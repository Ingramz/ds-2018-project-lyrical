Elton Britt & Rosalie Allen,"You're as hard to hold as quicksilver
When you kiss and run away
I dream you're mine and then as quick as quicksilver
All my dreams are led astray

I keep chasing you till I'm facing you
And embracing you with all your charms
Then you slip through my fingers just like quicksilver
Right into someone else's arms

Seems like I am havin' trouble with you
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
Seems like you're fickle, fickle as can be
And your fickle ways have got me up a tree

You're as hard to hold as quicksilver
When you kiss and run away
I dream you're mine and then as quick as quicksilver
All my dreams are led astray

I keep chasing you till I'm facing you
And embracing you with all your charms
Then you slip through my fingers just like quicksilver
Right into someone else's arms

Then you slip through my fingers just like quicksilver
Right into someone else's arms",Quicksilver,2004
Elton Dancer,"Your My Star, My Light, My whole entire life
Without you it's blurry and I can't see why
My friends say James are you feeling alright
And I just think that I'm dreaming all night
When I'm with you I feel I've been saved
And I wanna thank your mum and dad for what
They made so I just wanna say I'm gonna keep you
For life 24-7 I hope to

Hold ya closer and don't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please girl don't let go.

[Chorus]
Hold me Closer Tiny Dancer (Hold me Closer, Just hold me closer)
Count the headlights on the Highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen (Lay Me Down, Lay Me Down)
You had a busy day today

Your my perfect dream we're the perfect team
I'm the king, your the queen, your the book
That I read, without you it feels like there's no me
And that's why it's you that I just wanna keep
How many times have I told you that I love you
So many times you know I wanna hug you
So come and show me what love means
'Cause I don't really know I've just seen it in my dreams
I swear.

Hold ya closer and don't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please girl don't let go.

[Chorus]

It's crazy I don't think you recognize how strong my feelings are
So I dedicated this song to you listen.

Look I hope you recognize now what you really mean
Without you I couldn't do the songs I sing and I hope
You like it too 'cause it's nothing but the truth your not
Number 1 but you will be soon.

Hold ya closer and don't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please girl don't let go.

[Chorus: x2]

I hope your talking all the words man it's ironic",Tiny Dancer,2009
Elton G. Miranda,"One single drop of rain
Your salty tear became blue ocean
One tiny grain of sand turning in your hand
A world in motion

You're out beyond the furthest Morning Star
Close enough to hold me in Your arms
Adonai, I lift up my heart and I cry
My Adonai

You are the Maker of each moment
Father of my hope and freedom
Oh, my Adonai
One timid faithful knock

Resounds up the Rock of Ages
One trembling heart and soul
Becomes a servant bold and courageous
You call across the mountains and the seas

I answer from the deepest part of me
From age to age you reign in Majesty
And today You're making miracles in me",Adonai,2005
Elton John,"Blue eyes
Baby's got, blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue, blue day

Blue eyes
Baby's got, blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away and I say

Blue eyes holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got, blue eyes
And she's alone, again

Blue eyes
Baby's got, blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watchin' over me

Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be, I will see

Blue eyes laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got, blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again

Blue eyes laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got, blue eyes
And I am home again",Blue Eyes/I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues,
Elton John,"Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus 'cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spends his days counting
In a garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

Levon's sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leave Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing,
While Levon, Levon slowly dies

He was born a pauper
To a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times
Said God is dead and the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan, woo
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan, woo
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon",Levon,
Elton John,"Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double-barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues

Reality it seems, was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) you know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) oh don't you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away",All the Girls Love Alice,
Elton John,"Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the spectre he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed

Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes

Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there
What's his colour I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace",Border Song,
Elton John,"If your life is dull and dreary
And you're feeling rather weary
Of the mundane things that clutter up one's life
Drive your roller up to Bond Street

Where royalty and Sheiks meet
Make your day
Here's the thing to do
Spend a grand or two at Cartier",Cartier,
Elton John,"How come you're so understanding 
When I tell you all my lies
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end... Chloe

How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend
Chloe, Chloe

[Chorus]
Chloe, what you gonna do about me
Chloe, what you gonna do
What you gonna do about me

You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like giving in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe, Chloe

[Chorus]",Chloe,
Elton John,"Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time i look away
I find a hiding place

If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how i feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears

Just release me i can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb

It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back

Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time i look away
I find a hiding place",Easier to Walk Away,
Elton John,"Take a look at me now
And take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread
I'm in it for the gravy honey

Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly
Oh cause I'm, I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right 

I'll, I will amaze before the light
I crave the light mmm blinding white
I need the light tonight

Take a look at me now 
And take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra 
I'm in it for the killing

Inflate my ego gently 
Tell them heaven sent me
Oh 'cause I'm, I'm so expressive 
And I'm so obsessed 

With my ego, my ego 
And it's message oo inform the press
Invite the guests I need the press tonight

Do you remember acting out your youth
A romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite 
And how I'd blow my lines

And hide my face
Well maybe it was childish,  foolish 
Before schoolish, immaturish, lose your coolish
Well I had to grow and prove my ego

Take a look at me now
And take a taste of the money 
I'm not in it for the bread
I'm in it for the gravy honey 

Inflate my ego gently 
Go tell them heaven sent me

Elton John,"I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're bragging one is not enough
Something tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five

I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carving up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me let's call it quits

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want to go on with you like that
Don't want to be a feather in your cap
I just want to tell you honey I ain't mad
But I don't want to go on with you like that

It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's getting out of hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads faster in a breeze

[Chorus]

No I don't want to go on with you like that
One more set of boots on your welcome mat
You'll just have to quit them if you want me back
cause I don't want to go on with you like that

Oh if you want to spread it around sister that's just fine
But I don't want no second hand feeding me lines
If you want to hold someone in the middle of the night
Call out the guards, turn out the light",I Don't Wanna Go on With You Like That,
Elton John,"Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards

And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford

Like a child when his toys have been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel

And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded

Elton John,"If I wasn't born to love you, why was I born at all
If I wasn't meant to hold you, what are these two arms for
If I can't protect you, what are these muscles for
If I can't enrich your life, I might as well be poor
If I couldn't see you naked, I might as well be blind
If I couldn't treat you right, wouldn't I be so unkind

And you were made for me
You were made for me
You weren't born to be alone
And you were made for me

You were made for me
You were made for me
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
That you were made for me

If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to run
And if I can't draw warmth from you, why do I need this sun",Made for Me,
Elton John,"Looking back in anger
On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace

Somethings so young and pretty
Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast

And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right

I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves

Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms

There's a string of dangerous flowers
All around my bed
There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me dead",Suit of Wolves,
Elton John,"Rolling over trying to sleep
And understanding women
Thinking of you out there somewhere
Looking for a new beginning

Just let me be the final word
In the book we haven't written
I won't be another page
In understanding women

I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven

How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women

And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
Of understanding women",Understanding Women,
Elton John,"Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room, oh oh oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough oh to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room, oh oh oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much

Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say
Sad songs, they say so much

So, turn 'em on, (turn 'em on), turn 'em on, (turn 'em on)
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room, oh oh oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much
When all hope is gone
You know sad songs say so much

There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over

Well that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me who wears these shoes, darling

Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time

If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing darling who wears these shoes

I say that's fine but if I lose
I want to know who's in my foot steps
I want to know who wears these shoes

I see the facts but if it's true
I want to know who's in my footsteps

",All the Young Girls Love Alice,
Elton John,"Saturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear, clear and blue
But Saturday sun, it came without warning
So no one knew what to do

And Saturday sun brought people and places
That didn't see much in their day
And when I remember these people, these people and places
They were really, really too good in their way, in their way

And Saturday sun won't come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through, through your brain
Just think about, think about people
In their season, season and times
Just returning again and again

So Sunday sat in Saturday sun
And wait for a day gone by

",Saturday Sun,
Elton John,"Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Till there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

For some day our ocean
Will find its shore

Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
IF you know the way to blue

Look though time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind

Can you now recall all that you have known
Will you never fall when the light has flown
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue

",Way to Blue,
Elton John,"I'm not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings take me high above

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love

Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

Just send up my love ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone",Empty Sky,1969
Elton John,"She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother

And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection

And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street

For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea

The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after

And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand",Hymn 2000,1969
Elton John,"Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there

Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there

Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the woods
No we never will again

And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday

Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough

Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover",Lady What's Tomorrow,1969
Elton John,"I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China

Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she´d guessed the number
Of bales in the back room

While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colors
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails

Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I´m sure that it´s warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy´s sandwich",Sails,1969
Elton John,"In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip

Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand

Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun

Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window

The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn

In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer

In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip",The Scaffold,1969
Elton John,"The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs

Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they´re told
To bring their galleons

Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala

There´s long boats in the harbour
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers

And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor",Val-Hala,1969
Elton John,"It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands

And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
Than his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway

It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door

That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
Than his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway",Western Ford Gateway,1969
Elton John,"You know it, it is only true
That you could be the best of you
How I wonder miles away
Tying horseshoes by the bay

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Many say and lucky do
My own fire once said it too
Leave the ocean live and play
Door on sockets yesterday

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Is it fair or nestled sorrow
You could be there tomorrow

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Whooo

Whooo

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso",All the Way down to El Paso [Piano Demo][#][*],1970
Elton John,"Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved

Well I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died

But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life

Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then break all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy",The Cage,1970
Elton John,"I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more; now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school-girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

No more to roam on the snow hills of Hinton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run

For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please, don't be sad where 'ere you are

I am who I am
You are who you are
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman",First Episode at Hienton,1970
Elton John,"Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain 
And never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools 
That were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real

Elton John,"No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore

And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the king must die

Some men are better staying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose

And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in
Should I cry sanctuary

Elton John,"Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean

So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoestrings on Louise

Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry, get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swineherd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow

All those city women want to make us poor men
And this land's got the worse for the worrying
I got married at the early age of fourteen
And I've been worrying about the way you'll be loving them",No Shoe Strings on Louise,1970
Elton John,"If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well don't you try to stop me

Well that's my Rock-and-roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows

Well if she would only slow down for a short time

Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine

Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say

And all they say is you ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
I'm not the guy, or so it seems to fill my old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed

Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Elton John,"I pulled out my stage coach times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew

The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast

The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Ah ah ah
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Now everybody bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get

I know what they're saying son
There goes old man Joe again
Well I may be mad at that I've seen enough
To make a man go out his brains
Well do they know what it's like
To have a graveyard as a friend
'Cause that's where they are boy, all of them
Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again

Well it's time I moved off
But it's been great just listening to you
And I might even see you next time I'm passing through
You're right there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
So keep well, keep well old friend
And have another drink on me
Just ignore all the others you got your memories
You got your memories",Talking Old Soldiers,1970
Elton John,"I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing
Half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep

Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane they took the paddles
My arms they paralysed

So where to now St. Peter
If it's true I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now St. Peter
Show me which road I'm on

Which road I'm on
It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report

Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range

So where to now St. Peter
If it's true I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now St. Peter
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

Elton John,"Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps

But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down beneath the Southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands

I'll take my horse and I'll ride the northern plain
To wear the color of the greys and join the fight again
I'll not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun

[Chorus]
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans well that's just fine alright
Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring

Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travelers to go?

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light

Watch the ripples gently spreading
Tiny daughter of the Camargue

We were made for one another
In a time it takes to grow up
If only we were old enough
Then they might leave us both alone

So take my hand in your hand
Say it's great to be alive
No one's going to find us
No matter how they try
No one's going to find us
It's wonderful so wild beneath the sky

Sleeping in the open
See the shadows softly moving
Take a train towards the southlands
Our time was never better
We shall pass the sights of splendor
On the door of a new life
It had to happen soon I guess
Whether it is wrong or it is right

We learned to be so graceful
Watching wild horses running
And from those agile angels
We knew the tide was turning
For we watched as on the skyway
The herons circled slowly
While we mere mortals watched them fly
Our sleepless eyes grew heavy",Michelle's Song,1971
Elton John,"For our world, the circle turns again
Throughout the year we've seen the seasons change

What could I tell them
Would they criticize behind my back
Maybe I should let them

Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it in their eyes
Oh I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way they want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand

Is now a full-blooded city man

Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn

Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage, where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels 'til the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town

Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock-and-roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing 'til you've been

Elton John,"As I awoke this evening with the smell of wood smoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging upon a painted tepee
Oh I went to see my chieftain with my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said, I can't believe our warlord's dead
Oh he would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers guns

Oh great father of the Iroquois ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog whom white man fears

I take only what is mine Lord, my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die, along with my tribe's pride
I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run

Trampling down the prairie rose, leaving hoof tracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hands
I heard from passing renegades Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead

Now there seems no reason why I should carry on
In this land that once was my land I can't find a home
It's lonely and it's quiet and the horse soldiers are coming
And I think it's time I strung my bow and ceased my senseless running
For soon I'll find the yellow moon along with my loved ones
Where the buffaloes graze in clover fields without the sound of guns

And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior comes with a bullet hole",Indian Sunset,1971

While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down

Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the ways
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
That he can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Fly away, skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day

I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me from
This aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun

For just a Skyline Pigeon

Waiting for the day
That he can spread his wings
And fly away again

With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say

I have to write a letter
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees

So I'm sitting in the classroom
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Erroll Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggone thing

Oh I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good

Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof beats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight",Roy Rogers,1973
Elton John,"My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days

And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinner time and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

My landlady lives in a caravan
Well that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms

And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinner time and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease

And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well I just get high on tequila

Elton John,"Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied

Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon
Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind

If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel

And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere let's get there soon
Oh this song's got no title just words and a tune",This Song Has No Title,1973
Elton John,"I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
A heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down

I really got buzzed when your sister said
""Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you honey, where the scene's on fire""
And tonight I learned for certain that the blues expired

Oh your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Out bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist but she got more soul than me

Somebody help me 'cause the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away

I really got buzzed when your sister said
""Throw away them records `cause the blues is dead
Let me take you honey, where the scene's on fire""

Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then?
I bet that'll shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

Elton John,"Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees

My little boat - she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh, and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Plowing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Elton John,"As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn´t match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you´re fair
But there´s none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbour
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay",Grimsby,1974
Elton John,"Tune in, wouldn't it be something
Rumours spreading into panic

I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh don't forget me I'm so stranded

I wouldn't fool you but I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune

I've seen them I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go

Stars climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me mother earth

It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light",I've Seen the Saucers,1974
Elton John,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He's a pin ball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?'

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
'N' never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball.

I thought I was
The Bally table king.
But I just handed
My pin ball crown to him.

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall

Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!",Pinball Wizard [*],1974

But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent 
Upon your feather pillow

For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing
And her silence keeps us guessing

Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands

You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh, when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul

Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
I hibernate in English turf

Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burning vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave, honey
Tell me what you hound dogs think

Elton John,"""An extremely quiet child"" they called you in your school report
""He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught""
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died

At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
""Oh, he's unconcerned with competition he never cares to win""
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son

""Now you'll never get to Heaven"" Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said ""His brain's just snapped"" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground

Promising to hurt no one, providing they were still
A young man tried to make a break, with tear-filled eyes you killed
That gun butt felt so smooth and warm cradled in your palm
Oh your childhood cried out in your head ""they mean to do you harm""

""Don't ever ride on the devil's knee"" Mama said
Remember mama said
Ticking, ticking
""Pay your penance well, my child
Fear where angels tread""
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking

Within an hour the news had reached the media machine
A male Caucasian with a gun had gone berserk in Queens
The area had been sealed off, the kids sent home from school
Fourteen people lying dead in a bar they called the Kicking Mule

Oh they pleaded to your sanity for the sake of those inside
""Throw out your gun, walk out slow just keep your hands held high""
But they pumped you full of rifle shells as you stepped out the door
Oh you danced in death like a marionette on the vengeance of the law

""You've slept too long in silence"" Mama said
Remember Mama said

""Crazy boy, you'll only wind up with strange notions in your head""

And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked window of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks file in from the street

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side

Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
Can you help us

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins

And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
`Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working

For it's hay make and ""Hey mom, do the papers say anything good
Are there chances in life for little dirt cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods""

Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback
The honey, the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning

For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Mmm mmm couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down

From the end of the world to your town

If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man, yeah
Gave me a piece of mama, daddy never had

Some others choose the good old family home (some others choose a good old)

Elton John,"When I think of those east end lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima donna lord you really should have been there
Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor

And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye bye

I never realized the passing hours
Of evening showers
A slip noose hanging, in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it! listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank god my music's still alive

And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you dear
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away bye bye

And I would have walked head on into the deep end the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your h.p. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight, someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

Elton John,"There's a dusty old gutter, he's lying in now
Mmm he's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare, of undue concern
He said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember
Can I still shoot a fast cue
Has this country kid still got his soul

Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows

Take my money

Elton John,"Snow, cement and ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters
Tracking down the hours

But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl
With the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel

Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no no no

Junk, angel, this closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription
For a brand new heart attack

But where were all your shoulders when we cried
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel

With a piece between her breast

She put a pistol in her shoulder holster
She took her car up from Santa Fe
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes
Now she's hunting down a runaway
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor
You may be sorry when his light goes out
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster
You can never, never tell if the Law's about

If it seemed just like a movie
Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
And venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park

But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well, she quietly dumped her pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone",Shoulder Holster,1976
Elton John,"He died when the house was empty
When the maid had gone
He put a pen to paper for one final song
He wrote 
Oh babe, it's the only way
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living, to go on living, living life this way

And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're going to take the news
But if I had my life again
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd let nobody, I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes

Something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
I've gathered dust like the dying flowers
And I've drunk myself sober
After hours and hours

After hours and hours",Someone's Final Song,1976
Elton John,"She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind
She's sinful and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children
And she's been my lover

No, no, no, no, no, no she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten
You get excited
My mama she really likes her
She comes for coffee
And my mama asked me

So where's the Shoorah she sang
You know I hear it again my friend
Where's the Shoorah she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
'Cause she likes to sing about
Where's the Shoorah she sang
Over and over and over
Where's the Shoorah she sang",Where's the Shoorah?,1976
Elton John,"Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when its sinking
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a King

For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tealeaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind

And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed

Gone is a word that I now rarely use
Though sometime in the course of a day
I go racing back like a man possessed
By the wide-eyed and laughing daughters of some different age",The Wide Eyed and Laughing,1976
Elton John,"I was justified when I was five

Elton John,"I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of the night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore

But I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said thank you honey, forget about the money

Elton John,"Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more

Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper",Big Dipper,1978

Elton John,"When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still ain't quite enough

Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A.
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest

I sometimes feel that life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands

Elton John,"This house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason

Then someone shot through the tire swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season

And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's thought to survive

This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to rock and roll
But he has to tremble

For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathing",I Cry at Night [*],1978
Elton John,"I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need

Elton John,"It ain't gonna be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind

It ain't gonna be easy I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart

It ain't gonna be easy that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It ain't easy to put it back again

It ain't gonna be easy to forget
You've been seeing a man that I ain't met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart

It ain't gonna be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You gotta play your cards or fold a losing hand

And it ain't gonna be easy that's no lie

Elton John,"I've been blown away like a printed page
That reads, ""You're lovesick""
Headline news had me so abused
But I was lovesick

You never tried although I sacrificed
My weaknesses for you
I could have understood, I could have read your looks
I should have known better too

I've been holding out but it's time to shout
You know I'm lovesick
A helping hand for a dying man
Who says, ?He's lovesick?

Elton John,"The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold grey light
Someone sees a shadow run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done
They listen to the final countdown begun, three, two, one

Madness, it's a kind of madness
Tat turns good men bad
And we're helpless caught up in the madness
Of a world gone mad

The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear
A hopeless cry for help but no one is near enough to hear

As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives
They try to fight the flame but nothing survives of all those lives

And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain
And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart

And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul
Madness",Madness,1978
Elton John,"It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call

Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise

The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart

I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise again",Return to Paradise,1978

Oh you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far oh shooting star

It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might

Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers
After all this time
We've made the long and the lonely climb
And now we've reached the part

Elton John,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go Johnny go go go
Go go Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The People passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, how that little country boy could play

His mother told him, someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
And maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight

Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall

Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control 
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed

Elton John,"If you want my loving take me back
If you miss my touch little girl take me back
When the dreams you lean on are beginning to crack
Open up your heart little girl and take me back

If you want my loving then take me back
If you're on your own little girl take me back
When the nights grow longer turning blacker than black
Open up your heart little girl and take me back

Playing a part you're well prepared for, there you stand
With all I ever cared for in your hand
I'm waiting all the time
For some kind of sign from you
And I'll go on and on this way
Waiting for the day
When I will hear you say
You'll take me back

If you want my loving well take me back
If you're feeling down little girl
Then you'll take me back
When you look around you for the love that you lack
Open up your heart little girl
You got my heart little girl
Make a start little girl
And say you'll take me back
Take me back",Take Me Back,1980
Elton John,"Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line

But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried

Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world

Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold",Two Rooms at the End of the World,1980
Elton John,"Dust settles on a thin cloud
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
Staring at a line of white powder

High-priced madness pays the tab
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder

And she's a habit I can't handle
For a reason I can't say
I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say
White powder white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again

Shock waves to a tired brain
Sends that hungry lady to my door again
She's my shelter from the storm when I feel the rain
Entertaining white powder

I feel I'm dry docked and tongue tied
Heaven sends a stretcher for the kids to ride
I might just escape while the others might die
Riding on a high of white powder",White Lady White Powder,1980
Elton John,"Sitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand
Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdie's just arrived

Your fat and jolly friend draws near

Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying 'cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown

Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home
Yes it is

Elton John,"When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hill
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave

Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears

Are out of proportion and none of them right

Elton John,"Ever since I was a young boy, I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played them all
But I ain't seen nothing like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard, he's got such a supple wrist.
How do you think he does it? I don't know.
What makes him so good?

Well, he ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see lights-a-flashin',
He plays by a sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n never tilts at all.
That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now, I've always been the champ.
I know every trick, no freak's gonna beat my hand.

Pinball!  Let's play!
Pinball!  Let's play!

Even on my usual table, he can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.

That deaf, dumb, blind boy,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist.

Well everybody wants her
But no one ever gets her
Well the freeway is the only way she knows

When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
And senorita play guitar, play it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your great coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on

Yes I'll sit with you and talk let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same

Elton John,"Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway

For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind

Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day

I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun",Skyline Pigeon,1981
Elton John,"I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

If the boys all behave themselves here
Well, there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh, the prices I charge here will see you alright

So, she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game, oh

Forget us we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said

So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh, sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same

Elton John,"I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall, and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out

I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine

I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last

And your grace and style
Cut me to the bone
With your razor blade smile

And dark brown eyes
Always unprepared
For your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

If you only knew
What I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed
To say your name
It's hard to grin and bear
When you're standing there
My lips are dry
I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room
I've got it bad
Crying for the moon

But I would give my life
For a single night beside you",Elton's Song,1981
Elton John,"I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtle-esque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.
And all that political crap

Cause I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff?

If the boy had been blessed, he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue, you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through",Fascist Faces,1981
Elton John,"Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do
So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road

Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair

And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Cause I am the fox, like it or not
I'm always gonna be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox

It may sound crazy but it's often lonely
And the restless heart should be captured once in a while
Then you can use them, and you often fool them
Into believing whatever you desire

On their designated flights",The Fox,1981

But step out of line, boy, and I'll go for your throat

How come it gets so disturbing when two ships pass in the storm?
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born?

Me - I'd rather be on the heels of the wind",Heels of the Wind,1981
Elton John,"Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs

But the red lights where the catfights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium

Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance",Just Like Belgium,1981
Elton John,"They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

[Chorus]

We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise",All Quiet on the Western Front,1982

Elton John,"I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part

Oh, I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables 'round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

You'd better be ready to run now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete

Elton John,"See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet
(Long enough to hold on)

Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings

Oh, won't somebody tell me
Tell me, where have all the good times gone?
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone?

Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you
(Yeah, we had a good time)

Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past?
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you

They've gone away
Gone, they've gone away
Gone, they've gone away
They've gone away

It's hard enough to lose the game

I'll paint a masterpiece

Shine your love around me
You'll always be, the one for me
Say the world, and I'll be there
Loving you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so

We'll hear the music ring
From the mountain tops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world
With a lullaby
So the angels will know us
Angels will know us

Elton John,"I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm

Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night

No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
But the kids just watch the storm

I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war",Cry to Heaven,1982
Elton John,"I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again

Oh
Oh
Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote
Such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had

I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer

You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
Hmm, In the foreign field of death
""Oh, wouldn't it be wonderful?"" is all I heard you say

Instead you moved away

And I need you to turn to when I lose control

It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains

Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it

And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes

And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile

And trickled down the sleepy subway trains

For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meants she might wind up -

A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon the name's gone there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door

In neon, in neon...

Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into fashion that flashs above 'em in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon

She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
She'd smoulder like ashes if it meant she might wind up -

In neon...

[Chorus]",In Neon,1984
Elton John,"She looked so easy 'cause she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side

Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Look a little closer: that's acid rain

And I don't know
Why, Li'l frigerator, you're so cold
Go, Li'l frigerator, go
Get away from my soul
Li'l frigerator, you're so cold

She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive breath
She's an empty shell, you're a piece of meat
Just another statistic on her readout sheet",Li'l 'Frigerator,1984
Elton John,"Hey there, Georgie, got a couple of things to say
One, you're my friend; and two, it's hurting me
Seeing you act this way
But my hands are tied, and I can only try to talk you out of a fall
'Cause the reputation of the woman you're dating's
About as nasty as the Berlin Wall

Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
Man, you've got to watch yourself
She's gonna get in your head, she's gonna crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else

Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
She's just another divorcée
An undercover lover of a hundred
Other little fish in the sea

You better cut her loose before she gets her hooks in you
If you give her the world, and it was covered in pearls
She'd only ask for the moon
She's got you hypnotized with her big brown eyes
And a body that could stop a clock
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
Georgie boy, you're in for a shock

Well, it ain't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down, you'd do the same for me
It's always been that way
She's got you paralyzed with a pack of lies
About honor and the single girl
And if you buy that line, you must be out of your mind
You must be living in another world",Slow Down Georgie (She's Poison),1984
Elton John,"There's a fly in the window
A dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner
I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too

Well I can't help thinking
About the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me
Cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time
Feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days
We'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together
Without a wife in line
To pick the crop and get me hot
On elderberry wine

Round a tee in the summer
A fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round
Like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand

Well I can't help thinking
About the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me
Cooked black-eyed peas-me

And the cars you drive to buy your friends

This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away

And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her, I'll give you three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me

Oh, I fall apart
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

I fall apart, oh, I fall apart
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart

Oh, I fall apart
Oh, I get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time when I fall apart
With this threat of indecision hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely, oh, when the day grows dark

Elton John,"Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a forty five
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the after life

And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Play back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day

We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk, don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name

And idolize twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more riders",Leather Jackets,1986

To see if you still love me
Why conceal? You still feel
The need to push and shove me

Love will grow, it comes and goes
Emotions can deceive you
Well, this I vow, here and now
My love will never, never, never leave you

Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
More than just a memory of love

Take love for better, take love for worse

Elton John,"Nobody left in the airport lounge
They cleaned the ashtrays
TV's just wound down

I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through my flight

But when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas

The left bank is crying
For color to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber
When I get to Paris

You were the best
Of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth
Art has its price

It's so hard to hold on
To the ghost of your breed
It takes ambition
To call the colors you need

Oh, but when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas

The left bank is crying
For color to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber

Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that, do you?
The balance was uneven, but I'm breaking through

Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold

The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door, oh, that's all I ever got

You're a sinking ship with no place to go",Slow Rivers,1986

Elton John,"What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most of the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most of the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny

Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny

Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things can only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you

Rolling like thunder under the covers

Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man

And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend

What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon

Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me

Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company

It's like some drug for you

You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house

And it's no use each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe
Up on Blue Avenue

Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang Son of Heaven
And the groom just walked on air

I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man

And she walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said I do like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name

In the shadow of the holy
Oh I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Oh the preacher with his blessing
Pronounced them man and wife
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Make a promise to be kept for life",I Never Knew Her Name,1989
Elton John,"It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers

Hard done by you
Some things look better, baby

And the night drags on, and the fever burns
Come to your senses, everybody learns
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
You're an empty doll in the power of a fool

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back

But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you

When the leaves turn brown

And a big yellow sun in the winter

You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle

In a big round room on the edge of the moon
There's a shooting star
In a race for the final hurdle

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

And you can go dancing

No need to worry when you dance alone

I run out the front door into the center of the street
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet

I hear you after midnight from the inner city
As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

Well, this is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking

On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl, she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the park

This is my battleground, baby

Elton John,"They laid beneath the pine trees with their caps over their eyes
They were drunk with home and mama as they brushed away the flies
In an instant before the sunrise they had gunned the rebels down
As their flags were torn at half mast in the ruins of the town

There were white sails on the water for the crippled on the beach
There was a lack of ammunition so the cause was incomplete
When the bugle blew at breakfast and they knew their ships were in
Signs of grand assurance were carried on the wind

Take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

They just chalked it down in history but they kept their uniforms
They put their medals on the sideboards and they went back to their farms
For it was just a mere reminder that they stood beside the best
That God had saved the chosen few and the devil took the rest

So take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

On the planes above the rock face where the sculptured eagles swoop
There's a haunted yell for action among the specters of his troops
It was silent on the coastline as the crazy angels danced
With the sound of retreating footfall from his military camp

So take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks

Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

Turn them on, turn them on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on

They reach into your room
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much

If someone else is suffering enough to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
and it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife

If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died

But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

I only farmed in schools
That were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I

To be so wise

The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then

Fire flying from your hands

In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh

For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Oh, baby you're the one

Elton John,"There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways

Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows

And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train",Runaway Train,1992
Elton John,"There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're gonna get back to the simple life again


When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop",Simple Life,1992
Elton John,"No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season

She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason

Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke

Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out

She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found

Oh well the choice is hers

'Cause you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you

Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind

And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home",When a Woman Doesn't Want You,1992
Elton John,"Tonight it's hot down here
I can almost smell the rain
And I can almost taste the fear
Behind your name
Fans turning on the ceiling
I feel sticky as a chili dog
White boys howling in the evening
On that hollow log

Tall tales down the river
Say we aim to bury the truth
But the right hand just delivered
The devil in a suit

And he talks big in Whitewash County
Talks sweet as sugar cane
Got a past that's filled with lightning
Got a future filled with rain

Bug buzzing in an empty glass
Fiddle scratching some lazy tune
We're just some place that history passed
New dust, new broom
And it's a high hot buttered moon
He's got a shiny new wax face
Swears the South's gonna rise again soon

But you never change your mind",Whitewash County,1992

About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart

And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep

I'm not one of those who can easily hide

I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor but then again no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that oh
Keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
You see I've forgotten
If they're green or they're blue
Anyway New York, what we really mean

Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind

I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn

With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun

You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name 

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you 
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to

More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And blinking, step into the Sun
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen

Some say live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

To the humble common ground

I'm gonna be a noble king
Unscrupulously fair
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair

I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

The fauna and the flora gonna swing

No one saying stop that
No one saying see here
Free to run around all day
I'll be free to do it my way

My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
In them old cottonfields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home

Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town

Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home

Oh, let them cotton balls get rotten
I got you baby, who needs cotton

Well, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home

Every thought of you I want to shout aloud
Then I think about the love I have inside me
How you brought what's inside out

Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everthing I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down

And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real

Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall

On and on I've drifted with the tide
I didn't know that love could move me so
You fed my life with love and much more besides
And you showed me which way to go

Elton John,"When the money's gone, will you be my friend
Float a small row boat till the ship comes in
When the winter nights chill us to the soul
Will you feed the fire, spin the straw to gold
When the money's gone

When the money's gone, will you get cold feet
Will you still be there if the ends don't meet
Till we're in the red just forget the green
Take a bus with me, no more limousines
When the money's gone

Will you still want me
All it ever was
Will you still love me, will you want me

Oh what a fine life I give to you
All you ever want
Will you still be there
Will you pull me through when the cash don't come
And if you're mine
Will you still love me wherever we fall
When the money's gone

Oh will you want me baby
Oh will you need me baby
Oh will you love me baby
When the money's gone

When the money's gone, no more caviar
Will you eat fast food in a beat up car
Live life modestly, lost in lotto dreams
Will you find your way through it all with me
Through it all with me
Will you still love me
All it ever was
Will you still want me, will you want me

And a mile off the shore
Flies a bird who'll land no more
And as the tide pulls the sea
So you always will pull me forever more",When the Money's Gone,1995
Elton John,"Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rock and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom Heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try harder to recognize
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down,
Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver place,
Belfast.",Belfast,1995
Elton John,"Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed

I know you're still just a dream
your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed

And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky

Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed",Blessed,1995
Elton John,"You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance, I held my breath
Love always ends up hanging by a thread

Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you, and I'm cold, cold, cold

You said don't cry to me
He said I'm a dead man if you leave
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part

Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep",Cold,1995
Elton John,"This is my house
This is where I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe
This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me

This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul
Where is my tired heart
That is the question
Where is the answer
Inside my house

And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over again

'Cause this my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house
This is my bed
This is where I sleep

This is my house",House,1995
Elton John,"Grey London morning, wet London streets
Rain on the window, wind in the trees
It's my time to write, it's your time to call
There's something about distance that gets to us all

Dark clouds above me, little people below
All walk with a purpose with someplace to go
It's my place to paint my own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas, it's just the weather and me

And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold strech of black across blue
Latitude

Cracks in the sidewalks, dogs on the run
An old poster reading ""Give us your sons""
Window frames capture moments in time
But latitude captures the heart and the mind",Latitude,1995
Elton John,"I was made in England out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father, had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard and that black piano
Oh that sweet Georgia Peach and the boy from Tupelo

Oh, I was made in England
Oh, I was made in England

I was made in England out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground crying God send me a brother
Not a bloody nose for Rock and Roll
Give me that sweet Georgia Peach and the boy from Tupelo

Oh, I was made in England
Oh, I was made in England

I was made in England like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal, well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain and nothing to cling to

Oh, I was made in England
Oh, I was made in England

If you're made in England, you're built to last
You can still say 'homo' and everybody laughs
But the joke's on you, you never read the song

Elton John,"Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up but wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat

Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

Shakespeare's a men, got all the lines
Modern man lives the back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel of hands
Runs with the wolf, he sleeps with the lamb
Man falls and cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief

Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

He's the hoax behind the thrill
The poison arrow, the bitter pill
Hard to swallow, hard to kill, hard to understand
He's the light behind the hill
The broken promise, the iron will
Hard to kill, hard to understand

Oh I'm a man, I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

I'm a man, I'm a man I know what it feels like
I'm a man, working on the living part of life
You see through me, I understand
But don't lose hope if you can
Have a little faith in man

Where do you live, I live anyplace
Where were you born, in the state of fear
How old are you, nineteen hundred and ninety four years

When will you leave, I'll never go away
How will you breathe, you'll give me life
How will you see, sitting in the temple right between your eyes

My name is Pain, you belong to me
You're all I wanted, I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning in a world without end
I am the air, I am Pain

Elton John,"We've been crippled in love, short changed, hung out to dry 
We've chalked on the walls a slogan or two about life 
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns 
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down 

So please, please, let me grow old with you 
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove 
so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you 

We've been living with sorrow, been up, down and all around 
We've buried our feelings a little too deep in the ground 
Stood dazed in the doorway, the king and queen of clowns 
We've been flipped like a coin, both of us landing face-down 

So please, please, let me grow old with you 
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove 
so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you 

But tied to the same track, the two of us look back 
At oncoming trains ahead 
How many more times can we lay on the line 
Watching our love hang by a thread

So please, please, let me grow old with you 
After everything we've been through, what's left to prove 
so please, please, please, oh please let me grow old with you
Please, please, oh please let me grow old with you",Please,1995
Elton John,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile

I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key

Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us

Here I stand

If you want a boxer

The moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep

But a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please
I'm your man

And if you gotta sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if yo want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you

To the rush of day
When the heat of the rolling wave
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)

Elton John,"Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch

A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded must be displayed

Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here

His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

In those silent happy seconds
That surround the sound of this event
A parent smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend

And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother",The Greatest Discovery,1996

I gave you earth and sky
And everything in between

No Easter mornings
It's your cross now
Keep it all for yourself
It's overrated anyhow

Elton John,"Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned our long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will",Candle in the Wind 1997,1997

We say we care, we need, we feel

The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die

And so they say, the end will come for us
And so the world, slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must
But I don't believe, I don't believe that the end will come for us
No I won't believe the end will come for us

After all these rough seas
Left me reckless and abandoned

Give me peace and understanding

And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder
Will she still be the star to see me through
'Cause I can't steer my heart clear of you

No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view
And should I drift away, the compass holds the clue
You control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you

Elton John,"Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine

Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed

Should have had a talk with god
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in heaven all alone

And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares

Must have kissed you 'till I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the morning light

Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard",January,1997
Elton John,"I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out of the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues

And his promise made was never clear
It just carve itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my hand
On the night he said to me

Someday
We'll live like horses
Free rein
From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one
To regain your senses
Break out the stalls
And we'll live like horses

We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the tribe
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of the wagon train
On the road to the golden gate
On the flat dry dessert I jumped ship
It just made sense to me
I've spent too long in the belly of the beast
And now I shall be free

Someday

From you old iron fences
There's more ways than one

To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall

No escape, no change of heart, nor any place to hide

Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer

Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods""

For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning

As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there

Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more

Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

And I've been knocking
But no one answers
And I've been knocking
Most all the day

Oh, and I've been calling
Oh, hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger if only he could hear

Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop

Now we pray for rain and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking
But no one answers

Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze

Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze

The trail we blaze
Is a road uncharted
Through terra incognita to a golden shrine
No place for the traveler
To be faint-hearted
We are part of the sumptuous grand design

Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze on the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze
On the trail we blaze",The Trail We Blaze,2000
Elton John,"Looking back it makes me shiver
Don't be scared to kick the past
Selling lovers down the river
Nothing built for speed will last overnight

All those years of desolation
Pretty boys and damage done
Not the way to find salvation
Looking after number one

Trust me
Try rolling with the flow
Trust me
I've been there don't you know
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, you're naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me

Too many years your heart has wandered
Scared to make a final move
Too many nights those boys have squandered
You got nothing left to prove

I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, butt naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me
Trust me",Trust Me,2000
Elton John,"The more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassioned me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid",Without Question,2000
Elton John,"To be young, gifted and black,
Oh what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black,
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There are billion boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black,
And that's a fact!

Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun

When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

Young, gifted and black
How I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth

Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's at",To Be Young Gifted and Black,2001
Elton John,"Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
Was it something I done
Something that she heard?

My baby left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

Now I stand at my window
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman
Hate to say goodbye

You know she left me
Yes, she left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

Baby, one of these mornings
Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and
Baby, and daddy he'll be gone

You know you left me

Elton John,"You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free

I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky

Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you 
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

Can't always agree on all my dumb ideas
I'm still looking for a way out of here
You can value what you want
But you pay for change
There's full moons, cold lifeless nights
And tumbled stars spell out your name

Close your eyes, take a ride
Think of every time that you
missed your opp
click your heels, see how it feels
Something so childish 
Sometimes seems so real",The North Star,2001

Elton John,"Time has gone by
The calendar leaves ___
I might try phoning
If I could think of the words to try

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

She left in the morning
_____ was her way
And on returning
I find I have nothing to say

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
No, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

Elton John,"Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt

Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent",American Triangle,2001
Elton John,"I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight

Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen",Ballad of the Boy in the Red Shoes,2001
Elton John,"ThereÂ´s some things I donÂ´t have now
Some things I donÂ´t talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

ThereÂ´s consequences IÂ´m scared to taste
Cold hard truths I canÂ´t face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look thereÂ´s something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
DonÂ´t answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
DonÂ´t fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
CanÂ´t explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
DonÂ´t answer the question of what I am to you",Birds,2001
Elton John,"Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love",Dark Diamond,2001
Elton John,"We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching

NightlifeÂ´s a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperorÂ´s new clothes

And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like PinocchioÂ´s nose
As we walked around in the emperorÂ´s new clothes

We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck weÂ´d been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly

We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperorÂ´s new clothes",The Emperor's New Clothes,2001
Elton John,"I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man I've seen so much traffic

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough

A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

Elton John,"I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower

Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road

The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma

Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me

It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust

When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain","Look Ma, No Hands",2001
Elton John,"You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me

You can charm her
Calm her when sheÂ´s wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me

So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me

You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
SheÂ´s the love of your life
And no, youÂ´ll never, never love her like me

You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places IÂ´ve been
But youÂ´ll never, never love her like me",Love Her Like Me,2001
Elton John,"It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got

Just you and me at a crossroads then
Ain't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end

And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight'

In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone

In the candlelight I can recall
Your naked shadow looking ten feet tall
Like a wild pony dancing
Along the wall
Off balance I found love the only place to fall",Mansfield,2001
Elton John,"Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof

Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place

I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside

Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin,
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin

A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life

Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand",Original Sin,2001
Elton John,"You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the Storyline, furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried-up and sick to death of love
If you really need to know it
I never really understood that stuff

All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em as they say and weep

The granite cracks beneath my skin
I crumble into pieces on the ground

The things I've done, the places that I've been

Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind

I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved

Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)

And the red sun sinks
At last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce thinkin' of bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger; my heart goes to 'em
AIDS tested, it was stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all commend, like Malcolm X and Bobby Hut died for nothin'
Thought'll make you get teary, the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks
At last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sounds of guns

Tell me do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin' outta bags, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady
Crack got her crazy, yet she's givin' birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From outta the frying pan we jumpin' to another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I say go, stay in control, drink out my own bottles
I made mistakes but learned from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy?
Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)

A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beating for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say the more my work gets done

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee high to a man, yeah
Gave me a piece of mama, daddy never had

Oh Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love you
Shine the light, through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom, I love-ve-ve you, yes I do

If you choose to you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city (some people the city)
Some others choose the good old family home (some others choose a good old...)
I like living easy without family ties (living easy)
Till the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom

I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 
If I was a sculptor but then again no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
Oh I know it's not much but it's the best I can do 

My gift is my song 
And this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 

How wonderful life is while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind 
While I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that 
Keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting 

But these things I do 
You see I've forgotten 
If they're green or they're blue 
Anyway the thing is what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 
And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but 
Now that it's done

There's a woman waking up
Like sunlight spreads across the world
A smile for us is just enough
But in the heart of every girl
There's a homespun family dream
A light that's filled with so much joy
From a curly-head beauty to a teenage queen

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl.

In the heart of every girl
There's always room for Valentines
And boys to kneel and tip their hands
With words as sweet as summer wine
And in the heart of every girl
There is a rose for every spring
A peach that's fragrant and divine
She shines just like a wedding ring.

And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives

Eyes can light up any room
The moment she steps in
Intoxicating everyone
A life alone should be a sin.

And honeymoons in summer prove

Catch a star if you can
Wish for something special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listening
One melody, you're all for me

I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you, I'll paint a masterpiece
Just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready, are you ready for love

You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me

Say the word and I'll be there
Loving you forever
Don't let me go
Just say it's so

To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world

If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope in sight
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold onto something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

And every day's a prize

One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around

And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks

Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight

When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks

Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

That I don't recall

The lemons and weeds

Dear Slim, I wrote you but still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm a call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you you would write back
See I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up, you gotta call me man
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

Dear Mister ""I'm Too Good To Call Or Write My Fans""
This will be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka
You dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who could a saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you could a rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must of missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit will make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was, it was you

Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground.

And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.

Transmit all they know.

From Soho down to Brighton I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him, In any amusement hall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, Sure plays a mean pinball.
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean.
He plays by intuition, The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, Sure plays a mean pinball.
He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.
'How do you think he does it? I don't know.
What makes him so good?'
He ain't got no distractions, Can't hear no buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay, 'n' never tilts at all.
That deaf dumb and blind kid, Sure plays a mean pinball.
I thought I was the Bally table king.
But I just handed my pin ball crown to him.
Even my usual table, He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall.

This used to be the life but I don't need another one
Good luck cuttin' nothin', carrying on, you wear them gown
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down?

So I play along when I hear that special song

Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Rather be home with no one when I can't get down with you

Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile.
You got so many colours make a blind man so confused
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose?

So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine.
Just please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine

Elton John,"The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town

Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish that I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus:]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down",And the House Fell Down,2006
Elton John,"He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The how's and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives

She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl ain't that enough
To rage against the day

[Chorus:]
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the Sun King that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons I never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away

[Chorus]

And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh

Elton John,"I've seen the bridge, and the bridge is long
And they built it high, and they built it strong
Strong enough to hold the weight of time
Long enough to leave some of us behind

[Chorus]
And every one of us has to face that day
Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away?
And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away

Standing on the bridge, looking at the waves
Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide

And the bridge - it shines
Oh, cold hard iron
Saying come and risk it all
Or die trying

Elton John,"I've been out on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showing my friends around
I've seen it growing from next to nothing
Into a giant eating up your town

Called up the tealeaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands
She saw a mountain and a wild deer running
A crazy kid becoming a better man

But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waiting to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasing the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine silk Suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

[Chorus:]
And you can't go back and if you try it fails
Looking up ahead I see a rusty nail
A sign hanging from it saying ""Truth for sale""
And that's what we did
No lies at all just one more tale
About the Captain and the Kid

We've been missing at times in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes

Oh we've conjured up what we created
Way back then when I was standing up in six-inch heels
Now you're riding off into the sunset
And I'm still spinning like a Catherine wheel

But we stuck around for the battle
Waiting for a plan
To turn you into the Brown Dirt Cowboy
And me into a Rocket Man
It pleases the people some of the time
Digging into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

[Chorus x2]",The Captain and the Kid,2006
Elton John,"I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure

[Chorus:]
From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess I must have lost it on the wind

Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst

[Chorus x2]

In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time
You couldn't tell me I was wrong, you couldn't tell me anything
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind 
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind",I Must Have Lost It on the Wind,2006
Elton John,"It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and busing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yeah just like Noah's ark

Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yeah it's just like Noah's ark

[Chorus:]
And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark

These four walls have seen
The Cockettes and the Casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark

And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page

A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights

Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on Oxford Street
Now we're sitting in the South of France

Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you

Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee Williams play

Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall

Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside

Elton John,"We heard Richard Nixon say, welcome to the USA
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We've fallen in and I can't pull back
And I guess we'll have to stay

Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We're finally on our way

[Chorus:]
And Richard Nixon's on his knees he's sent so many overseas
He'd like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two, pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say ""welcome to the USA""

Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were where it's at
Or so the papers say

And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we'd never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson's promised land
Where Disney's God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay

In a bright red Porsche on Sunset I saw Steve McQueen
I guess he's just about the coolest guy I've ever seen
And for you and me that speeding car is how it's going to be

Kept the needle out of the red balloon

Shows the price of fame leads to overkill

Long black cars standing side-by-side

And the man on the door down at 54's

Elton John,"Nostradamus said I predict
That the world will end at half past six
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio?
Was he listening to the government?

Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sails
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June

The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are gonna have to change
Some holes along the road get filled

We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox

Pressure's gonna cook us if we don't unlock it
Guns going off if we don't uncock it
We've gotta climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're gonna burn, out on this beautiful rocket

Elton John,"Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je caressais le temps
J'ai joué de la vie
Comme on joue de l'amour et je vivais la nuit
Sans compter sur mes jours qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets qui sont restés en l'air
J'ai fondé tant d'espoirs qui se sont envolés
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant où aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le cœur mis en terre

Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je gaspillais le temps
En croyant l'arrêter
Et pour le retenir, même le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir et me suis essoufflé
Ignorant le passé, conjuguant au futur
Je précédais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde avec désinvolture
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans mais j'ai perdu mon temps
À faire des folies
Qui me laissent au fond rien de vraiment précis
Que quelques rides au front et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai gâché ma vie et mes jeunes années
Du meilleur et do pire en jetant le meilleur
J'ai figé mes sourires et j'ai glacé mes pleurs
Où sont-ils à présent?
À présent
Mes vingt ans",Hier Encore,2008
Elton John,"Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young",Yesterday When I Was Young,2008
Elton John,"Well your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph
There's a pale moonshine, above you
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around

Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph
Are the rumors eating you alive, Joseph

When the holy night is upon you
Will you do what's right, the position is yours

From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a child
When she took her stand
Did she hold your hand
Will your faith stand still or run away
Run away

When they've driven you so far
That you think you're gonna drop
Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop

With the plane and the lathe
The work never drove you mad
You're a maker, a creator
Not just somebody's dad

From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a man
When I take the stand
When I take the stand
Will he hold my hand
Will my faith stand still or run away

(Run away)

And the desert
It's a hell of a place to find heaven
Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God
And you climb to the top of the mountain
Looking down on the city
Where you were born

(On the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect)

Better you than me (better you than me)

Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use

And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing, you just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did

And I want to thank your Mum and Dad for what they made.
So I just want to say I'm going to keep you,
For life, 24/7 I hope to.

I need to know how you feel too,

You're my perfect dream, we're the perfect team,
I'm the King, you're the Queen, you're the book that I read,
Without you it feels like there's no me,
And that's why its you that I just want to keep,
How many times have I told you that I love you?
So many times you know I want to hug you,
So come and show me what love means,
Coz I don't really know I just seen it in my dreams

I swear hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,

It's crazy, I don't think you recognize how strong the feelings are,
So I dedicated this song to you.

Look I hope you recognize now what you really mean,
Without you I couldn't do this song I sing
And I hope you like it too, coz it's nothing but the truth
Your not number 1 but you will be soon

Believe hold you closer and don't let go,
I need to know how you feel too,
So hold me closer and don't let go,

Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
But he's a fool and he's a thief

Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day

There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night
Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green

The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page

Gone to Shiloh
Hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly

They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

Side by side
Gone to Shiloh

There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
You pray a great white whale might come your way

No freeway traffic in the frozen North
Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down
And a sign on the wall says, ""Hope Allowed""

All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

Cursing a wandering star

This cage round my heart
Locked up what I meant to say
What I felt all along the way
Just wondering how come
I couldn't take your breath away

'Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
And I should have sent roses
When you crossed my mind
For no other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should have sent roses

If fate should decide
I could do it all over again
I'd build no more walls
I'd stay true and recall
The fragrance of you on the wind

You'll get better than me
Someone who can see
Right from the start give it all that you need
And I'll slip away
Knowing I'm half the man I should be

'Cause I never sent roses
I never did enough
I didn't know how to love you
Though I loved you so much
And I should have sent roses
When you crossed my mind
For no other reason
Than the fact you were mine
I should have sent roses

I could have died
I could have given up
And not tried
To make it to tomorrow

Like a brokenhearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken

It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor

Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses
And they knew all the places
I needed to go

All of the people
I needed to know
They knew who I needed
And who needed me
And who would come help me

And who would just let me be
I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say

Life is oh so sweet
And you feel the love
Down deep inside
Even out there on the street

In the hands of angels",In the Hands of Angels,2010
Elton John,"I'm looking at a funeral wagon rolling down
A two-lane highway winding past a desert town
A big blue canvas painted by the Master's hand
The shifting clouds above and endless miles of sand

In that mirror maybe that's what's left of me
Wheezing like a freight train hauling sixty tons of steel
Air 'em out's the best release and get some rest
Carrie don't wait up for me the brakeman's going West

[Chorus]
In this room all alone
I dream of you
In this drawer I found someone
I never knew

Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian
I've seen dusty beaten delta boys cutting heads
A black face carny showman scare a song to death

In my short life I've seen as much as most men need
Now I'm just looking for some cleaner air to breathe

And hunger's empty hand

You think that you might find
In a bullet-riddled stolen car
On a back road in the pines

Or a tired old man of war
Or hidden like that Burma Star
In my dad's bottom drawer

Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit

Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill
You never drew a decent breath
But you're just dressed to kill

Look at you in your monkey suit

I've seen everything I give
Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with

There's just something about you. Haven't we met before?
We've been in love forever.
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning.

I just let you walk away. I've never forgiven myself.
I saw you on the steps in Paris, you were with someone else.
Couldn't you see that should've been me? I just walked on by.
Then we met in '42 but we were on different sides.

I hid you under my bed but they took you away.
I lost you in a London smog as you crossed the lane.
I never know where you're gonna be next but I know that you'll surprise me.
Come with me, I'll find some rope and I'll tie us together.

I've been waiting for you so long, I don't want to lose you again.
Don't walk into the crowd again. Don't walk away again.
I don't want to lose you.
I don't want to lose you.

I don't want to lose you again.
There's just something about you.
Have we been in love forever?
9.11 in New York, I took your photograph.

I still have your smiling face
In a heart-shaped frame.
Snowed in at Wheeler street, just two old flames keeping the fire going.
We look so good together.

Can't we just stay there forever? We were so happy.
I'd live that day over and over but the world won't stop turning.
When we got to the top of the hill we saw Rome burning.

Elton John,"In a bar in Toledo across from the depot
On a barstool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer so I walked on over
I sat down and asked her, her name

When the drinks finally hit her she said, ""I'm no quitter""
But I finally quit livin' on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter and here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings

In the mirror I saw him and I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face

Now his big hands were calloused, he looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought, I was dead
But he started shakin' his big heart was breakin'
And he turned to the woman and said

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and crops in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
But this time the hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

After he left us I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
And from the lights of the barroom to the rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all

Now she was a beauty but when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
'Cause I couldn't hold her the words that he told her
Kept comin' back time after time

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and crops in the field
And I've had some bad times, I lived through some sad times
But this time the hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

""You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children and crops in the field
I've had some bad times, lived through some sad times
This time the hurtin' won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille""

Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers in the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown

And it's getting very hard to stay
Well we're waiting here in Allentown

For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real

And chromium steel
And we're waiting here in Allentown

And the union people crawled away
Every child has a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got
But something happened on the way to that place

In your fine Park Avenue clothes

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from the heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are",Just the Way You Are,2011
Elton John,"Got a call from an old friend we'd used to be real close
Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house, bought a ticket to the west coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore this is my life
Go ahead with your own life leave me alone

I never said you had to offer me a second chance
I never said I was a victim of circumstance
I still belong
Don't get me wrong
And you can speak your mind
But not on my time

They will tell you you can't sleep alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you can't sleep with somebody else
Ah but sooner or later you sleep in your own space
Either way it's O.K. you wake up with yourself

I don't need you to worry for me 'cause I'm alright
I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home

Elton John,"It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
The regular crowd shuffles in
There's an old man sitting next to me
Makin' love to his tonic and gin

He says, ""son, can you play me a memory?
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
When I wore a younger man's clothes""

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright

Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

And the waitress is practicing politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
But it's better than drinkin' alone

Sing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you got us feeling alright

It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see
To forget about life for a while
And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
And the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
And say, ""man, what are you doin' here?""

Oh, la la la, di da da

Elton John,"In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
From the mountains of faith
To a river so deep

I must be looking for something
Something sacred I lost
But the river is wide
And it's too hard to cross

And even though I know the river is wide
I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
And try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the valley of fear
To a river so deep

And I've been searching for something
Taken out of my soul
Something I would never lose
Something somebody stole

I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't want to walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is that I've been looking for

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt
To a river so deep

I know I'm searching for something
Something so undefined
That it can only be seen
By the eyes of the blind

In the middle of the night

I'm not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
Baptized by the fire, I wade into the river
That runs to the promised land

In the middle of the night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the desert of truth
To the river so deep

We all end in the ocean
We all start in the streams
We're all carried along
By the river of dreams

In the middle of the night",The River of Dreams,2011
Elton John,"Well, we all have a face that we hide away forever 
And we take them out and show ourselves when everyone has gone
Some are satin, some are steel
Some are silk and some are leather
They're the faces of a stranger
But we'd love to try them on 

Well, we all fall in love
But we disregard the danger
Though we share so many secrets
There are some we never tell
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger? 
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself? 

Don't be afraid to try again
Everyone goes south every now and then
You've done it
Why can't someone else? 
You should know by now
You've been there yourself

Once I used to believe I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman that I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger kick me right between the eyes

Well, we all fall in love 
But we disregard the danger 
Though we share so many secrets 
There are some we never tell 
Why were you so surprised that you never saw the stranger 
Did you ever let your lover see the stranger in yourself.

But he isn't always evil and he is not always wrong
Though you drown in good intentions 
You will never quench the fire 
You'll give in to your desire when the stranger comes along",The Stranger,2011
Elton John,"Friday night I crashed your party
Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting any one
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
Turn out the light 
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said take me as I am
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while

Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall,
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

('How do you think he does it?)
I don't know!
(What makes him so good?')

Well, he ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
And never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He can't beat me now
I've always been the champ
I know every trick
No freak's gonna beat my hand

Even on my usual table,
He can beat the best.
His disciples lead him in,
And he just does the rest.

He's got crazy flipper fingers,
I never seen him fall,
That deaf, dumb, blind kid,
Sure plays a mean pinball.

He's a pinball wizard,
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard,
Got such a supple wrist.

He's a pinball wizard,
His score's a trillion more.
A pinball wizard,
The world's new pinball lord.
He's scoring more!
He's scoring more!
More more more more!

But I just handed my pinball crown to him.

Elton John,"The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

_____ on the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom

You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love",Candlelit Bedroom [*],2013

Too much war, too little love

Shaking with a fever

Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

Out on a limb fragile and adored

Those dizzy heights
And the view, from the diving board

Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board.

Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eyes
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles

See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight

Yea, yea, yea",Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight),2013
Elton John,"I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload

So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand

I'm going down
You and me together going down
It's not what I'd been told about this town
That when you least expect if you can drown
In quicksand

Elton John,"Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn

Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal? Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light

Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through

Elton John,"I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide

Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion

Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away

Oceans away, where the green grass sways
And the cool wind blows
Across the shadow of their graves.
Shoulder to shoulder back in the day
Sleeping bones to rest in earth, oceans away, oceans away

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let 'em shine

They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay

Elton John,"Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed, you never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France

Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down

And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all

A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner

And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome

Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons

And looking back at the hardened lifers
Looking back on the wretched poor
Thinking maybe they were my saviors
Strange to think I'll miss them all
Strange to think I'll miss them all

And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone wall
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all",Oscar Wilde Gets Out,2013
Elton John,"Spare the rod, don't spare the fool
If you take the breaks you're given
You get to make the rules
Take a chance and make it fast
If you break some bones on landing
You know you're built to last

Fight the tide and find the shore
If the gift horse isn't smiling
Just learn to ride some more
Common sense is a rule of thumb
If the suckers throw a red flag
Blow 'em all to Kingdom Come

And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring
Purify the stream

Search out days, that never end
If it's only for the chance to feel
Just like a child again
Tell a lie that speaks the truth
If the heart becomes a prisoner
Your soul will turn you loose

And take this dirty water
Running like a river
In and out of everything
We helped to put together
Take this dirty water
Help to keep it clean
Get back to the wellspring

Elton John,"Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said I'm gonna keep this good luck piece
Of iron inside my truck
The boy just whispered OK
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog

Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
Gone to California
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

Gonna set things right and set up a house

Elton John,"I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse

I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new

And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart

I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout

I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war

And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

A radio humming in every car, and it feels like the clocks have stopped

Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget what a wonderful crazy night that was

Some things you don't forget, some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that takes you back, won't let you go
Someday if you're asking all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was, yeah

Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Hearts on fire just one last time, a wishbone snapping in every hand

Someday if you're asking all about the key to love

Elton John,"Had some good times jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door

Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by

To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America (England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

All my sweet sins stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
I'm rolling over and over

Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seemed
Her happiness she lost
A broken tight-knit bond
Abandoning her trust
And now daddy's not around

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on

When she turns sweet sixteen
Her boyfriend called her his queen
A stimulating kiss, that felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another caress
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on (keep on comin')
Oh, girl, you're the queen
If you just believe
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on (you still carry on)

She became a happy wife
Whose husband called her queen
And she believed her life
Was perfect as can be
And when a surprise divorce came down
She rebounded and achieved
The mirror now reveals
What she can finally see

And leave far away""

Pouring out the blood
To the ground of tarvos' death
And out of nothing

Under a newborn sun nature rejoiced

""To find your journey through the dark
You'll have to travel on a field of green""

Through time dark landscapes leave their place to grasslands of joy
Bestowed to ancient oak woods here I ...

[Bridge2:]
... stand astonished by green, light of power covers me
To understand the nature of man I have now to speak with the trees.

In my life I always prayed the ancients acting with pure honesty
This is time to face the truth so here I go

Running through the woods I question every plant and every tree
Searching for the answer that was promised to me
Then the full moon comes out and the wind whispers in my ear :
""Ask for White Willow near the Silver Lake""...

[Chorus:]
-The fire in my heart was burning like the flames of ancient times
White Willow with his knowledge opened up my eyes
-The vision of the world I had before was based on thousand lies
White Willow taught me how to live my life with truth

And there it stands the only White Willow tree
He embraced me and he told me to gaze at the stars!

The wise old tree twice spoke to me and he said :
""Bring truth to the ones that you trust
And make them believe that I still exist""
So he closed his eyes and I traveled back home

Back to my world, home I return :
And the birds cry out ""The old king has died""
With tears in my eyes I follow my heritage :
Now I am to be new Elvenking!

[Chorus2:]
-Green power light was flowing down my eyes like

waters from the falls
White Willow filled my heart with lore I now recall (lore I now recall!)
-The black horizons once I saw now turn to white as I pass by
And now I know why man can't bear to know the nature of the truth

[End:]
[Narrator:] and there it stands, the only white willow tree
With golden leaves and a sweet old voice
He embraced me, hard as rock
And he told me, gaze at the stars

In the light I still see, the only willow tree
I'm living on, the dream he shared with me
Sometimes I can still see, the good old speaking tree
His voice like ambrosia's flowing deep in me




",White Willow,2002
Elvenking,"[Music: Jarpen, Aydan / Lyrics: Jarpen]

At dawn the ships arrived, they sailed
Through seas and foreign skies
To bring another age in lands
That needed no constraints
By the sign of the fire,
All pagan gods were bleeding
To dispossess thousands years
Of wisdom and beliefs, oh

Think for a moment, fall astray
First step on sand, meant the last
Of their old life
(""now it's done, all is gone""), so pure,
With dignity all was carried on
""What's this fighting for?""

""Disappearing sands, familiar voices
Everytime I stare at the night inside us
All the places I cherish darken
Past memories are the only
True consolation
For what my eyes are forced to see""

The tears in her eyes were like rain
Come from the gloomiest cloud
Pushed back from their own homes,
The germ of hate seized the heart
In a clear warm spring day,
His spirit left the body
Alone she stood while the ravens
Flew away from ruins, oh

""Far till sky unites with earth I'll hide you
They cannot dig what's inside of us
Far till sky unites with earth I'll hide you
They cannot dig what's inside of us""

""My life for you, despair on us,
Despair on us""

[Solos: Jarpen / Aydan]

Think for a moment, fall astray
First step on sand, meant the last

Everytime I stare at the night inside us

",Disappearing Sands,2004
Elvenking,"[Music: Jarpen, Aydan / Lyrics: Jarpen]

Follow again one single piece
Of dream afar
Spent my all whole life there,
Chasing the hope

A drive so strong,
So deep I cannot see the end
Inborn sense of finding
What's beyond, in the furious storm

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

Watch my gold,
It can be never bought or sold
Made up and collected through the years
From emotions and dreams

A noble line I carry on
Exploring the ways I never saw

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind

[Solo: Aydan]
[Melody: Jarpen / Regality: both]

Reunifying with air and soil I am part of
Distant yet so close!

Longing for a whisper
That would carry me away
Faced my ultimate desire that was swirling
Through the mazes of my mind
If you were given chance to fly would you
Retain your tears of joy
Pushed as far as any wind will go,
A fiery stride to the sun

Clearing my path from anything
That leads me to a fall
On the brink of loneliness, I faced
The illusion of leaving from the flock
On this one way trail to unfolding new
Worlds





",A Fiery Stride,2004
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]

I was told by my Grandma'
Many years ago, I was just a child
""Boy, go and grow as an honest man
Look on what you've done with pride!""

The years have passed I'm a normal lad
I won't be named in school treatises
But looking back on what I've done
Yes, there's a glimpse of pride!

The losers' ball - Dance with me
To the sound of the fiddle
For the ones who fall - Like a cloudless
Sky reflected in a billow
Learn a new step for each new Babylon
(build the city of lies and despair)

If you have time send a message
To every form of human life
""Hey out there if someone listens
This way we won't survive!""

We'll be drawn in arrogance
Hanged by the noose of greed
A new religion of violence
A bible of bad deeds

The losers' ball - Dance with me
To the sound of the fiddle
For the ones who fall - Like a cloudless
Sky reflected in a billow
Learn a new step for each new Babylon
(build the city of lies-lust-despair)

Elvenking,"[Music:Aydan, Damnagoras / Lyrics: Aydan]

I built a cradle for the Moon
And from her chariot (she) grants my
Boon - I'll keep my promises, I'm sure
She won't betray me

I'm bathed in her pale lightfall
Perceiving like a distant call
She whispers in my ears
Riddles I don't understand

Enchanted by thy serene glow
Oh, silent Lady let me know
Of arcane doctrines and secrets
To be not revealed

You doodle Night with stains of stars
Shining arabesques so far

Recite your rhymes, and tell me how to

Find my way -
Through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind

Painted in the sky,
As magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on [2x]

You and I asleep in my haven
Shettered by an archway of trees
And when you wake up, I'd rather be
There - Standing by your side

A comet rends this summer sky
Like a tear falls from Her eye
I feel my heart brakes,
The Nightroof is my own refuge

Follow the steps of a pagan
Against who won't understand at all
And what I've learned is how to

Find my way -
Through the endless starways
Far away - as man could understand
I will show my respect
Prey upon - to release your anger
Lay upon - my mind

Painted in the sky,
As magic as a silver chariot
Take me on and on [2x]

You and I asleep in my haven
Shettered by an archway of trees
And when you wake up, I'd rather be
There - Standing by your side

They're mocking me, they're fighting me,
I'm falling on my knees
They're celebrating victory
Let'em do it as they please
They can mock me, they can fight me,
I will pick up off the ground
Again I stand before my enemies
Can't let me down

Painted in the sky,
As magic, as a silver chariot
Take me on and on...

",Moonchariot,2004
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]

Stand before the new born kind

There is a song, taken far by the winds

A rhyme of poets, a melody
Wrapped in a dream
The elvensong has gone, to another realm

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders...searching for new scents
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown ""Thou will shall be done!""
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend

Singing our song, we went abreast
We plunged into a deeply cloven track
May the stars shine
Upon the end of road, now you can't tide

Stand before the new born kind

As young and fresh as the Spring in bloom
The song is telling stories
Every little is a gain
Tells of joy, it tells of pain

Pathfinders...searching for emotions
We are pathfinders!

Rulers of a reign without throne and
Crown ""Thou will shall be done!""
Beyond our bounds
Wondering, seeking and roaming
The unbeaten paths
Face future learning from the past

Lay down no bounds
To the things you can do
Everything's in your hand,
Look up to the Moon
All we are gathering, shall we not fall
We'll hold (we'll hold on)
We will meet again
This time my dear old friend

If you can't express what you feel within
Remember not only words can speak
If a pen killed more than sword
Let this tune be your own word!

A new journey begins each time
(hear my call)
You draw lotsfor new things to find
We are willing to endure the chance

Lay down no bounds...

And this journey begins --
With the beat of wings of lark
Her wake ravishing - skyforged spark
Gold-leaves are falling, all beasts are
Howling, the signs are clear!

The forces are near -
The crows say that someone will die
Embraces and fear - they tell no lies
Searching for new roads, sacrifice your
Blood, the signs are clear!

Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
All through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
You are free to choose your fate
Now make your choice

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining in
Fading lights
May you read the meanings, it's your lot

The journey comes to an end -
The lark plunged with sun into sea
All you love and defend -
Belongs to you and me
Pagan traditions of forgotten missions,
The signs are clear!

Eyes in the darkness
They watch, they follow you
The Spirits guide your soul
All through the clues
Eyes in the darkness
Now hear the Sisters' voice,
You are free to choose your fate
Now make your choice

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Roughly carved tree-trunks are shining
In fading lights
May you read the meanings

Through the seven seas our quest goes,
Pale moon our guide
Walking the trails of the perpetual knot
Search for the fibres,
The dwelling light net of Wyrd
Roaming souls on branch of Mother Earth

[DAWN: Fragments of star]

It's simply too hard
To blow out all these fragments of star
The dawn never shines
I'm condemned to this eternal night

Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes while you're
Holding me tight it enriches my life, it
Holds me spellbound

It crawls all inside
It's the wish to back down and hide
Like the calm sea
It's the haven of forces within

Fly away, far away
Oh, up this path I rode
I was searching for a reason
I lost the thread of tale
Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes while you're
Holding me tight
It enriches my life, holds me spellbound

[DAY: Autumn runes]

On the scars of old runes, thousands of
Forgotten memories and hopes
Are carved in stone, symbols of my childhood
Gone, on the wind floats a dream
And hundreds of my broken promises
And oaths
Taken by the stream, artefacts of what I
Was

Read the signs on the trees,
Written by golden leaves
Winds are howling their serenades,
Ancient chants singing all the good aims
I betrayed

Another night has passed, and with it all
The fears and dreads are gone,
And the shadows have faded

Clouds are leaving the sky, the horizon
Point out new ways to be found,
There is always a trail to follow, and it will
Take you home

Follow all the scents
Before light passes away
Long before the shadows fall
As covering miles in the distance
You will see
What you searched,
You will catch sight of your dreams
Dwelling forevermore, wander aimlessly

It's the fatal falling, on the path we
Choose
We're searching for answers
That never appear
We're searching for lands beyond
All limits, we're falling!

Millions of emotions (have) passed
Through my heart since I'm on this Earth
But the ones that remain are the ones
We're living for

[Repeat Bridge & Chorus]

[Solos: Aydan, Jarpen, both]

[TWILIGHT: The chant of the first snow]

It's the sweetest Night of all
It's a moment that lengthens
To eternity and more
While the flakes soundless will fall
I hear the sound of laugther
Coming from so high above
And the promise once made
Now it's broken
The curtain slowly falls
On the angel that kissed me

It's the Night of cruel remorse
It remains only a distant memory
Of things undone
A return to innocence
A travel back in time when everything
Seems clear and pure
And the promise once made
Now it's broken
The curtain slowly falls
On the angel that kissed me

[DEEP NIGHT: The Dreamcurse]

Cursed, cursed
That lone and threadlike figure
So shapelessly unbounded
Will haunt that empty jar
That is me

Cursed, cursed
I'm deep into transparency
A dreamy spiral staircase
A voice, a whisper echo in the gloom

Cursed (cursed), cursed (cursed)
I sharpen all my sleeping senses
Encircle my own wish
I'll never die!

Cursed, cursed
A gloomy sense of sadness
Impaled my arid heart
To the sceptre of melancholy

Cursed (cursed), cursed (cursed)
On the stroke of my halfhour
The token has been shown
Eternal wearing the Red Death masque!

Thousand ways of living
In the end (I) got my reward
I don't feel alone no more

Fly away, far away
Oh, up this path I rode
I was searching for a reason
I lost the thread of tale
Fly away, far away
Oh, whence I could feel you whole
There's a light in your eyes I'll follow
A spark of endless dreams
There's a light in your eyes
While you're holding me tight
It enriches my life, holds me spellbound

...and finally is day again...

On the scars of old runes, thousands of
Forgotten memories and hopes
Are carved in stone,
Symbols of my childhood gone,
On the wind floats a dream and hundreds
Of my broken promises and oaths
Taken by the stream,
Artefacts of what I was

Read the signs on the trees,
Written by golden leaves
Winds are howling their serenades,
Ancient chants singing all the good aims
I betrayed

It's the fatal falling,
On the path we choose

We're searching for lands beyond

",A Poem for the Firmament,2004
Elvenking,"[Music & Lyrics: Aydan]

Long the shores of a silent stream
I'm picking up pieces of my life
Finding out I was living my own dream
Beginning once again

I searched for themes
That I never knew before
It's like roaming a forest in winter
Searching buds buried in snow
I learnt new languages,
New forms to proclaim
All the will to be so sincere,
Not lying to myself again

Roaming through forest's trees
Creating a white snow trail on fallen
Leaves

Oh Mother Moon
Illuminate my return
'cause the road I took is so obscure

Sinking and drowning in a sea of fears
Showing compassion to the moan
Already happened in day long gone
The silk dilemma is the key, it's still for me

One by one the lights fade out
The fright-night covers all with her cloak
You cannot name the colour of the dark
I fall into a dream

From the lands lying at the end of World
I am bringing this dress as a gift, it is
Made with the purest silk
She smiled at me,
She never wore the dress
Touching the fabric was like holding
Nothing in your hand

Roaming through forest's trees
Creating a white snow trail on fallen
Leaves

Oh Mother Moon
Illuminate my return
'cause the road I took is so obscure

Sinking and drowning in a sea of fears
Showing compassion to the moan
Already happened in day long gone
The silk dilemma is the key

Hold my hand - 'till the sun set off
I'm proud of what I've done
At least the days I've spent are so totally
Unique





",The Silk Dilemma,2004
Elvenking,"I look around myself I'm feeling like a stranger to this world. 
Where are the friends once I got (as) I used to know?
No trace of common sense, a dash of a normal sanity. 
I wonder: ""Are they all mad? ... or is it me?""

[Chorus]
Thousands years have passed
And nothing gonna change
Marching the plains as loud 
As hell they're coming
Drawn up in lines, proud their eyes,
The army of the fools
Ruling the thrones, it conquered and won

I'm getting older,
Maybe I don't recognize I'm yet too old
For all this mind-blowing fair of insanity
When I was a kid I promised to myself I'd never grow up. 
But now wiser a bit I can see!

[Chorus]

Follow me, don't promise to be
What you never had thought you'd have wanted to be. 
Tell me I'm wrong but I follow myself. 
And the dreams that I've lived since I was born

[Chorus]",March of Fools,2006
Elvenking,"I can see them running towards me
All the time they steal my dreams
The ghosts of past and sorrow
All the time they steal my dreams

When I take a walk outside, whispers will surround my head
I can hear the echo of my voice, a hundred times or more

They shout, they carry on
They whisper on my sorrow
They shout all night long
But the whispers will not end
And the whispers will not end

The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
- Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is, so fragile, but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The rose is so strong but
It wonÂ't be Â'till the end, NO!

The ghost of past is showing me all the good times that have gone
- Now just a shadow on the wall
The rose is, so fragile, but still so everlasting
The ghost of sorrow is recalling all the damage done
Now just a brick off from the wall
The roses, so fragile, forever will fade away with the tide of life
But this night will hold them on!

Chorus:
Oh, I want to see when I was a child
All the emotions, the smiles and the cries
Now that I see, never it hides, the neverending nights
Remember the flash, the crowd was no more
A light that surrounds you, never before
Now that I see, never it hides, the neverending nights

At the end of this horrid night, whispers stopped to haunt my dreams
All emotions cast inside my mind, a hundred times or more... no more...

Winds of far horizons blow off all the fears
Fearless I stand, strong of all the emotions I lived through
As my memories and soul belong to you

Painted into the setting sun
A black shadow ringed in red flames
Handsome as words cannot describe
Ruthless as her blinded black eyes

And up they have seen the skies
Pains and joys of so many lives
All griefs your empty glance

Waters of the ocean tell her I am near
Winds of far horizons blow off all the fears
Fearless I stand, strong of all the emotions I lived through
As my memories and soul belong to you

I don't fear for my fate what really does ache
Is a false thought of home
No one ever will be in control of his end

By her tears and her pain
I'm eternally damned memories of a life
Nothing can ever be done to avoid my last touch

Waters of the ocean tell her I am near
Winds of far horizons blow off all the fears
Fearless I stand, strong of all the emotions I lived through
As my memories and soul belong to you

On that strange and silent night on lost hill of the memories
I've spoken of love and touched, she smiled to me
To me, smiled to me

For all the ones who seek their dawn
My wrath I breed, my wrath I spawn
Behind a crooked cross they hide
Forever I shall be their bride

",Lost Hill of Memories,2007
Elvenking,"On this night of nights, she's coming my way
Under this rain, dirty with agony and pain
Mistress of doom, winner of all fights
My glance is reflected in the blade of the scythe

A sparkling golden sickle
Mows down souls whistling in the air
Reddens little by little
The seas of life and mankind's lairs

A fall into the abyss
Deep into agony and pain
Spiral down to the anguish
It has been all in vain, all in vain, go

Welcome, please join the fair of failures
Enter into the hall of pleasures
Righteous the act to kill
Or wasn't it one of God's wills?

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Another name to be carved
For every slash of my blade
Until the day you find
The one reflected is your face

Come, taste blood, rust and terror
Come to the show with no restraint
It's your time

The mother of desperation
Death of thunder and rain
Sighs and tears are all in vain
Clad in a cloak of despair
She'll take you away

Welcome, please join the fair of failures
Enter into the hall of pleasures
Righteous the act to kill
Or wasn't it one of God's wills?

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Hold your ground and watch your back
With the aim of remaining the last
I asked this night for a piece of advice
This time the scythe won't fall, keep still

Still
Still

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Hold your ground and watch your back
With the aim of remaining the last
I asked this night for a piece of advice
This time the scythe won't fall, keep still

You leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

Leave behind all the trails of winter
The time has come for me to go
Though the fear has gone, the storm is over
And there's someone at your door

And if you follow the trails down this winter wake
She's reaping down souls, one for every flake
Throughout the ages, through centuries
She, mistress of customs of memories

I walked into a beer tavern
To give a girl a nice time
when i walked in i had 50 dollars in my pocket
When I walked out I had one dime

Wasn't she a beer drinkin' woman?
Don't ya know, man don't ya know?
She was a beer-drinkin' woman
And I don't want to see her no more

Now, when I spend down to my last dime
She said, 'Darlin' I know you're not through'
I said, 'Yes, baby doll
And the trophy belongs to you'

Don't you know, man don't you know?

And I don't wanna see her no more

I've got to step around here'

She had room for another quart of beer

Como una luz que nunca se apago
Como la noche eterna que nunca amaneció

La única vez que supe amar ahora
Tengo que renunciar a lo mas

Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me!

Elvin Jones,"I'm a shadow since you're gone
Just a shadow in the dawn
That breaks in the sand
A shadow lost in shadowland

My poor hear just flew away
When it realized one day
The dreams that we planned
Would only end in shadowland

I always wondered
Why you had to go
Whatever blunder I mad
I don't know
I guess that something
Turned out wrong
Didn't quite belong
In this lover's song

I'm a shadow, but you know
I'm the one who loves you so
So please, take my hand
And lead me out of shadowland
And lead me out of shadowland",Shadowland,1962
Elvin Jones,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Elvin Jones,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

Everything happens to me",Everything Happens to Me,1965

Since nothin' matters, then let it break
I ask the sun and the moon, the stars that shine
What's to become of it, this love of mine?

I have denied this life its worth
I will not be the victim.

Here's to getting worse
Hope it kills you faster.

Show me how it hurts to rot from the inside out.
This vigil burns until the day our fires overtake you.
Our father we forsake you.

Blessed be his name
Nothing now the same.

Ask me why I hate
Why I've prayed to see the nation that I loved disintegrate
And gladly give my life
That revolution regenerates.

In honor of the strife of those who've died
In generations before your blood stained glory
I reject you
I deny you

One little thought to me

Nearer your heart?

Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember

What do they do
Those circles of blue and white?
Oh! why do they seem to pictures a dream above
Then why do they fade my phantom parade of love?
 
Where do they end, the smoke rings I send on high?
Where are they hurled 
When they've kissed the world goodbye!
Oh! I'd give my life to laugh at this strife below
I'd be a king I'd follow each ring I blow
 
Puff puff puff puff your cares away
Puff puff puff night and day
Blow blow them into air silky little rings
Blow, blow them ev'ry where give your troubles wings
What do they tell and what is the spell they cast
Some of them fall and seem to recall the past
But most of them rise away to the skies of blue
Oh little smoke rings I love",Smoke Rings,1966

I let you
We broke the ties that bind

Blackened by an eerie sky a moonlit night
High on her heels above the icecold snow
Thunders demons thrilled by the chase

To be the one to hunt her down
To seize the price for the damage done
And bring this DemiGod to justice
Before the Grand Duke of Hell
(And of her life as well)
Little pity will be shown for her insubordination
... Be gone!

Two thousand souls on killing spree
Yet the first to reach her is struck by pity
And to his Lord and Master he means no disrespect
In letting her go...

There is but many who die this day
As the most crestfallen of angels are slain

The wrath bestowed on them all
Is tenfold greater than Heavens Fall
When the dearest of possessions are lost
For the folly of one apprentice

There is no pain severe enough
No sentence matching the crime that has been done
Here

... Finally... She is free...
... To roam the earth...
... And all of the above!

Elvira Madigan,"Falling by numbers before my very eyes
The Kin of the Dragons I've slain by birthright
And seer grant me courage for I know not the peril
That lie ahead down my twisted path

... So rise, oh Lord...
... Grant me strength, to uphold...
Thy kingdom to come
Thy death be undone
Sleep no longer

For the land below both King and foe
Awaits this final day
And though fear roams I do know, I do understand
What must be done...

Be seated, be afraid for what may come this way
For behind these shutters and behind these doors
Our story's about to unfold

I gather the will to end my mission
With the seven witches tied at the stakes
And as the audience is ghasping for air
I prepare to revel in the flesh
And now the feast is here, as the maidens fair
Are cleansed by the flames

Preordained
As I falter by every word
Summoning all but the Lord himself
For as the shape reveals as prophesied in the ""good book""
It all seams somewhat twisted to what I've
Learned to believe to be the man not the beast
I've (now) somehow succumbed to without
Knowing what made me sacrifice
All that's dead to be by the hand of the Lord

... Oh Lord why have you turned on me?

... Oh Lord you sought me out
Behind this curtain of my everyday life
And now it seams the only one to die
Is me...
