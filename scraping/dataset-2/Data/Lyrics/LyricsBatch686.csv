Martial Solal's Dodecaband,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It makes no diff'rence 
If it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm 
Ev'rything you got
Oh, it don't mean a thing

Martie Bicardii 151,"[Sideways]
Yeah
This goes to all them folks
Who like them nasty girls
Now I ain't talkin' about these
""Make love to me""
""Take care of me"" lil' thangs
I'm talkin' about buck sessions
Late night creepin's
Straight nasty girls

[Chorus: x 2]
A nasty girl is what I need and what I want
A nasty girl is super bad, I'd love the flaunt
Nasty girls creep in the back seat
Nasty girls stay nasty everyday of the week

[Sideways]
They say the freaks come out at night time
Written rhymes, lookin' fine
Make some pimp lines wit dollar signs
Brown hair, deriair thick
Took her to my lair
And I swear that I hit this
She said somethin' about a man but that's irrelavent
Had her suckin' on my trunk like I was an elephant
Low tail, [?], 60, feelin' tipsy
Breakin' out the hatters on the ladder
Better miss me
Sicky Sideways only came for one thang
Gettin' bomb headshots in the leftlane
I'm 'bout to cave in
Playa like gold and I'm engravin'
Makin' my toes pop high, freaky relations

[Martie Bacardii 151]
Martie I'm Bacardii is back again
Wit these raps that you haters just don't understand
I spot you at the party
""Do you have a man"" [Girl: ""No""]
She replied ""No""
Another fuck friend
I lace her up with game
She asked from where I came
I tell her Yoc Town friends ""Germany and Spain""
She started goin' low
You know how the story goes
I had it all sold
Picture perfect frame
I ain't ashamed
'cause this girl is jockin' for my name
I turned around and asked you girls
What this street bacame
[Girl: Oh my God]

[Chorus: x 2]
[Sideways]
Chalk up another statty, rollin' fatties
Call me Sugar Daddy, 2003 Caddy
As I skywalk
Left for drag on the sidewalk
Low pro, low key
Your hoes and me
Those hoes in heat
Slow platinum game through her earlobes
Moanin' so loud
I had her face in the pillow
Diary of a pimp
I got a glimps of my movato
Seen her lookin' tasty in Chevy Sirverado
So I paused
""Excuse me miss, what's your name
[Girl: ""Candy""]
I couldn't quite catch it
But heard somethin' 'bout a candy cane

[Martie Bacardii 151]
Scene two, me and you up at the rendezvous
I had the glass of Henn
This girl had the attitude
I thought to shoot and score
But then decided to ignore
She sat down next to me
I'm gonna get her [?]
[Girl: ""My name is Candy""]
She said: [Girl: ""This bar is such a bore""]
I fed her Brandy
Next scene I'm in a Super Sport
Where we're goin' but I'm knowin'
Back to her fort
And for a long time
I wasn't comin' up short
Difference to what a girl will give up, Chassy
But for true happiness
Finally that's nasty

[Chorus: x 2]

[Sideways]
Me and my folks like nasty freaks
And we peepin'
Call the Mexican, Perto Rican
Somethin' 'bout caucasians
Lovin' on them Asians
All the freaky deekies keep my bed squeaky
From U.S.S.R. freaks to the Middle East
To Eastern Greek, Italy, and France [?] capish
Love them mixed girls
The big hips girls
The big girls wit twigs girls
That make their limbs twirl
Them ghetto mamies
To not to name Ivana
The late night love session freakies [?]
Out
I love them freaky deeky girls no doubt

[Chorus: x 6]",Nasty Girl,2001
Martie Seidel,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they're trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere's horse
But the town has no need to be nervous

The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

[Chorus]
Mama's in the fact'ry
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for the fuse
I'm in the streets
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, ""I've just been made""
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, ""My advice is to not let the boys in""

Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
""Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it's not poison""

[Chorus]

Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero the Commander-in-Chief
Saying, ""Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?""

The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a bar bell he points to the sky
Saving, ""The sun's not yellow it's chicken"" Chorus

The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Put jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle

Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

[Chorus]

The geometry of innocence flesh on the bone
'Causes Galileo's math book to get thrown
At Delilah who sits worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter

Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after

[Chorus]

Where Ma Raney and Beethoven once unwrapped their bed roll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college

Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

[Chorus]",Tombstone Blues,1999
Martie Seidel,"God, I feel like hell tonight
Tears of rage I cannot fight
I'd be the last to help you understand
Are you strong enough to be my man? 

Nothing's true and nothing's right
So let me be alone tonight
Cause you can't change the way I am
Are you strong enough to be my man? 

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave 

I have a face I cannot show
I make the rules up as I go
It's try and love me if you can
Are you strong enough to be my man? 

When I've shown you that I just don't care
When I'm throwing punches in the air
When I'm broken down and I can't stand
Will you be strong enough to be my man? 

Lie to me
I promise I'll believe
Lie to me
But please don't leave",Strong Enough [Live],2004
Martika,"This has got to stop
I am not gonna put up with this any more
So tell me what's your excuse this time
No never mind I don't wanna hear it

So many times you pushed me aside
I'm getting sick and tired of your alibis
All alone sleepless nights
Trying to pretend our love would be alright

I could've changed my mind
If you cared enough to just apologize
But now it's much too late
Your license to my heart has met it's expiration date

Alibis
Tell me no lies
I don't wanna listen to the reasons why
Alibis
Don't act surprised
When I walk away from you and
All your alibis

You gave to me a little teddy bear
To keep me company the nights you were not there
wanting to say baby please stay
Now I don't wanna deal with all the games you play

I gave you all I had
But now I know that loving me was just a fad
There's nothing more to take
If love is just a test then you're my big mistake ",Alibis,1989
Martika,"Hypnotized
With just one look at you I'm paralyzed
I can't explain
Why just one touch from you drives me insane

You've got me head over heels
Better believe it baby
And I love how it feels

Cross my heart hope to die
May lightning strike me if I'm telling a lie
Cross my heart I swear it's true
I've never loved anyone more than I'm loving you
Cross my heart it's true

Believe me

Oh oh 
Heavenly something happens
When you're next to me
I get chills
You can ask me anything and babe I will

You've got me out of control
Better believe it baby
Form my head to my toes

Cross my heart hope to die
May lightning strike me
If I'm telling a lie

Martika,"I feel the earth move under my feet
I feel the sky tumbling down
I feel my heart start to trembling

Martika,"Why do you touch me, then turn away
Is there something you're afraid to feel
Boy, if you want me, it's getting late
Come and show me if your love is real

Cause I heard it from a friend
Who heard it from another friend
About the good things you do for me
I don't believe it 'cause I've never seen it
Now's the right time, prove it to me

I don't know what you've been told
But love has gotta come from the heart
You better shape up

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby

You've got emotions like everyone else
But you've gotta learn to let 'em show
I can't be in love all by myself
It takes two to make love grow

Make your move, I'm waiting for you
Actions speak louder than words

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby

Come on baby, show me your love is real

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby
Come on

Candlelight and a dance or two
That's all I need from you tonight
Softly whispering, I love you
Can only make me feel so right

Make your move, I'm waiting for you
Actions speak louder than words

It's not what you're doing
It's what you're not doing, baby

Martika,"If there's a fire in my eyes
It should come as no surprise to you
If I've shown you once or twice
How I feel it's because it's the truth
(You know that it's true)

Wanted to tell you so many times
How I feel when you're with me
Now that I found you
I know that you are my destiny

I love you more than you know
This feeling's so strong inside
I won't let you go
I'm afraid to show it
'Cause I don't want to blow it
I love you more than you know

You know you've got me hypnotized
But that's something I should hide from you
If I feel so mesmerized
It's because of the things that you do
(The things that you do)

I only wish I could read your mind
So I'd know just how you feel
Send me a signal
Tell me your feelings are just as real

I don't mean to put you under pressure
But it's something that I can't control
And though I'd give you the world if I could
I'm afraid to let you know

Martika,"Like water you see into me
You reach into me and I ripple round in circles
Reflections of my dreams in yours
Bring me to the shores of desire

I have been like a desert creature
Wandering on this earth so cracked and dry
But now your love is bringing me alive

My body heat will not cool down
Like water, I could not live without you
I want to dive so deep into you, I might drown

I feel like I've spent my whole life just kicking round

Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead.

It is a special one, it's never seen the sun

And starts a fire there and then I lose control

No I won't admit it
Why should I lie for you anymore?
You never loved me
You pushed and you shoved me
I seen a woman I never saw
I saw you laugh when the knife was twisted
It still hurts but the pain has shifted
I'm looking back at the time that drifted by
But I won't cry for the wasted years
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears

Feeling neglected
Used and rejected
You need a shoulder to lean upon
Maybe you've picked him
Found your next victim
Don't worry someone will come along
I broke the spell that you kept me under
I'd had enough of the rain and thunder
I lost track of the time and I wonder why
But I won't cry for the wasted years
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears

I'll sit around and drink a few more beers
Until the memory just disappears

No ocupo lucirme se bien despistar

Cosas buenas también malas
Son los golpes que te da el destino
No existe remedio ya no hay vuelta atrás
Un dolor fuerte en mi vida
Del señor la despedida,
Tengo fe que algún día lo vuelvo a mirar

Lo que quiero y cumplo mis antojos
Y es a mi modo y no se diga mas
Firme estoy con mis hijitos, el andru y el angelito,
Por ellos no hay duda siempre eh de brincar

Mi delirio son las damas
Y con un vaso de un buen Buchannans
Seguido en el rancho me gusta pistear
Serio cuando se requiere
Pero al mil con mis deberes

Martin Denny,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1997
Martin Denny,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye

And we were the players

Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay

The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

I need no soft lights to enchant me

Martin Drew,"The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?
My fickle friend,
The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind
The summer wind
The summer wind",Summerwind,2008
Martin Drew,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,2008

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Martin Fierro,"Can you tell me what happened to the blossom
Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy 
Was the blackberry blossom from the blackberry bush 

When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom 
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow 
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses 
And black as the wings of the Arkansas crow 
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon 
Known for his cackling and his screaming 
Driving away the swallow and the thrush 
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush  

I was picking berries when that crow flew above me 
Carrying my lover so far away 
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom 
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay 
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard 
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard 
And the day settles down to an evening hush  
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush",Blackberry Blossom,2004

Martin Flynn,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1992

Tell me where you are, tell me where you are
Summer nights, bright lights
And the shootin' stars, they break my heart

Callin' you now, but you're not pickin' up
Shadows so close if that's still enough
Light a match, light a match
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are

Oh, love
How I miss you every single day
When I see you on those streets

I don't know how to forget your face
No, love
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away

So far away

It's breakin' me, losin' you
We were far from perfect
But we were worth it
Too many fights, and we cried
But never said we're sorry
Stop sayin' you love me

You're callin' me now, but I can't pick up
Your shadow's still close, and I'm still in love
The summer's over now
But somehow it still breaks my heart
We could have had this talk

Martin Garrix,"I woke up pissed off today
And lately everyone feels fake
Somewhere I lost a piece of me
Smoking cigarettes on balconies

But I can't do this alone
Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

So when your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
I'll be there for you
When you're screaming, but they only hear you whisper
I'll be loud for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Last year took a toll on me
But I made it with you next to me
Around the world and back again
I hope you're waiting at the end

Sometimes I just need a light
If I call you on the phone
Need you on the other side

I got you, I promise
Let me be honest
Love is a road that goes both ways
When your tears roll down your pillow like a river
I'll be there for you
But you gotta be there for me too

But you gotta be there for me too

Boy, I'm holding on to something
Won't let go of you for nothing
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
There was a time that I was so blue
What I got to do to show you
I'm running, running, just to keep my hands on you
Running, running, just to keep my hands on you

When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times, you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you

You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up

Look who's got you goin' crazy again

I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad

You're off the map now, radar can't even find you

When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus

But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, 'cause Doc left you all guessin'

So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record, what

That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass

Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist

Who may have never got to see our faces

Broke down barriers of language and races

And plenty honey's involved

Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally

Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week

You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker

Along with G-Unit Records presents the return

At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages out on highway nine,
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors

And the lamplight shining on me projects my lonely gloom
My counterpart in agony mocks each tear that falls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

He lurks out in the darkness or in the neon's glow
He follows me across the steps and up and down the halls

My writhing shadow twists and turns as though it is in pain
I'm trying to escape the memory my heart recalls
And I cast a lonesome shadow on these lonely, lonely walls

The image of a love I lost and all the things I'd planned
Are as empty as the bottle that I hold in my hand
My soul is buried in the depths of love and life's pitfalls

Martin Jones,"It's not my fault if you didn't live out your
Youthful dreams
Now you want to backtrack, how different it all seems
Love seems to be like alcohol, evaporates before your eyes
The bonds that once were welcome, become the chains we despise

Chorus
When you cross that line, there's no turning back
When you cross that line, don't come knocking at my door

Everyone has got to take some responsibility
The grass is rarely bluer, but you wouldn't take it from me
Finding out the hard way can be an endless affair
I'd stop you if I could, but then again, I wouldn't dare

I'm telling you when I say these words, that
They're not spoken in bitterness
That destructive emotion has long ago left
And these tears that cleanse the soul and let me
Start afresh

When you cross that line, what more can I say
When you cross that line, we are no more
We are no more
",Cross That Line,1989
Martin Jones,"He wasn't looking for a pretty face
She wasn't searching for the latest style
He didn't want someone who walked straight off the TV

He wasn't looking for a five minute thrill
She wasn't thinking of tomorrow or of next week
This vacancy he meant to permanently fill

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine
An everlasting precious love
Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

Back in the world of disposable emotion
In the climate of temporary dreams
He wasn't looking for a notch on his bedpost
A love to push, pull and burst at the seams

I need an everlasting love
I need a friend and a lover divine

Wait for it, wait for it, give it some time

This is love worth waiting for
Something special, something pure

Guardians slept while comfort came
The vapours poison, the acid rain fell
The spirit cut from earthly bounds
The creature stirred the pain

How much abuse can she take
(awake from your dreamtime)
The lines are drawn our justice awaits
(will the guardians surrender)

The forest bare, a desert born
The life pushed out
They sold her cheaply
All for a shilling for next weeks treat
A marvel that had taken ten thousand years

Martin Jones,"This is our last supper together
The last time we share in this intimacy
We have created a suffering circle that threatens to
Tighten and destroy you and me

Yesterday I flicked through the snapshots we
Kept to remember the tender times
Each little picture and each little memory should bring back a smile
But now brings back a tear of regret

Chorus
Letting go is so hard
Letting go is so hard
So let us love tonight, thinking now of our greatest moments before we
Release from this death in life drink the wine and take my hand
Is it a crime to live this lie?
I know that we will never share, share this love again

But we both must be starting again, each one of
Us too strong in these chains to remain
This tug of war has weakened our purpose and
Pulled us apart from beginning to end

The good book at bedtime no longer suffices
The bottle of whiskey just one of my vices

The salt on your marguerita will stick to your lips
Lips that I'd die for a fleeting stolen kiss

But you're just another illusion
My mind wanders to you

You couldn't live with someone in dreamland
Toothpaste from harrods when the corner shop will do
A friend giving a lift becomes a chauffeur for two
The grandest illusions to hang on to
There you are with your golden brown skin
The sparkling pacifico catching your chin
The salt on your marguerita will stick to your lips
Lips that I'd die for a fleeting stolen kiss

It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1994
Martin Litton,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby,

Tie a ribbon 'round your fractured heart
Forget the blue it can hibernate
In the simplest shades of black and gray

Sitting in the home of the shadows
Maybe if we find peace there
We can only grow into yellow

A pirate ship 'midst the deadly fog
Will be the wings that spread to help you soar
Stay always near, never very far
So I can hold you when you break apart

Maybe if find peace here
Laying in my woods like a meadow
Maybe if you find peace here
You can only grow into yellow

"Martin Luther King, Jr.","Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. 
We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
We cannot turn back.
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until ""justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream.""¹
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. 
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.
And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.""
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. 
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.""²
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. 
Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride, 
From every mountainside, let freedom ring! 
And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. 
Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
But not only that:
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:
Free at last! free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!",I Have a Dream,1968

Stealing away from that old nightmare

Against the grain, unrestrained
I've invented a different game when I'm dealing
Dealing, now I'm dealing

Something out there is calling me
Beckoning me with urgency
Speeding, speeding, I am leaving

Oh saints alive, bless my soul
Driverless, now I'm in control

Bad pennies return from whence they came
I'll be back like a boomerang
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Speeding away with no time to spare
Speeding away from the same nightmare

The trail ahead is dark and unsound
But I'm lapping it up like a greedy hound
Free at last of the city sounds
Free at last to put my foot right down

Boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom

Shut your eyes, let's hold hands
Overtaking on the tightest bends
Throw the dice, toss a penny in the air
Heads or tails, the devil may care

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand
Just holding your hand.
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Back when in love was what to be
To know what truth was there to see
Was harder than keeping you close to me

Today I know that friends can be
More than good friends like you and me
The worst of what this story tells
Is me in love like no one else with you

*Made me believe in you 
Blindfolded by you 
Scolded by thoughts of you

Please don't throw my love away
What if you need this love someday
Please don't push it might go away
What if you come back nevertheless no
Please don't throw my love away
Don't you go taking for granted after all I gave
Don't throw this love away
Can't you see there's nothing else nobody else

But you and me not long ago
Were more than friends
We were lovers in a roll
Please tell me tonight
That night you were in love
As you were making me more and more
In love with you

With simple thoughts of you 
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you

And making them come true 
Holding one another, saying all I need is you

And show me that you care 
Say when I need you 
You will always be there 
But if you go and leave me 
(Ooh) This I swear is true

Now my nights would end 
With just one wish, that's you 
To hold me in the dark 
And help me make it through 
'Cause the pain that's inside me 
Would simply melt away 
If I had you here with me 
And promise me you'd stay

And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger

Well you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Separate lives",Separate Lives,2005
Martin Nievera,"Without you to hold me
And heal my heart
To guide me and keep me
From falling apart

My life is so empty
So hallow and cold
Footsteps and echoes
Of nowhere to go

Without you, without you I know
I?m all alone
I can?t go on this way
Day by day

Without you without you I know
I can?t let go
I want you here to stay
Every day

Without you who am I
What am I to do
My life?s out of focus
And so are my views

I need you to give me
The strength to go on
A reason for hope
And writing this song

Without you, without you I know
I?m all alone
I can?t go on this way
Day by day



Without you without you I know
I know I can?t let go
I want you here to stay
Every day


Without you, without you I know
I?m all alone
I can?t go on this way
Day by day

Without you without you I know
I know I can?t let go
I want you here today
Every day

I've been waiting for so long
Now I fin'lly found someone stand by me
Saw the writing on the wall
Then we built this magic fantasy
Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly (no baby)
So we take each other's hand
Cause we seem to understand the urgency 
Just remember...
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I tell you something this could be love!
I've had the time of my life

No, I never felt this way before
yes, I swear it's so true
And I owe it all to you...hey, baby
With my body and soul,
I want you more than you'll ever know
So we'll just let it grow
Don't be afraid to lose control
Just remember...
You're the one thing
I can't get enough of
So I tell you something this could be love...
Because I've had the time of my life
No I never felt this way before, yes
I swear it's so true
And I owe it all to you...
'Cause I've had the time of my life
And I charge through every open door
Well I find all true and I owe it all to you",(I've Had) The Time of My Life,2007

It's three in the morning
You're nowhere in sight
And all that I wanted was
To be with you tonight
I've watched love get closer
And then fade away
I've seen you believe in me
I've seen you try to stay

But what good is holdin' on
When you know that all you
Can think about is letting go
They say if you love someone
Then set them free
If they come back again
Then in the end it was meant to be

I thought we were lovers
I thought we were friends
I guess when reality steps in
The dreaming ends
We live for the future
We learn from the past
No matter how hard we try
Some good things never last
And all you can think about is letting go
Be true to yourself my love
That's all I ever wanted you to be
Just don't forget to smile 
When you think of me

I reached for the stars
I have got them in sight
There's someone who really needs me
Out there in the night
We live for the future
We will learn from the past
No matter how hard we try

And I long to worship Thee

Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy giver

She stands with her brother, with thousands of men
Her head has been shaven by a black uniform
She's one of God's children that waits at the door

Tears on her pillow, she tightens her lips
Touches the number tattooed on her wrist
The sign says, 'Treblinka', again she can't breathe
For all of the children she'll always see

They're her constant companions, six hundred souls
In the doors of the chambers, there's one door of hope
That would open to the forest and fields covered green
Where all of God's children again would be free

And they came out of the tunnels, went over in waves
She'd run with the others over the graves
As the watchtowers tumble in an ocean of fire
Some of God's children escaped through the wire

Slowly 'round the raven flies, scours the trees
Where they hide, the beast, he threatens, ""You won't survive""
She raises her fist and whispers in her sleep
""I am going to live, I am going to live""

Sunlight has risen in her garden today
Hannah is watching, her grandchildren play
She hears the bells ringing in a town far away
For all of God's children who died for this day

In my room, I hear him bring down his fist
And still at night, I hear my mother cry, mother cry

He'll raise his bottle just like a hammer
And she will be crucified

Her tears bleed through the walls in here
And I'll stand in your way, father

I was your secret fool
Through all the wasted words

Shades drawn tight against this man

There's a shadow in the shade of your eyes
There's a place we can go after dark
In between a truth and a lie
And it's lit by the light in your heart
The light in your heart
You had the coolest hand
I began to shake
In and out of doubt
A better world took shape
But if I fall sometime at your feet
Let me dream in your footsteps
Walk in your sleep

Under the bridge where we met first time
I'm comin' across town
Walkin' to your house

Yesterday weighs you down
Oh, lonely girl, won't you come on out?
I swear, it'll be alright
On this holy night

Put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Say goodnight to your sister
We're gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leavin'
In St.George's bay

And when I look into your eyes
There's one thing that I can say
No one loves you this way
So put on your red dress baby
And one more time let me see you smile
See you smile tonight

There's the abandoned train
Where we sheltered from the rain
Somehow I knew someday
We'd come here again

Put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Say goodnight to your sister
We're gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leavin'
In St.George's bay

And when I look into your eyes
There's one thing that I can say
No one loves you this way
So put on your red dress baby
And one more time let me see you smile

See the candles burnin' on the Saturday night over rainy town
All over rainy town, see them smile tonight

Here on this empty road
We stare at ourselves in a shop window
Funny we seem so right
On this holy night

So put on your red dress, baby
And wear your smile
Close the door right behind you
Gonna walk for miles
We'll go where the boats are leaving
In St.George's bay

And recall the tenderness
As we sit by the waterside
Oh, I can never forget
That I was the man who let you
Slip out of his life
So put on your red dress, baby
And let me one more time
Make you smile tonight

See the candles burnin' on the Saturday night
Oh, see the candles burnin' on the Saturday night

Put on your red dress
Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile
Put on your red dress, come out and wear your smile

Someday his innocence

I throw away my soulless days, I need you in my life
In the doorway of my heart the presence of you shines
So put your face to my window trust what you see inside

What are these eyes for if I can't see the moon watch over you?
What are these arms for if I can't hold you through the night?
What does this heart beat for if I can't lay by your side?
You must know I was made for you, yeah

I'll meet you by the wisdom tree and I'll hold you so close
Come on out of the wilderness let love free you from your ghosts

What are these arms for if I can't hold you through the night?
What does this heart beat for if I can't lay by your side?
You must know I was made for you, yeah

We'll walk upon the hill so high above the city
And count the rooftops down below
Lay on the grass, dream out loud
Catch runaway chains, dance in the rain

Someday you'll take my name
Kneel down in the moonlight, let your hair fall down around
Blow out all your candles tonight and I believe you will see
I was made for you

What are these arms for if I can't hold you through the night?

Wanders in darkness, on grimy ground.
In a forest, unclean, unsound.

leaflets scatter around to advertise.

A swamp, in it hands streched out
to catch a passing dime.
Donations to the rich,
widened opavements for the poor,
somewhere else to lie.
But my friend the carriage door
stands slightly ajar,
and I know clipped wings make uneasy flight,

Said God is dead and war's begun

And he shall be Levon

Martin Sexton,"I was a fool I was so much younger then
The night she took me by surprise
I should have known all the trouble that I'd be in
But then she hooked me with those eyes

Her drink was gin as she said “Tonight would never end”
But her love weighed so heavy on my mind
For she was the live-in lover of a drummer I called my friend
She weren't nothing but a gypsy in disguise

Gypsy woman, how'd you do that to me?
Gypsy woman, stole my heart and then you set me free
Gypsy woman, how'd you learn to like that?
Gypsy woman, come on back

Spending my wages on rose and wine
We'd ride the days and we'd dance the nights
The things we could do in my old VW
The city lights never seemed so bright from the reservoir

And my friends they would warn me
Saying she's one fickle queen
Better get out while the getting is good my friend
And besides her old drummer man is looking

And he's so big and bad and mean
But what I didn't know then is what I know too well
She played me like a violin

Gypsy woman, how'd you do that to me?
Gypsy woman, stole my heart and then you set me free
Gypsy woman, how'd you learn to like that?
Gypsy woman, come on back

So you tell me that you're leaving me now
After all the times that we have been through
As your clown how am I gonna ever go home
Somebody tell me what am I gonna do

And so it goes I lost my pride and I lost my job
This gypsy woman took nearly every thing I called my own
It was a big surprise

So next time she comes dancing prancing through the town
Gonna recognize the gypsy, I'm gonna recognize the gypsy
Gonna recognize the gypsy in disguise

Martin Sexton,"Silence, silence now
Silence, silence now

As you sit and read the paper
Dozing off, you dim the light
Put your glasses on the table
Sink into your easy chair

Dream the dream you've always dreamed of
You're a boy so free and wild
In this dream you capture freedom
And you're not your father's child

People cheer and clap their hands
Now you dream that you're a man
Amidst applause and blissful noise
You cannot hear your father's voice saying

Silence, silence now
Silence, silence now

As you dream you're in the circus
Ran away from home at ten
Got yourself a painted pony
Summersaults upon his back

This is what you've always wanted
Could this be the promise land
Share a laugh with all the carnies
Limelight and adoring fans

People cheer and clap their hands
Now you dream that you're a man
Amidst applause and blissful noise
You'll never hear your father's voice screaming

Silence, silence now
Silence, silence now

As you sit and read your paper
Dozing off you dim the light
As you wake your dream is over
Forget it all and say goodnight
Goodnight

Martin Sexton,"I've been stemmin' for change and singing in these streets now 
Long as I care to recall 
The dank little loung room in the Roosevelt hotel 
My idea of a holiday 

Every once in a while 
A little old light shines through my tunnel 
So I follow it like a moth flies to the flame. 

And just when I think I got my world by the balls 
I find I'm dancin' in the light again 
Dancing in the light 
Of a speeding freight train 
Singing it's hard 

Living in the free world 
Getting saved by the bell 
People find my company 
To be strange as hell 

Looking back on aspirations and dreams 
My father he had in mind for me 
Moon lights the tracks and broken glass as I recall 
Those plans I left so far behind 

And I know it's better off he never saw me this way 
He always told me donÃ?t let the devil have his due 
And I know my father would turn over in his grave 

To see me hog tied to the chain 
Or dancing in the light 
Of a speeding freight train 

Singing it's hard 
Living in the free world 
Getting saved by the bell 
People find my company 
To be strange as hell 

And its only getting harder in this free world 
With all this strugglin g and strain 
People find my sweet peace of mind 
In the pouring rain 

As the storm moves in ain't no friends to be found 
So I sit Ã?neath this dream and bridge for a while 
And it seems that my mind is in pieces on the ground

Getting saved by the bell 
Mostly find my Jesus 
In the pouring rain

Keepin' my hands pressed to the wheel

A man in this mood is a most dangerous kind
Then there was the time my head went blind
Couldn't see the sign at the time
Years would go by before I wondered who
Or where or what or why

Burning and learning when the damage was done

To the rest of my life
And I almost had it all
I'm sick and tired but I'm hoping 
That a cure will be found
Cause I can't stop thinking bout you
I can't stop thinking bout you

Here face to face with what I've been running from all these years
Hangs a dark cloud over the moon
Pull off to this roadside dive and maybe test my sobriety
Order a tall cool ginger ale

Lovin' you was sort of like lovin' a fifth of the finest bourbon
Was it your quality or high quantity that's put me in the shape I'm in

Now I'm tired and I'm scared and wide open to the rest of my life
And I almost had it all

Martin Sexton,"In a rusted red Chevy with a heart full of glory
She left that night
A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in
And then she asked me for a light

Said she had some old business see an old friend
Or maybe make a new start
But the words of her reason they changed with the season
And the truth burned in my heart

It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy
Cause I knew even then I was caught

I'm caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

So I listen to the wind for the answer
Time hangs heavy on my face
I run from the storm that's on it's way
Until I find there is no place

No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain
Yes I know this time it's too late, now

Cause I'm caught in the rain again
And I pray to the Heavens to defend me
I'm caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me

And the rain comes down so silently
And time stand's still like it's in front of me
And the years turn to the rain
And this silence kills me

So now in this one horse town bar
I sing in the back room in the December night
Here she comes through the doorway
With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget

She looks like she knew me
The heat shot through me, melted me down
So we sat and talked about the old days
Or any new things that we found

Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent
We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain

We're caught in the rain again
I pray to the Heavens to defend me
Caught in the rain
Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?

I'm out here on my knees
And my love knows I've been trying
Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying
So I guess she gets me the rain again",Caught in the Rain,1996
Martin Sexton,"I was a fool I was so much younger then
The night she took me by surprise
I should have known all the trouble that I'd be in
But then she hooked me with those eyes
Her drink was gin as she said tonight would never end
But her love weighed so heavy on my mind
For she was the live-in lover of a drummer I called my friend
She weren't nothing but a gypsy in disguise

Gypsy woman how'd you do that to me
Gypsy woman stole my heart and then you set me free
Gypsy woman how'd you learn to like that
Gypsy woman come on back

Spending my wages on rose and wine
We'd ride the days and we'd dance the nights
The things we could do in my old VW
The city lights never seemed so bright from the reservoir
And my friends they would warn me saying she's one fickle queen
Better get out while the getting is good my friend
And besides her old drummer man is looking
And he's so big and bad and mean
But what I didn't know then is what I know too well
She played me like a violin

So you tell me that you're leaving me now
After all the times that we have been through
As your clown how am I gonna ever go home
Somebody tell me what am I gonna do

And so it goes I lost my pride
And I lost my job
This gypsy woman took nearly every thing I called my own
It was a big surprise
So next time she comes dancing prancing through the town
Gonna recognize the gypsy
I'm gonna recognize the gypsy
Gonna recognize the gypsy in disguise",Gypsy Woman,1996
Martin Sexton,"Freedom came my way that night 
Just like a jet plane In and out of sight 
I was hauling ass at a million miles an hour 
Wondering how hard I'd hit 

When they came into the station 
They said I was bad beyond repair 
But I got no qualms with my situation 
Say here I am 

So say cheri cheri won't you dare to 
Say cheri cheri won't you dare to 
Leave a message and your number please 
Tie them up all my old fantasies 
Put them in a big red bow and send them care of me 

I'm taking a chance on the wind 
I'm packing all my bags 
Taking a mistake I gotta make 
Then I'm glory bound 

So I packed it up and I went to the winds 
And I lived out of a VW bus for a year or two 
Ain't nothing but a pipe dream and my guitar 
Livin off of apple fields and old cigars 
Diggin this microphone checking it out every night all alone 
The car battery is dead again so I got my head dead set against it 

So say cheri cheRI won't you dare to 
Say cheri cheri won't you dare to 
Leave a message and your number please 
Take the time to want to satisfy me

Martin Sexton,"I'm looking out into the ocean
This boy in a boat that I am
Through the haze I can catch a glimpse
Of the damage that's been done
Miles like minutes they pass as I row
And I count them in my head
Further and further I seem to go
From the home that I once made
Raise the anchor raise these tired hands
No direction and my pockets full of sand

I'm over my head

I the first few days of my journey
Friends and strangers came aboard my ship
Until the firsts of their passing
Crowded my quarters with gold
I've got no room for them anymore
For I fear I might go under
My anchor is tangled in weeds down below
As I heed the distant thunder calling
Raise the question that's in front of me
Clear as the sun I feel through the haze I'll never see

I'm over my head on the crazy ocean
I'm over my head on the stormy sea
I'm over my head with a clear commotion
I'm over my head and it's killing me

I'll raise my bow to the winds that blow
Face the storm face to face as I know
She's banging hard on my cabin door
I face my fear face to face and what's more
She's in front of me
And then she's gone for just awhile
And I'm crying
I'm over my head",Over My Head,1997
Martin Sexton,"Sittin' in this lonely town wonderin' when things are gonna change 
Dreamin' my life away and it seems them dreams they turned into a bunch of dust clouds 
Gettin' my nerve up but my past is pullin' me down 
wonderin' how long this black sheep can stick around

Somebody told me once before 
you can never go home again once you leave 
say anything just to steer me away from the truth of what I who I am and what I believe 
So I thanked him for his two cents 
with a shake and some sympathy 
and I packed up my blue jeans and I headed for the big prize 
of my freedom

Bye bye black sheep 
black sheep of the family 
Bye bye black sheep how that means so much to me 
Bye bye to my friends and to my family 
bye bye black sheep goin' off and set my soul set it free 

Times they were changin' I did just a little re-arrangin' 
take a couple chances my progress it advances 
to that prize of my freedom

It's written in the stars that steel bars never will a prison cell make 
once I find that sweet home or a place I like to call home anyway 
some people will say I'm crazy singin out loud like I do here on the street 
when I got A song I sing it out loud and if you don't like that my friend 
well I'm gonna say to you

Martin Sexton,"Every single time I come to this town
It brings out the worst in me
Decadence dries deep in the root of mine eyes
To bring out a thirst in me

Bust in to Burbank and buy a big beef jerky on Barham
Stare into the stockyard
Life in this car out on the road can be so easy

Then in the evenin' time, there's a welcome sight
In my lazy dreams
I'm still hopin', still hopin', still hopin' to find

The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me

Hansel and Gretel turnin' tricks for the big bad wolf on Sunset
In front of the health food store
See 'em linin' up in their Range Rovers and their Mercedes
For some peek a boo with the queen of hearts

And as the sun goes down in that purple sky
What passes for stars comes out
I'm still hopin', still hopin', still hopin' to find

The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me

The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me

I dreamed I saw Jesus on the sidewalk
Of Sodom burnin' sage he told me
""LA you're my desert rose, forgive me your age
I've done with my twenties but there's a reason to live
Swear I found it in the picks and pans of People magazine""

The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me

The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me
The best in me is the beast in me

I made good my escape in my Geo Prism
The little red rental that could
I was prayin' no more hair would grow on my palms
As I drove away from the sign, it said
""Welcome to Hollywood""

Oh, it's the beast in me comin' on through
It's the best in me shinin' on through
Mama had told me, watch out for the beast in me
But mama, mama it's okay
Yeah, the beast in me, oh, it's the best in me
Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

The beast in me is the best in me
The beast in me is the best in me

Martin Sexton,"Hey little jail bait 
Tell me a story 
Let me bum a smoke and we can chat a while 
I only need a moment 

One moment in your glory 
Before you get off and make your change 
Talking 'bout a woman that hasn't felt a day in a while 
Talking 'bout a woman that just can't say no 

She needs another lover like she needs another dose in her blood 
Talking 'bout a woman whose name is 
Candy 
She's so fine 

She's waiting on the backstreet line 
Like a 
Lost angel 
Not long for this world 

Don't usually get emotional 
Don't usually show my vein she said 
Only when I sing or when I'm making tracks 
And sweatin's just my mean way 

To show me where I am 
And to tell me where I need to be 
And through those eyes 
If she wore her disguise 

I'd see through it and say 
Come in from the rain girl 
Talking 'bout a woman she loves me like a dog loves a bone 
Talking 'bout a woman I just can't let go 

I need her as my lover like I need another hole in my head 
I'm talking 'bout a woman I know 
Candy 
She's so fine 

But she's shaking on that backstreet line 
Like a loose cannon 
Ashamed to explode 
In the middle of my day

Martin Sexton,"Hold me tight don't say goodnight
And I'll let you know that I care
Wait a little longer don't let me be
And I'll comfort you from the storm
It's been a long night tomorrow's another day
Call me when you find out the answer 
And I'll hope and I'll pray 
To a power that will keep me from goin' insane in the meantime

Teenage lovers caught up in this dance
Pain's the price of this young romance
How was I such a young fool to know
Lord knows I got no direction from home
So I say this prayer

Take hold of me blessed powers that be
Love keep us together

Down with the rain came the news
That our wild ways gonna bring us a baby boy
Wash away all those innocent dreams
Now my whole world is turned upside-down on me
And here I pray
To some power they say's gonna keep me from goin' insane

I can't be strong unless I'm by your side
My weakness tells me to run for the hills
Responsibility beckons me
To think I dreamed your kiss would set me free
Well I've never been so wrong

Chorus

There cries a child so deep in the night
He needs a father somebody to set things right
I am the one to love to hold him tight
To discount by love a serious oversight

She will keep us together wherever we go
Even if I live a thousand miles away

Seems you got me in your spell once more 
Must be there's a storm on the way 
You taught me to know when you're near 
In your glance 
Recall my shady days of youth 
Stealing altar wine and microphones 
Not so blindly fueling my need 
As rock and roll fueled my dreams 
You know rock and roll fueled my dreams 
Back then you saw me as this child 
In great need of the wildest sin 
How sweet your grace I stumbled in 
And how completely you waved 
As I laughed in your face 
Oh my Maria 
Oh my Maria 
How you stood for strength and sanity 
Now is there someone poking holes in thee 
I see now why you called me near 
Maria my song can you hear 
I know you see the silence on the sidewalk 
And the anger in the street 
And the voices of all these children 
Coming up to my feet 
And we sing your song in vain 
As some preacher sees his reign 
Come down

In the silence on the hill 
You know I'll be dreaming of you still

Martin Sexton,"The other night I had a crazy dream
'Bout a man in a fishing hat selling magazines
All the way from Kingston he'd worked his way down
I bought him a drink on the night they kicked him out of town

He said, ""You know I don't like the way I am.""
""No, I don't like the way I am.""

And I saw an old fisherman out swayin' on a dock
Swigging a jug of something and a string of fish that he had caught
His wife had left him just a week before
She packed up her bags and waltzed on out the door

She said, ""You know I don't like the way I am.""
""No, I don't like the way I am.""

And then she cried
And you and me walked down the shores of our youth
Chasing the sunrise, challenging the truth

It's all so distant now I've seen too many lies
Turning my vision into crumbling demise

Makes me want to say
You know I don't like the way I am
No, I don't like the way I am

But I'm gonna change the way I am
I'm gonna change the way I am",Way I Am,1998

Martin Simpson,"You know the guitar came to Europe with the gypsies 700 years ago
Spain brought the guitar to Mexico 400 years ago
U.S.A. picked a quarrel with Mexico and got Texas and California
And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us

It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats
Up in Syracuse there's a 92 year old woman
Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast

So they won't know which route I've gone

Down at the foot of old Chestnut Street
So I can hear old number nine
As she goes roaring by

Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Freight train, freight train goin' so fast
Please don't tell them which train I'm on
So they won't know which route I've gone

When I'm dead and in my grave
No more good times do I crave
Place the tombstone at my head and my feet
Tell my friends that I've gone to sleep

This is a strange affair

And all my companions are taken away
And who will provide for me against my dying day?

My mother, father, lover, friend and enemy
Where are my companions?
They're prisoners of death now and taken far from me
And where are the dreams I dreamed in the days of my youth?
They took me to illusion when they promised me the truth
And what do sleepers need to make them listen, 
Why do they need more proof?
This is a strange, this is a strange affair

Won't you give me an answer? 
Why is your heart so hard towards the one who loves you best?

Has wakened you, and warned you, and called you to the test

Martin Simpson,"Through streams and bogs and under bush, I made my weary way,
Though windfalls thick and devil's floods, my aching feet did stray.
Until at last by evening start, on higher ground I gained,
And there I met with a Creole girl, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain. 

Good evening to you Creole girl, my money is no good,
Although I fear the gators, well I must defend the wood.
You are welcome here kind stranger, my house is very plain,
But we never turn a stranger out, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

She took me to her mammy's house, and she treated me right well,
The hair around her shoulders, in them jet black ringlets fell.
I'd try to describe her beauty, but I find the words in vain,
So beautiful that Creole girl, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

Well I asked if she'd marry me, she said that could not be,
Because she loved a sailor, and he's far away at sea.
She said that she would marry him, and true she would remain,
Even through he never did comeback, to the Lakes of Pontchartrain.

So farewell farwell you Creole girl, I'll ne'er see you no more,
I'll ne'er forget your kindness, in the cottage by the shore.
And at each social gathering, a flowing glass I'd drain,
And I drink a health to the Creole girl, by the Lakes of Pontchartrain",Lakes of Ponchartrain,1994

Let's pretend that we're together, all alone.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

For this is a fine morning and bathing we'll go""

The first one they met was the keeper of game
And he wished them in his heart to return back again

He swum to an island but not in dry ground

And off to her mother's bedchamber she goes
Saying ""mother, dearest mother, I dream'd a true dream
That young William was floating in a watery stream""

Wringing her fingers and tearing her hair
Saying ""was there nobody by
That would venture their life for my fine darling boy?""

He rowed round the strand like a man in despair

You couldn't even hold a job, 
Not steady enough for the office, 
Not hard enough for the hod.
You'd rather be riding your Norton
Or going fishing with your split cane rod.
You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.

When your grammar school days were over, 
It was nineteen-seventeen, 
And you did the right and proper thing.
You were just eighteen.
You were never mentioned in dispatches.
You never mentioned what you did or saw.
You were just another keen young man
In the mud and stink of war.

You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job, 
Not steady enough for the office, 
Not hard enough for the hod.
You'd rather be singing the Pirate King, 
Or going fishing with your split cane rod.
You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.

You came home from the Great War
With the pips of a captain's rank.
A German officer's Luger, 
And no money in the bank.
Your family sent you down in the coal mine
To learn to be captain there, 
But you didn't stand it very long.
You needed the light and the air.

You were never any good with money.

You'd rather be watching performers fly
Or fishing with your split cane rod.
You were never any good with money.
You couldn't even hold a job.

When the second war came along, 
You knew what should be done.
You would re-enlist to teach young men
The booby trap and the gun; 
And they sent you home to Yorkshire, 
With a crew and a Lewis gun, 
So you could save your seaside town
From the bombers of the Hun.

You couldn't even hold a job.

And when my mother came to your door, 
With a baby in her arm, 
Her big hurt boy only nine years old, 
Trying to keep her from harm, 
If you had been a practical man, 
You would have been forewarned.
You would have seen that it never could work, 
And I would have never been born.

There's no proper work in your seaside town, 
So you come here looking for a job.
You were storeman at the power station
Just before I came along.
Nobody talked about how you quit, 
But I know that's what you did.
My mother said you were a selfish man, 
And I was your selfish kid.

You were never any good with money.

And all you knew of nature's ways:

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1992

Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""

You can bet one lucky day you'll waken,
And your blues will be forsaken,
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way.

If there is love in your heart to share,
Dear Bluesette don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you,
To find a someone to be true to,
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay.

Get set, Bluesette,
True love is coming,
Your lonely heart soon will be humming. 

Pretty little Bluesette, 
Mustn't be a mourner,
Have you heard the news yet,
Love's 'round the corner.
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons 
To make your your next springtime 
Your gold wedding ring time.",Bluesette,2008
Martin Taylor,"Sei calda come i baci che ho perduto
Sei piena di un amore che a passato
Che il cuore mio vorrebbe cancellar

Odio l'estate
Il sole che ogni giorno ci saldava
Che splendidi tramonti dipingeva
Addeso brucia solo con furor

Tornerà un altro inverno
Cadranno mille petali di rose
La neve coprirà tutte le cose
E forse un po' di pace tornerà

Say you need me with you now and always
Promise me that all you say is true
That's all I ask of you

Let me be your shelter
Let me be your light
You're safe, no one will find you
Your fears are far behind you 

All I want is freedom
A world with no more night
And you, always beside me
To hold me and to hide me 

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Let me lead you from your solitude
Say you need me with you, here beside you
Anywhere you go, let me go too
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me
Each night, each morning

Say you love me! 
Raoul
You know I do 

Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you
(They kiss)

I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me raoul! 

Christine I love you! 

Order your fine horses! 
Be with them at the door! 

And soon you'll be beside me! 

You'll guard me and you'll guide me
(They hurry off and the phantom emerges from behind the statue)

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Christine

Say you'll share with me one love
One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

You will curse the day you did not do
All that the phantom asked of you!

Martin Yates,"I don't know how to love him
What to do, how to move him
I've been changed, yes really changed
In these past few days, when I've seen myself

I seem like someone else
I don't know how to take this
I don't see why he moves me
He's a man. He's just a man

And I've had so many men before
In very many ways
He's just one more
Should I bring him down?

Should I scream and shout?
Should I speak of love
Let my feelings out?
I never thought I'd come to this

What's it all about?
Don't you think it's rather funny
I should be in this position
I'm the one who's always been

So calm, so cool, no lover's fool
Running every show
He scares me so
I never thought I'd come to this

What's it all about?
Yet, if he said he loved me
I'd be lost. I'd be frightened
I couldn't cope, just couldn't cope

I'd turn my head. I'd back away
I wouldn't want to know
He scares me so
I want him so

I love him so",I Don't know how to Love Him [From Jesus Christ Superstar],2001
Martin Yates,"I'm just the fastest thing you'll ever see.
That streak of lightning you just missed was me.
Don't stop now, we gotta keep it going all night.
Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!

You got no wheels, you don't know how it feels.

Rolling Stock! Rolling Stock!

You got no lovers if you got no wheels.
Don't try to show you can go faster than me.

This is my back view and it's all you'll see.
Don't stop now, we gotta keep it going all night.
Rolling Stock! We're Rolling Stock!
So get the motion in your wheels somehow.
The racing action's starting here and now.
Don't stop now, we gotta keep it all going night.

Martin Yates,"When your good nights have been said
And you are lying in bed
With the covers pulled up tight
And though you count every sheep
You get the feeling that sleep
Is gonna stay away tonight

That's when you hear it coming
That is when you hear the humming
Of the midnight train
Here again
Can't explain that midnight train
That midnight train

Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go

Come try to take me away
But bring me back before day
Light and fill the time between
Take me to everywhere
But don't abandon me there
Just want to say I've been

I believe in you completely
Though I may be dreaming sweetly
Of the

Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real? Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go

And if your there
And if you know
Then show me which way
I should go

Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real?  Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I don't want you to go

Starlight express, starlight express
Are you real?  Yes, or no?
Starlight express, answer me yes
I need you to be here",Starlight Express [From Starlight Express],2001
