Rock Kills Kid,"This feels like another dream
Trapped underneath my own routines
I tried to lift it off of me
I give up, I give up
I just sit and bleed

I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed

Arms and legs in between
Caught inside a stupid dream
Look for her, but cannot see
I give up, I give up
There's no time to believe

I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope
Is to realize

This feels like another dream
Everyone grabbed ahold of me
Pulled from every side of me
I give up, I give up
There's nothing left of me

Arms and legs inbetween
Caught inside a stupid dream
Look for her, but cannot see
I give up, I give up
There's no time to believe

I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope
Is to realize

I'm paralyzed...
I'm paralyzed...

I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle
And I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope
Is to realize

I'm paralyzed
Stuck in the middle and I'm paralyzed
I'm paralyzed
The only way to cope is to realize",Paralyzed,2006

Song lyrics 
Well I'm waking up again
Waking up to all of your sorrow
Your eyes possessing me
Everywhere I turn, they follow
Turn away, cause I have you to thank
For all the hatred that I feel
Cause I've become so dead and hollow

Why don't you raise your hands
You gotta be so proud
Raise your hands
And let me know
Why don't you raise your hands
I wanna hear it loud
Raise your hands
And let me know, you care

When will all this end
When will all this go away
You were always testing me
Just another game you play
Your eyes possessing me...

Why don't you raise your hands
You gotta be so proud
Raise your hands
And let me know
Why don't you raise your hands
I wanna hear it loud
Raise your hands
And let me know, you care

Why don't you raise your hands
You gotta be so proud
Raise your hands
And let me know
Why don't you raise your hands
I wanna hear it loud
Raise your hands
And let me know, you care

Oh, oh, oh...
Why don't you 
Why don't you
Oh, oh, oh...
Why don't you

Oh, oh, oh...
 
 ",Raise Your Hands,2006
Rock Kills Kid,"Bend my head in cellophane
Come on baby, ease the pain
Don't sit there, all tied up
In your regret, regret
Live your life, and think for yourself
So, don't hold back because of me
Be the things you wanna be
But you still want, to stick around
Oh you should, oh you should

All around, things are moving
And lying's such a waste
Turn around, face the world
And you will find your place
And you will, run like hell
And you will, run like hell

There's nothing you can say to me
That wouldn't make me wanna see you
Out there, taking a chance on the world
The world, spending your life wanting to see
What's, just around the corner for
You and all the open doors
That pass you by, you stick around
Oh you should, oh you should

All around, things are moving
And lying's such a waste
Turn around, face the world
And you will find your place
And you will, run like hell
And you will, run like hell

Ooh...
Ooh...

All around, things are moving
And lying's such a waste
Turn around, face the world

Can't feel better than this

Regulators
We regulate any stealing of his property
And we damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street,
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep!
Regulators! Mount up!

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice so I said ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride, and said ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats so I said ""I'm stuck.""

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won't'cha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin' 
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now Nate got the freaks
And that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up back up cause it's on
N A T E and me
The Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought 
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
The Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ""oh I like your size.""
She said ""my car's broke down and you seem real nice,
Would ya let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[Warren G]
I'm tweaking
Into a whole new era
G-Funk
Step to this
I dare ya
Funk
On a whole new level

The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

[Warren G]
If you know like I know
You don't want to step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangster twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate",The Regulators,2004

But I got in too deep and I could not pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bough us two tickets on that Coast City bus

Now our luck may have died and out love may
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything dies
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies
Someday comes back

Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers and
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm
Gonna do a little favor for him
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday
Comes back

What's up b-lo?
Hey man, niggas tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
And Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the snipers?
Man I'm talking about us and every motherfucking body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up coming to you
Snipers and do or die, rap-a-lot mafia
From the chi, here it go like this

I went from zip locks and baking soda
To smoking herb, cooking 'ola
Never looking overnight success
Cause I want a rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scene like po-po's
In the four door chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop snipers snap a lot
Putting down with rap-a-lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to chi

Ain't no success even if you crying for it
Them niggas alive know it, they dying for it
Even them niggas that kill, get caught, and strive for it
I strive for it
That's why I sixteen years and a positive
Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm taking it
See niggas faking it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't making it

Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalking from the end of my ? gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the snipers ? knew ya
Stressed out, had me feeling left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since ? to non-believers, overnight

[Chorus: x2]
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight

Living it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See ? got a death wish
But do or die and snipers , represent chi-town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doing this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells goin' drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from rap-a-lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, do or die, pick a piece snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart
Beauregard this industry from backyards to owing Lexus cars
So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight

Running out they mails
About the loved ones that said they love me, but didn't care
Do roc scare? with the fucking niggas who grounding me
It's roc on the block, 45 glock cocked
Finna pop these niggas and they drop

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Cause peace don't come cheap when you paying like cab fare
Yea, and, war is a beast right?
Looking at the stars like we used to do all night
And, I'm praying on 'em all hoping that you are alright

Life was simple, just work and pay bills off
Now you far away fighting, feeling like Bill Maher
These real times, tryna understand what you kill for
How it feel heavy like the weight of steel door

Reverse roles they use to hold all of us all down

Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying you’re even harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Nigga don't be a statistic
How your main bitch sending me pictures?
Feeling futuristic might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah nigga, I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If your a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch
Yeah, and it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back

This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole world, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on nice
Illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like, it's cold
Young CO, L.E. call me Neo
And If I ain't the one I'm the prototype
Insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog eat dog world nigga we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You lil pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy, nigga
Ask for it nice, now it's gimmie nigga
Once poor now it's plenty, nigga
Still want more, no Demi, nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got penny's for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught

On MTV and 106 in some of the freshest fits
But I ain't focused on these clothes, I got some goals to hit
Finished the album then I'm working on a movie script
Kenny I got you, and these niggas say they knots is thick
My Goyard got one card that'll take your bitch

In neighborhoods where I ain't worried 'bout no homicide
Me and my niggas won't fall victim to no kind of pride
Know when to stay humble, niggas thought I was sign and dive
I just started working on tours four and five
Now watch me travel, never tattle, snitches slowly die
You heard it before, but, real niggas only multiply
Strengthen my numbers, friend or foe, the flow ain't got a flaw

Racquetball without those gems, magic gets made when the lights get dim
And shorty ass fat but her waist real slim, might get a Evo or a X5M
Roll with the winners where the winters ain't cold
We chasing all the heat while we traveling the globe

Into every situation tried to get some ends about it
At 17 my bitch was 35, I had a vet
It's how I'm living and that boy ain't even made a check
They ask me how much would I put up on the placing bets
I would bet everything, I knew I'll always be a king
Shorty fell in love, it was just a fling
She be in the lab, show a nigga sing
Home girl hating on her, she might intervene

I be posted like I’m 7’4

Just like club LIV when that confetti fall
I fell in love with the game, damn it's a distant love
I let her see it just to tell her friends what she saw
200 mill how I get it, damn I can't be far
I keep my sneakers low cut

Never seen a square nigga with a happy home

Wind through the window blew the candle out
No lights, many cold nights

Old girl lookin' at me with the blank face
Made it off a prayer and a saint's grace

Probably on tour for the one four
Sucka tried to give me life plus one more

In the middle of a storm, never touchin' the brake
I drove like a bat outta hell
Down that lonely ol' four lane

With the bright lights of Houston just fadin' behind
My tires tearin' up the road toward the state line
I was leavin' the great Lone Star state
That I loved for good

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee
'Cause wherever she is boy that's home for me
Don't get me wrong

Love's the only reason, I'd ever leave Texas
She's the only reason, I'd ever stay gone

Just about Baton Rouge, I was changin' my mind
Thinkin' 'bout all the things I'd be leavin' behind
Like a Red River sunrise
And the stars on a Galveston night

For the love of a good woman who lives in Louisiana
On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair
And when I get there, I'm gonna get down on one knee
'Cause wherever she is boy that's home for me
Don't get me wrong

Love's the only reason, I'd ever leave Texas
An' she's the only reason, I'd ever stay gone

Like a long lonely night
Wonderin' where I'd spend the rest of my life
Gone like an old tumbleweed
Rollin' his way to a place he finally call home

On a bayou by the river with the moon in her hair

Rockin' Dopsie & The Twisters,"A long time ago, yeah
Before you was born dude
When I was still single
And life was great

I held this job as a traveling salesman
That kept me moving from state to state
Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana

Wondering where a city boy could go
To get a little conversation
Drink a little red wine
Catch a little bit of those Cajun girls
Dancing to Zydeco

Along come a young girl
She's pretty as a prayerbook
Sweet as an apple on Christmas day
I said good gracious can this be my luck

If that's my prayerbook
Lord let us pray

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
State of Louisiana
Wondering what a city boy could do
To get her in a conversation

Drink a little red wine
Dance to the music of Clifton Chenier
The King of the Bayou

Well, that was your mother
And that was your father
Before you was born dude
When life was great

You are the burden of my generation
I sure do love you
But let's get that straight

Well, I'm standing on the corner of Lafayette
Across the street from The Public
Heading down to the Lone Star Cafe
Maybe get a little conversation

Drink a little red wine
Standing in the shadow of Clifton Chenier

And when I found about the trouble I was causing
It only made me act even worse.

I played a lot of horrible songs
Yeah, a lot of them were bad
And when I listen back to the way I used to play,
It only made me even more mad

I have left for you behind 
For you don't belong to me
You heart belongs to someone else
 
Why should I keep loving you
When I know that you're not true
And why should I call your name 
When you're to blame for making me blue
 
Don't you remember the day 
That you went away and left me
I was so lonely 
Prayed for you only, my love

Rockin' Wildcats,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,2006

And let's get together tonight 
I got some money in my jeans 
And I'm really gonna spend it right 
Been a-doin' my homework all week long 
now the house is empty the folks are gone 
C'mon everybody
Well my baby's number one 
But I'm gonna dance with three or four 
And the house'll be shakin' 
From my bare feet slapping the floor 
When you hear that music you can't sit still 
If your brother won't rock then your sister will 
C'mon everybody 

Well we'll really have a party but we gotta put a guard outside 
If the folks come home I'm afraid they gonna have my hide 
There'll be no more movies for a week or two 
No more runnin' 'round with the usual crew 
Who cares C'mon everybody

Rockmaster Scott,"Hey girls, hey boys
Superstar DJs here we go!

Somebody say 'ho' (ho)
Say 'ho, ho' (ho, ho)
Now somebody, anybody, everybody scream 

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you're not a square from Delaware
And you got on clean underwear
And your momma ain't on welfare
Somebody say 'oh, yeah' (oh, yeah)
Oh, yeah! (oh, yeah)

Well DJ's spinning on the wheels of steel
Like it ain't no thing, cause he is for real
He's cuttin' the jams with a wave of his hand
And it sounds so fresh it'll make you stand
You hear the highs in your eyes, the bass in your face
This super DJ can rock the place
You hear bass, highs, tremblin' tones
He can even cut the jams without the headphones

Well Stick Rick is rockin' to the break of day
Makin' all the fly girls that wanna give me a play
Now if your DJ rocks to the break of day
Let me hear you say 'DJ' (DJ)
DJ (DJ)

We're gonna rock to the break of day
Say 'Keep on rockin' it' (keep on rockin' it)
Keep on rockin' it (keep on rockin' it)
Come on y'all keep on rockin' it (keep on rockin' it, keep on rockin' it)

Heh

Now clap your hands and stomp your feet
While the DJ scratch to the funky beat
He's makin' you move until your body sweat
He's even givin' you more than you supposed to get
Now twist and turn and let your body burn
And show everybody what you just learned
Let's all get together and form a crowd
While the DJ play it, nice and loud
Now everybody in the place to be
Let's all get together, repeat after me
Say, 'rock the house' (rock the house)
Say, 'rock the house' (rock the house)
Everybody say, 'turn it out' (turn it out)
Come on turn it out (turn it out)

Keep on rockin' it (keep on rockin' it)

DJs now, I'm coming strong
You better take my advice
Because it lasts this long
Is rocking the house
One job well done
For any DJ in this world to be someone
To make a fella say ""ho"" the girls get loose
And if the crowd respond to that, the jock got juiced
Enough pull to make some cash
'Cause it's all about duds
And they can jam-pack the place
No matter how much you spend
So if you wanna make some cash or be a DJ
You must rock the house right and know what to play

Now everybody in the place to be
Let's all get together, repeat after me
Say, 'oh' (oh)
Say, 'oh, ho' (oh, ho)
Once again I like it (I like it)
Come on I love it (I love it)
One more time I like it (I like it)
Come on I love it (I love it) ha!

All the fellas in the house if ya wanna break dance
Say, 'break dance' (break dance)
Say, 'break dance' (break  dance)
Come on
'Break break, break, break' (break break, break, break)
Cut it up DJ

This DJ cut different ways
So let me hear you cut it, DJ

Let's make some noise (ho)
Let's make some noise come on
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire

Plz forgive him lord, even a thug pray, but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me


Told me it was destiny, came to me 1 night I was dreamin, dese crazy visions I kept on seeing, all the money and clothes, all
The drugs that I sold from the life that I chose, but it could be karma, cause all these things u do it could haunt cha, if u do it wrong it come right back
On ya, all the money and clothes, all the drugs that I sold could be the reason u ain't livin tomorrow.

I remember I flexed a nigga for a couple chips, juss being greedy man 
I ain't even need dat shit, country nigga, he know me from a peice of meat,
But I had to do it to him man dat nigga was supa sweet, 
next week u won't believe what happned to me, dem folk came I took a loss on like 400g's, 
dat lil 100 stack cost me 300 strong, but it's my fault because dat shit I did was dead wrong.

Kim and Janet best friends
And they been that way for years
Janet single but see Kim got a nigga and two kids
Janet babysit her kids
Janet loves them like they're hers
Janet needs a place to live
So Kim let her come live with them
Kim knows her just like her fam
But what Kim don't understand
Is that Janet's not her kin
Janet's not even her friend
Janet's tryna seek revenge
Janet's got a plan
Janet's still holding a grudge from back when her and Kim were ten
She devised a perfect plan
Janet's gon sleep with her man
She lays naked in the kitchen wait for him to come in
He walks in the door like damn
You know a man gon be a man
In the mist of all of that he must forgot about Kim
Kim bust's in on them
Janet stands there with her grin
Kim fussin, cussin, hollerin, screamin going straight nuts on them
Kim crying out like damn
Jan I thought you were my friend
Janet said, ""You remember you took my boyfriend back when we were ten."" Damn

Michael real cool nigga but he just not getting money (how)
Drought came around
He fixed up niggas for some dummies
Now he ballin like a dog
Every night he in the club
Throwing money, popping bottles, flexing hard
He don't give a fuck
Then one night he met this girl
Finest girl he ever saw
He say I never seen before
She say I'm here from Arkansas
They kicked it off a couple months
She fucked and sucked him like a pole
He say I love your dirty drawers baby I never let you go
Year later they're still together
Now he feeling like he love her
So he let her in his business
Cause he felt like he could trust her
She sitting in the kitchen while he busting down dem bricks
She thumbing through the check
He swear he got a gangster bitch
Well he don't know about this bitch
Cause everything she say a lie
Man this xxxxx ain't who she say she is
This xxxxx is FBI
Man this game a dirty game
Man be well for the tricks

I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun

Take a message to Mary
But don't say I'm in a jam
You can tell her that I had to see the world
Tell her that my ship set sail
You can say she'd better not wait for me
But don't tell her I'm in jail, oh don't tell her I'm in jail.

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her what I've done
Please, don't mention the stage coach
And the shot from a carried gun
You better tell her that I had to change my plans
And cancel out the wedding-day
But please, don't mention the lonely cell
Where I'm gonna pine away, until my dying-day.

Take a message to Mary
But don't tell her all you know

Rockpile,"Now I can remember like it was only yesterday
Love was young and foolish like a little child at play
But oh how lovers change, I never dreamed how easily
'cause now I'm just a shadow of the boy I used to be

And when I write the book about my love
It will be about a man who's torn in half
About his hopes and ambitions wasted through the years
The pain will be written on every page in tears
When I write the book about my love

I was a fool to myself when I kept on runnin' around
And I fared little better when I tried settlin' down
Maybe some magic moment, I've never known one, not for long
For all too soon the magic is in a moment gone

And when I write the book about my love
It'll be a heartbreaking story about love and luck
When I get down on the pages all I felt
It will make the hardest-hearted of critics' hearts melt
When I write the book about my love

When I was young love was fun and I was so happy, I looked so good and I dressed so snappy
Two-tone shoes on my feet big old smile on my face, as I moved and grooved all over the place
Now I'm down in the heels my complexion is bad
'cause my love life is sadder than sad

And when I write the book about my love
It'll be a pop publication, tougher than tough

It will shoot to the top of the best-sellers list

But I forgot the way they did ya boy
That's why I'm never on the streets without my plastic toy

Torture me until I tell em about my man and point the dope house out

Rocky Gresset,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polkadots and Moonbeams,2008
Rocky Gresset,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

There is nothing for me but to love you,

Tearing my fear apart

It touches my foolish heart.

Me and Frankie and Jimmy and some Italian guy
We were singing oldies but they were newies then
And today when I play my old 45's I remember when
We practiced in a subway,in a lobby or a hall
Crowded in a doorway singing ""do waps"" to the wall
And if we went to a party and they wouldn't let us sing
We'd lock ourselves in the bathroom and nobody could get in
'Cause we were looking for an echo an answer to our sound
A place to be in harmony a place we almost found ooooh
And the girls would gather 'round us and our heads would really swell
We'd sing songs by the moonglows, the harptones and the dells
And when we sang sincerely, we really sang it high
And even though it was falsetto we almost reached the sky
We've sung a lot of changes since 1955
And a lot of bad arrangements we've tried to harmonise
Now they've turned into oldies but they were newies then

To push me, to push me over the edge, over the edge

In my closet and I'm reminded of
The greenest eyes that ever burned from behind

Neither could have known the plans that were in store
I'm seeing our home again
You're decorating
The walls with pieces from the waters of your shipwrecked past
Trying to make sense of how two of the darkest lives
Came together to give this world light
A world that's cracking and leaking all around me
I can spend my day knowing my love for my lady
Every song we hear, was written just for you and for me
We can show up late and leave early
I catch a hint of how you smelt

So I'll go this alone
Though we have always been together

Narrow let my steps be

Of tragedies but my God willing

You can trust me too



",Holding Onto Water,2001
Rocky Votolato,"I guess that's it for this boy
He'll never write again
Something tells me I've been here before
And so long to apocalyptic visions in this head
I'm going on to bigger and better things

Cause I'm tired
Like they were tired
Like a Mother, she knows what tired means
At the end of my century

We are all the authors of our own destruction
Help me to take what has been done here
And put this into focus
I've got a vision that's feeding on me
This dirty ambition you see
Call it lack of perception

Problems lie in how we look upon everything
Or is it that we haven't learned to see
That simple vision with two eyes shows us nothing
And nothing's quite the color that it seems

I'm going crazy like they went crazy
Going slowly - no much quicker than you think
At the end of my century



",Like a Mother,2001
Rocky Votolato,"You're in the kitchen, I stare at our bed frame
I'm hearing your voice through the door
I will work my fingers to bones
To find us a way out of here

I buried my past down in Texas
Where I'm from, to live here with you tonight
I know the morning light
Will come like it always does
To tear us apart
But I don't want to think about that right now
I just want to sit here and remember that little beach town
How the screendoor reflected the water
And your eyes in the picture we took
It left me with scars that are there for good

When we hit the bigtime
My darlin' I mean something
Like nothing the worlds ever seen
They'll put us on the Silver Screen
A Silver Lining - with clouds that forgot how to rain
The day we finally escape
Is all I'm thinking about right now
I just want to sit here and remember that little beach town
How the screendoor reflected the water
And your eyes in the picture we took
It left me with scars that are there for good
It burned holes in me that were permanent



",Like Silver,2001
Rocky Votolato,"Everyone will sing songs of lost mothers
Every debt will be paid in the end
Lives lived will be brought back into focus
As each one looses the place where it begins

Please tell them I said I'm sorry
I knew not all that I did
This message carried hopefully will carry
Much more weight than words of men down here

Feel your losses you'll know that it's October
Stretched out short days eat you from within
Lives lived brought back homeward
I'm leaving home again

Please tell me it's not the last time
Though that day awaits keep it far from here
There's still much work we've to get done
Your lighthouse is burning my travels clean



",October,2001
Rocky Votolato,"Never let go those years of discovery
There's only so much a pair of arms can carry
Embrace these years of necessity
Put your mouth around your double edged sword
Your unhappiness is what you are
The same nervousness that makes me good at what I do
Is my enemy today and will be my whole life through
I'll spend it with you
I have climbed a mountain
You've swam in every ocean
You've heard a million songs and never tried to sing
I've read hundreds of books and never wrote anything
I love you -- Just the same




",Swallowing Swords,2001
Rocky Votolato,"Thank you for leading me home that I
May one day return to walk through those fields again
I buried a treasure and made a map
So I'd always find my way back
I guess that don't matter now

Time has had a different effect on you
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
Life is rich and ripe with
Thoughts unsung, and songs unheard

I'm telling our stories to myself
I'm trying to make since of me and you
Summertime after our family broke
Was a turning point - so many things there to learn

Time has had a different effect on you
Look at you you're blue black and through being that kid I knew
I hope it's not too late that I
Tell you I love you and I always have



",Treasure Chest,2001
Rocky Votolato,"Everyday has a song
Some get sung while others go unheard
Take a good look around
It'll never be this way again so try to remember
Dylan, Drake, even Schwarzenbach
How you became heroes I'll never forget
It's not easy to look at your heart
Not many men know how and even fewer speak out

So if you know exactly what the sunset looks like
You'll be lucky if you don't loose your eyes

""To Hell with that""
She said ""I'll look deep and hard
It's what my God gave me these eyes for""
I'll look just as hard as her
Hell even harder I'll join her as a miner
Digging deep till I'm blind,
Without eyes still seeing but always singing out

Wrapped around my body tangled up in my ribcage
We just need to find songs we want to hear
The sounds been making my blue eyes go gray all these years

I'm suffocating now
I overdosed somehow on my own medicine
I know all to well

I'll get my mind straight
That ought to hold them off, just long enough

I've been fucked up, a nervous wreck as long as I can remember
But you write the story so pick up the pen
Draw me pretty pictures of everything I hope to live

We grew up way too fast
Forget about the past
Nothing can change that now
You'll learn to like the pain

To break the secret spell
That would open up the door and let me in

Its flowing from the purest well to ever give water
It spills out into an ocean where the sharks are circling
A carnival of counterfeits has no room for something real

Arrogance and ego wrapped around every word
Shouted from the pulpit as a judgment to control
These were my roots my seed was thrown in shallow soil
I grew into the thorn bushes to be scorched by the sun

The smell of the gasoline mixed in with the trees
When my faith is strong I know my strength
The threats will be screamed when the vultures fell threatened

For a man to play with his daughter

Rocky Votolato,"If I asked real sweet, would you take a ride with me?
Drive down streets that no one else has ever seen
Red bucket seats with a stereo from 1953

I knew you before you were born
And I've seen an ending worth waiting for
Under blankets and maps to keep us warm

Mile markers made out of rows of white birch trees
Lead me to black velvet dressed in silver rings
Just like you and me some things are meant to be

I knew you before you were born
And I've seen an ending worth waiting for
Under blankets and maps to keep us warm, keep us warm

The paper moon in the tree branch blue sky
Is cold and brittle on an October night
Dead weather vines that grew on concrete steam lamp lights

I knew you before you were born
And I've seen an ending worth waiting for
Under blankets and maps to keep us warm, keep us warm
Keep us warm, keep us warm

",Before You Were Born,2007
Rocky Votolato,"Christmas parties and all night fights
I remember you sweet-talking to me beneath the strung up lights
Those days are gone now I know I had everything to do with that
'Cause I've never been afraid of dying, never done much to avoid it
These memories still keep me up at night

On my way back from a place, no recovery
And I'm bleeding on my knuckles again, fighting in a fight I can't win
Broken teeth and broken nose and ten years at the bottom of a bottle
Will you help me find my way back home?

The halls in this place you can hear 'em scream
'Cause they had to watch and listen to the people
And the voices of what they'd seen
I can't hear anything and all I can see is a memory of your smile
Your necklace, pistol locket on a silver chain
Hold on too tight, you'll lose everything

On my way back from a place, no recovery
And I'm bleeding on my knuckles again, fighting in a fight I can't win
Broken teeth and broken nose and ten years at the bottom of a bottle
Will you help me find my way back home?

",Lilly White,2007
Rocky Votolato,"All the possibilities
Things you can pick up and look beneath
Just watch your step
Don't fall between the blanks in your memories

There's an anchor sinking in the sound
Of a sense of lack that follows you around
Years went by but I know
It don't matter what you think of me

I'm awake, don't let me go back to sleep
Like a fugitive who just quit running
You found out there's no escape

Some mistakes can't be undone
It'll never be like it was
And wishing for it only makes it worse

There's some demons waiting down South
Some kind of confederate ghost that holds me close
Shows me the way to go until I'm sure I'm lost

I built a workshop to find myself
Where I can dig in the corners climbing spider webs
It's a Polaroid cemetery of every look you've ever given me

I'm awake, don't let me go back to sleep
Like a fugitive who just quit running
You found out there's no escape

Some mistakes can't be undone
It'll never be like it was
And wishing for it only makes it worse

Keep on writing to capture a feeling
It's an outline of a real connection
Treat your desires as what they are
Imposter's and a lonely invitation

Some mistakes can't be undone
It'll never be like it was
And wishing for it only makes it worse

",Red Dragon Wishes,2007
Rocky Votolato,"I hear you call me, branches break in the wind
And through the leaves and concrete
You're gonna grow into something that death can't steal

A garden that gives, sprouts come up glowing
Fruits of jade and golden, silver trees to mark the legacy
Of a life that finally learned what this means

The invisible choir sings you a voiceless lesson
So you'll always remember what grew out of decisions
That death can't steal, lives that learned to give

When it seemed there was nothing
Oh, how much more it meant to those
Around we go there's a rhythm soft and slow
You'll always hear the choir if you listen close

But not anymore, I found out how to beat it

The highs are the ice in the branches on a mountain top
You didn't know who's hiding in your smile
The lows are the devil's tears, rain falling in the sunlight

Time is a debt, son, it's something you can't call your own
But not anymore I found out how to keep it
Who I used to be is just a sea of evenings
Now I'm the morning light that will always keep you from sleeping

Rocky Votolato,"The moonlight is shining down
Through the factories on the shipyard waters
And in a winter midnight Sideways moon sets
On the memory of what's gone missing

The sidewalk stares up silent
I'm just a shadow slowly disappearing
A ghost of something real that used to exist
A memory of what's gone missing

Why do you keep running?
The pace is hurried but you're never closer
To what it was you thought you wanted
It all keeps changing, now something else is missing
Who knows where?

I knew our time was running out
So by the kitchen window back at your house
I ended up wasted on whiskey straight
And filled the ashtray up with your secrets

You were an anchor with high cheekbones
I was a soldier with broken fingers
You ended up wasted on cheap champagne
Celebrating everything that's missing

Why do you keep running
The pace is hurried but you're never closer
To what it was you thought you wanted
It all keeps changing and now something else is missing

Familiar madness
It all keeps changing and now something else is missing
Hey, yeah

",Whiskey Straight,2007
Rocky Votolato,"That smoke, it moves just like sweet velvet
It lures me in till I'm drinking to kill the pain
Trying to stay out of a fight but the liquor, it won't let me
The only thing it's killing now is me

Your darkest eyes and pale skin are always on me
Black fingernail polish is chipping off again
On my mind just like a death threat or maybe death wish
Kill me anytime I'm ready for it

No one else was ever half this beautiful
No two hearts were ever half what ours was whole, whole
Desperate like the rain on your midnight window sill
You said I love you and I know that's what you meant
I know that's what you meant

There's a Holy Grail of a simple life led somewhere
In the blankets of trees between you and Tennessee
St. Peter's in a river running out to Homer's sea
Where the leaves can break your heart
And the waves might wash me clean

No one else was ever half this beautiful
No two hearts were ever half what ours was whole, whole
Desperate like the rain on your midnight window sill
You said I love you and I know that's what you meant
Hey, I know that's what you meant

Can't tell no lie
There's something going on
Standing in the front line

Bang in the danger zone

No longer should we hesitate
For we could leave it much too late
It's time that we decided our fate
We can't read those signs much longer

Before we sink without a trace

Rod Argent,"Last night she called across the 
Northern seas from home
And told me about the morning that was breaking
And the love she kept inside
The California sun may have me on the run, but
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies
Home where my love keeps a song sung for me
Home where my thoughts keep on wandering
No matter where I might be

I've flown the world and watched
The sunset down in old Jamaica
I've crossed the mountains and the desserts
Where the western heroes sung
And I'll be back someday
As soon as I can get away
Those memories will never fade away, but
Home is where my heart lies
Far beneath the grey skies
Home where my love keeps a song sung for me
Home where my thoughts keep on wandering
No matter where I might be

I wanna be back home again
In the land where I belong
I wanna see my love again soon
Sitting in the evening sun

These days I won't ever regret
I've been so happy here, and yet
There is one thing I can't forget

And deep grim lodges
Housed in siblings' far off game chambers
Comes the rain, oh Lord
And it reflects my tears, which originally grew in mirrors
Oh windows of illusion

And the rain fell, like ball bearings on a roulette wheel
Eliminating the future
And I saw ghosts, they were children
Running through a cedar boulevard
Into a wood
They came to a gate and looked inside
It was raining
And they heard a soft moaning, warm and plural

And the rain fell, on the lake, in the vast garden
Faster and faster
It was dark
Suddenly children were everywhere
Gliding along the lake, running through the trees
The stars arranged themselves like an illuminated skipping rope
The trees were rich and high, and mingled with the stars
As jewels complement skin

Come, jump across the lake
Into he branches
Higher than the clouds

Let the rain fall
From secret passageways
And oak casements come these spirits
Out of their sleepy silver webs
They play with the forgotten animals at night
And patter on our windows when we sleep
Only the rain has such soft fingers
Only the rain",Only the Rain,2002

Shelter me should I run for cover

To the black clouds in the West

In the sky that's not the night
Hey, there's a rain cloud there
That's shutting out the light

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain

The cold wind touched the beach
The sun we left in London
Is away beyond our reach 

Hey, I said darling:
It seems a waste of time
Hey, all I do is sit 
And drink our Spanish wine 

What do I tell you, it's always the same:
When you run for the sun, you catch the rain 

Of all the tales of Granada 
They tell of Islam's run
They lived beneath the Moorish lord
Beneath a Moorish sun

Oh, how we yearned to turn 
Our faces to that glare
When down from the mountains
Came the rain to soak our hair

Its gonna be good to have you back again with me

Come up and getcha, saved up for the train fare money
Kiss and make-up and it will be so nice

Tight around her glass
She only needs to be alone
She knows this mood will pass
To realize that she was strong
And he too weak to stay
And to realize that she is better off this way

Brief candles in her mind
Bright and tiny gems of memory
Brief candles burn so fine
Leaves a light inside where she can see
What makes it all worthwhile
Her sadness makes her smile

His alone girl fades away
Left out on a limb
Finds he needs her more because
She's no more need for him
He understood so very well
The things she had to say
Soon he'll understand that he is better off this way

Brief candles in his mind
Bright and tiny gems of memory
Brief candles burn so fine
Leaves a light inside where he can see
What makes it all worthwhile
His sadness makes him smile

In the corner see his face
The man just sips his drink
Not one feeling does he show
Far too numb to think
He does not say a single word
No word of love to say
Maybe he will soon believe he's better off this way

I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

I need you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
And if its quite alright
I need you baby
To warm the lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say its okay

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing.
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya, say do you remember
Ba de ya, dancing in September
Ba de ya, never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love that we shared in September.
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today

For over the noise, the talk and the smoke, I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a joke,
I walk in a room, a party of all, come sit over here, somebody will call
A drink for monsieur, a drink for us all, but how many times, I sat and recall.

Are the apple trees, blossoms in the breeze that we walk among,
Lying in the hay, games we used to play, while the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday when the world was young.
Wherever I go they mention my name, and that in itself is some sort of fame,

Come by for a drink, we're having a game, wherever I go, I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company's fine,
There's laughter and lights and glamour and wine.
And beautiful girls and summer's been mine, but often my eyes see a different shine.

On our backs sweet lie, looking at the sky, till the stars were strung

Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,
Being simpler souls.

I am of the latter brand;
All I want to do,
Is to find a spot of land,
And live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of veiw that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

Goin' home, and I'm running' home, down the Gasoline Alley where I was born

Should the blood run cold in my veins

Rod Sinclair,"Down on his knees he sees the devil weeping/whinging his tongue
Mr. Cadillac doesn't even know he's been fighting his own
He's been trying shooting all the angels/devils inside
Playing around with the good and the evil in his mind
Alone in the desert and cold so cold

Driving back to the 10 house city something is wrong
He found the killer weapon in his car on the floor
Delusional the blood lost paint his mind in a cave
Feeding monsters in the back of his head
Killer, ripper, who are you
Take a look into the mirror then you will know
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

Welcome to a world of chaos, you've been caught in the light
Saw the door to the 10 house tale 7 shots in the night

Standing in the dark and shaking my own hand for a while
Saw the angel/devil vanished out in the light
Breathing new air for a day to begin
Soulless body with an empty shell
Killer, ripper, who are you
Take a look into the mirror then you will know
Heaven fire up my blood I'm waiting for something that's better

The price was high to pay and the memories are all crying like a child
A reason for all the blood that leaked, and a call up for the wild

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine

If you really need me just reach out and touch me
Come on honey tell me so, tell me so baby

He's acting shy looking for an answer
Come on honey let's spend the night together
Now hold on a minute before we go much further
Give me a dime so I can phone my mother

They got each other, neither one's complaining

On a subject on which I'm well-versed
Though I'm still as dumbfounded as the first time I found her
It's either a blessing or a curse
Although I cannot offer solutions
It would be reckless of me to try
'Cause it's mystified man ever since time began
But hold on to your hat and I'll try

Love is like a burning arrow
It can pierce the coldest heart
Love is warm, love is patient
And the craziest thing you'll ever start
All right

I recall when I was a young man
A day I'm never allowed to forget
There was a girl that I met who I dreamed I would wed
Forever our lives entwined
She said you gotta stop worrying about the future
You know we're far too young for that
I wanna spread my wings like a willow in the spring
I never saw her pretty face again

Love is life, love is yearning
It does not boast, but speaks the truth
Love is fair and knows no boundaries
And the craziest thing you'll ever do
Oh, yeah

I wish you well in all of your travels
And may you find what you're searching for
It'll hit you like thunder when you find one another
And stay in your heart forevermore

Love is blind, love is tender
And the craziest thing you'll ever do

Rod Stewart,"Ever since I was a young boy,
I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must have played them all.
But I ain't seen nothing like him
In any amusement hall
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball!

He's a pin ball wizard
There has got to be a twist.
A pin ball wizard,
S'got such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it? I don't know!
What makes him so good?'

He ain't got no distractions
Can't hear those buzzers and bells,
Don't see lights a flashin'
Plays by sense of smell.
Always has a replay,
'N' never tilts at all
That deaf dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pin ball.

I thought I was
The Bally table king.
But I just handed
My pin ball crown to him.

Even on my favorite table
He can beat my best.
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper fingers
Never seen him fall
That deaf dumb and blind kind
Sure plays a mean pin ball!!!",Pin Ball Wizard,1972
Rod Stewart,"Fare the well my brother, please don't stand in my way
I'm going down to that dirty town
No matter what you say
You fooled me and you ruled me, and you played in every part
I gotta go, it's no use me stayin' home

Goodbye my sister, please don't let me see you cry
Gonna be a star some day, no matter what they say
And when you hear the crowds, all callin' and shouting out my name
Until then, my little friend, I'll be unsatisfied

So long sweet Melinda, don't forget that you're my girl
Gonna dress you fine, and if you give me time
Make you proud like I said I would
And if the Champs Elysee's no fallacy, if I find the world looks like it should
Candy cars, movie stars, street bars, then I could stay a while

Well I love you
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome
And I'll miss you all
Even tho' you're tryin' to hold me back

Farewell all my family, don't you know I mean you so well
Please appreciate I must make a break
Just to see what I can do
The stage is set so understand, I can't hide in the wings no more
I've got to go now it's no use me staying home

All I can say is I love you
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome
And I think I'm always gonna miss you
And I love you always
I think I'm always gonna miss ya

Rod Stewart,"Went downtown on the two forty-nine,
Playin' for recognition of the New York town.
See, me and the boys got a rock 'n' roll band,
They were so damn good, gonna lift up the man.

Well, we got ups, we got downs,
We got just so high 'til the sun goes down.
Got the ego, can be abused,
I got my two-toned shoes,
And I can sing the blues.

[Chorus:]
Look out, kids, it's the F. B. I.
We got a problem, you keep me high.
Put on your clothes, take the smile off your face
And put your money where your mouth is or get out this place.

New York town is a meanass town,
We got a thousand bands singin' underground.
Way down in New Orleans it's the same old thing,
Emotional music, a merry old thing.

Old King Soul, he finally gave us a jolt,
He played the vibes 'til nine and read from ten to four.
He played upside down, he played inside out,
Then a uniform band he was thrown into jail.

[Chorus]

Gettin' hungry I know little woman,
Can't get a smell 'cause my nose is blocked.
I'm so high, I can't believe it,
Hotel dogs are knockin' on my door.

Two night of singin' nearly out on the end,
Left the two parts red, oh what a square.
As soon as the man, there's no sweeter song,
Listen, McCartney, we're the band on the run.

Remember the song, wasn't it fun, 'cause it was just one of those things.

But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.

I said goodbye to money, I don't owe no alimony.
I paid my dues and payroll cues, gonna leave it all up to you.
I'll take my dog and my car, the best friends I've found so far,
And I'll keep goin' with the mornin' sun, singin' the same old song.

But it was alright for an hour; it was alright for a day.
But it did not last, it did not last till the weekend,
And I packed my bags and moved right away.

Well I guess you needed somebody to open each and every door
With a large amount in the Swiss account to give you thrills and nothing more.
But my Volkswagen is hardly a custom built Ferarri.
You want first class but I pump gas, so I'll get on out of your way.

Rod Stewart,"Day after day I'm more confused;
I look for the light in the pouring rain.
You know that's a game that I hate to lose.
I'm feelin' the strain; ain't it a shame?

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.
Give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time;
Don't understand the things that I do.
Cause the world outside looks so unkind.
Now I'm countin' on you to carry me through.

Oh, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.
Yeah, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.

And when my mind is free no melody can move me.
When I'm feelin' blue guitars are comin' through to soothe me.

And thanks for the joy that you've given me;
I want you to know I believe in your song,
And rhythm and rhyme and harmony.
You help me along, makin' me strong.

Give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away, yeah
Give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away.

Oh, give me the beat, boys, to soothe my soul;

Rod Stewart,"If I ever feel the light again shining down on me,
I don't have to tell you what a welcome it will be.
I felt the light before but I let it slip away,
But I still keep on believing that it'll come back some day.

It's not the spotlight, it's not the cam'ra light,
It's not the street lights of some old street of dreams.
It ain't the moonlight, not even the sunlight,
But I've seen it shining in your eyes and you know what I mean.

Some times I try to tell myself the light was never real,
Just a fantasy that used to be, the way I used to feel.
But you and I know better, even though it's been so long,

First encounter, hardly the best.

But I would not change a thing

""I still love you.""

Didn't I try to impress you,
But my old Chevy van kept breakin' down.
And my one room over the drugstore,
We watched the neon lights go out over town.

And some nights we'd go out dancin',
Come home singin' by the Erie Canal.

Guess I'll always love you all my life

You can keep your Streisands
Bardots and Lorens
You're my everything
But now you're my end 
It may be over
But just before I go 
I can make a new start
But I can't mend a broken heart

So when I read about you
In all the national press
On the arm of so and so
I may get depressed 
Cause I tried to love you
But didn't fit in 
I came on the dust
I'll leave on the wind

I'm a fool for you baby
My pride won't let me stay
I'm a fool for you honey 
I'll come back any day
I'm a fool for you baby

Rod Stewart,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel

Or see you paralyzed in both your thighs

Thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now
Every night for a year I've slept alone
Cold, damp room looks worse than me, no, no, no

Got a fear of death that creeps on every night
I know I won't die soon, but then again I might
Water down the drain, I'm wasting away
Doctors can't help the ghost of a man that's me, no, no, no

Water down the drain goes to the sea
The pattern of my life keeps a-haunting me
Moisture from the ocean fills the sky
Come on down to the ground as the time goes by, no no no, no no no

I never found out the reason why
Oh why my parents had to lie
About the place that I was born
Or from my hometown I was torn
At the tender age of four
I was livin' by homemade law

I never knew when it was to be laid
My desires are never displayed
I never knew what it was to be loved
I never knew what it was to be laid
I never knew what it was to win
I never knew what it was to be loved no, no, no

I served a while in the county jail
Five years for, for being hungry tired and poor

Ran a sweaty farm in old Alabam'
I was just eighteen, crude and mean
And all I needed was to get my own way
Get out of my way

Miss Judy she could have me
Any hour of the working day
She'd send me in the corn field mid-afternoon
Said son it's all part of your job

Miss Judy had a cross-eyed poodle
That I would kick if I was given the chance
Never wasn't amused by the kindness I used
I was whipped in the barn until dawn
It hurt me

Last summer we was restless
Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm
But it was all in the head
'Cause out in the yard
Miss Judy had the National Guard
We was beaten
Before we started

But she always didn't get her own way

Don't ever let it show

I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now
When I was stronger

They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again
The dressing rooms are gray

They come on strong and it ain't too long
Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find
You're just a boy again

When you want her lips, you get a cheek
Makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep
Then she's twinkling with the stars

You'll have to learn, just like me

Makes you kind of jealous but it sure is fun
I don't mind, but he wants my lady too

I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had is sussed
Valentino's all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts

In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win

Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin
Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win

Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case, it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone

'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong

Owning up for prosperity

I wish the world could see you now Lady Day
Laughing down at your oldest friend
The one who shared just about all he had
In a one-sided love affair
I get scared when I remember too much

Wasted time I suppose you could say that
Strange it don't seem that way to me

But ain't love a bitch

Oh I didn't understand till I was seventeen
She took me way upstairs and she wiped me clean
Oh I didn't realize she made a first class fool out of me
Oh Maggie if you're still out there the rest is history

You're all alone in the freezing cold
By the underground
Your hands are numb and you're feeling dumb
Cos you been let down
You thought you were rough and kinda tough
And maybe out of reach
You're acting chic, playing hide 'n' seek
But ain't love a bitch

Oh I must state right here I been there before
My eyes were closed and so my friends
I still don't know the score
Oh don't underestimate the strength of it
It may be unwise to analyze even the cause of it

You're driving home late one night and on the radio
Comes an old familiar song you used to know so well
(you know a lot about that)
Oh I can't comprehend this thing called love
Maybe it's a matter of fact I just can't grow up
Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile
All I really wanna know is there one sweet angel
That can make me smile

Ain't love a bitch

Torrential rains, wars and hurricanes
I wouldn't budge an inch
Your rent's unpaid and your team lose again

You can lose your job, your home and your health

In these days of changing ways
So called liberated days
A story comes to mind of a friend of mine

Georgie boy was gay I guess
Nothin' more or nothin' less
The kindest guy I ever knew

His mother's tears fell in vain
The afternoon George tried to explain
That he needed love like all the rest

Pa said there must be a mistake
How can my son not be straight
After all I've said and done for him

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Cast out by the ones he loves
A victim of these gay days it seems

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie went to New York town
Where he quickly settled down
And soon became the toast of the great white way

Accepted by Manhattan's elite
In all the places that were chic
No party was complete without George

Along the boulevards he'd cruise
And all the old queens blew a fuse
Everybody loved Georgie boy

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

The last time I saw George alive
Was in the summer of seventy-five
He said he was in love I said I'm pleased

George attended the opening night
Of another Broadway hype
But split before the final curtain fell

Deciding to take a short cut home
Arm in arm they meant no wrong
A gentle breeze blew down fifth avenue

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Out of a darkened side street came
A New Jersey gang with just one aim
To roll some innocent passer-by
There ensued a fearful fight
Screams rang out in the night
Georgie's head hit a sidewalk cornerstone

A leather kid, a switchblade knife
He did not intend to take his life
He just pushed his luck a little too far that night

The sight of blood dispersed the gang
A crowd gathered, the police came
An ambulance screamed to a halt on fifty-third and third

Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh
Da da da da da da duh

Georgie's life ended there
But I ask who really cares
George once said to me and I quote

He said ""never wait or hesitate
Get in kid, before it's too late
You may never get another chance
'Cause youth a mask but it don't last
Live it long and live it fast""
Georgie was a friend of mine

I said hello unnoticed

Spinning yarns that were so lyrical

The attraction was purely physical

That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsley prints
I put down to experience

Who tried to change my point of view

You're Celtic, United, but baby I've decided
You're the best team I've ever seen

And there have been many affairs
Many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around

Yeah, I'm depressed again

Give me wings I'll fly away
Magnificent and free
Far away from the madding crowd
There's gotta be a place for me
I'm down, I'm coming down again
I'm down, looks like I'm coming down again
I'm down, I'm down
Looks like I'm coming down again

Rod Stewart,"Miss you babe
Miss you babe

She's everywhere I go
She's everything I know
And now I think she's finally
Touched my soul
She's heaven here on earth
Much more than I deserve
And I don't wanna ever let her go
I'm getting used to all her ways
Everything she says
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups and all her downs

She's every move that I make
She's every breath I take
She's got a hold on me
That I don't wanna break

I mean my girl bring her home to me
My girl can't wait for you to see
My girl means everything to me
My girl my girl

My friends keep coming round
Saying come out on the town
What's wrong, you ain't the guy
We used to know
And I tell them I say
Without her by my side
I'm only half alive
I love her so bad
And I don't care if it shows

I mean my girl
Bring her home to me
My girl, means everything to me
My girl, can't wait for you to see

At last my heart has found a home
This time I know where I belong

That we've been through
How can you tell me 
That there's somebody new

See it my way I've nothing left
You can take my heart but don't steal my pride
Think it over before I'm pushed aside 
And tell me
Say it ain't true 
That's all you gotta do, baby

Get yourself out go along with the crowd

Who can't find love in this world
Tell yourself there's another one
Who's waiting for you, somewhere

Somebody special is thinking of you
Somebody special is dreaming of you
Somebody special is longing for you
Somebody special, special

Magazine dreams are easy stuff
But heaven knows they ain't good enough
Picture yourself from reel to reel
And get your hands on that driving wheel
And you know what
When it's hard to satisfy
A simple simple fantasy
Somebody somewhere is on your side
Waiting for you, crying

Somebody special, is looking for you
Somebody special, is searching for you
Somebody special, is waiting for you
Somebody special, somebody special

Maybe your heart's tormenting you
Why should it have any reason to
Wipe off that negativity
Put on some positivity
And when you think you're the only one
Who can't find love in this world

I was dreaming of a mobile
That couldn't be mine not without lyin'

When I stepped in soakin' beer down the cola machine
Oh, stayin' seventeen
Well she claimed she was a killer
And she owned a flood lit villa
A little aways from the main highway
Oh take me way down yonder

She was tall, thin and tarty
And she drove a Maserati
Faster than sound
I was heaven bound
Although I must have looked a creep
In my army surplus jeep
Was I being too bold
Before the night could get old
No, no, no, no
She proved me so wrong

Oh the Italian girls sometimes hold their religious habits
In front of your eyes, just to get you tied
Ah but not my little Bella 'cause I did not have to tell her
I'd rather you go with the morning sun, she made me so tired

She took me way, way, away down yonder
'Til I was gone with the morning sun on my back
Gotta get on back there soon as I can

I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes 
I'm not the custom made size

Out on the highway for awhile
I'll show you where the man in me 
Is when he doesn't hide

He's cruisin' in the fast lane 
Stuck behind the wheel
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside

Put another chair on the fire bring the bottle over here
I feel I'm getting old

I'm gonna have to leave a little bit sooner

Got to get me some South America sun

Honey don't even ask me if you can come along
Down at the border you need to be older
And you sure don't look like my daughter
Your ridiculous age, start a state outrage
And I'll end up in a Mexican jail
Darling please don't cry you know I wouldn't tell you no lie

Look over there
Oh my God don't look now
But it appears to be raining again
Get upstairs pack my book of prayers
Honey hurry I'm catching pneumonia
I gotta move while I'm in the mood
Or I'll disappear into that wall
Darling please don't curse
It really couldn't be any worse
Say I'm a sun fanatic but it's dark in your attic
And your cat sleeps over my head

I know I'm not a football star
But I want to little better than that
So I'm much obliged for the pure white ride
And a cup of tea every morning
I'll say goodbye, look your man in the eye
You know I wouldn't tell you no lie

'Cause I knew how much you loved the sun
But you chose to stay, stay and keep me warm
Through the darkest nights I've ever known

Then I know I love ya

Oh the snow fell without a break
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years
I couldn't believe you kept a smile
Now I can rest assured knowing that we've seen the worst
And I know I love ya

Oh I never was good with romantic words
So the next few lines come really hard
Don't have much but what I've got is yours
Except of course my steel guitar
Ha, 'cause I know you don't play
But I'll teach you one day
Because I love ya

I recall the night we knelt and prayed
Noticing your face was thin and pale
I found it hard to hide my tears
I felt ashamed I felt I'd let you down
No mandolin wind couldn't change a thing
Couldn't change a thing no, no

Persuaded painted ladies that I could say I'd been free
Over the mountain and under the sea
They'll never be another one like mine for me

Mine is always, mine is grand

Sure plays a mean pinball.

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feelin' all the bumpers
Always playin' clean.
Plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard
There has to be a twist,
A pinball wizard,
Not such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
What makes him so good?
Ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear those buzzes and bells,
Don't see lights a-flashin'
plays by sense of smell.
Always gets a replay,
Never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb an' blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball.

Even my usual table,
He can beat my best,
His disciples lead him in
And he just does the rest.
He's got crazy flipper' fingers,
Never seen him fall.

Tearing down the highway in the pouring rain
Escaping from my wedding day
I heard the bells ringing in the local church 
The ceremony's nearly under way
Telegrams came and the cheap champagne 
Was driving everybody out of their brains
But I convinced my best friends I lost my nerve 
And I pleaded I was being framed

""Sailor show me which way to go"" 
I screamed out loud
""Sailor show me which way to go""

Such a deadly silence 
Due to my defiance 
The wedding ground to a halt
Said I changed my mind
Ain't no use in your trying
So her brother punched me in the throat
Her mother got hysterical
The bitch was cynical 
Father's in the corner drunk
Picking myself off the floor 
I ran to the door
Damned if I was skippin' on my way

You should have heard the noise
Said ""Sailor show me which way to go""

Gonna love you from dusk till dawn
Keep your front door key 
Don't give him up for me

All night creepin'

Stayed with me long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
Then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's goin' now, come back tomorrow

And I said, Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side

Fly away, high away, fly away

Sure enough this morning came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against a child's sunrise

Take my hand, you're gonna be my man, you're gonna rise

Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""

How long has this been going on?

Well your friends and their fancy persuasion
Don't admit that it's part of a scheme,

And the night before?

You've got his number implanted in your brain,
He's been calling you, putting on a stupid name,
I don't own you honey but give me some respect,
Ev'ryone's laughin' laughin' behind my back,
Yeah and I'm jealous, yes I'm jealous,
Oh!

You're so cold baby it ain't like it used to be,
I'm suspicious, you're acting so deviously,
Secret phone calls, when you think I'm not around,
You've been seen with him all over town,
Yeah and I'm jealous when you look at someone else,
I'm so jealous, I want you all to myself,
I'm jealous babe,
I'm so jealous.

Now does he buy you ruby rings and perfumes from abroad,
Does he hypnotize you with things I can't afford,
Does he drive a Cadillac, is he white or is he black,
What's he got that I ain't got, is he really that big?
You bet your life I'm jealous babe,
Yeah,

You've been seen wit him all over town, baby
Yes, I'm jealous, goddam' jealous

You've been to Angelo's for a quiet dinner for two,
Then to Shakey Jake's where you danced until two,
Then to his place where I know you spent the night,
Got my spies girl, and they're all
Jealous

Did he really blow your mind,
Did he alway treat you kind,
Does he kiss you like I do,
Did he crawl all over you,
Did he have you on the floor,
Were you screaming out for more,
Is he better than I am,
Are you seeing him again.

I'm so jealous when you look at someone else,
I'm so jealous, want you all myself,
I'm so jealous, it's tearing me apart,
I'm so jealous, it's ripping out my heart,

I've been workin' all week tryin' to pay for this gear
Gonna raise hell on Union Street
Thirteen guys and a packet of three
And if I don't get laid I'll sure die tryin'
Tonight this city's gonna be all mine

I want to talk about motorbikes, cars and things
No sophistication or designer jeans
I'm no angel, but I know what I like
A little rough and tumble on a Friday night
I'm like a cornered rat, I gotta explode
Goodbye baby don't know when I'll be home

Tora, Tora, Tora, out with the boys
Tora, Tora, Tora, out with the boys
Tora, Tora, Tora, out with the boys tonight

By eleven o'clock I'll be flyin' high
Ain't nothing in the world that I won't try
Jimmy got smashed, took his trousers off
Barman said, You boys have had enough. Join the army, get yourself a decent job
Indecent exposure in a parking lot

Bundle on the dance floor, a jaw got bust
Swear to God that it wasn't one of us
A seven foot bouncer called the police
We got pulled in for disturbing the peace
Well if you can't take a joke
Then there ain't no point in living
Sunday morning I woke up laughin'

Tora, Tora, Tora, out with the boys

Fish net tights with red high heels
All the boys say she's cold as ice
I won't sleep until I'm satisfied

Keep on watchin' her across the room
Waitin' for the band to play a faster tune
I want her number but I'm scared to ask
I wanna dance and I want her ass
Want to fuck her, she's no relief
I don't know what's wrong with me

Dance with me
She won't dance with me
Why won't she dance wih me
She won't dance with me
Dance, dance, dance, dance with me

Why won't she dance with me
Come on, dance with me
Dance, dance, dance, dance with me

Here she comes floatin' down the street
Synthesized eyes wearin' cellophane jeans
Practicin' the art of sexuality
My tongue gets tied when I try to speak
Got a hard on, honey, that hurts like hell
If I don't ask her somebody else will

Dance with me
Don't wanna dance with you
Why won't you dance with me

All dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree
Dancin' and hummin' a rock 'n' roll melody
She's the daughter of a well respected man
Who taught her how to jerk and understand
Then she became a rock 'n' roll music fan

Sweet little rock 'n' roller, sweet little rock 'n' roller
Her daddy doesn't have to scold her 
Her partner can't hardly hold her
Because she never gets any older
Sweet little rock 'n' roller

Should of seen her eyes when the band began to play
And the famous singer sang and bowed away
When the stars were gone she screamed and yelled hurray
Ten thousand eyes were watchin' them leave the floor
Five thousand tongues are screaming out ""More"" and ""More""
About fifteen hundred waiting outside the door

Rod Stewart,"I didn't know what day it was 
When you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed
You said goodbye too soon

Breezing through the clientele
Spinning yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here
The attraction was purely physical

I took all those habits of yours
That in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense, Beardsly prints
I put down to experience

The big bosomed lady with the Dutch accent
Who tried to change my point of view
Her ad lib lines were well rehearsed
But my heart cried out for you

You're in my heart, you're in my soul
You'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend
You're in my soul

The same old ritual, the same old dance
The hardest thing to resist is

If the fire down below's gettin' worse and worse
You're so close to shootin' that you want to burst
Somebody's sponge needs squeezin'

But you know somebody's by her side

The howlin' wind that just won't stop

Billions floating 'round in space

Caught in a cross, fire of hate
How can we call ourselves Christians?
How can we turn the other way?

Rod Stewart,"It's a common misconception
About a man's role in this world
A provider and survivor and
A winner who must never fail

But oh, how he needs a woman
To reassure and give him strength
Through the darkest nights and the hardest fights
When there's no other corner left

When the world outside is threatenin'
And all his dreams have been destroyed
Take him in your arms watch all his guards
Melt like a little boy

Tell him, you really need him
Tell him, you really care
Tell him, you'll never leave him
He'll be satisfied

And he may not find it easy
To say what's on his mind
When he's full of doubt, say, ""We'll work it out""
God knows how hard he's trying

And he may never buy you roses
And forget to notice your hair
But as long as he says, ""I love you my dear""
That's all you need to hear

Tell him, you really need him
Tell him, you'll aways care
Tell him, you'll never leave him
He'll be satisfied

And they say, the heart's a hunter
But it's truth you can't deny
He may never be everything you want
But for you, he'd lay down and die

So Friday night when the phone rings
And he's stuck in a downtown bar
Roll away the stone 'cause the last mile home
Is the longest mile of them all

Tell him, you really need him
Tell him, you'll always care
Tell him, you'll never leave him

And tell him that you love him

Rod Stewart,"On a hot summer's night 
In the year of '75
Jimmy Doyle took his child bride 
Amanda, for a drive
She was only seventeen 
He just lived to see her smile
Their commitment to each other 
Burned like a forest fire
Otis on the radio singing Stand By Me

As a trooper pulled them over
And said Jimmy where you been
Someone matching your description
Has just robbed the liquor store
Amanda said He's been with me
But they weren't listening anymore
Down at Precinct Number Five 
They questioned Jimmy through the night
The sheriff said He's gotta stand trial
Armed robbery is the charge
Amanda said This cannot be
Gonna stay right here until you set him free
And I love him

Here to eternity
Forever 
Unto eternity
Oh God gave me something 
I must hold on to
Gonna hold on him
No matter what you do
The old courthouse was crowded
As the judge reviewed the case 
In a year of re-election
He was desperate to impress 
Innocent or guilty

He saw an opportunity
To send Jimmy down for life 
To the Penitentiary
Disbelief and anger
As they dragged him away
In a cell below the courthouse
They beat him like a slave
But his use of martial arts
Struck a blow for liberty
Felled a guard with a fist of iron
And killed him instantly
All the press surrounded Amanda
Coming down the courthouse steps
Pleading for her young man's life
And in a moment seen by millions
She bowed her head and cried
Show my man some mercy
He's the father of my child
I love him

Here to eternity
Forever 
Unto eternity
Oh God gave me something 
I must hold on to
Gonna hold on him
No matter what you do 
I love him
Here to eternity
Jimmy Doyle appeared again
In a second public trail
For the murder of a prison guard
They sentenced him to die
But Amanda with her long red hair
Made one last plea
As the court fell into silence
She cried out desperately
This man of mine is innocent
As one day I shall prove
It's an open case of self defense
All this circumstantial evidence
You place before your court
Has robbed me of my husband
Forget I will not
I love him

Here to eternity
Forever 
Unto eternity

I swear I'll clear your name
'Cause I love you

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some are gone and some remain

Oh these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all.

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one, compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love, as something new

I know I'll often stop and think about them

By being someone else

I only fooled myself
I knew the part, but in my heart
The role I couldn't play

But I will always love you

That could make a woman's heart sing forgive me

I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad
Thinking I'm gay
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort
(Of a guy)

But there's one thing I'm lacking
It's sexual experience
So I ask you, my sweetheart
Save me from this wilderness

I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this

Where I come from, love is
Just a hole in the wall
And the steel mills ring out and generations
Heed the call

And the rain never stops and the skies are grey
And the chance of romance
Slim as a bright sunny day

This is partly the reason
I'm so overwhelmed and shy
Because your beauty, by contrast
Is gonna make a young man cry

I've schemed, honey, of a night like this

A suburban home
To be left with a woman like you
Completely alone

Legs like a young giraffe

Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall

Stop a train at fifty feet

Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black

Revolution running through her veins
A radical from head to toe

Was ""just like a rolling stone""

We started dancing all around the room
Helped by a bottle of wine

Rod Stewart,"I've woken up on mornings such as this
And thought exactly the same as I'm thinking now
Every night for a year I've slept alone
My cold damp room looks worse than me

I got a fear of death that creeps on every night
I know I won't die soon but then again I might
Just like water down the drain I'm wasting away
And oh, doctors can't help. a ghost of a man, that's me

I'm going far
Ah, ah, ah

And oh, water down the drain flows to the sea
The pattern of my life keeps a-hauntin' me
Like moisture from the ocean fills the sky
Comes on down to the ground as time goes by

Ah, ah, ah
Please don't weep for me when I'm gone
Ah, ah, ah

I used to work and take a salary
In a hole up near a foundry
But it did not take me too long
To get my boots on a ""So Long!""
Long Spanish boots on a ""So Long!""
I took a day job in Bethlehem
I nearly threw in the towel then
But it did not take me too long
To get my boots on a ""So Long!""
High Spanish boots on a ""So Long!""

Dig it
I took a Spanish haberdashery
Restored with 15th century tapestry
But oh, Mr. Nesbitt got the best of me
So I strapped on my boots and said ""So Long!""
Laced up my high boots and ""So Long!""

So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood
Was invited by a skinny girl
Into her high class-world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

I was glad to come
I'll be sad to go
So while I'm here I'll have me a real good time

'Round the bedroom out back

Wandered c-c-cross the door
Missed my step and I fell on the floor
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead

I was glad to come
And I'll be so sad to leave
But while I was here I had me a real good time, ooh

That she only came here for the beer
That's a fact, oh, yeah

keep your body under lock and key

Rod Stewart,"Let me tell you about a place, somewhere up in New York way
Where the people are so gay, twistin' the night away
Here they have a lot of fun, puttin' trouble on the run
Oh man you'll find the old and young twistin' the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes, how he got here I don't know
But oh man, you ought to see him go, twistin' the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks, she's moving up and back
Oh man, there ain't nothing like twistin' the night away

Feel much better

Here's a fellow in blue jeans, who's dancing with an older queen
Dolled up in her diamond rings, twistin' the night away
Man you ought to see her go, twistin' to the rock and roll
Here you'll find the young and the old twistin' the night away

They're twistin', twistin', everybody's doing great
They're twistin' man, twistin', they're twistin' the night away
Twistin', you know they're twistin', twistin' the night away
They're twistin', twistin', man twistin' the night away

He said somehow, some way, it's gotta get better than this.
Patti packed her bags, left a note for her momma, she was just seventeen,
There were tears in her eyes when she kissed her little sister goodbye.

They held each other tight as they drove on through the night they were so excited.
We got just one shot of life, let's take it while we're still not afraid.
Because life is so brief and time is a thief when you're undecided.
And like a fistful of sand, it can slip right through your hands.

Young hearts be free tonight. Time is on your side,
Don't let them put you down, don't let 'em push you around,
Don't let 'em ever change your point of view.

They took a two room apartment that was jumping ev'ry night of the week.
Happiness was found in each other's arms as expected, yeah

Billy wrote a letter back home to Patti's parents tryin' to explain.
He said we're both real sorry that it had to turn out this way.
But there ain't no point in talking when there's nobody list'ning so we just ran away

So I cycled 'cross the neighborhood
Was invited by a skinny girl 
Into her high class world

Left my bicycle under the stairs
Laid my coat across the kosher chairs
Made my way across the crowded room
I had nothing to lose

My reception wasn't very keen
So turning on a friendly grin,
Stood on the table with my glass of gin
And came straight to the point

I'll have me a real good time

Was escorted by a friendly slag
'Round the ... back 

Wandered c-c-cross ...
Missed my step and I fell on the floor.
Said one word and was asked to leave
Kinda' wish I was dead.

I was glad to come
And I'll be so sad to leave,
But while I was here
I had me a real good time, oooh.

The skinny girl made it clear, 
That she only came here for the beer - that's a fact, oh yeah
The vicar he simply reeked of gin - good God

It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used

Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts

The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none in my eyes, you're everything

I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more

You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me

You fill my life with laughter, somehow you make it better
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love less defined
And its yours and its mine
Like the sun
And at the end of the day
We should give thanks and pray
To the one, to the one

Have I told you lately that I love you?
Have I told you there's no one else above you?
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

There's a love less defined
And its yours and its mine

to all of my closest friends,
and knew that it was over
and the party had to end.
If only, I'd have noticed
the sadness in your eyes,
she'd still be in my arms tonight
if only.

If only I'd have realized
the unimprotance of being cool,
to give a kiss,
maybe just say,
""Darling I love you.""
If only I'd said I'm sorry
I'd have been a much better man,
she'd still be in my arms tonight,

if only.
There's an emptiness
that fills my heart
now that she's not here.
I loved her more than my own life,
something I've always feared,
if only.

If only I'd come home at night
instead of stayin' out for one more drink,
if only I'd been unconcerned
what the other guys may think,
if only I'd held her tight,
but I guess it's too late now.
Oh how blind can one man be,
if only.
Whoa but I will not be sad
after all the fun we've had.
You live some
and you learn some, if only.

If only I could convince her
the importance of one more chance,
if only God would allow me
one more celestial dance,
If only I have the nerve
to call her up and tell her how I feel,
she'd still be in my arms tonight,
if only.

But it's only love
and love ain't real,
it's only a four letter word.
We spend half our lives chasing after it,
how wonderf'ly absurd,
if only.

Oo whoa but I will not be sad
after all the fun we had.
You live some and you learn some,
whoa but I will not be sad

Rod Stewart,"Here is a story that is bound to amuse ya
(about a fine young couple startin' out in life)
A dedicated husband and a real fine worker
(who lived for his children and his beautiful wife)
But one night in Dallas at a computer convention
(he got so loaded he could hardly stand)
Woke up with a heavy head and a strange girl beside him
(returned home a worried guilty man)
But inside his coat his wife found a note
It said ""Thanks for the good time Can I see you again""
She asked him ""Why oh why"" Tears rollin' down her eyes
""would you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory

Packed up all her bags and returned to her mother
(Two small children clinging to her dress)
Hurt and disillusioned but never down hearted
(she picked up the pieces of her broken life)
And meanwhile back in Boston the culprit lie thinkin'
(trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine)
Fired from his job and missing his children
(he didn't care one way if he lived or died)
Oh what a crying shame nobody else to blame
for one night of pleasure he had given her pain
Oh how it was so hard to climb so far to give it all up
for a moment of glory, glory

As the months rolled by and accusations fly
the bloodsuckin' lawyers know they're in for a kill
The gold war begins she's takin' off her rings
Close friends take sides while the waters are still

Phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment
(it was his little boy Johnny and his sister Beth)
They said ""Daddy we miss you would you talk to Mommy""
(a line of communication he had sadly missed)
She said ""Now don't get me wrong this is where you belong""
I said ""Good-bye children we can work it all out""
""But don't you ever forget how this family has bled
'cause you give it all up for a moment of glory"" glory

We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

Let's dance together just for the night
Let's don't worry about the future or nothin' else
'Cause just like the music's sayin' you gotta take chances
Go ahead just do it and trust yourself

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us tonight
There's a soul in the city
Saying everything's gonna be all right

So bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

They wish us luck
But they think we're just dreaming
Let's prove them wrong baby
'Cause you know what luck is
Luck is believing you're lucky
That's all and showing just a little bit of faith

There's a soul in the city
Watching over us I swear
There's a soul in the city
There's a whole world waiting out there

Listen
I got plans for us
Playing like a skip on a record
Through my head all night long
But when we walk that darkened stairway
And step out on the roof
I know what we're feeling can't be wrong

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles
Echo to the alley down below

Bring over some of your old Motown records
We'll put the speakers in the window and we'll go
On the roof and listen to the Miracles

Rod Stewart,"A friend of mine called up,
said, ""I fin'lly had some luck-
Could I have a minute of your time.
I met a girl last night
try as I might,
I can't get her off of my mind.
She walked in the room and right then I knew
I fin'ly found somebody for me.
But to tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do.
Should I go ahead or wait and see?""

I said, ""Give it all you got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?
Than to never love at all?""

Now I'm the kind of guy
who's normally quiet shy.
On romance, I don't know a thing.
But when she led me to the floor,
never danced before.
Suddenly my feet had wings.
I know that she wnats me,
I want her too,
but I'm so confused.
I can't think straight.
I feel so alive,
but on the other side,
should I go ahead or should I wait?

I said, ""Give it all you got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?"".
Than to never love at all?""

So, when the music starts
to flow from your hearts
like the coming of an early spring,
whe nthe river starts to flow
between your soul to soul,
may no man ever come between.
Die in her arms if she wants you to.
Be thankful for each passin' day.
When your odds collide,
let your spirits fly
and pray to God it's here to stay.

And I said, ""Give it all You got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all?

Give it all you got,
no holding back.
Let a light in your soul.
Ain't it better to lose in love
than to never love at all,
than to never love at all,
than to never, never love at all?""

than to never love at all?

Rod Stewart,"Across the street the river runs
Down in the gutter life is slipping away
Let me still exist in another place
Running down under cover
Of a helicopter blade

The flames are getting higher
In effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still alive
Somewhere someday
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words I love you
Rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam

Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailing

Light up my darkness
Light it up
Light it up

Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley

Rolling off my tongue

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle
Of a slot machine

Rod Stewart,"He wakes up in the morning like a newborn baby
The message on the machine says ""you're driving me crazy""
His feet don't touch the ground
he can hardly wait to see her tonight
Now every new song on the radio reminds him of her
He says hello to strangers and he's singing in the shower
The sign in his eyes says this guy's got a problem so nice so nice
She don't know what she's doing to him
Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream

When a man's in love when a man's in love
he'll fight like a tiger fly like a dove when a man's in love
He's early on the job and all his friends begin to sense
his attitude has changed he's serene and contented
His feet don't touch the ground he can hardly wait to see her tonight
And he calls her on the telephone about a dozen times an hour
She's flattered by the avalanche of attention and flowers
He tells all his buddies ""Boys, I've finally found someone for me""
She don't know what she's doing to him
Every day's like Christmas it sure ain't a dream

When a man's in love, when a man's in love

When a man's in love

She dominates his every thought and dream and conversation
He talks about her constantly with an air of jubilation
There ain't nothin' in the world he wouldn't do to make her little face smile
But oh don't it make you want to smile and dance
May God bless us all with a little romance

When a man's in love, when a man's in love
she's in his heart and running through his blood

Leaving nobody to carry it on
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

A blanket of newspaper covered his head
The step was his pillow
The street was his bed
One look at his face
Showed the hard road he'd come
And a fistful of money
Showed the coins that he'd bummed

He was only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song

You just thank the Lord

People get ready
For the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers
From coast to coast
Faith is the key
Open the doors and board them
There's room for all 
Among the loved the most

There ain't no room
For the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just
To save his own
Have pity on those 
Whose chances are thinner
Cause there's no hiding place
From the Kingdom's Throne

So people get ready
For the train a-comin'
You don't need no baggage
You just get on board
All you need is faith 
To hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket
You just thank, you just thank the Lord

Oh
Yeah

I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give
Never think about myself

If I gave you time to change my mind
I'd find a way just to leave the past behind
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

If I listened long enough to you
I'd find a way to believe that it's all true
Knowing that you lied straight-faced while I cried
Still I look to find a reason to believe

Someone like you makes it hard to live without
Somebody else
Someone like you makes it easy to give

Hang on St. Christopher
Through the smoke and the oil
Pumpin' iron around the scene
Let the radiator boil
Got no back down shift
And a two dollar grill
Got an '85 cab
On an '85 hill

*Hang on St. Christopher
On the passenger side
Open it up tonight
So the devil can ride

Hang on St. Christopher
With a ballast door
Kick me up ...
Throw me out in the fog
Tell ... Jack ...
Drive a stake through his heart
Do a hundred on the grapevine
Do a jump on the start

Hang on St. Christopher
Now don't let me go
Get me to Reno
And bring it in low, low

Hang On St. Christopher
With the hammer to the floor
Put a highball in the crankcase
Nail a crow to the door
Give me a bottle for the jockey
Give me a two ...
There's a certain ...
Bustin' down Johnny's door

(*Repeat)

Let the devil ride
Let the devil ride
Let the devil ride

Hang On St. Christopher
Now don't let me go
Get me to Reno
Got to bring it in low
Put my baby on a flatcar
Tell 'em to burn down the caboose
Get 'em all jacked up with whiskey
And we'll turn the mad dog loose

Let him ride, let him ride
Let him ride, let him ride

Through the smoke and the oil

And bring your shine right wisdom
Darlin' over here
Your Gaelic humor
And your pious smile

I remember 
When I was only seventeen 
The bohemian poet 
And dosciple of the streets 
Or was I just a little kid 
Searching for identity in '63 

Heard it on the radio 
On a cold December night 
It came burning down the air waves 
Like a savior's shinin' light 
All the way from the U.S.A. 
Across the Atlantic far away 
The magic came 

The house began to rock 
With Cupid and his bow 
The hootchy kootchy man's 
Lonely harp began to blow 
Little did I know that 
nothing in my life 
Would ever be the same

Strummed my guitar in bed 
Till my fingers bled

Thank you, Muddy

I saw Otis back in 1965 
Tears in my eyes 
As he sung ""These Arms Of mine"" 
But angels needed a soul man 
For the celestial blues band 
They took him home (took you home) 

Oh, what I'd give to see 
That red mohair suit and hear 
""Dock Of The Bay"" 
Or Sam in his two tone 
Singin' ""Bring It On Back Home"" 
What a show that would be

For the sounds you made 
Thank you, Sam, thank you, Otis 
Thank you, Muddy 
For the times we shared 
And they carry on

It's because this blue-eyed soul boys 
Got so much respect 
My gratitude to you 
Runs deep, proud and true

To pick wild mountain thyme

He gone North for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style

By the way, that's a cute hat
And that smile's so hard to resist
But what's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me Sweet Daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh

In order to deal in this game
Got to make the Queen disappear
It's done with a flick of the wrist
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know, a woman like you should be at home
That's where you belong
Taking care of somebody nice
Who don't know how to do you wrong

Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there's no way to tell by that first kiss
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You could be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before ya came in the door
They say, in your father's house, there's many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor

Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What's a sweetheart like you doin' in a dump like this?

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king

It's called the land of permanent bliss

Dodging from the shadows underneath those amber light

Except inside each other and I loved you so

For the Vatican don't give no sanction
I wasn't ready for that, no no

I moved right out east yeah, listen
On the Peking ferry I was feeling merry
Sailing on my way back here
I fell in love with a slit eyed lady
By the light of an eastern moon

Shanghai Lil never used the pill
She claimed that it just ain't natural
She took me up on deck and bit my neck
Oh people, I was glad I found her
Oh yeah, I was glad I found her

I firmly believe that I didn't need anyone but me
I sincerely thought I was so complete
Look how wrong you can be

The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe
They wouldn't give you the time of day
But the slit eyed lady knocked me off my feet

Rod Stewart,"Found my love by the gaswork croft
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I heard a siren from the dock
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelled the spring on the sulfured wind
Dirty old town, whoa oh, dirty old town

We're goin' to take a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
And we'll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town
Dirty old town, whoa oh, dirty old town

And oh we'll chop you down
Oh, dirty, dirty, dirty old town

It's been so long since I had a good time

Never wrecked my head on a bandstand 
in the trombone or clarinet line
When I come in heat on Bourbon Street for Mardi Gras
When those for a cryin'  just stay behind in the bar
'Cause it's been so long since I had a good time
Yeah it's been so long since I had a good time

I'm gonna lose control of my powers 
I might even lose my trousers
Smash some glass, act like trash if I want
Wear a skirt be a flirt if I want

This prodigal man from Dixieland needs a good time
right now, show me a good time right now

You better take it while you can
You gotta get it while you can

And when the Man Upstairs he calls me 
He'll say ""It's your turn son to come""
Don't play the blues down in old Toulouse for me
Let sleighbells ring and children sing in the street
And tell all of my friends that I had a good time
Open up the sky won't you ride me high 
Let's have a good time
And if I'm late at heaven's gate blame a good time

Ah listen
It's funny you know when you sit down
And think about what you had
About the friends you used to know
What happened, where did they all go
Can you remember happy hours
Spent drinkin' and thinkin'
We thought we could change the world
And we never, never, never, never, never
Never thought we could get much older then

We were the ones who loved to love the right to love
We'd bring it on home with the right song
Played at the right time
What happened to the girl that you loved once and left
Young man did you break her heart
Did she live, and did she marry,
Did she ever think on your face again
Ah now hold on a minute

I wouldn't change a thing if I could live it all again
Ah yeah

I think what you say is all so right
But I find it hard to jog my memories
Don't worry Lou you may never get another chance yeah

Yes I think what you say is all so right
But I find it hard to move my memories
Say it again with a lot more feelin'

And I think what you say is all so right
But I find it hard to find my memories
Don't sing so serious you make me feel so sad

But if I was true to myself
I would probably find it was a tear in my eye
That stopped me from believing you
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry don't worry

You know my tongue gets tired
When I think back on all of the things we do
But I wonder if I'll remember these few precious things
As years pass me by
Ah when young bodies that've grown older
And mind's become dimmer
I'll point the finger back in time

Miss judy she was moody
Owned a sweaty farm in old alabam
I was just 18, crude and mean
All I needed was to get my own way
Get out of my way

Miss judy she could have me
Any hour of the working day
She'd send me in the corn field mid afternoon
Said son it's all part of your job

Miss judy had a cross eyed poodle
That I would kick if I was given the chance
Never was amused by the kindness I used
I was whipped in the barn until dawn
It hurt me

Last summer we was restless
Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm
But it was all in the head
Cause out in the yard
Miss judy had the national guard
We was beaten, before we started

Miss judy she was moody
And she always didn't get her own way
Just state the facts, get it right
Kick her when she's down",Miss Judy's Farm [DVD],1997

On the matter concerning my dress.
I was raised in a clinic down in oklahoma,
There were many things I did not possess.
Well I never complained, because my father said,
""son you get your chance before you're my age"".
Then he took me upstairs and gave me this suit

But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""

Now I had my fair share of neat women,
But they came between me and my suit.
That was a filly from boston, a barmaid from houston,
Not forgetting the one in detroit.
They said, ""we like you boy and we think you're sweet,
But can't you lose your suit? ""
I said, ""nononono, you can't do that to me""
I remember what my father said:

He said, ""others may come and others may go,
But that suit will be around wherever you're goin'""
Three button hand me down, ha ha,
Three button hand me down

I've never been a tidy dresser
And the fold in my trousers it ain't straight.
Still I know a good cloth when I see one.
That's why I'm clad in this gray flannel suit.
Sometimes I wonder if I should visit a tailor
And get myself a smooth outfit.
Then I remember what my father said to me.
I make it from the open road, you all know this

But that suit will be around wherever you go""
