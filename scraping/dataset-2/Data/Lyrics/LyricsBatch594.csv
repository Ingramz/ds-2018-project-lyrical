Lifehouse,"Silence is golden
But I think it's gonna kill me now
Everything I've seen
Never seems to fill me now
No one told me that the world could fall through, yeahd

In between this
Am I gonna find a way
To defeat this
Living inside yesterday
I'm alive
I think it's time to live like I am
Am I ever gonna find it
Am I ever gonna find it
Am I ever gonna find out

Patience can wait for now
I think I've waited for too long
You always gave a choice
And the right to be wrong
All my life has been slipping through your hands, yeah

In between this
Am I gonna find a way
To defeat this
Living inside yesterday
I'm alive
I think it's time to live like I am
Am I ever gonna find it
Am I ever gonna find it
Am I ever gonna find out",Am I Ever Gonna Find Out,2002
Lifehouse,"I stand with a blank expression now
And I can't believe myself
Would someone tell me how
Did I get here

I am walking
Changing slowly
I am chasing
Climbing closer

I know that I'll never be alone
You will never let me go
You are my anchor
Hold my hand while I'm sinking in the sand
No one else could understand 
You are my anchor

It seems that I lost track of time
And I can't believe my mind
Would you save me if
I reached out to you 

I am waiting
Watching, standing
I am reaching 
Climbing closer

I know that I'll never be alone
You will never let me go
You are my anchor
Hold my hand while I'm sinking in the sand
No one else could understand 
You are my anchor

Anchor yeah

Can you hear me, hear me
Can you hear me",Anchor,2002
Lifehouse,"Tainted
Has our love gone cold
In a place that's bitter and broken
We tasted of a world I know
Surely there must be something better
Something forever

Hello
From the world below
I'm watching the sun burning
As the road is slowly turning
Well I know
That in letting go
I'm learning how to live
Through a life I have to give

Walking
Past the city lights
Silence can be so disturbing
You'll find me standing in the night
The stars never seem so unending
So unending

From the world below
While I'm watching the sun burning
As the road is slowly turning
Well I know
That in letting go
I'm learning how to live
Through a life I have to give

We painted
Whitewashed everything
When all that remains are
Shadows of the stains
Tell me
Where did we go wrong
Can we just move on

Hello
To the world below
While I'm watching the world spinning
This night seems so unending
Well I'll follow
To a place I know
That's only the beginning

Lifehouse,"Too late to hide
And too tired to care
Take what you've learned
And forget the rest
Take what you see
Of what's left of me
You know where I've been
And I don't want to go there again

[Chorus:]
You're beautiful, you're confusing
You're illogical, you're amazing
And I've seen the world
It's overrated
Until you're everything
I have nothing 
But an empty space

And I've been down
This road before
All that I've found
Points me right back to you
And I've watched you move
From down below
Where do I go from here
I guess I'll find out as I go

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're confusing

Lifehouse,"These clouds around you break your fall
As you came crashing to the ground
Did you learn anything at all
You climb back up to come back down

Everybody knows your name
But they don't know who you are
But to them it's just the same
Yeah you're just another name

She said fame will bring you down
At least that's what she used to say
Then they handed her another crown
She said it would never be this way

Everybody knows your name
But they don't know who you are
But to them it's just the same
Yeah you're just another name
La da da da da just another name

Yesterday she was a little girl
Pretending she was queen
Didn't know it'd change the world
Didn't know what this should mean

Which mask will you wear today
How about the one with the pretty smile
To you it's just another day
In a life you haven't lived in quite awhile

Everybody knows your name
But they don't know who you are
But to them it's just a game
And I think it's gone too far

Everybody knows your name
But they don't know who you are
You've got the most familiar face
But your just another name
La da da da da just another name
La da da da da just another name",Just Another Name,2002
Lifehouse,"Can't hold you down
Can I be you
There's nothing I can do
A slave to your hands

Climb up above
Your precious time
Don't worry your time
Don't hurry your mind

Where did you go?
Where did you hide?
All I can do
Is watch you pass by

Climb up above
Your precious time
Don't worry your time
Don't hurry your mind

Every time I try to take it back
I know I don't wanna live like that
I'll wait for tomorrow
Too tired to go the other way
Too late to wait another day
I'm going on

Climb up above
Your precious time
Don't worry your time
Don't hurry your mind

Climb up above
Your precious time
Don't worry your time
Don't hurry your mind

Lifehouse,"I still feel the same
Though everything has changed
The pain it cost now I feel lost inside of my own name
But I keep running
I am running
I keep living for the day that I'm with you
That I'm with you

The past has left its stain
Now I feel the shame
I'll seize the day if you take away the chains of yesterday
But I keep running
I am running
I keep living for the day that I'm with you

And I am waiting
I am waiting
I keep waiting for the day that I'm with you

A new day the sun is shining
Seems I'm closer to finding
That life is more than what we hide
No way that I am turning
As long as the sun is burning
Now it seems that all I want is you

I still feel the same
Though everything has changed
The pain it costs now I feel lost inside of my own name

But I keep running

Past the shadows hanging on the walls
It's been a long time since I felt the stain
Of yesterday getting in my way

I'm alive but tell me am I free
I got eyes but tell me can I see
The sky is falling and no one knows
It shouldn't be hard to believe
Shouldn't be this difficult to breathe
The sky is falling and no one knows

You leave me hanging on only to catch my breath
I got you and I got nothing left
Don't leave me all alone down here
With myself and all of my fears

Than be afraid of my own 
I'd rather be with you
 
I'd rather not know 
Where I'll be than be alone and convinced that I know 
And the world keeps spinning 'round 

My world's upside down and I wouldn't change a thing
I've got nothing else to lose 
I lost it all when I found you and I wouldn't change thing 

No you and I wouldn't change a thing

So I will just let go 

Let you turn me inside out

About anything but you wouldn't have it any other way

Lifehouse,"Quiet
Seems like an honest world
You're begging for the beggars' bread when the money's out
Stand climb and fall
Carry the world
Can't carry your own
When the world is falling down
And another breaks then another falls
For losers always make the winner's day
Stand climb and fall
Carry the weight
Can't carry it all
Are you falling
Are you faking
Are you healing
Are you breaking
Am I burning
Am I only melting 
These diamonds in the making
And I'm at the end of myself
Anything you want
And nothing seems to satisfy me
Take anything you want
Quiet
A sound you know so well
You're living just to make it through another day
Stand climb and fall
Carry the world
Can't carry your own
Are you falling
Are you faking
Are you healing
Are you breaking
Am I burning
Am I only melting
These diamonds in the making
And I'm at the end of myself

And nothing seems to satisfy me

Lifehouse,"This time what I want is you
There is no one else
Who can take your place
This time you burn me with your eyes
You see past all the lies
You take it all away

And it's never enough
It keeps leaving me needing you

Take me away
Take me away
I've got nothing left to say
Just take me away

I try to make my way to you
But still I feel so lost
I don't know what else I can do

Me stay here alone

Lifehouse,"Never meant to waste your time
Never meant to fall out of line
Always tried to get closer to you
Now it seems with every step
Feels like I'm losing my breath
I don't know what else I can do

But you wash over me
You wash over me like rain
And you fall over me
You crawl over me like sunshine

I never had to choose
Living a life with you
Or choosing lies only half true
And now I'd rather be
Alone with you and me
Than hiding behind these walls

But you wash over me
You wash over me like rain
And you fall over me
You crawl over me like sunshine

You wash over me 
You wash over me like rain
You fall over me
You crawl over me like sunshine
Like sunshine

Everything in the world was falling through
All I knew was to look to you
My sunshine
All my life never found my place
Until I felt the sunlight on my face

Never meant to fall out of line
Always tried to get closer to you
Now it seems with every step 
Feels like I'm losing my breath

I fight for a breath of air search but it's not there
In this sea of people I find I am not an equal
I'm not satisfied should my dreams be denied
Catch me at a good time see a man with a purpose
Otherwise you'll find me with the rest blending into the background
I want to kick myself but I'm busy resting
I wonder why I complain when I'm equally to blame
Hardcore is not a background beat for you to move your dancing feet
Its feeling living breathing its the life for those who love living its outrage
Energy compassion not hate not violence or fashion
So I ask you and I'm left to wonder
What you'll do when you've dragged it under
Find who's to blame the ones who destroy or the ones who let it happen

When I hit the ground
I try to concentrate and stretch a smile across my face
You are the one to set the sun
And then your coldness lingers on grab the clouds from out of sight
Turn our morning into night
You're the cold flowing through my veins that turns my laughter to a scream
And everytime we think it's done you're right behind us listening on

But of course I'll call you tonight.
Did you know you missed my birthday?
The loneliest it gets is when the wind begins to chill.

And when I stand at the top of your old street,
The church top brings a stillness to me.
And I can't think of anything I'd rather do
Than have my heart broken by you.

Could we be saved by inventions and hopes?
Cause I'm not all right.
The night seems to swallow me whole
And spits out second guessing.

I remember ever since that first day that I saw you on the street.
I've always wanted you in the worst way, but now I can't compete.
And I'm so... and you're so... we're both so all fucked up.

Tears in her eyes, 
It's the last time, The last time you can be sure of, 
But I can taste the salty kisses and the runny makeup, 
Yea, it could be so boring 

But she keeps crying, 
And they keep kissing, 
And I just hang about and listen 

She's got to go, 
She's got to go, 
In the airport, in the morning, and I know 
She's got to go 

Now it's time they know, 
They don't take a step, 
Line keeps on pushing, 
They won't stop kissing, 
The airport is racing, 
The smokers are pacing, 
It just started raining, 
Soon I'll have to go

And they keep kissing,

In the airport, In the morning, I know 
She's got to go 

In the morning, In the airport 
She's crying and the phone rings 
And you answer, and its quiet 
And there's nothing that'll change the fact 
That she's leaving tomorrow 
And you'll be alone again with nothing to distract you

And wondered that the man can deprive ya
It's there in black ink
With millions in dirty green had to think
Lives depreciated over drinks
Call me twisted
Rope burns to the neck was insisted
And all his hope turned to ""I guess should I risk it?""

Feel me shakin' up that dope in my apartment
And picture me on top of the world and still servin'
Blessin' all my shorties with birds to keep 'em workin'
As long as my hood is tight, my mind is right
Look at the dope line tonight, just doin' alright
For the nugs
Why y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug
This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good
With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's
With the itchy sittin' dead on the seat
For the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down
For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rounds

Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes

And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit
That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit
By-standers got hit up
And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights
Lightin' pilot lights
I would be crept on my a mask on silent nights

Flip a new Lac with his work
End up in the back of hearse
Then be packed in the dirt

He get cracked where it hurts
Feel the automatic when it jerks
Comin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk
Is that what it's worth naw, niggaz got the chrome in ? in the whip
Never let the law get the low on the licks

Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them ?booshy? hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all 
With the easy-e kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
But I guess that leaves dust and all
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we sold be	's
Cause you really gotta get greedy
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggas out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl

Check my name and Eddy came, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos

Ain't got an A and the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The Brandi, I can't stand it the way my mess 
And let's get stranded, I kizzel my nizzel fa shizzel

And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive I'ma be the one they gone put it on
(did you know me daddy) Man I ain't even have to ask shorty
It was right before my eyes, tattoos on her chest
Snake wrapped around her legs all the way up to her thighs
Her size, scrumptious fulfilling the fantasy of me and my guys
When she pulled her pants down 
Made me want to buck she oh my, what a surprise
Man I'm hoping, she'll let a nigga get it wet I gets wild and open
Way too provoking, on the beach rubbing her body down with suntan lotion
What's that, another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass 
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
got limo scrapes ride the butter crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that

Ho messo via un pò di illusioni
Che prima o poi basta così
Ne ho messe via due o tre cartoni
Comunque so che sono lì
Ho messo via un pò di consigli
Dicono è più facile
Li ho messi via perchè a sbagliare
Sono bravissimo da me.

Mi sto facendo un pò di posto
E che mi aspetto chi lo sa
Che posto vuoto ce n'è stato ce n'è ce ne sarà.
Ho messo via un bel pò di cose
Ma non mi spiego mai il perchè
Io non riesca a metter via te

Ho messo via un pò di legnate
I segni quelli non si può
Che non è il male nè la botta
Ma purtroppo il livido.
Ho messo via un bel pò di foto
Che prenderanno polvere
Sia su rimorsi che rimpianti
Che rancori e sui perchè
Mi sto facendo un pò di posto
E che mi aspetto chi lo sa
Che posto vuoto ce n'è stato ce n'è ce ne sarà.

E su questa terra che dondola
Dondola dondola dondola

Un cielo che resta lì

alla sua donna ed al suo amico di fare più piano e sul suo divano 
si stenderà

e la notte di chi non ha niente 
e la notte per forza volenti o nolenti

Mentre il sole alle spalle pian piano ca giù
E quel sole vorresti non essere tu

E così hai ripreso a fumare a darti da fare

Io e te ci siam tolti le voglie
Ognuno I suoi sbagli
È un peccato per quelle promesse
Oneste ma grosse
Ci si sceglie per farselo un pò in compagnia
Questo viaggio in cui non si ripassa dal via

L'amore conta, l'amore conta
E conta gli anni a chi non è mai stato pronto
Nessuno dice mai che sia facile
E forse qualche dio non ha finito con te

Grazie per il tempo pieno
Grazie per la te più vera
Grazie per I denti stretti

Per le botte d'allegria

Picchiare ancora contro per non lasciarmi stare
Ho ancora quella forza che ti serve
Quando dici, ""Si comincia""

E ho ancora la forza di guardarmi attorno
Mischiando le parole con due pacchetti al giorno
Di farmi trovar l da chi mi vuole
Sempre nella mia camicia

Abito sempre qui da me
In questa stessa strada che non sai mai se c'?
E al mondo sono andato
Dal mondo son tornato sempre vivo

Ho ancora la forza di starvi a raccontare
Le mie storie di sempre, di come posso amare
Di tutti quegli sbagli che per un
Motivo o l'altro so rifare

E ho ancora la forza di chiedere anche scusa
O di incazzarmi ancora con la coscienza offesa
Di dirvi che comunque la mia parte
Ve la posso garantire

Abito sempre qui da me
In questa stessa strada che non sai mai se c'?
Nel mondo sono andato
Dal mondo son tornato sempre vivo

Ho ancora la forza di non tirarmi indietro
Di scegliermi la vita masticando ogni metro
Di far la conta degli amici andati e dire
""Ci vediam pi tardi""

E ho ancora la forza di scegliere parole
Per gioco, per il gusto di potermi sfogare
Perch, che piaccia o no, capitato
Che sia quello che so fare

Abito sempre qui da me
In questa stessa strada che non sai mai se c'?
Col mondo sono andato
E col mondo son tornato sempre vivo

Ma sono giorni in cui suona più vicina

Caro il mio Francesco questa lettera ti arriva 
In un paese piccolo lì sugli Appennini 
Ho capito forse come mai ci vivi 
Che tanto ci si sente soli 

Ci si sente soli per quello che si è visto 
E poi per tutti quelli che han fatto così presto 
A montare su per fare un po' il tuo viaggio 
Giurando che per te davano un braccio 
Parlavano di stile, di impegno e di valori 
Ma non appena hai smesso di essere utile per loro 
Eran già lontani,

Sai quaggiù ce n'è in qualche modo di tre tipi 
Bravi artisti furbacchioni e topi 

Il topo canta solo di quanto lui sia puro 
E poi da via la madre per stare sul giornale 
Ed è talmente puro che ti lancia merda 
Soltanto per un titolo più largo 

E io che il mio disprezzo me lo tengo dentro 
Che il letamaio è colmo già pubblicamente 
Ma quei presunti mi puri 
Mi possono baciare queste chiappe allegramente

Caro il mio Francesco abbiamo tanti privilegi 
Ma tra questi certo non rientrano gli sfregi 
Di chi vuole parlare andando solo a braccio 
Di cose di cui non capisce un cazzo 

Non so com'era allora 
So un poco come adesso 
O sei il numero uno o sei il più grande cesso 
E il tempo che ti danno è fino al ritornello 
E tante volte neanche fino a quello 

Non c'è peggiore sordo di chi non vuol sentire 
Tu pensa a chi non sente e poi ne vuol parlare 
Ma caro il mio Francesco è già mattina 
Qui mi devo svegliare 

E allora avanti un altro 
Ti passo il mio telefono salutami la tipa 
Avanti pure un altro 
Convincila che sono il suo ragazzo per la vita 

Caro il mio Francesco è il momento dei saluti 
Ci avremmo riso sopra se ne avessimo parlato 
Lo so che non ha senso starsi a lamentare 
Di alcune conseguenze del mestiere 

E so che mi son fatto prendere la mano 
Perché uno sfogo fa sbagliare spesso la misura 
Ma come ti dicevo son le quattro del mattino 
L'angoscia e un po' di vino 

E allora vado avanti a cantare della vita 
Sempre e solamente per come io la vedo 
Che la morte se la suona e se la canta 
Chi non sa soffrire da solo 

E allora avanti un altro 
Qualcuno che abbia voglia di ascoltare 
Avanti pure un altro 
Qualcuno che abbia voglia di ballare 
E allora avanti un altro

E ti è toccato partire bambina
Con una piccola valigia di cartone
Che hai cominciato a riempire

Due foglie di quella radura che non c'era già più
Rossetti finti ed un astuccio di gemme
E la valigia ha cominciato a pesare
Dovevi ancora partire

E gli occhi han preso il colore del cielo
A furia di guardarlo
E con quegli occhi ciò che vedevi
Nessuno può saperlo

E sole pioggia neve tempesta
Sulla valigia e nella tua testa
E gambe per andare
E bocca per baciare

Hai fatto tutta quella strada per arrivare fin qui
E ad ogni sosta c'era sempre qualcuno
E quasi sempre tu hai provato a parlare
Ma non sentiva nessuno

E ti sei data ti sei presa qualche cosa chissà
Ma le parole che ti sono avanzate
Sono finite tutte nella valigia
E li ci sono restate

E le tue gambe andavano sempre
Sono sempre più adagio
E le tue braccia reggevano a stento
Il peso della valigia

E sole pioggia neve tempesta
Sulla valigia e nella tua testa
E gambe per andare
E bocca per baciare

Sole pioggia neve tempesta
Sui tuoi capelli su quello che hai visto
E braccia per tenere e fianchi per ballare

Hai fatto tutta quella strada per arrivare fin qui
Ma adesso forse ti puoi riposare
Un bagno caldo e qualcosa di fresco
Da bere e da mangiare

Ti apro io la valigia mentre tu resti li
E piano piano ti faccio vedere

Un po' più dure a morire

E stare al mondo è già di più un impegno
E adesso giri con in tasca un pugno
Nell’altra tasca il tuo rimario

Per chi vorrebbe solo farne parte
E avere almeno due o tre cose certe
E avere un dio che si diverte

Ma scegli tu fra botte e rime
E scegli tu fra inizio e fine

Ma scegli tu per primo

E quando canterai la tua canzone
La canterai con tutto il tuo volume
Lasciando qualcun altro a commentare
Che tu devi andare

Son stati giorni di tempesta e vento
Ed era pronto solo chi era pronto
Ma adesso sai a cosa vai incontro
Chi non è morto è già più forte

L’impatto con il mondo è sempre duro
Per chi lo vede come un posto scuro
Vorrei poterti essere utile davvero
Poterti dire che sei al sicuro

Ma scegli tu fra botte e rime
E scegli tu fra inizio e fine
E scegli tu
Ma scegli tu per primo

E quando canterai la tua canzone
E te ne fregherai di quanto piove
La urlerai in faccia a chi non vuole
E non sa sentire

E quando canterai la tua canzone
La rabbia l’innocenza e l’illusione
Ti toccherà cantare l’emozione
Che non sa nessuno

E quando canterai la tua canzone
Da quel momento in poi non puoi tornare
Da quel momento in poi dovrai andare
Con le tue parole

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
in a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me,
an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones...

Out of the middle came a lady

In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips

Lighter Shade of Brown,"You might ask is why we call ourselves the hip hop locos
Baking like Boston beans fartin out our vocals
No laxative for the shit that we get
So pass it on to Mike you Mikey he likes it
Others disapprove of the move that we swing
Not a brown underground thing not a pop thing
Yo you gotta come hard hey yo we in their face
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways
Versatile some should learn the definition
If money is the key then sucka why you dissin
The rap scene is hectic when it ends from when it starts
But most rap groups today are found on the pop charts
don't get us wrong we prefer the funk better
But a job is a job for the real go getter
Standing in the spotlight here come the bros
Throwing down with the brown on the hip hop locos

Chorus 2x
Hippity hop what?
The hippity hop locos
Hippity hop what?
The hippity hop locos

Once again its on never the same old song
cause me and my boy you know that we got it going on
Listen to while I flow
Got the skills to let em know
So let me be the one that was the one
Who told you so check it
Most didn't think we could flow rhymes
Excite write produce the whole 9
I don't want to respect cause I get mine
You got static raise up cause its fight time
I'm the beginning to end you gets no win
I put my fist to your chin you working
Pound for pound I hold my own when I come around
So ain't nothin but a come up when I'm throwin down
Like this like that spit game when I rap
Got back to bum rush and filled your cap
So everybody gather round and peep the vocal
Its the D also known as the hip hop locos

Chorus 3.5X

Versatile some should learn the definition 3x
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways
Versatile some should learn the definition 3x
I switch pop to hip hop to pop both ways

Now the brothers help me out on the side with my rap skills
Did what I had to do now its time to show you the deal
Never rap on the mic intoxicated
I might of hit the drink but the crew you know I can't fade it
19 years old and I never in the twelfth
For me being a loco I had to go myself
>From Santa Ana the city that gave me my pride
I kicked it and I chilled with the homies on the Westside
Born and raised a baby Latin with my little Latin friends
Thinking of ways so that we could make ends
Always stuck to hip hop cause hip hop won't flop
So let us swing our thing and let it rain like a rain drop
Snap back go pop cause the shop has been rocked
With a style that they call a hipper shade of hip hop
Goes out to those both friends and foes
As we close
Ugh..The hip hop locos

Chorus until end",Hip Hop Locos,1992
Lighter Shade of Brown,"Verse: 1 ( ODM )
Well you ask me what the definition of a homie is
A friend till the end, but some start when you're kids
Little traviesos that are always into something
Doing something bad acting like they did nothing
Well here's a little story about a homie named frankie
Had another little homie that was down for hanky panky
Sort of like Spanky and Alfalfa, Little Rascals
Doing what they doing getting away without a hassle
Like going to the schoolyard for your late passes to class

Cutting in lunch lines leaving other students last
And strolling to the movies to see a rated ""are""
When mom's dropped them off it's where E.T. would be the star

Stealing was an issue that just could not be ignored
Taking tapes and 45's from the local record store
Being good kids to them was nothing but bologna
Cause this is what you do when it's you and your homies

Chorus

Verse: 2 ( DTTX )

My situation with my homies wasn't all fun
sometimes bad sometimes sad, but had to have one
I wouldn't change it for a thing cause it's priceless
Your homies are your down, yup!  Can I get a righteous
As kids, we saw and we did what most kids never did
Took my first swig chilling at my homies crib
Searching for ways, so that we could make presidents
Life was hard beign a product of my residence
But me beign the youngest, I had to stay strong
Mom's was my teacher cause Pop's was already gone
Hung out in the streets doing my own thing
Living in the barrio, but I never gangbanged
Coming up was a must, growing up with who I grew up
I found out just who I can trust
Me, Myself, and I not fronting like a phony
I'm true to the game and I'm down with my homies

Chorus

Verse: 3 ( ODM,DTTX )

You want to be my homie well hey I'll tell you something
Hanging with my crew doesn't really mean nothing
Blabbing when I get all toured doing my songs
You gonna want to kick it, well listen up here holmes
It goes way back before you ever knew me
I hung with my friends and not male groupies
Just goes to show everybody where I'm coming from
Hey yo! D' break em off something

( DTTX )
So many people want to hang now that I'm in the rap game
They say that they're down when they don't even know my name
Well I could say that I have many friends
But a homie is true, through and through until the end
And ain't a damn thing changed
We're still hanging in the hood and doing the same thangs
Cause I ain't one to be a phony
I'm still true to the game and I'm down with my homies

Chorus",Homies,1992

(Verse 1)
Now as I stroll at an ease pace
The sun is beatin on my face
From place to place I want to get a new taste
Of that new world
That good life because you see in my society
Reality equals casualty
I'm just dippin no need for ego trippin
Clippin through my tapes cause my boom is steady hittin
Reminiscin bout the days when it used to be safe to cruise
But now days if you don't bite you lose
Huh& and I'm a man who don't deserve this static
It's gonna get tragic
If we gotta go at it
Yo, I'm just dippin in my ride
Havin a great old time
Rollin down the street bustin rhymes
I'm buggin out on the girlies on the corner
And you know they never treat ODM like a foreigner
Steady feelin the vibe
And everything is alright
When I'm dippin my ride

(Chorus)
Dip into my ride
Dip into my ride      
Dip into my ride and let me take you to the other side
Dip into my ride
Dip into my ride and let me take you
Dip into my ride
Dip into my ride      
Dip into my ride and let me take you to the other side
Dip into my ride
Dip into my ride and let me take you

(Verse 2)
Well its late night
Dippin like
Like veteran
Rollin down the street
Make fat lounge in my seat
As I stroll
Time keeps skippin
Life seems hard cause the dub got me trippin
On my way
Livin it like any day
That's the way it's got to be
When it comes to being me
Pop the new hit
Dippin through the neighborhood
Coolin with the homies
Everything is lookin good
Pocket full of benjamins
Sittin like that& fat
Macks so believe that
Gas up and I'm out
Pump my brakes
Pump
why all know what I'm talking bout
Think I get my serve on
Feel that vibe
Bumpin out the hoo-ride
As I hit the switches
Front and back, side to side
Dip into my ride

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Now I'm rollin down the strip
Cruisin bout 25
I glance to the left
There go my homey up at Hayra
(Hey what's up, homey)
Well what's the haps for the night
(Well, there's a party goin on and when we ll be sure show to rock the mic)
(Women&  ???, be sure to bring your jeep& man)
(Cause most of these girls got&)
Whoa
Yo forget that
I'm just chillin
Sit back and shoot the breeze
Now here comes my partner
Sittin fat up some D s

(Verse 4)
Well as I stroll
I steady see the O glidin on my right
Pull up as we stop at a red light
Check to see
Everything's right
Cause we ain't getting sweated by them fools in the black and white
So I roll straight to the spot
Bust that left
O, hits it next
Steady feelin the vibe
And everything is alright

Two lovers
And I'm ashamed
Two lovers and I love them both the same

(Verse 1)
You know I got two lovers so just call me the mack
As I slang my dirt like this and like that
Kickin up dust from sun down to sun up
Cause for me and mine it ain't nuttin but a come up
What's goin round another sets out to get me
Sweat me
In other words wet me
But the homies from the hood they got my back
Together putting it wide cause it's like that
One for all and all for one
Yo, there ain't no sunshine where I'm from
So I live my life by putting in work
Everyday all day cause I got it that way
Strivin to survive to keep my family alive
Cause it's not goin to work with a 9 to 5
So I live my life up under the covers
And they call me the man with two lovers

(Chorus Repeat 2X)
(Verse 2)
Well I got two
Not one plus a daughter and a son
I live day by day troubles put me on the run
I stay so comployed to buy each kid a toy
Plus I pay the rent
See that's how my money's spent
Now as for my lovers I got it undercover
Only one fives and tens just to buy the milk and butter
But that's okay they don't know I got a bank roll
Fatter than the super bowl and still play the hero
A zero I'm not
And I got a lot of pride
Brown pride that is
So a few of you might not understand
I got the juice together of own brown clan
So I'm the man
Who keeps the life just to keep my family strugglin
The pot is hot and keeps on bubblin
With the lord next to me I'm no different from the others
Except two lovers

(Chorus Repeat 2X)
(Verse 3)
Now I ve been there and done that
Came up like a fat rat
Ain't like they see me
Can't be that with a bat
Cause players only love you when they are playing
And if you are playing you know what I'm saying
I'm at the poin of no return
So take it from cause I ve already been burned
And now I'm singin that sad sad song of how I ved so fast and died so young

(Verse 4)
And all good lies must come to an end
If you think this is right you better ask a friend
Coming from another side point of view
I can feel the heart beat
So can you feel it too?
Life in the hood shouldn't be like that
It gets kinda rough when you gotta use a gat
In fact when you have to live with some others
Yo, I'm talking bout two lovers

Half a million dollars made him feel so well
He got to eatin' his lunch and couldn't hardly tell

It ain't never been no mistake”

after he'd find out that mama couldn't understand him, and he couldn't
understand the way his mama was doin' him, he packed up his little
flower sack, and he decide that he would leave.

call Mister Charlie's. So he walked up to mister Charlie, mister Charlie
was workin' round in his rose bushes 'n things... so he taps him: mi-mi-mi... say Mister! But he didn't know his name that time. The man
straightened up and said my name is mister Charlie. He say
mi-mi-ch-ch-ch-ch- He said but boy I ain't got to fool with you, you
can't work. He said, me-me can work!

the back, said and if you promise me that you will stay in this bunk
house, and watch my mill, and keep the fire from burning my mill
down, say I live two blocks up the road, say and if you see the
mill's on fire, say you run up and tell me the mill's on fire, you got a
home and meal as long as I've got it. Ta-ta-ta-ta-thank you mister
Charlie. So the little old boy went to bunkin' that night.

to tell him his rollin' mill was on fire. So mister Charlie said, I ain't got
time to fool with you. So the little boy stuttered too bad for him to
understand. So mister Charlie stooped over him again, he pat him on
the back, said ye-ye-ye-ye-your ro-ro- he said Wait a minute. He
said, if you can't talk you must sing, and he hollered:

Nobody does it like a prophet, it's gone before you know you lost it
There are reasons you keep your hands tied, there's certain things you shouldn't have tried
So if you gotta tell me something, you better go from the beginning

We all forget to sleep, and crash at someone's feet
Everybody skips a beat
We let the chances pass, the few we held so fast
Everybody breaks a glass

And here I'm standing in the middle, not just a little but a hill full
Wondering how I got a head cold, wishing I didn't know what I know
It's never been about the money, we're worthy or we are not worthy
However much you got on your plate, you're as good as you reciprocate

We all pretend to keep our tongue out of our cheek
Everyone's the fool they seek
We all go off the track, and feel for our way back

Shook
Scared to look
At peers when they peer back
It's weird how we fear that

It's weird how we wear masks
It appears that we fear our own tears
More than tear gas
My team's struggling in years past

Looking to draft beers
To bring cheers back
But when the drinking game's finished
No Guinness just a clear glass

Seeing our real image mirrored back
The places that we go to cope
It's so strange
When we're older folks

It don't change
Trying to hang, we don't know the ropes
When we fall, we got more than our shoulders broke
It's no game

It's why we overdose on cocaine
Get our brains comatose, there's no blame
If you've ever know shame
Known pain

Known days when it really don't feel okay

Somewhere perfection lies, but not for you and I

Now the road is a mine field
I can't follow the way she moves
I can't see past the shadow
You make the darkness disappear
I feel found when you stay near
I know where I am when you are here.
My way becomes so clear

When you are gone
Will I lose control? 
You are the only road I know
You show me where to go
Who will drive my soul? 

Seems somebody burned out the signs
I can't expect the hard curves
There is no borders
There are no lines
How can I know where to turn? 
You make the street lights reappear
I feel bright when you stand near
I know what I am when you are here
My place becomes so clear

When you are gone
Will I lose control? 
You're the only road I know
You show me where to go
Who will drive me soul?

Makes a good man convert?

And our demons to fight
But how can I win when
I'm paralyzed?

Wrap their fingers round my throat

Wrap their fingers round my throat

Into such fantasies

Maar je moeder loopt te stressen ewa laat dat broeder
Je hebt liever dat het gaat als vroeger
Maar dan moet je niet slapen, je moet vaker zwoegen
Droeg kapotte Nikes, ik loop niet naast m'n schoenen
Geen hoer maar toch laat ik heel de straat me voelen
Voor m'n jongen door het vuur ik hoef geen naam te noemen
Scotoe zoekt bewijzen maar hij maakt het moeilijk
Harde jongen toont niet vaak gevoelens
Zoveel money in me mond mattie laat me spoelen
Want ik praat alleen maar saaf stuur het na m'n moeder
Ik kan m'n strijders en m'n haters voeden

E-e-h-eeeh
Op een dag zitten we safe, geen stress zijn we allemaal weg
E-e-h-eeeh
Van waar ik kom geen films, geen grap het is allemaal echt
E-e-h-eeeh
Ik ging fout deed dom zet het allemaal recht
E-e-h-eeeh
En als we kijken na de fouten die we maken zijn we allemaal slecht

Het lijkt zo ver tot je ziet dat het echt is
Toch mis ik de tijden op straat van vroeger
Geen elastiek meer ik stack nu in plastic
Ik kan jou zeggen hoe die zaken moeten
Je mag op me klimmen want bedragen roepen
En ik zie hoe jonge jongens hier salaris zoeken
Ik zat te denken om vandaag te boeken
Maar dan loop ik wat mis ik kom uit rare hoeken
Heb die rode zool maar loop niet naast m'n schoenen
M'n leven is veranderd ik heb schaafgevoelens
Ja patron lang in Morro maar hij maakt miljoenen
Pak het in 3D ik laat die haters voelen
Pak het van dichtbij, ik laat die haters zoomen
We stacken groene tuin nu met paarse bloemen
Voor m'n jongen door het vuur ik hoef geen naam te noemen

Houd je kwaliteit goed en je klanten blij

Ik wil weten wat de plan en de winst is
Maar kan jou zeggen hoe die life in de wind is
Te laat op m'n vlucht maar geen stress ik vlieg business
Dus ze wachten op mij, ik heb fans, ze willen foto en ze wachten op mij
Maar ook engelen des doods en ze wachten op mij

Ben tot vroeg in morning op de fucking wegen
Fock die player haters
Man, I get that paper
Jullie slapen uit, ik sla een nachtje over

Een nieuwe Merrie naar een nieuwe Rover
Draai een hele dikke en lig achterover
Ik ben met de dealers en ben met de rovers
Ik kom van de bodem, maar we staan nu boven
Bouw een lift, ik wil geen trap meer lopen
Laat je club verbranden als we binnenkomen
Laat de brandweer komen, maar ben niet op blussers
Ze zat net te pijpen en je nu te kussen

I'm stuck here again
And I can see
That I'm not digging my way out
I'm digging my grave

Arms are weak from holding up this front
No escape and no surprises
Complicated compromises

Break free, 
Break free from everything
Break free before it breaks me

How you can be the brighter star
And light up the sky
Well I can't seem
To even light up my own way
And I've burned out from trying

I've become what I despise
Paralyzed inside a lie
Arms are weak from holding back the flood
Sinking as the waters rise
Drink myself to sleep each night

To be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of

I'm here right now, will I see tomorrow?

But nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?

I guess they won't
I guess I'm fucked

Johannes Brahms is often mentioned 
In the same breath as Bach and Beethoven

These models inspired him 
To write some of the greatest music
Of the romantic era

Brahms said with great conviction:

But I am Johannes Brahms

If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?

Walk on through a red parade and refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground and makes us forget all common sense
Don't speak as I try to leave 'cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull and I push too deep then I'll fall right back to you

Like Moths to Flames,"Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I'll call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure of what I stand for
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore!

This is it, boys, this is war, what are we waiting for?
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype save that for the black and white
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

That's alright I got a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering just who I am, (who I am, who I am)
Oh, who am I?

Well, Some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared that you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win, I always win
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I still not sure of what I stand for
What do I stand for? What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know (so come on)

So this is it? I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?

When I see stars that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like this one, (so come on)
(So come on)

Well, this is it, guys,
That is all five minutes in and I'm bored again
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home;
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go

Who the fuck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun?

My heart is breaking for my sister and the con that she called love
But when I look into my nephew's eyes
Man you wouldn't believe, the most amazing things that can come from
Some terrible lies !
Some terrible lies !
Lets go!

The other night,
You wouldn't believe the dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we'd both agree (we'd both agree)

About worrying ya moms, and burying ya best cat, 
Talking about revenge while you carrying his casket, 
All teary eyed bout to take it to a mattress.

Talkin' bout where I be, yeah

He could've made more but he didn't sign his contract
As far as street guys we was dealin' crack
That's just how the game goes I don't owe nobody jack

Like a rose, flipping down the street
Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet)
Bumping to the beat (bumping to the beat)
These streets they keep me busy yeh
Makin' bread
And I'm ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Oh here I go!
Ballin making dough
Working for myself

Cause they know
That I'm ballin'

Do that, who that, you that one they called on
Baller' get your ball on
It's all on now fall on to a new groove
Really ain't nothing to prove
We, set the mood
Or shoot some pool
Or blaze a Cool
What? What up fool
Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my small kitchen ?throw?
You know I gotcha
Watch out, no need to pull your glock out
It's a players affair, now
Look at my hair and the girls wit me
They got the same thing on
Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on
Cause my uncles about to get their sang on
And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'
Keep it ballin'

He starts to mill
Just rollin' true his town
Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)
Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)
Because he's loved
Loved in every city
That's why he's ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')
Yeh ballin'
(Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin')

There it is cause it is there
Now have a seat and come hit the game from a player
They say time brings change and change brings time
It's so genuine and so divine
It's been so long in fact its overdue
Now tell me baby girl what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you
I fell for you, I'll always look over you
There's really not much that a player would'nt do for you
So quit stallin' and fallin'
And come get a bar of some of this ballin'
Now quit stallin' and callin'
And come get yaself a bar of this ballin'

But I really wanna let niggas know what's happening though

Popping collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoeing cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay selling, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thugging off on the stereo
Killing 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothing, we keep getting more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top

On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least

With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool man
Go on and do yo' thing, gang-bang
in the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showing me around they house, then he slide me in the back
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out man
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfucking L.B.C.

If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;

Can't survive on his own, can't take good care of his 

Family, you know what I mean son
I mean, you were put in this world by yourself
You're supposed to depend on you

Lil B,"Time flies, time flies. As we keep living and as we keep being positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories. Mac miller, I love you

All of my homies used to get on my case like ""when you 'bout kill 'em?""
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprouts some children
But I've been murderin' the game, almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these Nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half man and half amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man, my mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches can still can fuck my hologram, god damn

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive

You can see the way that time flies
Time files, try to catch it
Time flies, time flies
Try to catch it

You can expect the unexpected
These dreams are manifested from my head into reality, they seems a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless, with an ego big as Texas, thinkin' ""I'm the man""
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the clear as small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk a path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone, on the road
Even thought I know they need me at home
Keep my control from a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own, punches like this probably beat up Stallone

And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride

Popping that gangsta shit on the radio, and it's disturbing you
Big Moe nigga that's my big dog, and my love ain't never gon withdrawal
So we clicked up coming to get why'all, my nigga Ja said you's a bitch dog
I'm a soldier, these niggaz ain't never gon learn
Fucking with the fire bitch nigga you freezing, then you burn
This is M-O-E, Murder Of Everything in front of us
And can't nobody stop it, because the reaper's coming to cancel every one of us
And it's all gravy, all of my niggaz are hard plus we all crazy
Wishing I can be a peaceful man and, hoping that the Lord save me
Fuck a nigga named 50 Cent, you nothing but change
I'm a whole dolla nigga, hanging one in your brain


Now can you picture see smoke out choked out, with Guerilla Maab
Mob figgas representing, and we here to do the job
Got my step-on nigga shoes on, 'case it get dirty
'Cause man it's going down, in the Thirty
It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B
Black H2 Hummers, when we holding the Avenue
Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap
Nigga they call me hit man, don't get your wig pushed back
Man some of these niggaz, is bitches too
Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you
Archie Lee been real, before I had a crew
Get it right don't get it wrong, I stay's in the zone
Plus my piece got yellow stones, like I stayed on the Stone
I spit that hood shit, that wood shit
Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you
Niggaz getting ran over, in a Rover
Trae forever staying sober, like a Jehovah
Witness I'm at your door brah, door brah

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Let's take it, to the streets
Any one of you, motherfuckers got beef
I will fill you, with heat
Get the nine millimeter fitted up in my denim, on my creep
Who that want to do that, bitch or come through that
And sweep up, that street
I'm a motherfucking G, and bitch you gon' listen to me
When I speak, ain't got no time to try to be friendly
Motherfuckers, must didn't hear me
Move around bitch, before you feel me
We smoke em, and choke em
Then fry a motherfucker, just like a poker
The game is now over, be the next
To the thoedest cats or now open, are you playing with me boy
Watch a nigga bob and weave, and then we break jaw
We ain't barring no law
Snap rugged and rough, and playing this game raw
Bitch we ready for war, anybody running up is bound to get scarred
D-O-you-G I are, dropping bombs up on you bitches going hard


These niggaz be plexing and talking down, on a G ass nigga
Sweet pea ass nigga, fuck around and catch the heat ass nigga
Beefing with me a nigga named be	, you silly rabbits finna see
A guerilla thriller will kill a nigga, in these H-Town streets
Ready for war boy we raw, I thought I told you cats
Who was the nigga that had to bust, and make the crowd move back
Never slacking or lacking, still attacking like I'm Sadaam
Set it off like the chirp that's going off, on the alarm
Doing harm nigga we swarm, on any and every hater in sight
Fuck around and call a nigga Teddy, steady turning off your lights
Night lights gon get burned, fucking with paper that I earned
S.L.A.B. gladiating on hating, see you cats gon learn

It's Jay'Ton, motherfuckers and if they don't know the name
From the wild wild West, slugging em like Jesse James
Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't want to get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

S-L-A-be	, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck
I'm a cold blooded killa, do a murder for the price
So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

Lil Bandit,"I woke up yawnin'
And it's another Sunday mornin'
Mom's cooking on the stove
And you know where I'm goin' back to the park
Know we gonna stay till it get dark
Homey's cruisin' they rides because they rides is sharp
Hittin' switches, lookin' at all the fly shi...
Drinkin' what we drinkin' and you know it ain't apple juice
Remember those days when we used to kick it
From cruisin' on with you late late when we kick it
Paint the flex, and never want to go home 
Even when the streets lights came on
We still rode till dawn
Three wheel motion, slidin' and coastin' 
Smell the bar-be-que kids running around just acting like fools
It's all good cause it's easy like a Sunday
Sunshine at sunrise, rollin' down a one way all day
And you know it's how we liven it up
And everybody got love and they given it up come on

Let's take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Like they do every Sunday morning
Easy, easy, easy

Everybody just chill, carne asada on the grill
Pop the top on the Cuervo, me and the homey's keep it real
Early Sunday morning waitin' for these ladies to come
No guns, nothin' but fun, one love underneath the Sun
See it's not where you from but how you kick it
Remember back in da days 

On a Sunday afternoon
Me and the crew, just jammin' the oldie tune
The weather was cool and the sky was blue

Daily spinning, hit the fire, chasing pretty woman
Stack loot, and tryna live life flush like crushed lemon
From the beginning to the end this Mexican always puts it down
Point Blank with the lighter shade of brown
Low rides squeak the ground with this pound
With familia all around is how we all get down
No scrappin' you know it happenin'
Keep the heat burning, rainy or stormy
And keep it easy like Sunday morning

Let's take it easy
Easy, easy, easy
Like they do every Sunday morning
Easy, easy, easy

I remember those Sunday mornings, shine up the ride
Puff the good feel cause we chill all night
Hit the streets from (?) to Manobello
Bumpin' them oldies and everybody's mellow
Roll down the window, feel the cool air breeze
Envision all the homey's around making g's
Let's kick on that Sunday cause tomorrow's Monday
L.A. liven homey cause it's the realest homey
From glocks to blocks all the streets be hot
Tricks jock chrome spinnin' if your car is hot
Bumping down, side to side pancakin' the street
System bangin' down the Paramount with cops by me
Phat Bandit with the homey D double T 
On a Sunday marinate and rollin' through streets
No tickets played it cool, just got a warning
'Cause everybody's laid back on a Sunday morning

Like they do every Sunday morning

What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices
What I'm going do, what I'm going be
If I have to please you and I don't please me
I got too many choices, too many choices

I've been so many places, still I don't know where I want to be

I gotta go, don't want to know your name
Cause your life, is none like
But I want you to know before I go, that baby, we could've had it all
We could've had it all

[Bad Azz]
Just to be alive is a blessing to me
Hey, you can lose your mind and heavy stress moving
Recently, I've been talking to myself a lot
I answer back, thinking 'I ain't supposed to answer that'
Is that a fact? Am I losing it for what I said?
Or is it 'cause a nigga talking and ain't no one there
I can't remember 'cause I'm scared, I don't look back
It's hell behind me and I ain't trying get took back
I know you feel me, stressing, learning lessons of life
Till they kill me, and we'll be, alright in the long run
Maybe mix son gin with my life 'cause we all gone crazy
And maybe, we'd learn to maintain
It'd help us stay sane, for the time we remain
Or maybe, the rest of the world'd lose they mind
And we'd die not knowing how we wasted perfect time
Damn, (we could've had it all)

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Beau]
I'm on top of the world and about it
Yeah, it don't make sense, only chase for sex and presidents
Probably next on the set but I check myself quick
My old homies want to get me (fuck why y'all), the devil want to hit me
Flashing cash that like ? on ass
Giving into greed, doing dirty deeds for the last time
I swore to God it was, but I lie
I try to stay clean but clocking green made the Holy Ghost die
That's why B.T. banging now, that's why bigets is slanging 'round
It's 'cause we don't know how, to stay sane in this game
Having chips and then they took away, it's just another face of pain
And while I got a couple bitches try and dirty up my name
Getting served by a couple hoes, gobble up the game, going crazy
And still grind sales in this paying-the-world game
But I choke, it ain't nobody fall but Lil' Beau
Tell the tag on my toe and nigga mourn what he here for
Friends be the snakes in disguise so I fear for 'em
Knowing Jesus watching all my homies and my kinfolk
Guide me the right way, you'll pay for ? yourself, yeah

[Chorus: x2]

[Lil' Tip Toe]
I wake up early in the morning everyday, when the sun rise
Just praying for the world to come together before my son rise
And get old, and have to go through life without a daddy
Just because your Caddy came through with a barrel pointed at me
Life is short to being happy, so I live with smiles and hugs
But some folks, they rather trip to spitting rounds of slugs
I keep it real for those that choose to learn game from me
I'd probably blast myself before you'd ever see a change in me
I'm going crazy out here, God help me if you will
I try to keep it real, on my journey up the hill for a mil
But still, I got too many choices to make
And while Tha Lowlifes rising to the top they hoping we brake
Lil' Tip'll never fall without a reason from God
You will never fall without a reason from God
(I got too many choices, too many choices, we could've had it all)

With candy toys candy yacht's

To slip and slide and diva enterprise
We drop candy hits that's how we bring it

If I act too sassy pardon me why'all
I be playing with Barbie dolls in my carnegie hall

Any of why yall prankstas, why yall ain't gangstas
Why yall just throwbacks
Put slugs to yo brain

The ghetto version of Norman Bates
Thug in the same
So ask about me
Porno with six stars
So don't doubt me
And niggas who ain't gangsta
Stay the fuck away from round me
I got dope in every county
Fuckin' bitches that's a ?
They call me that boy Nutty
Ain't no nigga finna clown me
Shit, I haul off and kidnap yo whole family
Strap up a bomb and kill every one for testing me
So when I go I'm taking all my folks
So when we hit hell, we still can go to war

Wool club loader, 4-5 in the holster
And its the take over
I'm shaking these bitches from off my cock
And these haters up off my shoulder
Claiming gangsta but you so coward
Talking bout trepos
Sissy ass bitch then take yo ass to Chuck Wilder
Women's prison and you still probably won't last for a hour
You a nigga scared to death you gon' get raped in the shower
By 6 dikes slapping yo ass with towels
You'll probably move yo bowels
You'll probably piss on yourself and crumble like a ball of powder
See we fo sho' folk, 9-7 four-door
Black Game claiming throwing signs out the window
We keep it all ""G"", since elementary
We represented from the block to penitentiary
Make em remember me, Burn one the O.G

He just asked me ""Pimp why you bangin' my trick?""
Hoes tell that nigga my name

Fifth of Hen, hydro, bull dagger and her friend
I'm a fat nasty dog
I make these hoes crawl
Plus I'm gangsta bought
Bust at my enemy
Plus I'm in they main girl draws
You ain't no kin to me
So nigga keep my name out yo mouth
You talkin' shit I'll cock this trigga bitch and run in yo house
And lay you down
Let me come into your house
So piss on the ground
Cock this pistol into your mouth
And don't make a sound
There's no way in and there's no way out
So bring me your gat

When Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky, and Mike had a curl

You heard gangstas make the world turn round
Well shit's gon' continue popping while fire burn on the ground

Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello

Lil C,"Lil' Keke the Don, Lil' see the Underboss
C.M.G. fa sho

Hit licks for heavy bricks, I get it 14 plain
Coming from out of town, it's gon' be 19 a thang
Rock for rock, zone for zone
Block for block, getting it on till the whole thang gone

I'm a rap star, but I got love for the do
Going hard with the snow, till it ain't no mo'
Cash flow, I keep it cracking and stay stacking
Distribute these goods, and try to ease away from jacking
My neighborhood, it rock like heavy metal
We raised that way, so you can play it on the ghetto

I got that work nigga, but I ain't Beatrice
Keep 17 bricks, in the pissy mattress
H-Town, H-Town, the city of dope
Got the shit channeled, with the chickens under the boat

Don't get me wrong, some fly and some float
My nigga in Rico, from the Gulf of Mexico
To the fat sack of do-do, that me and Ke' smoke
I'm the quarterback, my receiver wide open
For a pass, got the police on D
But shit knowing me, I'ma throw a T.D.

I'm in the kitchen, with the Pyrex shaking
I'm 'bout my game, ain't got time for the faking
I might be rapping, but I'm still brick breaking
'Cause ain't no limit, to this money I'll be making

I'm in the kitchen, with the Pyrex shaking
I'm 'bout my game, ain't got time for the faking
I might be rapping, but I'm still cake baking
'Cause ain't no limit, to this money I'll be making

You know the streets end up, and I just can't let up
Niggaz falling out of line, man they must catch up
'Cause the limo's, jacuzzi's and presidential suites
All that pretty shit, can't keep my hands out the streets

I do it dirty, the type of work that get a nigga thirty
Birds that get the worm, are the ones up early
It's a hard job, trying to survive the mob
Staying in the limelight, without a playa getting robbed

I got a brick hanging and it's wrapped like a gift
With a poisonous smell, that the dogs can't sniff
Airplanes and trains, mics and cocaine
It's 20 for a show, 20 for a thang

Rapping is beautiful, it got a young nigga shining
But some'ing in my blood, that just keep a nigga grinding
I get's paid, on a regular basis
So many faces, so many places what

I'm in the kitchen, with the Pyrex shaking
I'm 'bout my game, ain't got time for the faking
I might be rapping, but I'm still brick breaking
'Cause ain't no limit, to this money I'll be making

I'm in the kitchen, with the Pyrex shaking
I'm 'bout my game, ain't got time for the faking
I might be rapping, but I'm still cake baking
'Cause ain't no limit, to this money I'll be making

It ain't no limit to this money, I'm telling you mayn the game funny
Niggaz wasn't with it, till you mention big face hundreds
Get the bricks, load 'em in the train
Load 'em in the submarine, load 'em in the plane

It's in the game, like EA Sports
Slip and get hit with bullets of all sorts
You don't wanna play around with me do ya
Hollow tips shred right through ya treat you like I never knew ya

Behind my work
And I'm always one deep when I do my dirt, the truth hurt
It hit you like a boomerang and come back
Like dope fiends, digging for hard crack

Get your mind right, 'fore you fuck with mine
24/7, 365, I'ma shine
Ice gon' blind, don't make a mistake dummy
And I'll do whatever it take, to make money for real

I'm in the kitchen, with the Pyrex shaking
I'm 'bout my game, ain't got time for the faking
I might be rapping, but I'm still brick breaking
'Cause ain't no limit, to this money I'll be making

[Hook: Dallas]
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
And though you gone, you still on my mind
I often wish that I, could kick it one more time with you
Time after time, you still on my mind
Sometimes I wish that I, could pull the hands of time for you
I wrote this song, to let you know I'm down
I know you know I'm down, I know you know I'll ride for you

I just thought that I'd clear my mind, off the top and represent my dog
DJ Screw you know that I miss you mayn, so every chance I get I gotta mob
Never thought I'd be doing this song, but time after time I feel like I'm alone
I could recall kicking it like G's, but now I reminisce going down my songs
It really hurt to see your T. Jones, feel the wrath that he reaching fo'
Everybody wanna be, Screwed and Chopped
But they don't know, it's bout to be smoked
They don't feel the pain that I feel, the love that I got for you is too real
We been down since back in the day, if you was still here I'd be down still
Everyday I gotta ride for the team, S.U.C. for L-I-F-E
It's bout time I let 'em know who we be, you the Don and now the world gon see
Ain't no way that I'm gon forget ya, in my mind I gotta paint my picture

Ain't a day that pass, you ain't on my mind
I love you mayn, never put no one up above you mayn
So you know, that I gotta keep thugging mayn
Still all about you, and ain't nothing changed
You the reason I wreck, trying to get a platinum plack
For my brother Dinkie, I remember just what you told me
That niggaz in the game, can't even see me
Me and Jay'Ton, fin to get your shine on until you get free
I'ma get my grind on, me and you
On another level it'll be that way, even when my time gone
I had to show, that you part of my heart
And it really hurt, when they split us apart
All I know is I still remember, I've been repping you since from the start
Everyday on my pen and pad feeling sad, seeing shit that we never had
All I know is what's mine is yours, for the good times or for the bad

Though we, be homies sometimes

Kin folk I just got your letter, you and me we SK forever
You been gone, for bout three and a half
All of the times, is bound to get better
All I could say, is that we gotta ride
For the last and the time, you locked up inside
One day gon come, you bound to be free
When you hit that gate, I'll be right outside waiting
Donnie, you gotta hold your pride
I ain't forgot about you dog, everyday I ride
Everyday of the year, right by your side
Better believe, I'm keeping your name alive
And that's on the click
Even though, my pain might make me sick
My day coming up, and I'ma hit that lick
Then me and you, both'll have time to kick
Raise our kids like grown men, reminiscing like back when
Bleeding our block in a dead end, if time went back would I do it again
It's really hard to say, but I prolly would
Just to see your face, everyday got a time and a place
All I know is I miss you dog, South Klique for life and I'm still your ace

We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue that
22 that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Hook - 2x]
Too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging 4's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And y'all haters, y'all can kiss our ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Tite]
I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

The youngest guerilla in here mayn, Young Dyno
In here with Trae, D and S.L.A.B
We representing this to the fullest mayn, AK's loaded
And cocked, but now the clip's ready to peel on a punk

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Why'all niggaz better run, we ready for war
This ain't no game we off the chain, and playing it raw
Speaking my name you better quit, 'fore you lose your jaw
S-L-A-be	 that's on my life, we ready for war


Who gon represent for Texas, like I represent for Texas
And who this nigga talking down on Dirty South, niggaz rapping reckless
Scared took him out of the hotel, 'cause when Ro swang Ro swell
Eyebrows and jaws, so in my presence Mr. don't tell
I'm a motherfucking murderer, you the wanksta
Popping that gangsta shit on the radio, and it's disturbing you
Big Moe nigga that's my big dog, and my love ain't never gon withdrawal
So we clicked up coming to get why'all, my nigga Ja said you's a bitch dog
I'm a soldier, these niggaz ain't never gon learn
Fucking with the fire bitch nigga you freezing, then you burn
This is M-O-E, Murder Of Everything in front of us
And can't nobody stop it, because the reaper's coming to cancel every one of us
And it's all gravy, all of my niggaz are hard plus we all crazy
Wishing I can be a peaceful man and, hoping that the Lord save me
Fuck a nigga named 50 Cent, you nothing but change
I'm a whole dolla nigga, hanging one in your brain


Now can you picture see smoke out choked out, with Guerilla Maab
Mob figgas representing, and we here to do the job
Got my step-on nigga shoes on, 'case it get dirty
'Cause man it's going down, in the Thirty
It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B
Black H2 Hummers, when we holding the Avenue
Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap
Nigga they call me hit man, don't get your wig pushed back
Man some of these niggaz, is bitches too
Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you
Archie Lee been real, before I had a crew
Get it right don't get it wrong, I stay's in the zone
Plus my piece got yellow stones, like I stayed on the Stone
I spit that hood shit, that wood shit
Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you
Niggaz getting ran over, in a Rover
Trae forever staying sober, like a Jehovah
Witness I'm at your door brah, door brah

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Let's take it, to the streets
Any one of you, motherfuckers got beef
I will fill you, with heat
Get the nine millimeter fitted up in my denim, on my creep
Who that want to do that, bitch or come through that
And sweep up, that street
I'm a motherfucking G, and bitch you gon' listen to me
When I speak, ain't got no time to try to be friendly
Motherfuckers, must didn't hear me
Move around bitch, before you feel me
We smoke em, and choke em
Then fry a motherfucker, just like a poker
The game is now over, be the next
To the thoedest cats or now open, are you playing with me boy
Watch a nigga bob and weave, and then we break jaw
We ain't barring no law
Snap rugged and rough, and playing this game raw
Bitch we ready for war, anybody running up is bound to get scarred
D-O-you-G I are, dropping bombs up on you bitches going hard


These niggaz be plexing and talking down, on a G ass nigga
Sweet pea ass nigga, fuck around and catch the heat ass nigga
Beefing with me a nigga named be	, you silly rabbits finna see
A guerilla thriller will kill a nigga, in these H-Town streets
Ready for war boy we raw, I thought I told you cats
Who was the nigga that had to bust, and make the crowd move back
Never slacking or lacking, still attacking like I'm Sadaam
Set it off like the chirp that's going off, on the alarm
Doing harm nigga we swarm, on any and every hater in sight
Fuck around and call a nigga Teddy, steady turning off your lights
Night lights gon get burned, fucking with paper that I earned
S.L.A.B. gladiating on hating, see you cats gon learn

It's Jay'Ton, motherfuckers and if they don't know the name
From the wild wild West, slugging em like Jesse James
Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't want to get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

S-L-A-be	, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck
I'm a cold blooded killa, do a murder for the price
So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

I'm moving slowly and silent staring make it so my hustle is airtight
The city streets is hectic, gotta get it
Here tomorrow ain't a promise to me
So I don't live in fear, working til' I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, reup and that's when I read
It's over you never see me, it's being salt as it's lesser
The niggas straight out the gutta, murder without a question
Product of my surroundings, click clack from downing
All they know is he missing when niggas ain't never found him
Assaulting and stealing yet, I don't live it on regrets
I'm a muthafuckin' killer foreal with the same threat
I'm as gangsta as it gets and my advice for you is live your life
Ya never know when niggas might hit you on the city lights
Get it right, ya never know when niggas might hit you on the city lights
Get it right (get it right)

Born and raised on the north blocks, home of the hard knocks
Wanna get rich, find a spot to pump that heart out
Might get robbed or shot if niggas don't think you worthy
In my hood, I saw a lot of gangstas die early
Mama heart broke, and brother feel like he gotta fix it
So he loading up from straps, 'bout to hit it where they kick it
Got a first class ticket to the pen
Seventeen years old but up in there they all men
It's just another day, one come out, another go in
It's hard out here, you can't even trust yo friends
They'll have a nigga set up, whatever by the curb
It's every man for self, oh you ain't heard?
I'm a muthafuckin' hog, survive through it all
Stand up tall, we don't fall, naw
I been shot at but ain't been shot
Been in plenty fights but ain't been drop
Always came out on top like a hardknock

Straight up
Yeah, these tattoo tears cover my face
My momma got mad at first but shit she know who she made
I'm a G you gotta pray for me, it is what it is
Why these niggas out here playing, mayne this really my fear
What'chu know about them late nights, no lights and no food?
No diapers for the baby's, the house smell like booboo
Think of what'chu would do, what I tell ya what I does
Walk straight up off the porch, now the game has begun
My big brother on lock, so I stole his gun
He ain't gon' need it where he at, I'm finna go and stuff some crack and that
Big homie knew I had it on my mind
He ain't like it but it's right that run it through my bloodline
He knew if he decline it wasn't goin' to be hard for me to find
So he choose to put me down, and I got up on my grind
If you dawgs and you hoes say I'm glorifying crack
My momma lights off, the whole house pitch black, bitch!

For you jackers that's hatin'
Run up try to rob yeah bitch I'm a be waitin'
In the country see me skatin'
On my chrome lookin' good
You fuck with my bitch and I'm a shoot up ya hood
Still leather and the wood that's tradition down in Texas
Roll Cadillac we don't fuck with no Lexus
Bitch by my side in my ride lookin' lovely
Pour up out the paint we ain't sippin' on no bubbly
Screwed tape loud while I'm swangin' by the crowd
And the dro'' got me how it feel like I'm in a cloud
I'm a H-Town nigga.
Reppin' for P.A.T.
Big Hawk, DJ Screw, Big Moe and Pimp C
I'm a Shine for my city fuck them haters talkin' down
So holla at a nigga when you see me walkin' round

In my slab puffin pounds tryna take away my frown
And I

I got my mind on my money and my glock in my hand
Grindin' hard, paper stackin' tryna follow the plan
Pullin', gloss and steams chasin' million dollar dreams
Livin' the thug life I get it by any means
When times get hard I got no one to hold me down
So I ride with the top down and cruise around town
The boppers in line, cause I been known to be a slab rider
Comin' down clean, marchin' like a freedom fighter
When you ride 4's patna' stay strapped
The gone catch ya at the light and put one in ya cap
See I keep it in my lap, I ain't slippin' for none
I ain't got sprayed by any but homie I ain't done
I'm bout to raise a truck and drop a couple of screens

See the leather is perforated, them boys gone sho' hate it
My slab is undisputed I'm the number one rated
With my Top Drop

While they waitin' on me to fall, I'm a still stand tall
Ball hard in the mall
I been shinin' for a while, haters ya in denial
Since back in 9 -8 I been wreckin' freestyles
With spit lines that'll put a smile on ya child
And do a song that'll make the hood go wild
The flow versatile, When they hear it they like wow
That boy got talent yeah I like your style.
But uh
No pressure, don't let the bullshit stress ya
A ? with somebody test ya

Ya Grind lesser, ya shine lesser
Ya win when you don't let this material shit impress ya
Insides like a dresser, wood grain on the dash
My motto, fuck pain put my name on the cash

Now cars, clothes, and hoes is a thang of the past

Welcome to the South
Try to criticize us for how we live
They gon do the same things that we just did
Betta watch your mouth
Try to criticize us for how we spit
Then say you respect the money that we get
Welcome to the south
Watch em criticize everything we did
And expect that us to never even trip
We know them grills and candy paint
So be careful what you say
Cuz we might just throw it right back in your face
Betta watch your mouth

[Verse 1]
[Chamillionaire]

Uh I cross the globe
I hit a hater
Same whispers from state to state
If you didn't say then this ain't for you
Don't worry bout it cuz you can't relate
Before you buy me then you criticize me
While you beside me
Lets get it straight
Cuz you remind me of the kid beside me
Same rapper that you say you hate
Wanna criticize then fine
Say the south got simple rhymes
Everytime I travel I'm in the backyard that act just like mine
Same rhyme just different times
I don't think that it changed a lil
Used to show our grills and they be like ew
Nowadays they all say thats ill
I remember when the major label
Wouldn't even come pay a visit
Used to say they had love for us but
They just blowin them suspect kisses
Now you watchin me see you plottin me
Can't act like we ain't suspicious
Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh
I ain't leavin much trippin
Cuz im a man where I'm residing
Im decidin where I'm residing
Should never tolerate domestic violence
I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence
But I'm the owner not just the client
Shit the south is where I stay at

Don't knock the swagga, don't knock the swagga
Then turn around and be a swagger jacker
You a man and you should be a man
Don't walk around without an Adam's apple
We was lookin at it from a distance
But we wasn't trippin cuz it had to happen
Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin like you been a fan of rappers
You was hatin or participatin when you saw sub anuba slidin through
You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you
You actin like somebody made ya say it
Took your hand and then applied the glue
Turn around and give the mic to you
And now you end up lookin like a fool
Can't holla ya, some followers
and thats the reason I'm in the lead
The rest of yall are some benchwarmers and gettin mad cuz I'm in the lead
I'm switchin speeds, don't get fatigued
Yall behind in line, yall chasin me
Yall finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe
I won't lie and act like I'm the one supportin everything
Like southern rappers ain't never lame
Like some of these boys don't eff up the game
Most of us do our thang
And the rest of em leave my ears in pain
But thats him and he sure ain't me
So don't look at us like we all the same

Never been a socializer

She was sittin on butter
Hundred thousand under her ass
I was workin the wood, circle smokin candy mashin on the gas
I can't be you, I can't do you
I just do me, if you ain't
Been where I been then you can't
Be who I be if you ain't
Seen what I see and you can't see what I see
I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free
Been a legend in the south since the year '93
Pocket full of stones, menace to society
The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's
Now everybody pimpin and they all got keys
Nigga please, you work for UPS

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Refuse to talk about just, cars and bling-bling

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Osama Bin Loden is dropping bombs man, in a situation like this
How can I reach calm man, calm man, my nigga
This is hard times, like its so much gun smoke and see the stars
Shine
We living on dreams but is they coming true, what I'm gonna do
Make a million and pull a stunt or two, a stunt or two

Step into the world of a mob nigga, live in so much pain
The rain steady pumping me up, locked down on hard times
But I'm knowing that I gotta make it, running on my deadline
Giving out flat lines, cause if you think that I'm feeling
Fucking up by mine man, I gotta maintain
Its like everything that I had, it won't ever be the same
I feel I'm sicking home the cemetery
'Cause that's where all of my people rest
I can't take the stress, I'm fin to send it through somebody chest
That's why I walk around pissed off, strapped with a vest
I done been through a lot, ready to release the glock
Vicinities South, a brother on my Dickie, I be ready to ride
And I'm sick of this shit, I ain't fin to be hiding out, lately
Street life's got a nigga lost, will I wind up in a coffin
I don't know, I'm about to blow, I don't wanna take no mo'
But when I bust in a rush, you better hit the flow
Reality is a motherf**ker, that's what they was telling a nigga
That's just the truth, I lost my nigga Screw 
And Relay too and Andrew, now what about Danny Boo
That's fucked up, growing up in a childhood all alone with nobody
No mama no daddy, Z-Ro I see why these niggas can't relate to us
'Cause we them thugs of another kind
Making these niggas feel us two rhymes
'Cause if they lived the life that we live
They'd probably be broke down, crying and dying

Living in the ghetto, everyday is a motherfucking test
And I just can't rest, gotta keep a vest around my chest
Seem like everybody wanna start a little plex
Nigga but not me though, I'm trying to focus 
On bigger and brighter thangs
Steady trying to come out the storm
From hurricanes, to heaven and lighter rain
Running away from the police

Nigga fuck peace, its all about war
Nothing but a A-K and a H-K and a Tommy Gun
Sitting in the back of the car, I just can't cope
Everybody is a suspect, even if you don't bust I'ma bust back
We down to ride and, all you little 
Bitches and niggas get off my nut sack
Been eighteen lonely years, since I buried my T Dogs
When I be shooting the breeze
But I'm still conversating like she ain't gone
You can take a look at this light of mine
Never did glimmer, never did shine
'Cause I resort to a life of crime
And I know I'm wrong, but I gotta get mine
Fools don't understand me, a nigga be nervous 24/7
Puffing on sticky, eyes redder than period candy
Look at my pockets, I might as well stop it
Because them hoes on flat, look in the freezer
And a sive, ain't nothing but a stomach, these are hard times

[Chorus]

Ro pass me the AK, one of these niggas
Fin to pay for everything that I'm feeling, ain't no more healing
To the head with lead, is the only thing I'ma be drilling
My nigga this hard times, and the way that it look
I don't think that it's gonna get better, the only thing that's here
Is to suck it up, inside I know that's why we not giving a fuck
Ready to bust, on anything this life feeling, like we on our last breath
I'm quiet as kept, my nigga don't start 
Or else somebody gon see they death
Or hate us like that, but this side of Trae it be like that all times
The only thing that I know more than pain, is pain and me never dying

Poverty stricken and headed to prison
Running because of the life, you looking for codeine
Or amphetamines, I got em at the cheapest price
Living by the rules of the street life, fin to get niggas
Better beat the street light home, after dark I par-park
Everybody be tripping, attempting to get rich
Dig a bigger ditch bitch bleed, I'm a motherfucking man
Trying to do all that I can, I always held my ground
And I never ran, got shot for taking a stand 
I need a plexing, because I'm stressing, losing my mind
Smoking Wesson, my head I'm pressing, hard times

[Chorus: x2]",Hard Times,2016
Lil C Style,"Nine in the mornin' feds at my door (my door) 
Lou Cortez creakin' cross the hardwood floor (right) 
Dippin' through the alley I made my escape 
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape 
Man with no music but happy he's free 
Bailin' fast as I can bail down 19th Street 
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand 
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand 
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC 
Remotely controlled by the bombity 
But just livin' in big city is a serious task 
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask 

We're comin' with that G shit, that see shit that makin' niggas sick 
How does it feel to see a G from your clique? 
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?) 
Last night's dice game got my win on 
About a G and a half is what I come with 
But twenty five G's is what I left with 
Teatley was the word I heard 
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone 
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas 
I threw a see (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie 
Seven-four-four-tre back to back 
I sent two fools back to their lizzack 

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift 
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip 
But I chill 'cause my ho might call 
Ain't no thang 'cause I sleeps all day and slang when night fall 
And I takes a quick walk up the block 
With my Glock cocked, ready to make a stop where I set up shop 
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin' 
That's where a nigga'll be slangin 
I'm makin' a cool grip of shit, this ain't me 
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki 
And now the shops on deck 
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step 
Now I got ends 
And I'm rollin' a Lexus, fuck a Benz, and so many new friends 
But I could only trust a few 
And unawarely I trusted you 
But if only G 

It's Snoop, homies from the motherfuckin get-go 
Devoted and quotin', back in '84 
I was thirteen, G was a year older 
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders 
Gettin' good on the hood was the anticipation 
And yeah, King Park was the destination 
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night 
Even the smokers that be levellin' gettin' sparked tonight 

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey 
'Cause I represent like every day 
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot 
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot 
From at least about five years ago 
When I was in junior high goin' to Marshall 
The homey use to come up to the school and rock 
And leave and have the bitches flockin' his jock 
Damn them was the days of the past 
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin' people's ass 
And everybody a blast 
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz 
And that's your ass 
Fucked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha) 
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust) 
'cause I let it sit that day 
I wished I was there I would've clowned 
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound 
'cause he wouldn't even squad back 
Man we can't fuck with no niggas like that 
He'll get us all cracked 
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap 
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!) 
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah) 

Some of these nigga are bitches too 
And some of these niggas look just like you 
So if you've ever been toetone 
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on 

It's 5:30 in the mornin', now I'm yizzawnin 
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee 
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack 
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack 
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection 
And let me dial slow, flossin', tossin' a bitch (bitch) 
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention 
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten 
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends 
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal 
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G 
Young Daz, little nigga you can't fuck with me 

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you 
So what made them niggas try to spit at you 
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you 
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too 

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha) 
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you 
'Cause when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes 
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota 
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt 
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk 
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest 
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me fucked up 
My hood is gettin' hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin' 
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots 
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah) 
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1 
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though 'cause you don't really know 
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho 
Swoop G by the fuckin' L-be	's-see 
None of these nigga want to fuck with these (aah)

Check it, I bust a bitch till she butt naked

Eastside Long Beach, this one to eat
or all, rough, ruggeded and raw
We give it to why'all, us niggaz give fuck naw
It's like everyday, I greet my niggaz with a grin
They pull out the dice, starting grinnin and shake it twice
But I don't gamble, I pull a bitch like a door handle
Let that bitch leave nothing but toe sandals
and a map, it's like that
I ain't payin nothing until she bring they pipe back
It's like twice that, my niggaz fell to semm they like that
Fuck rap, fuck a around and you get snatched
What a tight match, and Tray Dee, Soo' and Style
When I say tight, they ""Ha"" like Juvenile

[Lil see Style]
Bust a regal, livin life illegal
time to say whut up to all my people (Whut Up, Whut Up)
Eastsidin, did my first crime with an automatic nine
And every since then I known about to grind
Tryin to rap, and slang at the same time
That was then, and look at me now
Ballin like a motherfucka, puttin it down

Eastside Long Beach as we represent

[Chorus: Soopafly]
Pimpin everyday (Every day)

Slap a bitch with this dick with stand vicious, we pimpin
Watch a sucker drop, bank rolls a hoe
While mackin keep me stackin bankin, and clothes (We Stroll)
With a limp from the limp of my clip
Plus this heavyweight peace with all the diamonds that drip
Bitch, you best recongnize how we ball day
All day every day, ain't no playin a tray
I'm like an ace of space, I bust I'm doin too much
Catch her in traffic I'm scoopin her up
Jumpin out the white with the park lights on
High as a kite, shootin dice all night long
I stay hustlin and mustlin to keep my effect
Smoke a quarter or a half, fuck a cheap dime sack
I'm livin to the limt or don't live it all, get it and ball
Nigga look at me and my doggz

[Bad Azz]
I floss my gold chain, with diamonds
The Italian style, the bad person Tray Davis, Soopafly, and Style
I never lost my touch not a bit
Today I'm better than I was yesterday with this 
Don't test touch my fast hand draw
If my strap is in the car, I'm going bomb to the shore
We the number one supporters, drugs, gang love
Smoke the weed, throwing up gang signs, we gangstas
Got to love, got to thugged it up for our mouth
I be on this every single day, no doubt
See me, I'm worth about 450 and ounce
I drop sixteen bars, and go buy me a car
I'm just an local universal with my vocal
Put the hip hop fan base in a choke hold 
My gang Dogg Pound, a gang of gangstas and entertainers
Sign an autograph, bangin, and we rich and we famous
