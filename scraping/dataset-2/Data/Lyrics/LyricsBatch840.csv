Peter Bjorn and John,"When all is gone, and things go wrong
We don't need them anymore
The artifacts and all they lack
We don't need them anymore

I don't have the means, and so it seems
For now I can't participate
But I've waited long
Now the dollar's strong again
I still can't participate

When we don't consume it seems we are immune
To all of the thoughts they sell
You know as well as I, that's a lie

'Cause I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story, but it always ends
I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story, but it always ends

And when I die, the angels will try
To count all my belongings
To measure my worth, pure gold, solid dirt
To see if I'm worth keeping

But the house I rent and the car I drive
I'm sorry but they ain't mine
You know as well as I, that's no lie

'Cause I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story, but it always ends
I want to spend, I want to spend
In a never-ending story, but it always ends
And it always ends, and it always ends",Poor Cow,2006
Peter Bjorn and John,"Let's take the easy way out,
Let's move away for good, 
Let's pull the curtains down and leave.
It's between me and her now,
Can't separate at all,
Let's put the cards back in the sleeve.

She's stepping on my shoes
And I couldn't want it more
That way I always know she's close
She's like a big orchestra
Playing my tiny tune
Let's pull the curtains down and leave",Roll the Credits,2006
Peter Bjorn and John,"I start to melt
With your arms, round my waist
And your mouth, starts to spell
And the words, telling me, to fade

I start to fade
With her arms, round my waist
And he mouth, starts to spell
And the words, telling me, to stay

And my mouth, starts to spell
And the words, saying its, OK",Start to Melt,2006
Peter Bjorn and John,"I guess I should have caught your call
But I just had to waste the phone forget it all
Bones are trembling, hands are cold
You don't know how it feels you've got me up against the wall

Maybe we could make this work
But I just had to leave before it's getting worse
I don't know what you came here for
It's almost that I wish we hadn't met at all

Your slap was like a wake-up call
The bruises on my face don't bother me at all
Bones are trembling, hands are cold
It's almost that I wish you had me up against the wall",Up Against the Wall,2006
Peter Bjorn and John,"If I told you things I did before
Told you how I used to be
Would you go along with someone like me?
If you knew my story word for word
Had all of my history
Would you go along with someone like me?

I did before and had my share
It didn't lead nowhere
I would go along with someone like you
It doesn't matter what you did
Who you were hanging with
We could stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folk
Talkin' 'bout the young style
And we don't care about the old folks
Talkin' 'bout the old style too
And we don't care about their own faults
Talkin' 'bout our own style
All we care 'bout is talking
Talking only me and you

Usually when things has gone this far
People tend to disappear
No one will surprise me unless you do

I can tell there's something goin' on
Hours seems to disappear
Everyone is leaving; I'm still with you

It doesn't matter what we do
Where we are going to
We can stick around and see this night through

And we don't care about the young folk
Talkin' 'bout the young style

Peter Bjorn and John,"We want it bad, so bad it hurts, lets wait
You turn me on, but the problems turn me off
Please pack my bags I want to close this case for good
Let make this steady its all bend out of shape
You look away now, I want to know why

Been calling bluffs like this before
Its so old
You just cant get worse
Ancient curse
But what if we could break that

We want it bad, so bad it hurts, lets wait, until the next part
You turn me on, but the problems turn me off
It wont let go, it must been buried for so long, its all so clear now
Don't get me wrong now, but we were doomed from the start
Its getting dark now, should have know why",Ancient Curse [*],2006

And did you agree
It's a must

In the middle of a hall in Barcelona
Trying to figure out how to get down
'Cause this solitude is bringing me down

The paintings around me, they don't understand me
I'm a bit too early, I'm seen as development
Curing adolescence

But I'm not just being blue
'Cause I have fallen, shape and color too
But I miss you
I miss the content

That is the focus, that is what all this school is reading to us
All just a part of what I am
It's just a part of my beating heart
Beating for you

So I beg you please
Please wrap me up, please take me up
Please hold me close unto your breast
Run down the stairs

Out in open air
Away from the ladies, the Japanese tourists
Their guards won't notice cause I'm so hopeless
Take me wherever you really only came from
You will be famous, seen in the headlines

Though you just kindly stole my heart (seen in the headlines)
Because you kindly stole my heart (a world famous artist)

If you're up for sharing I can split up mine

And out and in
And everything that's in between
And in my ridicule I thought that I was something special,

Across the mountains and the seas
Beyond the make-believe of any fairy tale
Why have the thirst if not to drink the wine
And what a waste to have a taste
Of things that can't be mine

And tell me where
Where is it written what it is I'm meant to be

Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space

Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips

I will be remembering

Peter Breiner,"Memories light the corners of my mind
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember

And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me

Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together

They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Teach them well and let them lead the way.
Show them all the beauty they possess inside.
Give them a sense of pride, to make it easier;
Let the children's laughter remind us how we use to be.
 
Everybody's searching for a hero;
People need someone to look up to.
I never found anyone who fulfilled my need.
A lonely place to be, and so I learned to depend on me.
 
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow.
If I fail, if I succeed. 
At least I lived as I believe. 
No matter what they take from me,
They can't take away my dignity.
 
Because the greatest love of all is happening to me.
I found the greatest love of all inside of me.
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve.
Learning to love yourself is the greatest love of all.

Peter Brown,"Well you got to clap your hands, it's a long way to heaven, 
You can't let living way you down.
As far as I'm concerned, it ain't no good for nothing
To worry 'bout where you're bound.

You got to be a friend to your brothers and sisters
You got to help them see the light
As far as they're concerned life is a journey in darkness, 
Their love is shining through the night

[Chorus]
And we got love love love in our hearts tonight, 
We got love in our hearts
And we got love love love in our hearts tonight
We got love in our hearts

Well there's got to be a way, we could help one another
Don't have to face the world alone.
We gotta hold the hands up, someone who needs you.
Help him on a journey home

You got to close your eyes, to see tomorrow, 
Imagine what the future could be.
Should you be concerned, bout the way things going, 
Then make it only love that you see

[Chorus]

Oh but that's the way, that the world keeps on turning, 
Round an round we go.
As far as I'm concerned, well it may not be heaven, 
But it's better then what's down below.

So let's all join hands, and head for that rainbow, 
Keep working till our dreams come true.
And we all live together, in the promised land, 
And start the world new.

A candy bar, a falling star, or a reading from Doctor Seuss

The cat in the hat came back, wreaked a lot of havoc on the way
Always had a smile and a reason to pretend
But their world has flat backgrounds and little need to sleep but to dream
The sidewinder sleeps on his back

Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
Call me when you try to wake her up
(Call me when you try to wake her)
I can always sleep standing up
(Call me when you try to wake her)

The photograph on the dashboard, taken years ago
Turned around backwards so the windshield shows
Every streetlight reveals the picture in reverse
Still, it's so much clearer
I forgot my shirt at the water's edge
The moon is low tonight

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night
I'm not sure all these people understand
It's not like years ago
The fear of getting caught
Of recklessness and water
They cannot see me naked
These things, they go away
Replaced by everyday

Nightswimming, remembering that night
September's coming soon
I'm pining for the moon
And what if there were two
Side by side in orbit
Around the fairest sun?
That bright, tight forever drum
Could not describe nightswimming

You, I thought I knew you
You I cannot judge
You, I thought you knew me

Try so hard to quiet your mind

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

The tracks that ran down the boulevard had all been washed away 
Out of the silver light, the past came softly calling 
And I remember the times we spent inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, it seemed like a holy place, protected by amazing grace 
And we would sing right out loud, the things we could not say 
We thought we could change this world with words like ""love"" and ""freedom"" 
We were part of the lonely crowd Inside the Sad Cafe 
Oh, expecting to fly, we would meet on that shore in the sweet by and by 
Some of their dreams came true, some just passed away 
And some of the stayed behind inside the Sad Cafe. 
The clouds rolled in and hid that shore 
Now that Glory Train, it don't stop here no more 
Now I look at the years gone by, and wonder at the powers that be. 
I don't know why fortune smiles on some and let's the rest go free 
Maybe the time has drawn the faces I recall 
But things in this life change very slowly, if they ever change at all

Peter Case,"Out on the freight line there's an old hobo camp
Where a drunk man lay sleepin' in a ragged old tram
And the lines on his face mark a life on the run
Is he somebody's husband, somebody's son?

Well every week the newspaper tells a story of rage
Where the victims lay scattered across the front page
And there's always some loner, on a spree with a gun
Is he somebody's husband, somebody's son?

From the death rows of prison to the soup kitchen door
Each soul is an equal in the eyes of the Lord
Though hatred consumes them, once they were loved
They were somebody's husband, somebody's son

So out on your journey down the highways of life
Cherish your mother, crave the love of your wife
And forget not the outcast and the homeless were once
Somebody's husband, somebody's son

From the death rows of prison to the soup kitchen door
Each soul is an equal in the eyes of the Lord.
Though hatred consumes them, once they were loved
They were somebody's husband, somebody's son

They were somebody's husband, somebody's son

They were somebody's husband, somebody's son","Somebody's Husband, Somebody's Son",1995

Peter Case,"One, two, three, four

Well, I started out 'neath the spring
And smoke down a gravel road where the gate was broke
I reached her house, saw the golden glow
The hearthstone fire all lined with coal

I said, I'm gonna change my ways

Couples were dancing by the jukebox light
Cops were out front sipping cokes uptight
She smiled at me, said, “Honey, come on in
Sit right here, won't you hold my hand”

I said, I, I'm gonna change my ways
Yeah, said, I'm gonna change my ways
Oh, I think I'm gonna change my ways
Yeah, I'm gonna change my ways
One of these days, oh yeah, alright

Saw a blackbird fly with red tip wings
Soaring above the penitentiary
In the northern lights but the sky was blind
Confusion sounds for a troubled mind

Said, I'm gonna change my ways
Yeah, I, oh, one of these days
Alright, come on now, hey

Yeah, by the rescue mission and the Goodyear blimp
Spied a one arm man walking with a limp
I got another chance then I blew it to bits
I made a new start by calling it quits

I said, I could've changed my ways
Yeah, I said, I'm gonna change my ways
Yeah, said I, oh, one of these days

Yeah, I'm gonna change the way I shuffle the cards
Change the angles I play when I'm crossing the yard
Gonna change my ways, I'm losing control
I'm starting over with a brand new soul

I said, I'm, yeah, change my ways
Yeah, I'm gonna change
Oh, one of these days, one of these days
One of these days, one of these days

",I'm Gonna Change My Ways,2007
Peter Case,"This place has changed since we were the kings
The shops torn down where we pawned our rings
8 by 10's no one sees no more
Like Telly Savalas hangin' by the door, Palookaville

Well, you can't tell your baby how a left jab feels
The first you take rocks you on your heels
Soon you're back in the car up for the long ride home
The canvas is splattered with your blood and bone, Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

The crowd was dressed in leathers and lace
They scream for more, why you work this fast?
Then they tore up their programs and they jumped to their feet
Whatd'ya say, we go get somethin' to eat? Over in Palookaville

Palookaville cast off by crooks
A punch drunk fighter with two left hooks
You only blame yourself for the way it went
You threw away your chances now you're sweatin' the rent
All in Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

Now you're one of the crowd walkin' where they walk
There's a new kid hoppin' and talkin' the talk
But you know what's it's like fallin' off'a the map
Your heaven sent treasure got sprung like a trap
Over Palookaville

Now there's a boy in the dark he's got a ways to go
Underneath the covers with a radio
He's tunin' in a fight from Bangor Maine
Once you catch the bug it's never the same, Palookaville

You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody to see
You coulda been somebody
Coulda been somebody like me

",Palookaville,2007
Peter Case,"Another night, another show
Another day so far to go
Couple hours, motel room
I'll be back on my highway soon

Forget tomorrow and the jam you're in
You're alive right now as you've ever been
The line you shoot will never miss
That's the old soul twist

The judge ignored your earnest pleas
Truth was buried, lies were eased
Come on down, try to sleep
Rest your eyes stay off your feet

You can walk the moon or swim the sea
If it's not too late it'll never be
You hold the treasure in your fist
Let it go, that's the old soul twist, that old soul twist

Bang it, dang it, hang it on the wall
Throw it out the window, run and catch it before it falls
Used to go like that, now it goes like this
Time to do that old soul twist

Pressures on, money's tight
Everything will be alright
Stay awake, stay alert
Do the things you know will work

The only strength is the strength to live
The only life is the life we give
Live to give, that's the word
And all the wisdom that I've heard

Used to go, now it goes like this
That's the old soul twist

",That Soul Twist,2007
Peter Case,"It's cold outside, Lord help those
Lost tonight with the freezing toes
In the dark with the rain drenched clothes
She's all the way down

The sky has cleared, stars are bright
Temperature's gonna fall tonight
In the park looking for a light
She's in a hospital gown

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
It's another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'll say

Some drink wine, some are smokin' crack
This lady all alone wants none of that
In the park with a cart and sack
Afraid she's gonna drown

A choice she made not long ago
Has led to this, how could you know?
The door slammed shut, her children go
To whatever life they've found

Underneath the stars, what's it going to be?
In the house of mars, stranded by degrees
Hunger in the night, answered with a prayer
See the passing cars, there's nobody there

Now the clergy have their doubts
Are they helping lazy layabouts?
Late at night the drunken louts
Terrify the town

The cops are young, well, they're just kids
They don't know about the skids
They just do what the gentry bids
From the other end of town

Underneath the stars, who will crack the seal?
Waitin' here to die, numbers on a wheel
Figures in the dark, crouch against the wall
Out here in the park there's no one to call

Asleep in the park rain or shine
A thousand crows on the telephone line
Ask her how and she'll say fine
She's all the way down

Dew drops shot like cannonballs
Crash on paper prison walls
Her heart stops beating and her breathing stalls
She's dyin' all alone

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

So now you ask what can I do?
See and know, they're just like you
You could wind up in the blue
Beneath a pauper's crown

Don't be afraid, you'll be surprised
If when you look into their eyes
You find a soulful feeling rise
You're all the way down

Underneath the stars, city by the sea
Headlights of the cars shine but no one sees
In another world, just five feet away
Look into her eyes, God bless is all she'd say

Cracking that whip
Making her own decisions
Taking no lip
Living with no conditions 

There's only one thing that she's missing

Peter Cetera,"Lying here thinking of a place to hide
I've got to get away
There are times like this when I'm better off by myself 
Stuck in a corner
Nothing more to lose, I'm a goner
I'm just chained by thoughts, surrounded by walls
And they're closing in around me 

Lying here waiting for the chance to run
I need to isolate
There are times like this when I'd rather be left alone 

Caught in a panic
Trying not to look like a manic 

Got to move, got to go
Got to get out of here
Leave this all behind me

No one will ever find me there
Solitude, solitaire
Won't you give me some bread, give me some water

No one will ever find me there

Mass confusion
Leaving me with no solution
If you find I'm asleep, better leave me alone

there's so many things I want to say

I don't want to lose you,
I could never make it alone.

I am a man who would fight for your honor,
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of.

that we did it all for the glory of love.

You keep me standing tall, you help me through it all,

I guess it must be fate
We've tried it on our own
But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

When love is truly right
(This time it's truly right)
It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes
Oh, and on the way it grows

Peter Cetera,"If you see me coming up an open road
With an empty glass and a single rose
Take a turn towards the shifting light
There you'll see my shadow lost in the night

Endless flight has no directions now
To a coward's kiss from a hero's vow
If I could find the words, I'd pick up the phone
If I was half a man, I wouldn't sleep alone

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings

Oh you shook your head like a wild horse
Beneath the southern cross in the frozen North
Oh when our bodies touched on that burning beach
I could have sworn that heaven was within our reach

Send me no more angels on a restless wind
All I ever wanted were the simple things
If a love like ours means anything
Show me a sign, honey, dip your wings

Time just crawls here behind my eyes
If the scar heals, can our love survive
Life's only purpose seems so distant now
If there's a chance at all won't you show me how

If a love like ours means anything

I can't believe it's over

There's nothing left between us

Half awake and half asleep
Have you ever laid there thinking
Was it all a dream?

Have you ever stayed up waiting
For a telephone call
Just to hear her say hello
'Cause you miss each other so

And times you really want to cry
Finding reasons to believe her
'Cause you'd die a little if she lied
And when in times of doubt
Have you ever tried to work it out
But still she leaves you wondering
What it's all about

And when she's far away
Have you ever felt the need to stray
And tried and then discovered
It just doesn't pay
'Cause with her, you can be true
And with her, you can be you

And times you really want to cry

Peter Cetera,"Merely by chance
Very unsuspecting
You caught my heart
Unprotecting me
Now I've fallen in love with you 

Just when I thought
Life was free and easy
You came along to me
Soft and breezy
Now I've fallen in love with you

And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man
Happy man
And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can't understand
Now that I'm a happy man 

Be with me now
Love me forever
Leaving you lady
Is something that I'd never do

I've fallen in love with you

You give to me, I give to you

How can I hear myself with all this noise
But all this confusion just disappears
When I find a quiet place where I can hear

One clear voice callin' out for me to listen
One clear voice (that) whispers words of wisdom
Close my eyes till I find what I've been missin'
If I'm very still I will hear one clear voice

I'm always searchin' for which path to take
Sometimes I'm so afraid to make mistakes
From somewhere inside me stronger than my fears
Just like the sound of music to my ears

The love you gave me
Nothing else can save me

But deep inside we've known
We'd be back to set things straight
I still remember when your kiss was so brand new
Every memory repeats
Every step I take retreats
Every journey always brings me back to you

After all the stops and starts
We keep comin' back to these two hearts
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall
After all that we've been through
It all comes down to me and you
I guess it's meant to be, forever you and me, after all

It lives from year to year
It changes as it goes

When you look at me across the crowded room,
Suddenly I want to be alone with you.
I hang on every word that leaves your lips,
Anticipate the moment when I feel your kiss.
Enough of you is not enough.
Do you love me, do you love me, do you love me that much? 

For so long, I've been trying to believe,
That someday, you'll fall as deep as me.
But it's just not there, love isn't always fair.

Why I felt weak when you were around me

I would rather be
Than to be back home with you

Out there just for me

You feel the same way too?

One drop will open up your eyes, rain love

It's the color of every sky, it's the way to change the tide
When the world is crumbling down on you and me
It's the calm that lifts the storm, it's the promise that keeps you warm
When you don't understand, just touch the guiding hand that comforts me

Rain love

Takes this lot to make you realize
No greater love could ever fill the sky

In a town called faith

From the country of wants and the sea of needs

Someday when I rule the world
Gonna stand by you
Love you all I can
You're beautiful
The reason I believe
Don't give up on me
I'll make it wonderful
When I rule the world

When I look into your eyes
Oohh it just amazes me
And the way I feel inside
When your changing me
Through the sweat and the tears
Moving step by step
I'll do anything for you

Someday when I...

High, High above it all
In the sky you promised I choose to stand
Stand by you I'll stand by you

And mail it right away

It came to me the moment you walked by
It seem to me you looked at me so sweetly
The moment that I stared into your eyes

Are you the one to steal my heart completely?
Are you the one that I am to adore?
Are we the pair that slips away discretely?
Are you the one that I have waited for?

We can toast the moon sitting by a fire
And then walk hand in hand for others to admire

Are you the one to paint the town so brightly?
Are you the one I simply can't ignore?
Are we the pair that dance together nightly?
Are you the one that I have waited for?

We can sail the seas on an ocean liner and then drink pink champagne
Our life could be no finer

Lock the door and stop complaining
Gather 'round and listen well
From now on we're entertaining
How to hotten up this hell.

Hold the mood and hold the chatter
Skip the food and stop the clatter
Can't you hear that pitter-patter?
We're not here to eat.
We came for the heat!

Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's hop the gods of love
Will shine above
And show the way.
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice
Take my advice
It always pays
To raise the roof!

Crush the ice and shake forever
Tell the evening where to go
And if you need a new endeavor
I can teach you what I know

Grab your partner by the collar
Bribe the barman with a dollar
Just ignite that mighty holler
Lead me to the trough
Till the light goes off!

Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's hop the gods of love
Will shine above
And show the way.
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice
Take my advice
It always pays to raise the roof!

Cut the strings and set the table
Gather roses on your way
Welcome to our Tower of Babel
Learn the language, come what may.

Spare me how the wind is blowing
If you keep the whiskey flowing
You can reap what you've been sowing
If you walk the plank
You've got me to thank

Let's raise the roof
Let's make a scene
Let's hope the gods of love
Will shine above
And show the way.
Let's call the shots
Let's roll the dice

The time for playing nice has run
Before the big hand hits the one
We've got to do what must be done

Raise the roof
Raise the roof
Raise the roof
Raise the roof

That could've turned the whole damn thing around
But that July something was lost
And never did get found

He was a sun that was waiting to rise
He had the look of a king in his eyes
And everything, everything was possible

And now he just laughs and says what the hell
And clings to the secret that he'll never tell
But I wish in knew what kind of scar
Can turn a sun into just another falling star

Now I get this deja  vu and I don't really like it
With this friend of mine that can't get it in his brain
He's a diamond lost inside the stone
He's a player born to win the game

But he's gonna blow it all, the brass rings in his finger
And I gotta watch as he throws it away
He's like a song that's rare and right
That no one's gonna play

He is a sun that is waiting to rise
He's got the look of a king in his eyes
And everything, everything is possible

And now he just laughs and says what the hell
And clings to the secret that he'll never tell
But I wish I knew what kind of scar
Can turn a sun into just another falling star
Oh, just another falling star

Can someone explain it 'cause I don't know why
Some people live like they're waiting to die
And I wish I knew what kind of scar
Can turn a sun into just another falling star

Some girl that I just met
For dinner at this place
On Lafayette

When it was time to go
She gets the check and grabs my coat

Mix 'em up, you pay the price

Acts like Jane

But it's a lesson every child has learned
If you play with fire
Your fingers might get burned

So let me get the door
And let me keep you warm
Why take less of me
When I could give you more

You gotta be careful
Foolin' with nature

A three-ring show that comes and goes too fast
The best of friends have been divided by a kiss
And if we can't love again, I can always reminisce

Cinderella beautiful, this one is for you
We almost made our fairy tale come true
And happy ever after was unavailable
Now two years after midnight
I'm still thinking of those yesterdays
When I was prince charming
And you were Cinderella beautiful

You know I don't like Christmas but thanks for the holiday card
I didn't know you moved so far away
The winter months were the usual mess back here in New York

I'm doing fine but sometimes, every now and then
I miss who I was with you and I wonder where he went

Peter Cincotti,"Ah well, he had nothing to lose, it was time to cruise
And he got out of that place
He knew just what to do and made every move
Without leaving a trace

He jumped over the fence and hit the ground
Running as fast as he could without making a sound
His feet were flying through dirt and mud
Each step propelled by a rush of blood

And all he wanted to do after all those years inside
Was make it out alive, make it out alive

Well, he's been running away
Ever since the day he dropped out of school
He never did what they told him he should
He just was no good at following rules

But he learned how to get what he wanted, alright
By using a gun and a switchblade knife
He'd start a fight and kill on a whim
And take your life like it belonged to him

And he always thought if he ever did get caught
He'd make it out alive, oh make it out alive

Oh, when the cops came around, they put him under arrest
But he couldn't care less
He didn't even blink when they threw him against the wall
He didn't think he did anything wrong at all

So they locked him up and they put him away
But he knew that he was gonna escape one day
And so he did and ever since then they tried
But they never saw his face again

Right now he's bumming around
In a small town down in Mexico
And every day he tells himself he's free
But he doesn't feel it though

He still falls asleep with just one eye closed
Looking over his shoulder wherever he goes
He's got a boat and a house on the beach
But he hasn't lived one day in peace

Watching how you brush your hair

And throwing pennies in

We were wearing caps and gowns
My mother took a photograph
I was the only one not smiling, I was too big for this town
I can't believe that I was only 17
A catholic punk who couldn't wait to scream

Come tomorrow
I'll be leaving this worn out, worn down place
I'll be drinking sunlight and dancing on the moon
I'll find me a girl that suits my ways
Spending all my nights and days
Just singing drunken love songs out of tune
I'll be rolling like a pair of dice, come tomorrow

The trees on Golden Avenue were bitter red this morning
As I shuffled through the crowd
Another dose of daily news, another cup of coffee
The same old runaround
And I turn each corner hoping that I'll see
A miracle just waiting there for me

Come tomorrow
I'll be leaving this worn out, worn down place
I'll be drinking sunlight and dancing on the moon
I'll find me a girl that suits my ways
Spending all my nights and days
Just singing drunken love songs out of tune

Going nowhere, like leaves are blowing past my window
Caught up in a wind they can't control
That's my story, a two bit kind of Peter Pan
Who never tried for Neverland
And I think it's time to find my wings and go

Come tomorrow
I'll be leaving this worn out, worn down place
I'll be drinking sunlight, dancing on the moon

Why don't you get away? Get away

Don't turn the bed yet
I'm not the maid
What do you want then?

They must have written the room number wrong
I am looking for someone named Christopher Scott
317, oh, I'm sorry, unless
Well, you must be, of course, you're John's wife, are you not?

Oh God, I see, it had to happen
You must be Kim, Chris went to find you
Please come inside, no one will hurt you
I'm Chris's wife, my name is Ellen

In a way, I am glad I am meeting you first
Understand, you were only a name till tonight
I don't know how I'd feel if our roles were reversed
Please won't you sit down

Tell me you are lying
We've been married a year, I am sorry, it's true
He said he'd come to get me
He says he tried to reach you, but what could he do?

Please tell me you're not married
You don't know, you can't know what I've done to be here
You don't know how he needed a new start

I feel walls in my heart closing in
I can't breathe, I can't win
As for the child
You say it's Chris's

Oh yes, madame, my son is Chris's
I had a dream for my son to belong
And not live his life in the streets like a rat

We aren't rich, but we'll shoulder our load
Chris and I are totally together on that
Then you must take Tam with you
Take a child from his mother, impossible Kim

You will take Tam with you
Then he'll get what I wanted for him
But Kim, your child needs you
Chris is married to me, we want kids of our own

Tam's chance lies with you now, not with me
No, can't you see
It won't work, it can't be

If you're saying that
Because you've made him change his mind
Chris must go away
And leave me and his son behind

If you're saying
That because my husband has another wife
My child has no future, like the dust of life
He must come tonight to my place
Tell me so to my face

I don't want this, I didn't come here
To meet a girl who loves my husband
I came here to help, but what do I do?
Now, after this, what do I?

But here you are with the dawn

Wish I'd forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you when my love went away
Now everyday I start by saying to you
Good morning heartache, what's new

Stop haunting me now
Can't chase you no how
Just leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight through Sunday blues

Good morning heartache, here we go again
Good morning heartache, you're the one who knew me when
Might as well get used to you hanging around
Good morning heartache, sit down

Pouring in my heart, causing tears of pain.

Memories of a life with you 
Take me with you, I'm the one who's 
Gonna lift you, to your Shining Star.

Spreading love's rainbow--an everlasting flame.

No, I won't believe your heart is cold
Maybe just afraid
To be broken again
Let someone with a deep love to give
Give that deep love to you
And what magic you'll see
Let someone give his heart
Someone who cares like me
Let someone give his heart
Someone who cares like me
Someone who cares like me
Someone who cares like me",Watch What Happens,
Peter Erskine,"I want to see your face in every kind of light
In fields of dawn and forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the seasons and the times of your days
All the nickels and the dimes of your days
Let the reasons and the rhymes of your days
All begin and end with me

I want to see your face in every kind of light
In the fields of dawn and the forests of the night
And when you stand before the candles on a cake
Oh, let me be the one to hear the silent wish you make

Those tomorrows waiting deep in your eyes
In the world of love that you keep in your eyes
I'll awaken what's asleep in your eyes
It may take a kiss or two

Through all of my life
Summer, Winter, Spring, and Fall of my life
All I ever will recall of my life
Is all of my life with you
",What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?,
Peter Erskine,"Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I 
In my mind we can conquer the world 
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I",You and I,
Peter Erskine,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1986
Peter Erskine,"Listen while you read!
In the night, though we're apart,
There's a ghost of you within my haunted heart
Ghost of you, my lost romance,
Lips that laugh, eyes that dance

Haunted heart won't let me be,
Dreams repeat a sweet but lonely song to me

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart

Dreams are dust, it's you who must belong to me
And thrill my haunted heart,
Be still my haunted heart",Haunted Heart,1989
Peter Erskine,"The party's over, the game is ended, 
the dreams I dreamed went up in smoke.
They didn't pan out as I had intended; 
I should know how to take a joke.

I'll go my way by myself, this is the end of romance. 
I'll go my way by myself, love is only a dance. 
I'll try to apply myself and teach my heart to sing. 
I'll go my way by myself like a bird on the wing,
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.
I'll go my way by myself, here's how the comedy ends. 
I'll have to deny myself love and laughter and friends.
Grey clouds in sky above have put a blot on my fun. 
I'll try to fly high above for a place in the sun.
I'll face the unknown, I'll build a world of my own; 
No one knows better than I, myself, I'm by myself alone.",By Myself,1990
Peter Erskine,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1992
Peter Erskine,"I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her to
I love her

She gives my everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I 
Have you near me

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her, ooh",And I Love Her,1993
Peter Erskine,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1998
Peter Erskine,"Saturday night comes creeping
Saturday night comes creeping cold
Saturday night comes laughing and dancing
Sunday leaves you cold

Saturday night comes crying
Saturday night comes weeping and sore
Saturday night finds you looking for friends
That you don't want to see no more

Saturday night comes crazy
Saturday night comes swinging and wild
Saturday night comes sharp as my suit
I want to be Sunday's child

Saturday night comes creeping
Saturday night comes creeping and cold
Saturday night comes laughing and dancing
Sunday leaves you old

Leaves you old",Sunday's Child,2000
Peter Erskine,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,2000
Peter Erskine,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2003
Peter Erskine,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2005
Peter Erskine,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love,2016
Peter Fessler,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1996
Peter Fessler,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1997
Peter Fessler,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si. 

The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear,

Das Leben ist ein auf und ab
Es geht mir auf den Sack
Ich hab das Laufen satt

Ich will das sich die Scheine häufen
Ich will geile Bräute
Und ein kleines Häuschen

Und dafür geh ich mit dem Kopf durch die Wand
Denn das ist der Weg aus der Gosse zum Strand
Ich bin frech, sie glotzen mich an
Ich fick' mich von Fotze zu Fotze durchs Land

Guck mich an die Krone steht mir seht ihr
Ich geh hier nicht mehr weg versteht ihr
Gebt mir was mir zusteht
Ich will das es mir gut geht
Ich dreh' auf und ich will
Das ihr mir dabei zu seht

Nun weht ein andrer Wind
Weil wir anders sind
Du kannst mir glauben
Alles wird jetzt besser ganz bestimmt
Ich pack' den Stier bei den Hörnern wie beim Rodeo
Egal wie der Bulle kämpft oben bleib ich sowieso

Das Leben ist wie ein Rodeo
Der Bulle bockt ich sag jippie-O
Ich sitze oben gib die Krone hoch
Ich werd' mir den Thron und die Kohle holen

Hast du mich gesehen Mama
Ich bin on Top
Ich bin die Creme de la Creme Papa

Es bringt voll Bock richtig abzugehen
Aber das es auch mal flopt das war ab zusehen
Es floppte schon ein paar mal in meinen kurzen Leben
Da half mir der Barmann paar kurze heben

Kein Label öffnete die Kasse
Babe hatte mich verlassen
Shame on you ihr Deppen
Heute lieben mich die Massen

Ich fahr' ab geschmeidig
Denn ich hab's nicht eilig
Dickes Glied is heilig
Dicker Jeep ich weiß nicht

Bin über dreißig
Jede süße weiß ich
Mach kein Killerbuissnes
Ich mach Kinder und bin fleißig

Bin Chef mir geht's eh gut
Meine Band is' so fett
Das es weh tut
Du willst Seed blocken
Alta du wirst weggeräumt
Will ich Seed Fans schocken
Sag ich Sido ist mein bester Freund

Der Bulle bockt ich sag jippie-O
Ich sitze oben gib die Krone hoch

Ich bin teurer Weißwein
Ich bin so cool ihr denkt
Hier kommt 'ne neue Eiszeit
Ich pack' Holz in den Ofen
Das das Feuer heiß bleibt
Erst kommt die Arbeit
Dann die Freizeit

Von nichts kommt nichts
Glaub mir das is' so
Jetzt hören sie meine Songs
Laut in der Disco
Doch das reicht nicht
Ich bleib fleißig
Es muss nicht allen gefallen
Darauf scheiß ich

Ich krieg den Preis
Ich hol' mir die Kohle
Man kann nicht gut leben
Ohne die Kohle
Ich streng' mich an man
Ich bleib' am Ball
Ich hab' gemerkt mit Spaß
Kann dir das leichter fallen

Also rauf auf den Bullen und jippie
Ich reit ihn ein für euch
Und dann könnt ihr mitziehen
Es ist nicht schwer
Bis nach oben zu steigen
Die Kunst dabei ist
Lange oben zu bleiben

Das Haus am See

Und am Ende der Straße steht ein Haus am See.
Orangenbaumblätter liegen auf dem Weg.
Ich hab 20 Kinder meine Frau ist schön, hmm
Alle kommen vorbei ich brauch nie rauszugehen.

Hier bin ich gebor`n, hier werd ich begraben.
Hab taube Ohr`n, `nen weißen Bart und sitz im Garten.
Meine 100 Enkel spielen Cricket aufm Rasen.
Wenn ich so daran denke kann ich`s eigentlich kaum erwarten",Haus Am See,2008
Peter Fox,"Ich kletter hoch
Es rollen Steine
Und sie fallen auf Dich drauf
Du siehst sie kommen
Gehst nicht zur Seite
Du dachtest Du fängst sie auf

Du greifst nach meiner Hand
Wir sinken in den Sand
Ich halt Dich fest so gut ich kann
Doch wir kommen nicht voran
Du siehst mir ins Gesicht
Ich seh alles
Nur Dich nicht
Zusammen allein
Denn wir haben kein
Alphabet das wir Beide teilen
Die Spur hinter uns hält uns zusammen
Doch auch sie zerfällt irgendwann
Ich weiß dass unter uns beiden der Boden bricht

Ich kann nicht mit
Und nicht ohne Dich
Vielleicht besser ohne Dich

Du hast gekocht
Es gab Steine
Die liegen jetzt in meinem Bauch
Sie sind schwer
Ich bin alleine
Bitte wer
Schneidet mich auf

Das Spiel ist neu
Du bist kalt
Und ich betäubt
Mein Herz voll mein Kopf leer
Gestern war es umgekehrt

Du bist
Haushoch am Horizont
Ich seh Dich an beim Näherkommen
Seh wie Du bist und wie wir sind
Dass wir nicht zufrieden sind

Wir gehn ein Stück weg
Kommen zurück
Und wir erkennen das perfekte Glück
War, ist und bleibt ein Fiebertraum
Und wir sind echt

Ich kann nicht mit
Und nicht ohne dich
Aber vor allem nicht ohne dich","Ich Steine, Du Steine",2008
Peter Fox,"Ich steh im Zimmer, kann nicht pennen
Meine Birne is' am brennen
Ich gieß mir einen auf die Lampe 
Bringt nichts, die Gedanken rennen

Durch den Schädel immer im Kreis
Alle Drähte laufen heiß
Es riecht nach hirnverbranntem Fleisch
Ich stecke meinen Kopf ins Eis

Ich denk, denk, denk, denk, denk zuviel
Es wär gut, wenn mein Hirn aus dem Fenster fiel
Druck im Kopf, es gibt kein Ventil
20.000 Szenen durchgespielt

100.000 Szenen ausgedacht
Mein Höllenschädel raucht und knackt
Ich brauch ne Pause und ich pack das verdammte Ding
Und schraub es ab

Die Kugel fällt nach vorn
Kann nichts sehn, bin ohne Ohren
Ich steh im Dunkeln
Ich hab meinen Kopf verloren

Der Tag bricht an, es klopft an deine Tür
Du machst auf, da steh ich ohne Kopf vor dir
Oh, halt mich fest, weil ich mich sonst verlier
Nur mit dir find ich den Weg zurück zu mir

Der Kopf rollt, denn er ist rund
Ich hinterher, renn alles um
Bin taub, stumm, blind und dumm
Ein Königreich für einen Blindenhund

Meine Murmel hat mich abgehängt
Ich frag mich, was ich wohl gerade denk
Vielleicht ruf ich mich, doch ich kann nix hörn
Wie konnte ich mich nur so zerstören?

Stoß mich an allen Ecken blau
Mein Kopf kullert durchs Treppenhaus
Ich muss ihn retten, ich geb nicht auf
Während ich mit mir um die Wette lauf

Ich werd verrückt, ah ich halts kaum aus
Ich strauchel, fall hin, lieg im Staub
Das grauen streckt seine Klauen aus
Oh, weck mich aus meinem Albtraum auf

Der Tag bricht an, es klopft an deine Tür
Du machst auf, da steh ich ohne Kopf vor dir
Oh, halt mich fest, weil ich mich sonst verlier
Nur mit dir find ich den Weg zurück zu mir",Kopf Verloren,2008
Peter Fox,"Süße, mach dich schick, ich hol dich in 5 Minuten ab
Das beste ist grad gut genug, denn heute ist der letzte Tag
Du sagst Mama tschüss, ich hab dir Blumen mitgebracht
Draußen blauer Himmel, die Vögel zwitschern im Park

Wollen wir Betten rocken im Ritz?
Die Präsidenten-Suite nehmen?
Bis es qualmt und die Bettpfosten in die Knie gehen
Oder wir nehmen 'n Haufen exquisiter Drogen, heben ab 
Vielleicht kann man von oben schon das Paradies sehen

Letzte Chance für einen Sprung in Acapulco
Ich schreib noch schnell 'ne Oper, Baby, und stell mich an Pult
Letzter Akt, ich im Frack, das Orchester spielt im Takt
Ich dirigier wie besessen, du bist die Königin der Nacht

Lass uns nicht von morgen sprechen
Worte können uns nicht retten, bald ist alles egal
Wir können die Sorgen vergessen
Lasst uns tonnenweise Torten fressen,

Und dann Arschbomben-battle in feinster Garderobe
Du im Abendkleid, ich in Bundfaltenhose
Es gibt strauß am Spieß, Haifisch in Aspik,
Dazu Château Lafitte und Kaviar aus der Dose

Reich mir dein Glas, es könnte voller sein
Der Kater erledigt sich schon von allein
Alle rasten aus und basteln Konfetti aus Moneten
Und zünden Raketen mit 100 Dollar-Scheinen

Wir brauchen keinen Schlaf, bleiben bis zum Ende wach
Haben nur Plan A, tanz auf dem Vulkan, bis es kracht

Peter Fox,"Ich renne bergauf, rolle bergab
Durch die Pampa und durch die Stadt
Geradeaus, zerkratz meinen Lack, Zack
Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand, bis es knackt
Bleib wo du bist, ich hole dich ab
Ich mach nicht schlapp, auch wenn ich Gicht hab
Ich bin am botten, bis ich blutende Hacken hab
Kauf wie ne Frau neue Botten im Minutentakt

Die Pumpe pumpt, ich hab wunde Lungen
Wie ein junger Hund, wird nicht satt
Zweifel gibt’s nicht, ich lauf drum rum
Ich jag ein Phantom, bis ich es hab
Im Zick-Zack ihm nach,
Ich schlaf kaum, fress Dreck
Seh es an der Ecke, bin ich da, ist es wieder weg
Eine fette Henne vor der Nase, bin angezeckt
Ich will sie haben und Wedel mit dem ganzen Heck

Irgendwas hält mich auf Trab
Und manchmal hab ich es satt
Es tritt mich Tag und Nacht
Der Teufel im Nacken, der nach mir schnappt

Die Welt muss sich drehen und nichts kann so bleiben
Ich renn durch mein Leben wie eine Lok auf 2 Beinen
Ein Hund kann nicht krähen, ein Fisch kann nicht schreien
Und ich kann nicht stehen bleiben, ich bin ein rollender Stein

Hightech-boots von der NASA
Auf meinen Waden riesige Adern,
Auf der Brille Fliegenkadaver
Als ich zu Fuß aus Paris nach Dakar kam

Bin dreckig latsch durch n See
Ich hab Hunger und esse im gehen
Trink aus ner Pulle Iso-Getränke
Strulle in die Ente, ganz souverän
Bin auf der Flucht, bin auf der Jagd
Ein gehetzter Fuchs, ständig auf Draht
Es ist wie ne Sucht, ich brauch's jeden Tag
Bin ein Bus, meine Bremse versagt

Latsch durch Mauern, nix darf dauern
Kau an den Nägeln, hab Hummeln im Arsch
Muss wieder weg, will nicht versauern
Frauen trauern, tragen Fummel in Schwarz

Die Mucke pumpt laut, ich riech es von Weitem
Rum, Rauch Frauen und Seife
Drei Tür-Checker fliegen zur Seite
Weil ich in den Schuppen wie auf Schienen einreite
Ich renne 10 Runden durch den Club
Ich dance, der Dancefloor geht kaputt
Bräute in schicken Pumps stehen im Schutt
Ich trag sie zur Bar und wir nehm 'n Schluck

Ich hab sie Huckepack, tanz auf'm Tisch
Verschütte alle Drinks, bin nass wie ein Fisch
Ich renn hinten raus, einmal rund ums Haus
Und Vorne wieder rein, bin fast wieder frisch

Ich muss gehen und alle gehen ab",Lok Auf 2 Beinen,2008

Stinke nach Suff, bin kaputt, ist 'n schönes Leben
Steig' über Schnapsleichen, die auf meinem Weg verwesen
Ich seh die Ratten sich satt fressen im Schatten der Dönerläden
Stapf' durch die Kotze am Kotti, Junks sind benebelt
Atzen rotzen in die Gegend, benehmen sich daneben
Szeneschnösel auf verzweifelter Suche nach der Szene
Gepiercte Mädels die wollen, dass ich Strassenfeger lese, ah

Halb Sechs, meine Augen brennen
Tret' auf 'nen Typen, der zwischen toten Tauben pennt
Hysterische Bräute keifen und haben Panik denn
An der Ecke gibt es Stress zwischen Tarek und Sam
Tarek sagt „Halt's Maul oder ich werd' dir ins Gesicht schlagen“
Sam hat die Hosen voll, aber kann auch nicht nichts sagen
Die rote Suppe tropft auf den Asphalt
Mir wird schlecht, ich mach' die Jacke zu, denn es ist kalt

Guten Morgen Berlin
Du kannst so hässlich sein
So dreckig und grau
Du kannst so schön schrecklich sein
Deine Nächte fressen mich auf
Es wird für mich wohl das Beste sein
Ich geh nach Hause und schlaf' mich aus
Und während ich durch die Straßen laufe
Wird langsam schwarz zu blau

Müde Gestalten im Neonlicht
Mit tiefen Falten im Gesicht
Frühschicht schweigt, jeder bleibt für sich
Frust kommt auf, denn der Bus kommt nicht

Und überall liegt Scheiße, man muss eigentlich schweben
Jeder hat 'nen Hund, aber keinen zum Reden
Ich atme ständig durch den Mund, das ist Teil meines Lebens
Ich fühl mich ungesund, brauch was reines dagegen, ah

Ich hab 'nen dicken Kopf, ich muss 'nen Saft haben
Ich hab dringlichen Bock auf Bagdads Backwaren
Da ist es warm, da geb ich mich meinen Träumen hin
Bei Fatima, der süßen Backwarenverkäuferin

Alles blinkt, man wird taub und blind
Wir feiern ausgelassen, ich rauch und trink

Man trifft Rudel junger Hunde, die sauer sind
Sie haben zu viel Zeit, die Kläffer suchen Streit
Ich seh' zu das ich bei drei auf der Mauer bin

Tausend Tonnen Taubenshit, alles grau und versifft
Jeden Müll ins Maul gekippt
Die Affen werden faul und dick
Du bist nicht fit und wirst gefressen
Ungekaut, kurz verdaut und für immer vergessen

Ist mir egal, ich kann nicht mit dem Dreck
Und ohne kann ich auch nicht

Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate

Their production will be second to none 
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound

And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill",Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,1978

But they don't know that there's thunder in the air
Mutual attraction was never enough
But now I know you can do without me
I don't know if I'm over you

Late at night
I'm hiding from a heartache
Yes I'm
I'm hiding from you
I'm so tired
Of living with a heartbreaker
So I, I'm hiding from you

In the words of a fool, I can't remember
But in our guarded moments I might break
It seems our love was just a hit and run
But while it lasted, you were second to no one
I don't know if I'm over you

Chorus

When I'm faced with the memory of love
And it's you that I want but you're not enough
Take it all easy, you can't believe what you see
Cause my heart isn't mine to control
And it seems to be out of control
Full of desire, it's making a liar of me
Oh no

Chorus

(I'm tired, tired of hiding)
Yes I'm, I'm hiding from a heartache
Yes I'm, I'm hiding from you
I'm so tired of living with a heartbreaker
So I, I'm hiding from you, you



",Hiding from a Heartache,1986
Peter Frampton,"I can take you to the Eiffel Tower
I could call you every single hour
When I stayed behind in my chevrolet
I can hear, no matter what you say

So all these things come into view
Stop me saying, ""I love you""

But there's always another hill to climb
Never enough of that precious time
Ready enough that you see my way
Oh, won't you give me just a one more day

And all these things come into view
Stop me saying, ""I love you""

I got this feeling, won't go away
I got so much I can't hide
I'm feeling stranger, stranger than you
I have to sing it now

All these things come into view
Stop me saying, ""I love you""
Hey talk about it

All these things come into view
Stop me saying, ""I love you""

I got this feeling, won't go away
I got so much I can't hide
I'm feeling stranger, stranger than you
You were right there by my side

There's always another hill to climb
Never enough of that precious time
Ready enough that you see my way
Oh, won't you give me just a one more day

And all these things come into view
Stop me saying, ""I love you""
All these things come into view
Stop me saying, ""I love you""



",Into View,1986
Peter Frampton,"When the lights come on
And the fever is high
Moments of madness
And mixed emotions
When we reach the dawn
We've got a lot to say
We can start again
While we scream
For one more day

It's like moving a mountain
Let's get it done, roll the stone
Like a man who is crazy
I'm gone

Why do we beg for more
No one could witness spite
I must look pretty sick
Cause we can't seem to quit, no no
We often turn away
It's only self-defense
But where can we go
When there's no hiding place

Chorus

When the lights go down
And the fever is gone
We must do each other
The fever is high once more

Chorus

It's like moving a mountain
It ain't the writing on the wall
Like a man who is crazy
I'm gone

Move a mountain

Move a mountain

Move a mountain

With this warning
My premonition will come true
(Well) I'm no psychic man
I am no skeptic but
I got news for you (yeah)

I woke up dreaming
With a message in my head
Is someone playing games with me
You have to watch out for
A black cat across your path
Or seven years will pass, oh

Chorus

You keep on doing
What you're doing
All the time, oh
Any day I'll be loose
I know the feeling
When you lose all control

Hey you turn around
Look down and feel the ground
You won't come close to fire
To yourself, you're just a liar, yeah


Woke up this morning, yeah

",You Know So Well,1986
Peter Frampton,"Isnæ?° it nice that we can dream
Of all the places we can't see
Fly over oceans wide
Do all the things we never tried
And isn't it strange how you can go
Back to a home you've never known
It's like you were there before
A place you've been searching for

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart leads the way

Isn't it nice to feel so free
And love the way love's supposed to be
Never with hurt or pain
And never with something else to gain
And isn't it strange it seems so clear
That you have nothing here to fear
But somehow the morning light
Fades all the things you see at night

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

Once you're there
You'll know that you're inside
You can't turn back
When you open your eyes

The new world waits inside your dream
And your heart knows the way
But isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life you'll someday know
And let the real world fade away

Isn't it nice to let it go
On to the life your soul will know
And let the real world fade away

Peter Frampton,"Oh woman, Oh woman, Oh what can she be?
Whatever she is, she's necessary.

A woman is something both evil and good,
But too complicated to be understood.
An angel when lovin', a devil when mad.
A woman can make you both happy and sad.

Afraid of a cricket, she'll scream at a mouse.
But she'll tackle a husband as big as a house.
She'll take him for better, she'll take him for worse.
She'll bust his head open and then be his nurse.

(This verse I'm not sure of)

She's spiteful, deceitful, keen sighted and blind.
????? and crafty and cruel and kind.
In the morning she does, in the evening she don't.
You're always a thinkin' she will but she won't.

Oh woman, oh woman, oh what can she be?
What ever she is, she's necessary.

These are the words for ""A Man"" as close as I can remember

A man, oh a man, any woman will say,
Whatever he is, we like him that way.

A man is a creature we can't overlook.
As easy to read as a page in a book.

That's all I can remember of ""A Man""
Can someone fill in the rest for me?

One thing that makes it all complete
You find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the face of their children
Some find it in their lovers eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you find that special thing
You're flying without wings

Some find it sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You find it in the works of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So impossible as they may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
'Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

Well for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sun rise on your face
To know that I can say I love you
At any given time or place
It's little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine
And it's like flying without wings
'Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

And you'll be where it ends

And that's the joy you bring

This is rock bottom why yall, I never expected it
In order to be businesslike you must meet the prerequisite
Leave your culture at home, smile, don't be too proud, too wild
You may suffer, just don't cry out loud
This notion of professionalism is like an exorcism
Forced to give your life away while you're earnin' a livin'
These thoughts had stopped me from rejoinin' the work force
But now the situation I'm in, just seems to hurt more
Maybe it won't be bad, maybe it'll be good
I could use a little structure in my life, maybe I should
Take my suit and tie out of the closet
Try shinin' my shoes and brush the fuckin' dust off of my wallet
Let's consider the prospects, make a couple phone calls
Now so many interviews you know I got next week
I'm strictly goin' from the bottom to the peak
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

We married on our 4th anniversary
Bought a house and turned a room into a nursery
For the bouncin' baby that we're expecting in June
I sat in that delivery room from noon, to noon
24 hours of labour then the nurse asked me his title for the paper
You know, so the government can chase ya'
First name: John, Last name: Insignificant
I'm smiling like a proud dad; I got the birth certificate
Go to the house and here's my 
And I looked around and nothing's good enough for her or him
So my 8 hour days became 9; 9 slid up to 10; a subtle slip up to 11 and then
And after a 12 hour day, I too little energy to say 'I love you' to my baby
Or play daddy to J, and I thought this was the way 
O be a husband and a father
I guess I could've looked in her eyes, and seen I lost her
But it wasn't my fault, I'm workin' hard, it couldn't be
I've been successfully existing as a member of this family
I was so convinced the household had to always be complete
I didn't realize the only thing that's missing is me

[Chorus]

[Mr. Lif]
There was never any talk of divorce
I can't believe how focused I was in the face of such a huge potential loss
Thought I signed a grievance with the boss
In fact, I was mad at my wife, as if she's trying to knock me off course
But I still visited the florist, to get her flowers
(When the last time I did this?) Hmm, not since our wedding shower
I got home and I was greeted by the fact we'd been deleted
I was someone that my wife and child thought they no longer needed
And before I could say, 'Where's John?'
I looked down and he was clingin' to her arm
I realized-ed that I'm wrong
I blacked out and by the time I came to, they were gone
But somehow I sat and shook my head, and then I carried on
And I still completed 3 weeks of work, before my breakdown
The ambulances came and I got medicine to take now
And it's hard to get a job when you been treated and released
So both my relationship and my career had deceased
It took years to put myself together, piece by piece
And thank God I found a woman that's propitiate with me
And I'll never let this happen again, it's not to be
I'm ready focused and determined to get back on my feet

Peter Gabriel,"The scattered pages of a book by the sea 
Held by the sand, washed by the waves 
A shadow forms cast by a cloud
Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them, effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""
More opened ears and opened eyes
And soon they dared to laugh

See a little man with his face turning red 
Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead",Can-Utility and the Coastliners,1972
Peter Gabriel,"Get 'em out by Friday
You don't get paid 'til the last one's well on his way
Get 'em out by Friday
It's important that we keep to schedule, there must be no delay 

I represent a firm of gentlemen who recently purchased this 
House and all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity we've found a better place for you 
To go, go-woh, go-woh

Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, they're asking us to leave

Get 'em out by Friday
I've told you before, 's good many gone if we let them stay
And if it isn't easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away

After all this time, they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I don't know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how they'd take more money
The Winkler called again, he came here this morning
With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating 
I think we're going to find it hard 

Now we've got them
I've always said that cash cash cash can do anything well 
Work can be rewarding 
When a flash of intuition is a gift that helps you excel-sell-sell-sell

Here we are in Harlow New Town 
Did you recognize your block across the square, over there 
Sadly since last time we spoke
We've found we've had to raise the rent again
Just a bit

Oh no, this I can't believe 
Oh Mary, and we agreed to leave

This is an announcement from Genetic Control
It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on 
Humanoid height 

I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the 
Properties that have recently been sold, taking risks oh so bold
It's said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
They say it's alright
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity, they've been told they must go
Told they must go-go-go-go

I think I've fixed a new deal 
A dozen properties, we'll buy at five and sell at thirty four 
Some are still inhabited
It's time to send the Winkler to see them
He'll have to work some more

With land in your hand, you'll be happy on earth 
Then invest in the Church for your heaven",Get 'Em Out by Friday,1972
Peter Gabriel,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""
Lord of Lords, King of Kings
Has returned to lead his children home
To take them to the new Jerusalem",Supper's Ready,1972
Peter Gabriel,"A carved oak table, 
Tells a tale 
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold, 
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room to arbors cool. 

A time of valor, and legends born 
A time when honor meant much more to a man than life 
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong 
Through lance and sword. 

Why, why can we never be sure till we die 
Or have killed for an answer, 
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe 
That no race has been grander 
It seems because through time and space 
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore. 

A dusty table 
Musty smells 
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor 
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey 
That scars the panes. 
Gone the carving, 
And those who left their mark, 
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway 
And the weak must die according to nature's law 
As old as they. 

Why, why can we never be sure till we die 
Or have killed for an answer, 
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe 
That no race has been grander 
It seems because through time and space 
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore.",Time Table,1972
Peter Gabriel,"Watcher of the skies watcher of all 
His is a world alone no world is his own, 
He whom life can no longer surprise, 
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown. 

Creatures shaped this planet's soil, 
Now their reign has come to an end, 
Has life again destroyed life, 
Do they play elsewhere, do they know 
More than their childhood games? 
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail, 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth. 

Judge not this race by empty remains 
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead? 
For now, the lizard's shed it's tail 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth. 

From life alone to life as one, 
Think not your journey's done 
For though your ship be sturdy, no 
Mercy has the sea, 
Will you survive on the ocean of being? 
Come ancient children hear what I say 
This is my parting council for you on your way. 

Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars 
Where we have gone you know you never can go. 
Watcher of the skies watcher of all 
This is your fate alone, this fate is your own.",Watcher of the Skies,1972
Peter Gabriel,"Met this girl called Josephine and took her up on my machine
We had a little fun and now we got a little one
Had to get married, being chased out of town
Found ourselves a place to live, we put all our money down
  
Call it Home Sweet Home, home sweet home
Eleven floors up in a tower block
Happy just to have a home
I've gone and changed  the lock on our home

Nothing really worked out right, things got broke,
They stayed that way
None of our friends came around at night and little Sam got 
No place to play
""We've got to get out of here, Bill"" she said ""I've been telling 
You all the while""
When I came home from work that night she'd jumped out the
Window with our child

From our Home Sweet Home, home sweet home
Just a place to take a rest, just a place to make our nest
We call it our home

When the insurance money came through seemed dirty didn't know what to do
Took the cash went down the casino, down on the wheel on the double
And I won, oh yes I won, like I never won before
Bought myself a country house with an antique carved oak door
  
It was Home Sweet Home, home sweet home
Just a place to lay our head think of all those things we said
About in our Home Sweet Home.",Home Sweet Home,1978
Peter Gabriel,"Ten coaches roll into the dust
Chrome windows turned to rust
'Hand on inside they know they must
Hanging on the green backed words ""In God we trust""

No one knew if the spirit died
All wrapped to go like Kentucky Fried
Trying to read the flight of birds
Low on fuel, getting low on words

And she comes out like a white shadow
She comes out like a white shadow

Each one drawn to empty spaces
Outsiders, borderline cases
It's hard to tell black from white
When you wake up in the middle of the night

Weighed down by the absence of sound
Broken now by the cry of a hound
Looking for movement within the haze
Light can be deceptive with her rays

And she comes out like a white shadow
And she comes out like a white shadow
She comes out like a white shadow",White Shadow,1978

I drive my car but there's no place to park it

I say ""Hey Scumbag, has there been an alarm?""
He said ""Yeh, 'been selling off eternal youth
They all got afraid 'cause I'm the living proof
My name is Einstein do you know time is a curve?""

I've got my radio
I can hear what's going on
 
I've been waiting for this
I have been waiting for this
All you people in TV land
I will wake up your empty shells
Peak-time viewing blown in a flash
As I burn into your memory cells
'cause I'm alive
 
They're coming 'round the corner with the bikers at the front
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of will
And the governor's car is not far behind
He's not the one I've got in mind
'cause there he is-the man of the hour, standing in the limousine
""I don't really hate you
I don't care what you do
We were made for each other
Me and you
I want to be somebody
You were like that too
If you don't get given you learn to take
And I will take you.""
 
Holding my breath
Release the catch
And I let the bullet fly
 
All turned quiet I have been here before
Lonely boy hiding behind the front door
Friends have all gone home
There's my toy gun on the floor
Come back Mum and Dad
You're growing apart
You know that I'm growing up sad
I need some attention
I shoot into the light",Family Snapshot,1980

Her honey belly pulls the seams
Curves are stiff upon the hinge
Pale zeros tinge the tiger skin
 
Moist as grass, ripe and heavy as the night
The sponge is full, well out of sight
All around the conversations
Icing on the warm flesh cake
 
Light creeps through her secret tunnels
Sucked into the open spaces
Burning out in sudden flashes
Draining blood from well-fed faces
 
Desires form in subtle whispers
Flex the muscles in denial
Up and down its pristine cage
So the music, so the trial
 
Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens
Dance in circles, they the blessed
Man and wife, undressed by all
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed
 
Even as the soft skins tingle
They mingle with the homeless mother
Who loves the day but lives another
That once was hers
 
The worried father, long lost lover
Brushes ashes with his broom
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover
Bursting over the bride and groom

And the talk goes on
 
Memories crash on tireless waves
The lifeguards whom the winter saves
 
Silence falls the guillotine
All the doors are shut
Nervous hands grip tight the knife
In the darkness, till the cake is cut

Passed around, in little pieces

The family and the fishing-net
And another in the mesh

to the least
Dancing for the slow release, first the boy and then the beast
Then the beast
 
Burning, burning with the kiss of life
Burning, burning with the kiss of life
 
See me, a big woman, big woman so full of life
See me, a big woman, big woman going to be my wife
 
Watching for the different eyes they change your face they come inside
Watch the spirits laugh and cry, watch them find a place to hide
Watch the spirits talk in tongues, watch them take you for a ride

Big woman sits beside, head in hand
With heat from her skin, and fire from her breath

Peter Gabriel,"Thick cloud, steam rising, hissing stone on sweat lodge fire
Around me, buffalo roam, sage in bundle, rub on skin
Outside, cold air, stand, wait for rising sun
Red paint, eagle feathers, coyote calling, it has begun
Something moving in, I taste it in my mouth and in my heart
It feels like dying, slow, letting go of life

Medicine man lead me up through town, Indian ground, so far down
Cut up land, each house, a pool, kids wearing water wings, drink in cool
Follow dry river bed, watch Scout and Guides make pow-wow signs
Past Geronimo's disco, Sit 'n' Bull steakhouse, white men dream
A rattle in the old man's sack, look at mountain top, keep climbing up
Way above us the desert snow, white wind blow
 
I hold the line, the line of strength that pulls me through the fear
San Jacinto, I hold the line
San Jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight, I hold the line
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I'm losing it, getting weaker
I hold the line, I hold the line

We will breathe, of the air

That you build with flesh and bone

Loaded questions from clean white coats
Their eyes are all as hidden as their Hippocratic Oath
They tell you how to behave, behave as their guest
You want to resist them, you do your best
They take you to your limits, they take you beyond
For all that they are doing there's no way to respond

Don't give up

It is so strange the way things turn

Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place
Where we belong

You worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us

Please don't give up

I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below

And whatever may go

That river's flowing

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one
Don't give up
No reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up now

Peter Gabriel,"Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
All this momentum keeps stealing through
Across the cornfields, through all the marshland
There's nothing gonna stop this thing
Clear the trees, burn the brushwood
Bring the diggers in, I'm gonna move this earth
Lay the big stones, put down the sleepers
Haul the steel in, I will beat this land
Don't care how but, I'm coming through here
Whatever it takes, oh

Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy

Right through these fences, cut through the stone walls
Dig out the tunnels from a solid stone
There she is, but so surrounded
All those fancy men with soft white hands
Come all this distance, that should be me there
Whatever it takes (whatever it takes), oh

Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy
Don't break this rhythm, don't break this motion
We work together in sympathy

Peter Gabriel,"Suffocated by mirrors, stained by dreams
Her honey belly pulls the seams
Curves are still upon the hinge
Pale zeros tinge the tiger skin

Moist as grass, ripe and heavy as the night
The sponge is full, well out of sight
All around the conversations
Icing on the warm flesh cake

Light creeps through her secret tunnels
Sucked into the open spaces
Burning out in sudden flashes
Draining blood from well-fed faces

Desires form in subtle whispers
Flex the muscles in denial
Up and down its pristine cage
So the music, so the trial

Vows of sacrifice, headless chickens
Dance in circles, they the blessed
Man and wife, undressed by all
Their grafted trunks in heat possessed

Even as the soft skins tingle
They mingle with the homeless mother
Who loves the day but lives another
That once was hers

The worried father, long lost lover
Brushes ashes with his broom
Rehearses jokes to fly and hover
Bursting over the bride and groom

And the talk goes on

Memories crash on tireless waves
The lifeguards whom the winter saves

Silence falls the guillotine
All the doors are shut
Nervous hands grip tight the knife
In the darkness, till the cake is cut
Passed around, in little pieces
The body and the flesh
The family and the fishing-net
And another in the mesh

The body and the flesh",The Family and the Fishing Net [Live],1986
Peter Gabriel,"The streets are lined with camera crews
Everywhere he goes is news
Today is different
Today is not the same
Today I make the action
Take snapshot into the light, snapshot into the light
I'm shooting into the light
 
Four miles down the cavalcade moves on
Driving into the sun
If I worked it out right
They won't see me or the gun
 
Two miles to go, they're clearing the road
The cheering has really begun
I've got my radio
I can hear what's going on
 
I've been waiting for this
I have been waiting for this
All you people in TV land
I will wake up your empty shells
Peak-time viewing blown in a flash
As I burn into your memory cells
'Cause I'm alive
 
They're coming 'round the corner with the bikers at the front
I'm wiping the sweat from my eyes
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of will
And the governor's car is not far behind
He's not the one I've got in mind
'cause there he is-the man of the hour, standing in the limousine
I don't really hate you
I don't care what you do
We were made for each other
Me and you
I want to be somebody
You were like that too
If you don't get given you learn to take
And I will take you.""
 
Holding my breath
Release the catch
And I let the bullet fly
 
All turned quiet-I have been here before
Lonely boy hiding behind the front door
Friends have all gone home
There's my toy gun on the floor
Come back Mum and Dad
You're growing apart
You know that I'm growing up sad
I need some attention

Peter Gabriel,"When the night shows
The signals grow on radios
All the strange things
They come and go, as early warnings
Stranded starfish have no place to hide
Still waiting for the swollen eastern tide
There's no point in direction we cannot
Even choose a side

I took the old track
The hollow shoulder, across the waters
On the tall cliffs
They were getting older, sons and daughters
The jaded underworld was riding high
Waves of steel hurled metal at the sky
And as the nail sunk in the cloud, the rain
Was warm and soaked the crowd.

Lord, here comes the flood
Here we'll say goodbye to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent
In any still alive
It'll be those who gave their island to survive
Drink up, dreamers, 
You're running dry

When the flood calls
You have no home, you have no walls
In the thunder crash
You're a thousand minds, within a flash
Don't be afraid to cry at what you see
The actors gone, there's only you and me
If we break before the dawn
They'll use up what we used to be.

Peter Gabriel,"I know something about opening windows and doors
I know how to move quietly to creep across creaky wooden floors
I know where to find precious things 
In all your cupboards and drawers
Slipping the clippers
Slipping the clippers through the telephone wires
The sense of isolation inspires
Inspires me

I like to feel the suspense 
When I'm certain you know I am there
I like you lying awake, 
Your baited breath charging the air
I like the touch and the smell of 
All the pretty dresses you wear

Peter Gabriel,"Thick cloud, steam rising, hissing stone on sweat lodge fire
Around me, buffalo roam, sage in bundle, run on skin
Outside, cold air, stand, wait for rising sun
Red paint, eagle feathers, coyote calling, it has begun
Something moving in, I taste it in my mouth and in my heart
It feels like dying, slow, letting go of life

Medicine man lead me up though town, Indian ground, so far down
Cut up land, each house, a pool, kids wearing water wings, drink in cool
Follow dry river bed, watch Scout and Guides make pow-wow signs
Past Geronimo's disco, Sit 'n' Bull steakhouse, white men dream
A rattle in the old man's sack, look at mountain top, keep climbing up
Way above us the desert snow, white wind blow
 
I hold the line, the line of strength that pulls me through the fear
San Jacinto, I hold the line
San Jacinto, the poison bite and darkness take my sight, I hold the line
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek, think I'm losing it, getting weaker
I hold the line, I hold the line
San Jacinto, yellow eagle flies down from the sun, from the sun
 
We will walk, on the land
We will breathe, of the air
We will drink, from the stream
We will live, hold the line
Hold the line
Hold the line",San Jacinto [Live],1986

Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box

He can handle the shocks

Of kissing Mary's lips

for being as timid as a lamb

I came home with a new kind of charge
I learned to hunt in the night
I learned about camouflage

Was warm and soaked the crowd.

Use up what we used to be.

Through slowest heaving night
Whatever fear invents, 
I swear it make no sense
I reach out through the border fence
Come down, come talk to me

In the swirling curling storm of desire
Unuttered words hold fast
With reptile tongue the lightning lashes
Towers built to last
Darkness creeps in like a thief
And offers no relief
Why are you shaking like a leaf?

From sleepy tears undone
From nippled skin as smooth as silk,

Like there's no one there at all

Come on, come talk to me

Breaking out through the silence

And the heart it will not be denied

All the barriers blown away

Won't you please come talk to me

And I'm finding my way home from the great escape

Only us sleeping
Only us dreaming

'Til I could see the face behind the face
All that had gone before had left no trace

Down by the railway siding
In our secret world, we were colliding
All the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

So I watch you wash your hair
Underwater, unaware
And the plane flies through the air
Did you think you didn't have to choose it
That I alone could win or lose it
In all the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

In this house of make believe
Divided in two, like Adam and Eve
You put out and I receive

[Chorus]
Down by the railway siding
In our secret world, we were colliding
In all the places we were hiding love
What was it we were thinking of?

Oh the wheel is turning spinning round and round
And the house is crumbling but the stairways stand

With no guilt and no shame, no sorrow or blame
Whatever it is, we are all the same

Making it up in our secret world [x3]
Shaking it up
Breaking it up
Making it up in our secret world

Seeing things that were not there
On a wing on a prayer
In this state of disrepair

Peter Gabriel,"People go naked and pick up these trails
Someone before me laid down these rails
When it's loaded up too heavy,
this engine fails
In lovetown
I can't settle down
And do those teeth still match the wound
Take a good look around
In lovetown

Aaahha, aaahha
Looking in lovetown
Aaahha, aaahha
This is lovetown

Sometimes you're stormy water
on which I pour my oil
In each other's shadow
The roots reach into the soil
All these knots so tightly tied
We could not uncoil
In lovetown
No place to settle down
And do those teeth still match the wound
Take a good look around
In lovetown

Aaahha, aaahha
This is lovetown
Aaahha, aaahha
Looking in lovetown

Who's lonely lips will find these hidden scars?
Who's seen the kisses left in dim lit bars?
Who's out in the streets, looking for love like ours?
Who's looking in lovetown tonight?

Have you got what you want
Said have you got what you need
With what you did and what you saw
Did you find you needed more
Have you got what you came for
Are you really so sure
Are you really so sure

Looking in lovetown
In lovetown
Living in lovetown
Hey yeah yeah.",Lovetown [From Philadelphia],1994

Peter Gabriel,"While The Eeath Sleeps:
(Macedonian)
Dali znaesh mila majko
shto sum ne srekjna
Cel den doma sama sedam
Nadvor ne smejam.

Do you know, mother,
How unlucky I am?
All day I sit at home,
I am not allowed outside",While the Earth Sleeps,1995
Peter Gabriel,"Party Man
So then, up upon this high wall
Looking at the street lights
All spread out like a banquet
Why is this room so silent?
Only when I'm moving
No direction chosen
Rolling over emotion
Guess I'm your party man.
p p party man, p p partyman
I'm your party man
(repeats)",Party Man,1995
Peter Gabriel,"Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 

Waiting your time, dreaming of a better life 
Waiting your time, you're more than just a wife 
You don't want to do what your mother has done 
She has done 
This is your life, this new life has begun 
It's your day - a woman's day 
It's your day - a woman's day 

Turning the tide, you are on the incoming wave 
Turning the tide, you know you are nobody's slave 
[ 1989 version - Find your Brothers and sisters ] 
[ 1990 version - Find your sisters and brothers ] 
Who can hear all the truth in what you say 
They can support you when you're on your way 
It's your day - a woman's day 
It's your day - a woman's day 

Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 

[ extra lyrics from 1989 12"" remix ] 

There's nothing to gain when there's nothing to be lost 
There's nothing to gain if you stay behind and count the cost 
Make the decision that you can be who you can be 
You can be 
Tasting the fruit come to the Liberty Tree 
It's your day - a woman's day 
It's your day - a woman's day 

[ end of extra lyrics from 12"" remix ] 

Changing your ways, changing those surrounding you 
Changing your ways, more than any man can do 
Open your heart, show him the anger and pain, so you heal 
Maybe he's looking for his womanly side, let him feel 

You had to be so strong 
And you do nothing wrong 
Nothing wrong at all 
We're gonna to break it down 
We have to shake it down 
Shake it all around 

Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree 
Souma Yergon, Sou Nou Yergon, We are shakin' the tree",Shaking the Tree,1996
Peter Gabriel,"The time I like is the rush hour, 'cause I like the rush
The pushing of the people, I like it all so much
Such a mass of motion, do not know where it goes
I move with the movement and, I have the touch
 
I'm waiting for ignition, I'm looking for a spark
Any chance collision and I light up in the dark
There you stand before me, all that fur and all that hair
Oh, do I dare, I have the touch
 
Wanting contact
I'm wanting contact
I'm wanting contact with you
Shake those hands, shake those hands
Give me the thing I understand
Shake those hands, shake those hands
Shake those hands, shake those hands
 
Any social occasion, it's hello, how do you do
All those introductions, I never miss my cue
So before a question, so before a doubt
My hand moves out and, I have the touch
 
Wanting contact
I'm wanting contact
I'm wanting contact with you
Shake those hands, shake those hands
Give me the thing I understand
Shake those hands, shake those hands
 
Pull my chin, stroke my hair, scratch my nose, hug my knees
Try drink, food, cigarette, tension will not ease
I tap my fingers, fold my arms, breathe in deep, cross my legs
Shrug my shoulders, stretch my back - but nothing seems to please
 
I need contact
I need contact
Nothing seems to please
I need contact",I Have the Touch,1996
