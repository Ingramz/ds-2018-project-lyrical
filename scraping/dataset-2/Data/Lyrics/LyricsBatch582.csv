Ledisi,"I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

Tossing and turning another sleepless night
The rain crashes against my window pane
Jumped into my car--didn't drive too far
That moment I knew I would never be the same

Cause I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

Now here you are begging to me
To give our love another try
Girl I love you and I always will
But darling right now I've got to say goodbye

Cause I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

I saw you (and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

Hey, hey, baby, how you doin', come on in here
Got some hot chocolate on the stove waitin' for ya
Listen, first things first, let me hang up that coat
Yeah, 'n' how's your day today, did ya miss me?
Oh, you did, yeah, I missed you, too
I missed you so much I followed you today
That's right
Now close your mouth
Cause you cold busted
That's right, now sit down here
Sit down here
So upset with you I don't know what to do
'n' my first impulse was to run up on you
And do a Rambo
Whip out the jammy and flat-blast both of you
But I ain't wanna mess up this thirty-seve hundred dollar lynx coat
So instead, I chilled
That's right, chilled, then I went to the bank
Took out every dime
And then I went and canceled all those credit cards
Yeah
All your charge accounts
Yeah
I stuck you up for every piece of jewelry I ever bought you
Yeah
That's right, everything
Everything
Did fool out with me
Naw, don't go, you ever go, don't go looking in that closet
Cause you ain't got nothing in there
Everything you came here with--

Is packe dup and waiting for you in the guest room
That's right, what was you thinking about, huh?
What were you tryin' to prove, huh?
You's with the Juice
'n' I gave you silk suits, Gucci handbags, blue diamonds
I gave you things you couldn't even pronounce
Now I can't give you nothin' but advice
Cause you're still young
That's right, you're still young
I hope you learn a valuable lesson from all this
You know?
Gonna find someone like me one of these days
Until then, know what you gotta do?
You gotta get on outta here with that
Alley-cat-coat wearin'
Hush-puppy-shoe-wearing'
Crumb cake I saw you with
Cause you dismissed
That's right, silly rabbit
Tricks are made for kids, don't you know that?
You without me: like cornflake without the milk
It's my world--you just a squirrel, tryin' to get a nut
Now get on outta here
Ah!
Don't touch that coat!",The Rain,2005
Ledisi,"White boys are so pretty 
Skin as smooth as milk 
White boys are so pretty 
Hair like Chinese silk 

White boys give me goose bumps 
White boys give me chills 
When they touch my shoulder 
That's the touch that kills 

Well, my momma calls 'em lilies 
I call 'em Piccadillies 
My daddy warns me stay away 
I say come on out and play 

White boys are so groovy 
White boys are so tough 
Every time that they're near me 
I just can't get enough 

White boys are so pretty 
White boys are so sweet 
White boys drive me crazy 
Drive me indiscreet 

White boys are so sexy 
Legs so long and lean 
Love those sprayed-on trousers 
Love the love machine 

My brother calls 'em rubble 
That's my kind of trouble 
My daddy warns me ""no no no"" 
But I say ""White boys go go go"" 

White boys are so lovely 
Beautiful as girls 
I love to run my fingers 
And toes through all their curls 

Give me a tall 
A lean 
A sexy 
A sweet 
A pretty 
A juicy

Ledisi,"We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations 
Introduction to the nation of revolutionary thoughts 
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and change 
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter 
So y'all niggaz still ego trip based and 
Have not begun to taste the kundalini wisdom bliss 
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the stages 
Play this on your play list 
I like dough 
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical 
And don't blame me for the slang and the words 
God writes these rhymes through me 
I just listen to him 
I'm just livin' duke 
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me 
Cuz I still think abstract 
And stay metaphysical 
And challenge what is really real 
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back 
Not that it's away 
But everybody got somethin' to say 
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now 
And make that hot 
So it will get exploited 
And the corporation only will back dudes who bite my style 
And they can try and try again 
I've been influenced by a lot of pioneers 
South to the East and West 
But when a hot MC 
Gets on stage with a real MC 
Most of the time the situation gets hostile 

[Chorus] 
We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Welcome to our world and intro to 
Fall into a space 
Where there is no thoughts 
Just moments captured 
Here we go 

We vibrate at higher frequencies 
Let us up inside your head 
Just step inside our world of vibration 
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed 
 
Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within 
In a world of BS that we're livin' in 
To my ears music sound sweet as cinnamon 
So I stay poundin' out tunes and tunes again and again 
In the 5th chapter ladies and gentlemen 
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu 
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though 
On second thought, I'm like a letter man though 
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome 
Shootin' through your vains, vibratin' though your eardrums 
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes 
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum 
Seen the world two times all except for India 
About to vacate there when we finish this one 
Work hard but still some sweep 
We won't mention them 
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine 
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin' 
When we're done with this these songs are our pension 
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson 
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen 
City, town, state arena or convention 
Please believe these the G's that ease pension 
Rakka and Ev said that it's a marathon 
Song after song, we keep on inventin' 

[Chorus]",World of Vibrations,2005
Ledisi,"This life can make me so confused
But it's alright
Living day by day I feel so used 
That ain't right

I just want to run and hide but I dont have the time to cry
It's alright
It's alright
Alright

Many thoughts are running through my head
It's alright
Itching to be somewhere else but here
It's alright

I can't wait to see your face 
I need a smile and your embrace
I'm alright (2x)

[Chorus]
Life can bring us through many changes
It's alright
Just dont give up it's going to be alright
People come and they go
It's just the way it goes
Everything is everything
It's alright

Sometimes the rain makes me sad and it's alright
Somethings things in the world make me mad and it's alright
In the the morning when I see the Sun I know im not the only one 

Wish I had some money to pay my bills 
I can't even buy that dress on sale but it's alright
Having money don't mean a thing
Loving you is everything
And I'm alright
I'm alright

Everything is everything

Ledisi,"[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know what to do, I can't stop wanting you
I'm in love, in love, with my best friend
It's tearing me apart, 'cause he has my heart
Oh, I'm in love, in love, with my best friend

[Verse 1]
I've been wanting you for may lifetimes now
And I'm so afraid to tell you, how I really feel
You have been there for me, I was 13 you were 14
Best friends for years, where do I go from here?
Oh Lord

(Can't stop the way that I feel
Every time I see you, I lose control, just can't let it go, oh no)

(A kiss from you ooh, how does it feel
Oh I wonder, I'm so close to you, but I wanna get next to you)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
When we're out together, everybody smiles at us, 'cause they think that you're my man
So I hold your hand, like you're my man
I keep hoping that you'll notice me, and maybe one day you and I can be together, more than just friends

(I can't hide the way that I feel
Every time I see you, I lose control, I can't let it go, no-no)

(Kissing you just won't be enough
I need all of you, I wish you wanted me, like I want you)

If you could only understand the things that he does for me
Beautiful, wonderful, gorgeous and simplicity
He describes all the things that love is about, for me

Ledisi,"Coffee with cream coming up right away
You look, I look, we smile, we wave
You go, I dream about kissing one day
Oh well I sigh, maybe tomorrow when he comes again
I'll finally get to say what I've been wanting to say

I wanna get to know you
How can I get to know you
I wanna get to know you
Know you better
I wanna get to know you
How can I get to know you
I wanna get to know you
Know you better

Hanging with my girls, night-time, another world
High heels, blue jeans, he's looking at me
He takes my hand ""would you like to dance? ""
I say okay and then he starts to say to me
The words that I've waited to hear, the phrase that's no longer a dream

I wanna get to know you
How can I get to know you
I wanna get to know you
Know you better
I wanna get to know you
How can I get to know you
I wanna get to know you
Know you better

You are
The meaning of everything beautiful
I can't wait to breathe your air
That smile
What a pleasure for me just to look at you
I can't wait to do whatever

I wanna get to know you
How can I get to know you
I wanna get to know you
Know you better
I wanna get to know you
How can I get to know you
I wanna get to know you

Lost not yet found, grieving in misery
Hope lurks around, when will the sun ever shine on me?
I need love to come and carry me

Unsure of love, I needed love.

Just like the sun, you brought the light and now we are one.

Ain't gone change a thing cause I'm in it. 
Everything is beautiful because of you. 
How did you get here, I was dreaming? 
Somebody heard me, cause I was needing you. 
I was wanting you, I was calling you.

Then you came and everything about me has changed. 
Just like the sun, you brought the light and now we are one.

Ledisi,"A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road 
It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone 
It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun 
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun 
The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush 
A knot in the wood, the song of a thrush 
The wood of the wind, a cliff, a fall 
A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all 
It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of the slope 
It's a beam it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope 
And the river bank talks of the waters of March 
It's the end of the strain 
The joy in your heart 
The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone 
The beat of the road, a slingshot's stone 
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow 
A fight, a bet the fange of a bow 
The bed of the well, the end of the line 
The dismay in the face, it's a loss, it's a find 
A spear, a spike, a point, a nail 
A drip, a drop, the end of the tale 
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light 
The sound of a shot in the dead of the night 
A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump, 
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps 
The plan of the house, the body in bed 
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud 
A float, a drift, a flight, a wing 
A hawk, a quail, the promise of spring 
And the river bank talks of the waters of March 
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart 
A stick, a stone, it's the end of the road 
It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone 
A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe 
It's a thorn in your hand and a cut in your toe 
A point, a grain, a bee, a bite 
A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night 
A pin, a needle, a sting a pain 
A snail, a riddle, a wasp, a stain 
A pass in the mountains, a horse and a mule 
In the distance the shelves rode three shadows of blue 
And the river talks of the waters of March 
It's the promise of life in your heart 
A stick, a stone, the end of the road 
The rest of a stump, a lonesome road 
A sliver of glass, a life, the sun 
A knife, a death, the end of the run

'Cause when you walked out, you walk into my dreams
Hearing these memories all in my head
Was it your voice that said? Come back to bed
I know there was a reason that I had to walk out
But now I can't remember what the fight was about
I know I was mad, said I was pissed
But it wasn't so bad, not worse then this

I miss you now
Maybe you deserve another chance
Maybe your man
Maybe we should try again

'Cause I miss you now (Cause I miss you now)
I miss you now
Maybe it really wasn't our fault
Wasn't so bad at all
Maybe I should come back home

Yo mama keep calling me, phoning my house
Asking me why you sleeping on her couch
How could we give up on something so good
I tried not to call, maybe I should
I don't wanna be the reason that it didn't work out
We put too much into it just to give up now
Let's call it a truths, got nothing to prove
Been gone for too long and I'm missing you

[Chorus]

'Cause I miss you now (Cause I miss you now)
I miss you now
Maybe it really wasn't our fault
Wasn't so bad at all
Maybe I should come back home

Maybe we can solve it by saying I'm sorry
Maybe we can take it back to where we started
I miss your kiss
Long for your love
One month without you, is more than enough
Maybe I just needed to breathe
I walked away now I can see
I'm lost without you
Don't know what to do
I called just to say
That I'm missing you

A way to be
You're looking down again
Just let it be
And I'd only do for you what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me

Will you ever find where you'll be
And I'd only do for you what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me
And I only would do for you what you'd do for me yeah

Oh don't look back just to lean on me
Oh it's taken the life out of me
It's not like you'd know
You've never been close enough
Closer than you've been to me
It's not what you say
It's just in the way
You push me away

And I only would do for you what you'd do for me yeah

Lee,"Standing on top of the sunshine, holding my face to the wind
I smile and I wonder what it's all really supposed to be about
And then it came along and it hit me like a cool breeze
And it rubbed on my nose, as I undressed in the moment
The here and now of my reality that I embrace
Some, they never get that chance to feel such liberation
But me, I welcome it with open arms

And this is an awesome feeling. Sometimes I need to stop and take a breath
It's like you climbed the highest moment, sang the perfect harmony
That exact space where you knew you wanted to be
It was all you ever wanted was just a chance to be free
And you have it right now

So don't you try to hold me back, don't put your limits on me
I want to open up my eyes and look as far as I can see
If you don't want to fly with me please just let me be

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone

Happiness is just a word if you don't know how it feels
Sadness an emotion that I refuse to make real
From now on I live my life and make my dreams real
No more fire without light, no more knowledge without zeal
No more tears without laughter, no more anger, no more hurt
I have to take all those things and then I throw them to the dirt
Time to set a course for greatness, time to lift my people up
No more walking into walls, find the doors to get unstuck
I have to fulfill my destiny, I am my Father's son
You can walk with me if you'd like, together we are one

Together we are strong, together we will win

Together we make things right, today it all begins
Tomorrow is a new day, history will remember us well
Yesterday is in the past, we've got new stories to tell
We've got new suns to kiss, new horizons to touch
In fact, I've really never wanted anything quite this much
So don't you try to hold me back, don't put your limits on me
I want to open up my eyes and look as far as I can see
If you don't want to fly with me please just let me be

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone

Life moves so slowly, time passes through me
Wind flows so freely, carries us softly
And I feel it's time we, look at things closely
Please won't you free me

And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone
And let me go it alone",Alone,

the 100 year old tree 
Climb up on a horse 
and let it run full speed 
Take a look down at the world from 30,000 feet 
on your next flight 

Watch a flock of birds 
against the morning sun 
Close your eyes and listen 
to the river run 
Catch a firefly in your hand 
or a raindrop on your tongue

Plant a seed and see 
what comes out of the ground 
Find the heartbeat on your baby's ultrasound 
In a few years hear it laughing, 
and don't it sound like a song? 

Stop and think about 
what you don't understand 
Things like life and love 
and how the world began 
Hear the doctor say he can't explain it, 
but the cancer is gone 

There is a God 
There is a God 
There is a God

Wise men saw a sign
And set out 'cross the sand
With songs appraised to sing

They traveled day and night
With precious gifts to bring
Guided by a light

They chased a brand new star
Ever towards the west
Over mountains far

And when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes
They'd come so many miles
This miracle they prized
Was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child
Could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world
Into the light of day

And nothing but a child
Could help erase those lines
So once again
We all can be children for a while

Now all around the world
In every little town
Every day is heard
A precious little sound

And every mother kind
And every father proud
Looks down in awe to find
Another chance allowed

And nothing but a child
Could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world
Into the light of day

And nothing but a child
Could help erase those lines
So once again
We all can be children for a while

They stand beneath the mistletoe
Embarrassed by the awkward circumstance 

He asks her if she'd like a drink
She says, ""I better not I think
Oh, what the heck, maybe just one glass""

They talk about, oh, this and that
He says, ""I like the way you laugh
And I'm so really glad you're here""

Then suddenly it's much too warm
She feels his hand against her arm
The season loves the reason for romance
It'll get you if you give it half a chance

The night goes on, the music plays
A moonlight Christmas serenade
A lovers' song that's meant for only two

And they don't even know it yet 
But this is one they'll not forget

The holiday where all their dreams came true
Across the floor he spins her around
Oh, could it be they've finally found
A love worth waiting for

Then in the tender yuletide bliss
They share an unexpected kiss

It's late into an early morn

Lee Ann Womack,"I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner
In every face I'd see you

So with nothin' more than a tank of gas
I drove away without lookin' back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
Goin' anywhere as fast as I can

And I'm a little past, little rock further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead, too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels

It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past, little rock
But a long way from over you

These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have it my way
I'd go back to where you are

Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
Oh, and I'm still a far cry from gone

Lee Ann Womack,"Down at the lost highway cafe
I met a man there with a map in his hand
He said ""I'm a little bit confused
And I'm not sure where I am""

He said, ""I'm trying to find this place
Been trying to get there for a long, long time""
Then he smiled and looked away
And asked me if I'd heard of happiness

I told him that it just might take a while
Maybe some years, and a lotta miles
Go down the road till you hit party ville
Don't stop unless you're lookin' for cheap thrills

Go past love to you hear wedding bells
Stop and honeymoon and rest a spell
You might get lost on the way is my guess
It ain't easy finding happiness

He said, ""I think I understand
I better go before the sun goes down
'Cause it's hard to see at night
And I just don't trust my eyes anymore""

I said ""Good luck"" and watched him leave
He hit the fast lane, then he disappeared
Just another weary traveler like so many
Trying to find his way back home

There's so many stops along the way
You keep on hoping that there'll come a day
I should have told him but I think he knows
So many places where he shouldn't go

So many souls that get turned around
Lookin' and wonderin' why it can't be found
It's a straight shot past loneliness
Why can't we seem to find happiness?
It's easy to get turned around I guess
On the road to happiness

When you put your arms around my neck
And I barely even kissed you back

I'da held on a little longer
And let that moment linger
And never let your fingers slip away from mine

Yeah, I work for the queen all day

Sometimes it's a bitter taste
For a motherless child so out of place
I never understood why she ran away
Maybe I'll never know

But there's a light shinin' through the trees
And a restless hum that's calling me
I could almost be carried by the breeze
And let it take me where it goes

[Chorus]

Now I'm standing on the front porch
Kettle whistling through the screen door
Little footsteps on the kitchen floor
Pretty soon we're gonna eat

I think I found a family

On our way to separate rooms

I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word we'll call it quits
Baby you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

It's been so long since I felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
It's been hard but hearts can only
Do that for so long

It's crossed my mind a time or two

Called us off a thousand times
We've called it everything but quits
We've said some things that hurt
But love's always had the last word
We've called it everything but quits

Well I might get mad but it don't last
Said things but always took 'em back

But anything worth havin' is worth fightin' for

[Chorus]
Have you seen that girl
That everybody says I used to be
Have you seen that girl
Where along the way did I lose me?
Have you seen that girl

She was full of life
Looked on the brighter side
If it was worth a chance she'd take it
Said that life is what you make it
But a few wrong moves led to a few wrong turns
And once your burned your not the same
You tend to shy from the flame
I hate to think shes giving up her dream

Some find it in working for the man
Some find it with a bottle in their hand

Some find happiness is out of reach
No matter what they do
Baby, that's not me

I wonder
About these walls of yours and mine

Then the silence that follows for days
All that leaves a home feeling broken
Lord, if these walls could talk they'd pray

If love lived here you couldn't tell
Five thousand square feet of living hell
And two hearts that need to be saved
It all died here from pure neglect
Is it too dead to resurrect
Lord, if these walls could talk they'd pray

Two little hands folded tight by her bedside
Asking Jesus will my family be ok
A child of five is just too small
Her prayers alone can't save us all

He bought it just for me down at the store
And mama bought a Goodwill gown
Added lace and beads she found
So I could wear what Cinderella wore

So much for used and abused
Abandoned, thrown away
Some things are destined to live another day
It takes a certain kind
To look deep enough to find
The beauty within
And I thank God for those
Who make the old new again

And to my baggage filled with broken things
I threw in all my hopes and dreams
And on my sleeve I wore my broken heart
I thought forever'd be how long I'd wait
Before I met the man who'd make it better
And give me a brand new start

I never wanna not believe,
That someone has a plan for me.

Live every moment as if, its the last one.
Find all the love deep within, give it away.
Be thankful for all that I've been given.
From now on, this is how I want to write,

It's burned into my brain,

Glass of Johnny Walker Red,
With no one to take you home.
They're probably closing down,
Saying, ""No more alcohol.""
I bet you're in a bar
'Cause I'm always your last call.

I don't need to check that message.
I know what it says.
""Baby, I still love you,""
Don't mean nothing when there's whiskey on your breath.
That's the only love I get.

I could not believe my eyes

Put my feet on a hardwood floor
I get to hear my children laughing
Down the hall through the

I thank God for all I've been given
At the end of every day

With so much more than I deserve

That love me
To love them so much it hurts

I know you know what I'm thinking
By the way I look at you
And when we're lying in the quiet
And no words have to be said
I think to myself, I think to myself
This love is a beautiful gift

Lee Ann Womack,"One day shy of eight years old,
When grandma passed away.
I was a broken hearted little boy,
Blowing out that birthday cake.
How I cried when the sky let go,
With a cold lonesome rain.
My mom smiled, said: ""Don't be sad child.
""Grandma's watching you today.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Seasons come and seasons go,
Nothing stays the same.
I grew up, fell in love,
Met a girl who took my name.
Year by year, we made a life,
In this sleepy little town.
I thought we'd grow old together,
Lord, I sure do miss her now.

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.
""That's how you know she's watching,
""Wishing she could be here now.
""An' sometimes if you're lonely,
""Just remember she can see.
""There's holes in the floor of Heaven
""And she's watching over you and me.""

Well my little girl is 23,
I walk her down the aisle.
It's a shame her Mom can't be here now,
To see her lovely smile.
They throw the rice, I catch her eye,
As the rain starts coming down.
She takes my hand; says: ""Daddy don't be sad,
'cause I know Mama's watching now.""

""'cause there's holes in the floor of Heaven,
""And her tears are pouring down.

Lee Ann Womack,"Her head rolls back and forth
Against the billows of her long black shiny hair
As she contemplates the ecstasy
Of some other love that now she wished was there
If she could only realize
That the love I have could beckon her command
Instead of laughing endlessly
And pushing back advances with her hands

Every night I see her leaves
A nightmare of illusions when she’s gone
And it leaves a longing feeling in a man
With a pain that lingers on
The gaudy goodbye can’t replace
The girlish giggle of her sweet hello
But tonight I’ve made my crumbled mind up
That I’ll never ever let her go

Too many nights I’ve watched her tease
By shifting all her weight from hip to hip
And with her hands brush back the falling strands
That cover up her satin lips
She struts upon the stage
And her fallen victims are callin’ out for more
But she leaves them stranded helplessly
And exits to her dressing room door

Tonight I’m gonna take her
I’ve infiltrated past the guarded door
But she just hurries by me carryin’
All those scanty costumes that she wore
And she asks a sawed off cigar smokin’ cat
If he would open up the door
Then she told him to load the baggage
Because they open tomorrow night in Baltimore

I’m gonna be there tomorrow night in Baltimore",Tomorrow Night in Baltimore,2014

He said “how do you do?”

He gave me a bottle full of something sweet
Said I’ll fill it up every time we meet

'Neath the Town Hall light

Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run

The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand

There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso

Lee Blanton,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,2005
Lee Brandon,"How do you keep
The music playing?
How do you make it last
How do keep
The song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself
To someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run
Out of new things
To say

And since you know
We're always changing
How can it be the same
And tell me how
Year after year
You're sure your heart
Will fall apart
Each time
You hear her name

I know the way
I feel for you
Is now or never
The more
I love the more
There I'm afraid
That in yours eyes
I may not see forever

The best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends

Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off

The chills I get when you lay your lips on mine

Do you want to dance all night
Do you want to take a little

I found my soul in rock and roll when me and my first guitar were introduced
Truth is I've only loved one woman
And she'd have stayed, but I made her leave

Standing in the lake watching water skis go by,

God, she felt so unbelievable in his arms
But now she's catching her self looking down at her ring every now and then

So this morning she had coffee with a brand new friend
She still had a half of a cup left when he asked her, ""Can I see you again?""

But now she's catching herself looking down at her ring every now and then
She don't want to leave, she just needs him to be that way again

And midnight played like a drive in scene

With sand in your hair and sand in my jeans

And the sunset looked like an airbrushed t-shirt

Stuck a gun to my chest and told me to drive.
I was scared but she was beautiful, like a movie.

She kept lookin' back like somethin' was comin',
Said we ain't slowin' down, ain't stoppin' for nothin',
My truck was shaking, my blood was pumpin',
But she was laughin'.

I 'bout hit the brakes when we came around the corner,
A mile of blue lights, guns aimed and pointed.
Whatever she had is what they wanted,
And it's all a little fuzzy after that.

Blue lights flashin' and drivin',
Dirt lane passin' and flyin',
Tearin' through the red lights,
Blowin' through the stop signs.
All I remember is sirens,
Ringin' from the gun shots firin',
One curve away from dyin',
And all I remember is...

The man on the radio reported the chase,
And all about the beauty,
How she cleaned out the bank.
She was armed and dangerous,
She almost got away but they found her.
She was cussin' at choppers,
They were swirlin' around,
Reloadin' her revolver every couple-a-rounds.
Shot off a couple shots,
But they wouldn't back down.

And kissed me on the cheek and said,

Lee Brice,"I'm down on my knees again
A call for my repentance
The war has taken over me
I beg for the forgiveness
The bullets ricochet uh
I hear 'em when I sleep now
The blood is on my hands Lord
From man, woman, and child
I'm a soldier from my country
But a slave unto my gun
The screams to echo louder
God, what have I become?
I pledge my allegiance
I left my family, a new born baby
To slay the enemy, the struggle for power
The lust, the fantasy
I trusted America, she took my sanity

Winds of change rolling in
Take your love back again
I your fool, Amen
Just a bowl for your violin
You played me
You made me, your violin

She looks at her reflection
Eyes black and blue
She told them she would leave him
She said she was through
He took her from a small town
Showed her the big city life
He promised her the world
Then he made her his wife
But he runs around town
He's a cheater and a beater
She's sleeping with the enemy
But no one believes her
A diamond green, a glass of whiskey
The bottle of pain pills open and empty
She left a letter ""to hell I send thee""
He brought home flowers, ashamed and guilty
Too late

Winds of change rolling in
Take your love back again
I your fool, Amen
Just a bowl for your violin
You played me
You made me, your violin

Uh, you was like a rag
I've been washed up and dragged through the mud like a thief
From all the beefs and my love, take it up, take a down
Took a left, took a right, there's no one to be found
To explain to me why
Why it was me that was brought to the edge of the cliff
'Cause this is not fair but why should you care?
The choices I've made of mine but I swear that all can not be the fault of just me
I've tried to maintain my wants and my needs
To work and not see the changes I've strived for
A better life for my family I would die for
Taking away everything from me
And that's why more
Tell me to make a decision in front of five doors
As I'm praying, I'm saying 'Why lord?'
Send me to a war without a sword
I'll fight and I'll fight more
I'll travel along road
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord
You played me
'Cause I'm just a violin
My life is another cord

You made me, your violin
You played me
You made me, your violin",Violin,2017
Lee Brown,"Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories

Got my bag, got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
Long to hear that all aboard

Seven, that's the time we leave, at seven
I'll be waitin' up at heaven
Countin' every mile of railroad track
That takes me back

Never thought my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take that sentimental journey

You can get the play

I'm shivering
We can buy some wood and something to eat

Lee Collins,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,2000
Lee Collins,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter

Lee Davis,"The night is young, the skies are clear 
So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Mi, mi, mi, mi, 
Re, re, re, re, 
Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

In the end it'll be figured out

Deeper than your sweetest dream

You can't feel what it's like 'till you've been there my friend 
I'm fallen I'm fallen away 
Fallen away 

And have you said everything that you needed to say

And I found myself answering back 
Is everybody staring or is it all in my mind 
I'm fallen I'm fallen away

The picture is constantly changed 
I tried to avoid it but it's part of me now

'Cause I need you to know

And all of the wine we had
And I almost forgot that the world fell apart today

Is the taste of your lips and the smell of your skin

And my eyes are getting tired 'cause you turned the lights down low
And your heart's only beat speak under the shades

Would you come fly away at the sunrise of day

And other times I think you know me best
I could love you better but I'd never wanna love you less

Tried to make a living on her own
And then I came along and I took her from her mother
And now my heart is where she calls her home

Tried to give her everything I promised
But things don't always go just as we plan
We built our world and we tore it down
But I can't do this on my own because her heart is where I call my home

And who would've known that I'd ever get to see her in her down
And who would've thought that the two of us would ever give a vow
But just look at us now

Counting down the days, second guessing
It was full of clouds, my feet were cold
I packed my things and ran away
In fact didn't even really lost a day because her heart is where I call my home

So I guess I'll be honest with myself
I'm going down this road I never known
This road has turns and this road has hills
But I know I'm always gonna love her still because her heart is where I call my home

Lee Greene,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1997
Lee Greene,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Never were as blue as his eyes

And vowed that I'd never love anyone else again
Only him

As pure a s my gown of white I stood by his side
And promised that I'd love you till the day I died
Lord, please forgive me even though I lied
'Cause you're the only one who knows just how hard I tried

I had a ring on my finger and time on my hands
The woman in my needed the warmth of a man
The gold turned cold in my wedding band
It's just a ring on your finger
When there's time on your hands

When I add up all the countless nights I cried myself to sleep
And all the broken promises you somehow failed to keep
He can't blame me

He's the one who left me too many times alone
In a three bedroom prison
I tried to make a home
My love slowly died but the fire inside still burned
And the arms of a stranger was the only place left to turn

 I reach out to find a light so she can see
 Then I wait to hear her story
 Why she stayed out late tonight & she tells me
 That it really wasn't her fault
 If she'd had her ways she'd have been home hours ago
 That's when her tears start to flowin'
 And she swears it's true but in my heart I know

 When I'm sure that I've convinced her
 That I believe her story then I turn away
 I don't let her know she's hurt me
 'Cause the words stick in my throat I want to say
 And I'm so afraid I'll lose her
 If she knew I knew the truth she just might go
 So I listen to her story
 Try to hide the hurt, but in my heart I know

 She's lying, there's not a word of truth in her crying
 And still I've got this awful urge to take her in my arms and hold her tight
 God, I know she's lying, a little more of me keeps on dying
 Oh how I wish that I could be the one that she's been lyin' with tonight
 Instead of me I'd rather be the one that she's been lyin' with tonight
 She's lying",She's Lying,1982
Lee Greenwood,"It's over, I left the door unlocked again
But this time someone new walked in
While she was all alone

And he told her that there was much more life to see
Than she would ever see with me
Now she's going, going, gone

It's over, I never thought I'd see this day
When everything would walk away
That I depended on God, he'll hold her

To make sure she don't change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone

I should have paid attention, there were many warning signs
But I just never thought she'd walk away
Here I stand in silence, just an echo of the words
I heard her say

She said, it's over and much too late to change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone

Lee Greenwood,"Lonely lady living down the hall
 Don't you have any friends at all
 I never hear a knocking at your door
 Could it be you just don't try anymore?
 You've been hurt so seriously
 You act so cold but it's so easy to see
 You're a waste of real good love
 But you can't hide or run fast enough

 [Chorus]
 Somebody's gonna love you, no matter what you do
 Somebody's gonna find all the pieces of a broken heart
 Hidden inside of you
 Somebody's gonna touch you, it's just a matter of time
 And if you're ever gonna try love again, it might as well be mine

 I know exactly how a heartache feels
 It's gonna take a little time to heal
 Why must you hide away inside yourself
 You could mean so much to someone else
 Every night while you're sittin' at home
 You may be lonely but you're not alone
 There's a whole world full of people out there
 Waiting on someone like you to care

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle

Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

I DIDN'T SEE THE NEED FOR ANYONE
NOW IT'S CLEAR THAT I WAS BLIND

AND I KNOW HOW MUCH I HURT MYSELF
BUT I FELT NO PAIN

I NEEDED SOMEONE
BUT I JUST KEPT RUNNING
SO FAR AWAY
IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE, BUT

YOU MAKE IT SO EASY TO BE WITH YOU
YOU BROKE THROUGH, OH

If I only knew then what I know now
You wouldn't be sayin' goodbye

I took a perfect love & gave you a perfect heartache
I took a band of gold & made a 24-carat mistake
& turned it into...

Fool's gold, and I was a fool 'cause I let you go
Fool's gold, yes I was a fool 'cause I didn't know
Too many times I just didn't try
Now all I hear is you sayin' goodbye
Starin' at an empty hand full of fool's gold

If I'd spent the time just holdin' you tight
& sharin' my feelings with you
Then you'd understand what's inside of this man
& you'd know what I'm goin' through
I know that I was wrong now that it's too late
I took a band of gold & made a 24-carat mistake
& turned it into...

To keep holding on with hope in our hearts

Sometimes it seems we would be just as well 
Off on our own knowing somebody else 
Then I think about all we've been through

There have been so many nights that you saved me 
There have been so many mornings you gave me 
The courage to get up and get out of bed 
To face the world one more day 
There have been so many trials we've conquered together 
And so many miles of rough roads we've weathered 
And I swear forever that I'll never leave 
Cause lady, I still believe 

You bring out my best, you can bring out my worst 
You feed every hunger, then leave me burning with thirst 
And at the moment that I know that I'll surely die 
Your love is my fountain of life

Before the mornin' paper, before the coffee's on

My baby knows, it's the time we share
She wakes me gently and brushes back her hair
And she moves into my arms, sweet and slow
I can't wait to get up and go

Gonna take my baby on a mornin' ride
When the sun comes slippin' 'round the mountain side
'Bout an hour, maybe two
Ain't nothin' me and her would rather do

Than see the green grass glist'nin' in the mornin' dew
While the world is still damn spankin' new
Oh, I know how beautiful the day will be
When she takes a mornin' ride with me

And when we get back, it will feel so right
To just lay back and linger in the mornin' light
Then she'll smile at me, thinkin' where we've been
Wantin' me to take her again

I'm gonna take my baby on a mornin' ride

In the deep blue water rise
So many danger signs
I've come to recognise

I should go but I hold on
I swallow back my pride
Leaving should be natural
But how can I decide

Between a rock, and a heartache
There is just no place left to turn
Way down deep, I know I can't win
With the choice I've got to make
Between a rock, and a heartache

Rise the face of day
I swear this time is over
There is nothing left to say

You call me up sweet talking
Saying we'll be friends
Even though is crazy
I know I am trapped again

Way down deep, I know I can't win
With the choice I've got to make
Between a rock, and a heartache

It tears me up to know, I've got to chose

Way down deep, I know I can't win

On Mary's lap is sleeping? 
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet, 
While shepherds watch are keeping? 
This, this is Christ the King, 
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing: 
Haste, haste to bring him laud, 
The babe, the son of Mary. 

Why lies he in such mean estate 
Where ox and ass are feeding? 
Good Christian, fear: for sinners here 
The silent Word is pleading. 
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through, 
The Cross be borne for me, for you; 
Hail, hail, the Word made flesh, 
The Babe, the Son of Mary. 

So bring him incense, gold, and myrrh, 
Come, peasant, king, to own him.

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.

Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;

O night, O holy night, O night divine!

With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

Lee Greenwood,"I would pick and we would sing to the rhythm of that front porch swing
The moonlight holds the spotlight that we shared
I found new notes on that old guitar, she believed I could be a star
She told me that she wanted to be fair

And she said, I love you more than to hold you down
Boy you're glory bound
We can't share a world with different dreams
So I chased mine and she found hers too
Someone else made hers come true
Now I'm a star, but every time I sing

My heart goes drifting down a dusty Dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the Dixie road

Every night I'm in a different place and I'm searching every stranger's face
Trying to find the girl that's just not there
She's back there in Montgomery and I'm clear across the country
But whenever I'm alone I go back there

My heart goes drifting down a dusty Dixie road

And then I act a little crazy when I'm feeling ya flow
Like dynamite you're a real go getter

Bouncing up and down on a roll

Taking all my clothes off
Swim butt naked
Till I get arrested
I'll do most anything for you
Cause I like your dirty attitude
Dancing on hot coals
Juggling with a chainsaws
Sleeping on a nail bed
All this and more
I'll do most anything for you
Yes anything for you

Well now I'm in trouble
Caught by the cops
For the love that I showed you out on the rocks
But that don't mean a thing to me
'cause when you're near me I'm feeling free
So give me the smile
That makes me go wild
Give me the look that got me so hooked
So tie me down before I explode
You're the best of all the feathers I ever did know

Bouncing on the town here we go
Bouncing up and down on a roll
Turn on the lights
See my delights

You won't find it on any map.

Lee Hazlewood,"Don Lowance, the man who plays guitar with me, and I
Were born in a small town
And we kinda think it was a different sort of small
Town because in our town, we had a dragon and people
Used to make up stories about the dragon

Sinse the stories were made up most of them started:
""Once upon a time, there was a very friendly dragon""
Except people didn't have any way of knowing that the
Dragon was friendly so they shot at him with guns and
Threw rocks at him. And the dragon being a sort of a
Poor sport, he ate a lot of those people up

Now, the dragon was messing up their senses, something
Fierce until one day he wandered into the store that
Sold spirits, and after making a fast brunch of the
Owner and four emplyees, he broke into this wine
Barrel
And that did it, from that day on the dragon was not
Only a friendly dragon, he was a happy friendly dragon

And now all he does is walk up and down the streets of
Our small town and tap people on their shoulders and
Ask them for a little change so he can buy some of that
Stuff that he likes better than people

Buddy can you spare a dime
For a little glass of wine
Buddy don't you pity me
Just one drink then I'll be
In a world all my own
The only place I call home
Where no hurt can get to me
And no one but me can see

Pretty flowers dance and sing
Laughter is a common thing
Where no hate has ever been
'Cause I won't let it in
By the warm purple flame
Every little grape calls my name
As it climbs on the fire
And makes the fire burn higher

Higher than it's ever been
Time and space mean nothing then
I fall about a mile or two
So pardon me if I ask you
Buddy can you spare a dime

And that's the story of the little town that Don and I
Was born in and our dragon, fairly strange story",First Street Blues,1965

And I am a part of every tear that you cry

Lee Hazlewood,"See the candle light burning
In a cabin not so far
From a river wild, that's friendly as a child
To an old man and his guitar

Spends each lonely night just wishing
On some long forgotten star
Dreaming dreams until only dreams seem real
To an old man and his guitar

Remembering loves, remembering springs
So many loves, so many springs
But there was one he loved the best
She made him soon forget the rest

His hands that once played only magic
Now where the sting of times crewel scars
But all his songs aren't sung the best is yet to come
For an old man and his guitar",The Old Man and His Guitar,2002

we went so high we couldn't stop
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere 
Two of us together building castles in the air 
We spun so fast we couldn't tell 
the gold ring from the carousel 
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had
I miss the Hungry Years 
the once upon a time 
the lovely long ago 
we didn't a dime 
those days of me and you, 
we lost along the way 
how could I be so blind 
not to see the door 
closing on the World 
I now hunger for 
Looking through my tears, 
I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one 
Making plans was so much fun 
We set our goals and reached the highest star 
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you 
with everything and nothing too 
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay 
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday
I miss the Hungry Years

And taken off the market in the afternoon
You can buy a piece of it if you want to
It's been good to me if it's been good for you

Take the grand look now the fire is burning
Is that your reflection on the wall?
I can show you this room and some others
If you came to see the house at all

Careful up the stairs, a few are missing
I haven't had the time to make repairs
First step is the hardest one to master
Last one I'm not really sure is there

This room here once had childish laughter
And I come back to hear it now and again
I can't say that I'm certain what you're after
But in this room, a part of you will remain

Second floor, the lady sleeps in waiting
Past the lantern, tiptoe in its glance
In the room the soft brown arms of shadow
This room the hardest one to pass

How much will you pay to live in the attic?
The shavings off your mind are the only rent
I left some would there if you thought you couldn't
Or if the shouldn't that you've bought has been spent

A song that I had only sang to just a few

And I will give to you summer wine

Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine

I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet

And then she gave to me more summer wine

Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine

My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine

The turning tide
Breathes all the mystery of you...

Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

And work boots on a backdoor step
Scones in the oven and preserves in jars
Talking prices at the sale yards
It's long straight roads and one horse towns
And sheep dogs bringing the mob around
It's she'll be right and having a go
It's good on ya mate and what do ya know?

Fields of wheat and rows of corn
A rusty tank and flaking paint

A simple gathering of melody and rhyme
Written down and twicked a bit
Ink pen on manuscript
Little town Little song
Lookin' for somewhere to belong
Sat in a bureau drawer
Pulled out then performed
For a governor and mayor
A low clock scratched me down
Next mornin' we left town
And he was hummin' as we rode
And I wondered where we'd go
On and on round and round
Far and wide am I bound

Always wondering free
On and on like the wind
I am home I am friend
And you'll always be as close

I crossed the mountain trails
They sing my story from the cave to Morton Bay
And send me on my way
On and on round and round
Far and wide am I bound

Always wondering free
On and on like the wind
I am home, I am friend
And you'll always be as close
As a whisper to me

As Private Monroe gentle sang
I floated over no mans land
I've seen the tears
Of countless lonely sons
I've crossed the raging seas
Wound up in symphonies
Was there in victories
Been song on bended knees
Of just some notes and verse
Nothing more and nothing less
You find me at the stock camp
As their passin' out the rum
Out near where I'm from
On and on round and round
Far and wide am I bound
I'm a gift I'm a drifter
Always wondering free
On and on like the wind

Promise me now you’ll remember me just like this
The cool desert night and the stars as
So when we’re apart no matter how empty things seem
I’ll be here by the river in your Diamantina dream.

At seven years of age,
You walked right up and kissed
My cheek and laughed and ran away.
I blushed and got embarrassed,
And teased by all my friends,
And I promised you I never would forget.
At 17 we stole a kiss,
Down by the river bend,
And we were high school sweethearts
When school came to an end.
But you said you had to travel on,
That Id find someone new,
And as we said goodbye I swore to you

I'll remember, how you
For every moment, of every passing day
And ill promise u forever
If its all I ever do.
I'll remember, Ill remember you.

Just gets better everyday,

A melody we use to know
Remember how it was back then

Till all the stars fell from the sky

The song could take you back in time

But she's living in the past
She didn't know it wouldn't last
And it's a long, long, lonely road
Oh, to go down

The treasured names
You call each other just for fun
And as you woke
She kissed your eyes
You killed it all when it had
Only just begun
What's it take to make you realise

Love isn't easy though
Many like to think it is
But you must learn
To give and take or know
What you will miss

As we dance beside the moon

It's always on my mine

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true.

Her only answer is one little smile,
