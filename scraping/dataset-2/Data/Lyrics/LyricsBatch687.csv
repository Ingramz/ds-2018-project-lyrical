Martin Yates,"From Song and Dance I have never felt like this
For once I'm lost for words
Your smile has really thrown me
This is not like me at all
I never thought I'd know
The kind of love you've shown me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing

I don't know what is going on
Can't work it out at all
Whatever made you choose me
I just can't believe my eyes
You look at me as though
You couldn't bear to lose me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing

I have never felt like this
For once I'm lost for words
Your smile has really thrown me
This is not like me at all
I never thought I'd know
The kind of love you've shown me

Now, no matter where I am
No matter what I do
I see your face appearing
Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing

Like an unexpected song
An unexpected song
That only we are hearing",Unexpected Song [From Song and Dance],2001
Martin Yates,"You were once
My one companion
You were all
That mattered
You were once
A friend and father
Then my world
Was shattered

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Wishing you were
Somehow near
Sometimes it seemed
If I just dreamed
Somehow you would
Be here

Wishing I could
Hear your voice again
Knowing that I
Never would
Dreaming of you
Won't help me to do
All that you dreamed
I could

Passing bells
And sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem, for you
The wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were
Somehow here again
Knowing we must
Say goodbye
Try to forgive
Teach me to live
Give me the strength
To try

No more memories
No more silent tears
No more gazing across
The wasted years
Help me say
Goodbye",Wishing you were Somehow Still here Again [From Phantom of the Opera],2001
Martin Yates,"They don't want me any more, 
They all say I'm through 
Well it's time they knew 

With on look 
I can break your heart 
With one look 
I play every part 
I can make your sad heart sing 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know. 

With one smile 
I'm the girl next door 
Or the love that you've hungered for 
When I speak it's with my soul 
I can play any role 

No words can tell 
The stories my eyes tell 
Watch me when I frown 
You can't write that down 
You know I'm right 
It's there in black and white 
When I look your way 
You'll hear what I say. 

Yes, with one look 
I put words to shame 
Just one look 
Sets the screen aflame 
Silent music starts to play 
One tear from my eye 
Makes the whole world cry. 

With one look 
They'll forgive the past 
They'll rejoice: I've returned at last 
To my people in the dark 
Still out there in the dark 

Silent music starts to play 
With one look you'll know 
All you need to know. 

With one look 
I'll ignite a blaze 
I'll return to my glory days 
They'll say Norma's back at last. 

This time I'm staying 
I'm staying for good 
I'll be back 
Where I was born to be 
With one look 
I'll be me",With One Look [From Sunset Boulevard],2001
Martin Yates,"Passarino - go away!
For the trap is set and waits for
Its prey!

You have come here
In pursuit of
Your deepest urge,
In pursuit of 
That wish,
Which till now
Has been silent,
Silent...

I have brought you,
That our passions
May fuse and merge - 
In your mind
You've already
Succumbed to me,
Dropped all defences,
Completely succumbed to me -
Now you are here with me:
No second thoughts,
You've decided,
Decided...

Past the point
Of no return -
No backward glances:
The games we've played
Till now are at
An end...
Past all thought
Of ""if"" or ""when"" -
No use resisting:
Abandon thought
And let the dream
Descend...

What raging fire
Shall flood the soul?
Which rich desire
Unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
Lies before
Us...?

Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold - 
What warm,
Unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point
Of no return...

CHRISTINE
You have brought me
To that moment
Where words run dry,
To that moment
Where speech
Disappears
Into silence,
Silence...

I have come here,
Hardly knowing
The reason why...
In my mind,
I've already
Imagined our
Bodies entwining,
Defenceless and silent -
And now I am
Here with you:
No second thoughts,

I've decided,
Decided...

Past the point 
Of no return - 
No going back now:
Our passion-play
Has now, at last
Begun...
Past all thought
Of right or wrong -
One final question:
How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...?

When will the blood
Begin to race,
The sleeping bud
Burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
At last consume
Us...?

BOTH
Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold -
The bridge
Is crossed, so stand
And watch it burn...
We've passed the point
Of no return...

PHANTOM
Say you'll share with
Me one
Love, one lifetime...
Lead me, save me
From my solitude...

Say you want me
With you,
Here beside you...
Anywhere you go
Let me go too - 
Christine,
That's all I ask of...

Are.

GIRY
(spoken)
You must. But remember: your hand at
The level of your eyes!

RAOUL

But why...?

Why? The Punjab lasso, monsieur. First
Buquet. Now Piangi.

MEG
(spoken)
Like this, monsieur. I'll come with you.

(spoken)
No, Meg! No, you stay here!

Come with me, monsieur. Hurry, or we
Shall be too late",The Point of No Return,2002
Martin Yates,"No more talk of darkness,
Forget these wide-eyed fears;
I'm here, nothing can harm you,
My words will warm and calm you.

Let me be your freedom,
Let daylight dry your tears;
I'm here, with you, beside you,
To guard you and to guide you.

Say you love me every waking moment,
Turn my head with talk of summertime.
Say you need me with you now and always;
Promise me that all you say is true,
That's all I ask of you.

Let me be your shelter,
Let me be your light;
You're safe, no one will find you,
Your fears are far behind you.

All I want is freedom,
A world with no more night;
And you, always beside me,
To hold me and to hide me.

Then say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Let me lead you from your solitude.
Say you need me with you, here beside you,
Anywhere you go, let me go too,
Christine, that's all I ask of you

Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime;
Say the word and I will follow you.

Share each day with me,
Each night, each morning.

Say you love me!
RAOUL
You know I do.

Anywhere you go, let me go to
Love me, that's all I ask of you.
(they kiss)

I must go
They'll wonder where I am
Wait for me Raoul!

Christine I love you!

Order your fine horses!
Be with them at the door!

And soon you'll be beside me!

You'll guard me and you'll guide me
(they hurry off and the phantom emerges from behind the statue)

I gave you my music
Made your song take wing
And now how you've repaid me
Denied me and betrayed me
He was bound to love you when he heard you sing
Christine
Christine

Say you'll share with me one love,
One lifetime say the word and I will follow you
Share each day with me, each night, each morning

You will curse the day you did not do

Martin Yates,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],2002
Martin Yates,"Whistle down the wind
Let your voices carry
Drown out all the rain
Light a patch of darkness
Treacherous and scary

Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you
I'll be there to stop
The tears and all the weeping

Make it clear and strong
So the whole night long
Every signal that you send
Until the very end
I will not abandon you 
My precious friend

So try and stand the time
Then your ways abandon
Send a flare up in the sky
Try to burn a torch

And try to build a bonfire
Every signal that you send
Until the very end out there
So whistle down the wind
For I have always been right there

Howl at the stars
Whisper when you're sleeping
I'll be there to hold you

Right there",Whistle Down The Wind [From Whistle Down the Wind],2004
Martin Yates,"What a day this has been!
What a rare mood I'm in!
Why, it's almost like being in love
 
There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love
 
All the music of life seems to be
Like a bell that is ringing for me
And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peal
I would swear I was falling
I could swear I was falling

Martin Yates,"Nothing is so good it lasts eternally
Perfect situations must go wrong
But this has never yet prevented me
From wanting far too much for far too long
Looking back, I could have done it differently
Won a few more moments, who can tell?
But it took time to understand the man
Now at least I know, I know him well

Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom
I know him so well

No one in your life is with you constantly
No one is completely on your side
And though I move my world to be with him
Still the gap between us is too wide
Looking back, I could have played it differently
Learned about the man before I fell
But I was ever so much younger then

Wasn't it good (oh so good), 
Wasn't it fine (so fine)
Isn't it madness he can't be mine

Didn't I know how it would go
If I knew from the start
Why am I falling apart

Wasn't it fine
Isn't it madness he can't be mine
But in the end, he needs a little more than before
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom

A very good place to start
When you read, you begin with--

Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name, I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will lead us back to Do, oh, oh, oh
[WITH CHILDREN] Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name, I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will lead us back to Do
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do-- So-- Do

[SPOKEN] Now, children, once you have these notes in your head, you can sing a
million tunes by mixing them up--like this:
[SUNG] So, Do, La, Fa, Mi, Do, Re... [SPOKEN] Now you do it.

Martin Yates,"Oh what a circus, oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress called Eva Peron
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all of the misery right

Oh what an exit, that's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried like Eva Peron
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country in a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all the world's papers today

But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?

She had her moments, she had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the casa rosada crying, ""Eva Peron""
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see and how, she did nothing for years

Salve regina mater misericordiae
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra
Salve salve regina
Ad te clamamus exules filii eva
Ad te suspiramus gementes et flentes
O clemens o pia
Hail, oh queen, mother of mercy
Our life, sweetness, and hope
Hail, hail, oh queen
To you we cry, exiled sons of eve
To you we sigh, mourning and weeping
Oh clement, oh loving one

You let down your people Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted, not much to ask for
But in the end you could not deliver

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
And she's not coming back to you

Show business kept us all alive
Since seventeen October 1945
But the star has gone, the glamor's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in

Instead of government we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud

Sing you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead, your king is through
She's not coming back to you

Don't cry for me Argentina
For I am ordinary, unimportant
And undeserving of such attention

Hits you when it's too late, hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game, nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain feeling like a clown

It ain't right with love to share
When you find she doesn't care, for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on, on you

It's a heartache, nothing but a heartache
Love her till your arms break
Then she lets you down

When you find she doesn't care for you

"Martin, Bogan & the Armstrongs","I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1993

That you and I were truly one,
That our future was forever
And would never come undone,
And we came so close to be close
And thought you cared for me
There's distance in your eyes tonight
So we're not meant to be.
The love is gone,
The love is gone,
The sweetest dream
That we had ever known.
The love is gone,
The love is gone,
I wish you well
But I must leave you now alone.
There comes a moment in your life
Like a window, and you see
That your future is there before you
And how perfect life would be,
But adventures call with unknown voices
Pulling you away
Be careful or you may regret
The choices you made someday
When love is gone,
When love is gone,
The sweetest dream
That we had ever known.
When love is gone,
When love is gone,
I wish you well
But I must leave you now alone.
It was almost love,
It was almost always,
It was like a fairytale we'd live out
You and I.
And yes some dreams come true,
And yes some dreams go trough
And yes the time has come
For us to say goodbye.

Though she looked a little worried and weak.
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But daddy'd left the proof on her cheek.
And I was only eight years old that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair in town
On Independence Day.

Well ,word gets around in a small,small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But mama was proud and she stood her ground
But she knew she was on the losin' end.
Some folks whispered and some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out there was no one about
On Independence Day.

Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today
Is a day of reckoning.
Let the weak be strong, let the right be wrong
Roll the stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day.

Well,she lit up the sky that fourth of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames
And took down some names
And send me to the county home.
Now I ain't sayin' it's right or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way.
Talk about your revolution

Barely brush each other's hand
He says ""I'm sorry""
She says ""Don't worry""

And it's like they were meant to be
Lying there with her he softly whispers

Feel like a mile wide ditch 
I got a hole inside 
The doctor just can't stitch 
Gone without a trace 
You left a hollow place 
There's not a stone to mark 
Where I used to have a heart 
 
There were times when I would 
hold you 
And feel the pounding in 
by chest

As a canyon way out west 
That's how deep I love you 
Babe, I love you  still 
To the bottom of this space 
I'll never fill

And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

Hey baby how you been?
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only want what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now

Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family
And we've got each other
And I found out the hard way that

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives with drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean, white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walkin' around in a culture of darkness
Livin' together alone, and all I can say is

Love's the only house big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house big enough for all the pain

And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty and together we'll make a stand
Somewhere cross the parking lot some bands playin' out of tune
City streets are gonna burn if we don't do something soon
And senorita can't quit cryin', baby's due now any day
Don Juan left, got sick of tryin'
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store and
She said I, I wanna buy a little carton of milk but I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey cause the pain's gotta go somewhere
Yeah the pain's gotta go someplace

Though my heart may break tomorrow

The gems that others gave me
Will shine upon my hair

And even those who know me
Will think my heart is light

With a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him
As though he were a charm

Once he smiled upon her
And once he smiled on me
But they knew not what I suffered
For they found no change in me

I'll be all smiles tonight

Never let down my guard
Closed the curtain on my heart
So the world could not see
All the demons in me
Told myself I was free

Then you showed me how wrong I could be

Now I'm standing on a mountain of rubble
That once was a wall
Took years to build around me
And you came along
And you tore it down
Like it was nothing at all
Now it's a little scary
Learning to fall

When you looked in my eyes
Past the fear and false pride
You saw goodness inside
I can't believe how I feel
I believe love is real
And I'm ready to heal

You show me how right I can be

To keep me in their prayers
Remind them how I need
To feel them everywhere

Nothing's ever gonna bring her down
And everywhere she goes

It makes you want to cry, she's so beautiful

In my blue jeans and my bare feet
I saw old Mrs. Mayo in her garden so high

She got her prize azaleas
And her big ole fat tomatoes
She invited me in to have a piece of her pie

And later on I thought I'd head on down
By the Caley River to the old rope swing
There was a bunch of kids laughin' and jumpin' in
I sat down on the grass and I just watched them play
And all my worries seemed to wash away

Oh it's a magical thing
When the sun is shining down on me
And this is such a beautiful place
Don't want to miss a minute of today it's
So magical

Tell myself to live a little freer and love a little better
Gonna soak it in like there's no tomorrow
And drink up every second like a big ole glass of water

Martina McBride,"I want to tell you all the story bout the Harper Valley widow wife
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play
She said mama I got a note here from the Harper Valley PTA
The note said Mrs Johnson you're a wearing your dresses way too high
It's reported you've been drinking and a running round with men and goin' wild
We don't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way
It was signed by the secretary Harper Valley PTA
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
They were sure surprised when Mrs Johnson wore her miniskirt into the room
She walked up to the blackboard and I recall the things she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA
Now there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he asked me for a date
And Mrs Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice whenever he's away
And Mr Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town
And shouldn't wodow Jones be told to keep
Her window shades all pulled completely down
Well Mr Harper couldn't make it cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
When you have the nerve to tell me that you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Payton Place and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did it happened just this way

To see what I might see
And having never sailed before
I drifted aimlessly
A warm breeze rocked my boat until
In slumber I fell sound
But woke to find the light grown dim
And dark clouds gathering 'round

In haste I worked at turning back
But now the wind blew wrong
And when the night came cold and black
My strength was almost gone
But with one last small thread of hope
I bowed my head to pray
Then through the dark I saw a rope
And heard a calm voice say

Grab the rope
Hold it tight
In the distance
Shines a light
Neither fear
Nor feel alone
There is One
Who'll lead you home

But did as I was told
And with the rosey dawn at last
Dry land I did behold
I kissed the sandy banks and swore
My sailing days were through
But should I ever stray from shore
I know now what to do

Nor feel alone

Find a way to keep that baby she carried

Pull the blinds and lock the doors
And hang a pleasant picture on the wall

They were herding us in and out of there like we were cattle
Not exactly the fairy tale that I had planned
But mama said, 'aren't you supposed to get married, girl
Before you bring a baby in this world?'
And what could I say but 'yes, ma'am'?

And I called her from that chapel in Love Land
I said, 'I really love this man.'

Seemed like a lifetime driving from Vegas to Oklahoma
If you're allowed a number of mistakes in life, maybe I've filled my quota
They called it a reception, saying we did the right thing
And they smiled their broken smiles
Said, 'who needs to walk down the aisle?'
And I showed off my wedding ring

And we walked away hand in hand to Love Land
Oh, how I love this man
Love Land

Amazing all the progress we've made since the days of Thomas Edison
Still only God gives life in spite of modern medicine
Doctor's voices whispered, 'we did all that we could do
But your baby wasn't strong enough
To make it the whole nine months.'
And as my world broke in two
He said, 'I'll carry you through to Love Land.'

For the longest time I blamed myself
Thought I was paying for my mistakes
But we tried again
Now we're watchin' him blow three candles out

Martina McBride,"Hold me like a wild flower
Fall around me like a sun shower
Kiss me like you're on fire
And tell me what's underneath

Show me
I want you to show me
What love is

Run with me like a hell bent Gypsy
Scream for me from the highest balcony
Carve my name on an old red door in Spain
Make me immortal, make me immortal in your heart

Show me
I want you to show me
What love is
What love is

Baby, get my attention
Touch me deep inside
Show me what I've been missing
Missing all my life

Give me my finest hour
Give me my ray of light
Give me something that can't be denied

Like a thousand red balloons
In a sapphire sky
A roman candle burning
Burning through the night

Like the pyramids in Egypt
The diamonds in your eyes
Show me
Show me what love is

Like the Eiffel tower shining
With a million lights
Snowflakes falling like confetti
On a New York City night

And to hold on to forever
Newborn babies cry
(Show me, show me)
I want you to show me
What love is

Show me
Show me what love is
Like a wild flower
(Like a wild flower)

Martina McBride,"I wondered how to come to You,
I did not dare believe it true, that You regard the orphaned ones:
Beloved daughters, worthy sons, 
The broken and the barren too,
I heard I could find some rest in You.

What kind of love in injury's place, 
Would leave instead the stain of grace?
So I come in sorrow and I come in shame.
I come to the cross with my pain.

Just as I am, without one plea,
But that thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

The pardon that I found from sin spilled out from where the nails went in.
My heart will ever more proclaim
I had not lived until that day.
And I know there is a crown for me
Beyond where mortal eyes can see
And I don't nod to any man,
But offer me just as I am.

So I come rejoicing with hands held high,
And I come singing words of new life.

Just as I am, without one plea,
But that thy blood was shed for me
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God,
O Lamb of God,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

No, I love you still.

It twists you and it shakes you before it turns you upside down

And You can't look back, so just live it up and feel the rush

We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed since I don't know when

And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

Searching for light.
Cold and alone,
No comfort in sight.

Always moving and goin' nowhere.

All is lost, there's no place for beginning,
All that's left is an unhappy ending.

Martina McBride,"I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all you can show me
Is the prairie and the sky

And I don't want to hear a sad story
Full of heartbreak and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain 
In the night and I watched it burn
I watched it burn, I watched it burn

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well you really got me this time
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive
And I come to listen for the sound
Of the trucks as they move down
Out on 95
And pretend that it's the ocean
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean
Baby, do you know what I mean?

I would rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I would hold my life in his saving grace
I would walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham

Martina McBride,"Just an old country boy, wearing my Osh-Kosh boots
Walked by the trailer factory, every day on my way to school
And early on in life, the only thing I wanted to do
Was buy me a trailer and move it down to Grandview

Got out of high school, got on at Whirpool
Bought me a car, two guitars and everything
Me and Patty were falling in love before the summer was through
I started thinking about trailers and high lots in Grandview

It was a scorching summer night, we just left the dairy bar
We was sitting out on Ridgeland Road in the front seat of my car
I said ""Patty, if you marry me, babe, I'll take good care of you
I'll buy a brand new trailer and move it down to Grandview""

She said ""Ah, your wedding song, it sounds real nice
And I could sure get off on sleeping with you at night
But I tell ya what, baby, you want me, here's what to do
I want a brick home like my mother's, ain't movin' down to Grandview,"" yeah
That's what she told me

Martina McBride,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

And Lord how slow the moments go.
All I do is pour black coffee.

I'm hanging out on Monday,
But Sunday dreams too dry

And a woman is born to weep and fret
To stay at home and drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes.
And moody all the morning, moody all night.
And in between I drink black coffee.

By another little boy and this is what he said:
""Me & you tonight are gonna make some cash,
Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash"",
They did the job, money came with ease,
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease,
He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha,
Tried to rob a man who was a duty undercover,
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic,
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static"",
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap,
But little did he know the little boy was strapped,
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why'd ya hit me ?"",
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney,
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure,
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger"",
So he cold dashed and ran around the block,
Cop radioes it to another lady cop,
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister,
A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her,
Looked around good and from expectations,
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations,
But she was coming and he made a left,
He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath,
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him,
Then he made his move to an abandoned building,
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor,
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw?,
Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope,
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap,
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun,
He went outside but there was cops all over,
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova,
Raced up the block doing 83,
Crashed into a tree near a university,
Escaped alive though the car was battered,
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered,
Ran out of bullets and still had static,
Grabbed a pregnant lady, got out the automatic,
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead,
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead"",
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong,
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on,
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded,
Before long the little boy got surrounded,
He dropped the gun, so went the glory,
And this is the way I must end this story,
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream,
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream,
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh,
Just another case 'bout the wrong path,
Straight 'n narrow or your soul gets cast.",Children's Story,1996

Or simply the easiest
The narrowest path
Is always the holiest
So walk on barefoot for me
Suffer some misery

Man will survive
The harshest conditions
And stay alive
Through difficult decisions
So make up your mind for me
Walk the line for me
If you want my love
If you want my love 
Idle talk
And hollow promises
Cheating Judases
Doubting Thomases
Don't just stand there and shout it
Do something about it 
You can fulfill
Your wildest ambitions
And I'm sure you will
Lose your inhibitions
So open yourself for me
Risk your health for me

Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!
Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel
Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel
As the images unwind, like the circles that you find

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go 
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you ""we're through""
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything

Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted

Is there a chance you could really want me?

Martine McCutcheon,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes it All,2012

Nothing's as wild as my imagination

I can't believe it, say I'm not alone

Been forsaken in the waiting room
It's so easy
To leave my other life behind

C'est un mot qu'on dirait inventé pour elle
Quand elle danse et qu'elle met son corps à jour
Tel un oiseau qui étend ses ailes pour s'envoler
Alors je sens l'enfer s'ouvrir sous mes pieds

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame
Quel est celui qui lui jettera la première pierre
Celui-là ne mérite pas d'être sur terre

Ô Lucifer!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Glisser mes doigts dans les cheveux d'Esmeralda

Belle
Est-ce le diable qui s'est incarné en elle
Pour détourner mes yeux du Dieu éternel
Qui a mis dans mon être ce désir charnel
Pour m'empêcher de regarder vers le Ciel

Elle porte en elle le péché originel
La désirer fait-il de moi un criminel
Celle qu'on prenait pour une fille de joie une fille de rien
Semble soudain porter la croix du genre humain

Ô Notre-Dame!
Ô laisse-moi rien qu'une fois
Pousser la porte du jardin d'Esmeralda

Belle
Malgré ses grands yeux noirs qui vous ensorcellent
La demoiselle serait-elle encore pucelle
Quand ses mouvements me font voir monts et merveilles
Sous son jupon aux couleurs de l'arc-en-ciel

Ma dulcinée laissez-moi vous être infidèle
Avant de vous avoir menée jusqu'à l'autel
Quel est l'homme qui détournerait son regard d'elle
Sous peine d'être changé en statue de sel

Ô Fleur-de-Lys!
Je ne suis pas homme de foi
J'irai cueillir la fleur d'amour d'Esmeralda

J'ai posé mes yeux sous sa robe de gitane
À quoi me sert encore de prier Notre-Dame

Me faz pensar que ainda me ama
E alimenta essa ilusão

O coração dispara a mesma história vejo acontecer

Que de nadie te acordaras

Tengo celos hasta del pensamiento
Que pueda recordarte
A otra persona amada

Mucho tiempo
No has de olvidar el momento
En que yo te conocí

Mírame, pues no hay nada más profundo
Ni más grande en este mundo

And she told me a story yesterday,
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she's gonna come back tomorrow

And I said ""fly on my sweet angel,
Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,
Tomorrow I'm gonna be by your side""

Sure enough this morning came on to me

Take my hand, you're gonna be my man,
You're gonna rise""

Fly on through the sky,
Fly on my sweet angel,

Marty,"Magic mirror come and search my heart
Can you tell me what you see
There's a thousand voices whispering
Songs and you're the melody

So I imagine my heart with you
See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive
Love ecstasy imagining you with me

Many, many days our shadows passed
Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light
And that morning light is you
So I imagine my heart with you

See what imagination can do
It's not hard to conceive 
love ecstasy imagining you, imagining me
The beauty we both can see

You're the dream I prayed would come along
To make my fantasy
Day and night you live inside my heart
You're the flame of love to me

Marty,"Wastin' my twenties on this God thing
It's what they tell me, like they wanna make my mind change
God saves, just don't question His time frame
Supreme hoodie, pull the strings to cover my face
I been treatin' these planes like it's a bed
Missin' birthdays and Facetimin' instead
I lie about what I do when they ask me
Sometimes I think my family is happier without me, me
I haven't been myself in weeks now
I'm runnin' by myself in these streets now
No apologies for bein' me now
Only makin' songs if I'm killin' every beat now
I never live by the compliments
Twenty-seven, unmarried, still livin' at my father's place
I promise to take care of them when I get rich
These record execs look like Harvey Dents
It's a new era of the misfit
Everything switched, rather be happy than get rich
And growin' up, to me, is like a death wish
Gave my purity away, I wish I woulda kept it
Only makin' songs that I like
Instagram is not real, it's just highlights
And rappers talkin' crazy about my life
When I see them in person it's, ""Whaddup?"", high five
They like, ""Why you make these silly songs?""
'Cause I'm bored of everything that my city does
I don't make songs for the radio
'Cause I don't talk about pretty women and dealin' drugs
So shoutout to suburbia
If you're ain't from here, chances are we never heard of ya
It's like I was raised in the old school
Where haters talk about you like they know you, you
I probly shoulda died in '02
Labels sayin' that we killin' things, I'm like, ""Oh, shoot!""
I'm 'posed to, I'm goin' postal
And if you need some dope music we the go to
The Social Club boys are in the buildin'
Dad's Puerto Rican and my mom's side's Sicilian
Which means when I'm talkin' they assume that I'm yellin'
I wanna shift culture for all my independents
This is the land of the free
Anti-Christian celebrity
Those bright lights weren't meant for me
My God's not dead and He still reigns supreme
Close my eyes, I see stadiums
Performin' when nobody was payin' 'em
Thank God his parents never stopped prayin' for 'em
The world didn't understand him, so instead they hated on 'em

Marty,"I think I'm the worst rapper on this entire song
You know what it is
Or, if you don't, you're about, you're about to know

I don't need a stylist
I'm only wearin' black
And my homies are wylin'
We all love Taylor Swift
I'm eatin' with pilots, they callin' me the chef
I'm saucin' it up
No directions, we made it from scratch
Fear God tee on
Shout out to Jerry Lorenzo
They callin' me ugly
I'ma still marry a ten though
And I'm killin' the friendzone
I'ma kneel in the endzone
And my ex had nothin' inside, so you know that I hopped out a window
Anti-political, only makin' songs that I like
This is anti-radio
No placements, won't make it to top five
And high five to my team, we don't respond to anybody on the sidelines
And I shoulda died
Like, I don't know, but it feels like I got nine lives 

I came in this with, like, four friends (four up)
Tube socks and Chuck Taylors on
I stayed in this and gave no cares (not one)
Now I'm moonwalkin' on every song
Area code is 7-6-0, 6-1-9, 8-5-8
Think I'm great, think y'all late
That's okay
Marty, let me come up in this party like I'm Scarface
To point the finger at the bad guy (go ahead)
At four years old I been a rabbi (gotta leave)
Let me show you how to do this (I do it)
I just need a pencil and a pad
Guy, follow me now
Couple record companies tryna call on me now
Tell 'em all to hit they knees and acknowledge the style
It came from God
Man, I got my game from God
Ain't a dollar that can move me from the reign of God
I'm in this buildin' hollerin' West!
Hold on, let me go and take a rest, I ain't yellin' at y'all (what)
I'm just tryna hit you with some evidence y'all (what)
Evidently heaven sent me excellence y'all
I just wanna be a legend
I just wanna speak to the people
I just wanna play my sounds, make my rounds
Love God, live life
Do it all legal, it's easy

Don't ask me a question
If you don't wanna hear what my answer is, I'm gonna answer it
I got no time for the drama
I got no time for the politics
I do not care about names
They don't mean nothin' to me
I didn't get in the game to make friends
And kiss up to people that don't even like me
You know what I mean!
I don't expect everybody to like what I'm doin' out here
But I am the one that's gon' look in the mirror at the end of the day
You don't want my career
I got some people that write me like, ""I wish you'd die like your momma did""
These are the comments that I gotta problem with
You should be quiet and watch what you hollerin', woo!
My fans will eat you alive
Trolls, get off of my page
My bars fly over they heads
I wrote that line on a plane, I wrote that line on a plane
You won't see me in a chain
I basically wear the same shirt everyday
Get a hole in it, go the store and I buy it again
You already know who it is, for real

Still on the coast where they throw the set
'Palas still bounce like Hammer checks
Papi gon' get 'em like Dangerfield
Orale, you don't get no respect
Labels that hit Fern and Marty up
Marty and Fern never call 'em back
""You tryna be funny?"", was all they asked
Look at the charts, who laughin' last?
Now I'm signed, need contracts
My God is major, my league minor
Throwin' numbers up, need contact
These beats remind of Scott Steiner
Andy killed it on Sway's show
So I best be workin' my one-liners
Still pray for that skyline, boy's lit the shots at those one-timers
I just wanna see hands in the air, my Lord
Never thought rappin' would keep us employed
Feelin' like Pacquiao I'm fightin' with Floyd
The family watchin'
I better go hard in the paint, that '96 Rodman
Shots out to Eric, I got 'em
Dog days in the Cali' summer
Life's hard, this beat's harder
Rest in peace out to Harold Hunter
All praise to the Holy Father
All the smoke was secondhand
Either way we'll never land
Say a prayer 'fore I come around
Blood of Jesus, please wipe me down
New York

I wake up from my bed
Look over, kiss my lil' girl in the head
'Cause everyday is Father's Day
Just like everyday is a birthday, you dig?
Third of the three little pigs
The wisest one, I build my house up with bricks
So when the storm came, we just came together in the Lord's name
Bruh, I sold drugs
Bruh, I been grimy
Lord's stackin', you can ask 'bout me
Had the OG's, they respected me
The younger boys not remember me
I was in them streets in the background
Was your ganstar's gangsta, I spit game for free
Nowadays when I recollected and I put it down, gotta pay me
When you say Hollywood, gotta say me
When it comes to these raps and these APs
Cadillacs always been a M.O
Even when the old school broke down
I'll patch 'em up, hit the skrip with 'em
It's no surprise a brother on now
When the streets get a chance to speak up
They want a brother that's gon' eat with 'em
Speak up about the same issues and run it straight
Ain't gon' play with 'em
My contents done changed up, so them twelve year olds need a young sheperd
Looked at Santino right in his eyes
He broked out laughin', he's so reckless
He know I got now, it's no pressure
But when it's his turn, let the grits burn
That Lawrence Fishburne
But it's on record how his old boy spit it like an old veteran

Aha, I was old boy spitting like an old veteran

Only our bodies were apart (it's making me crazy)
That was so easy, so easy.

I had a taste of the real world (Just a drop of it)
When I went down on you, girl, oh.

I can hear windmills and rainbows whenever you talkin' to me

(Never say never)

I feel like swirling and dancing whenever you walk in with me

You ripple like the river when I touch you (let me touch you)
Then I pluck your body like a string (show you what I mean)
Then I start dancing inside you (oh baby, a love song)

Oh baby in a love song, aw baby
Oh yeah, yeah, alright
Baby we're sure doin' it tonight

Every time you come by let me try (come on by)
Pretty please, with sugar on it, that's how I like it, ugh.

I can't even believe it with you

It's like having every dream I ever wanted 
(Dream of a lifetime) come true.

I picked up your vibes, you know (I'm having a fine time)
It opened my mind but I'm still dreaming.

Yeah (sarcastic Grace mini-orgasm)
And you're right where I found you, with my arms around you! (oh baby).",Miracles,2000

Yeah you gotta watch out if you sneeze
For swingin' up there in the breeze
You`re liable to cough
You might very well fall off
And tumble down flop on your knees-knees

And when the stormy winds wail
And the breezes blow high in a gale
There's a curious dropping and flopping and plopping
And fat little babies just hail-hail

And the babies lie there in a pile
And the adults they come after awhile
And they always pass by

Oh I never really know quite what to expect
But it won't get me down

Just to teach me how to live
And the secret of it all is trusting in you
And the wisdom to give

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future when it blinds you today
Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way
'Cause we've got to break away
Break away to be

Faith-talkin' people, we must discern what's really real
Faith-walkin' people, you can't believe in everything we see
Faith-talkin' people seems like such a mystery

But in all the earth there is nothing worth
Half as much as life with you
'Cause the people and the things we're counting on here
They're gonna pass away too

I don't understand everything is planned
But I don't really have to know
'Cause he's giving me a joy that's filling my heart
When I learn to let go

So say goodbye to the feelings 'cause the feelings go away
Say goodbye to the people 'cause the people never stay
And say goodbye to the future when it blinds you today
Say goodbye to the reasoning that's standing in the way

Oh, hear my song, O God of all the nations,
A song of peace for their land and for mine.



My country, 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liberty,
Of thee I sing.
Land where my fathers died,
Land of the pilgrims' pride,
From every mountainside,
A song of peace.

About 9 o'clock stop by the record shop
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history
Stop by my dispensary, give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling like a skunk
But it's all legal in LA, everybody taking a hit 
From the politicians, athletes and even the teachers
My dentist even hit it, Dr Beecher

Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow
I know that I must have your kiss although it dooms me
Though it consumes me, the kiss of fire!

Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the Polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine
It happened in Monterey
Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey
 
Making believe I'm merry
In ev'ry glass of sherry
I see the sparkle of her eye
And when I hear the cello
Tender and sweet and mellow
I hear the music of her sigh
