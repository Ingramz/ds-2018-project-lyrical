Ray Price,"I come to the garden alone while the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear the son of God discloses
And he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there none other has ever known

He speaks and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing
And he walks with me...",In the Garden,1993
Ray Price,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown
[ piano ]
Oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world is a wonderous attraction for me
For the dear lamb of God left this glory above to bare it to dark calvary
So I'll cherish the old rugged cross...",The Old Rugged Cross,1993
Ray Price,"Oh well, I'm tired and so weary
But I must go alone
Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me",Peace in the Valley,1993
Ray Price,"Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure
[ strings ]
(Save from raft and make me pure)
Could my tears forever flow could my zeal no languor know
These for sin could not atone Thou must save and Thou alone
In my hand no price I bring simply to Thy cross I cling

While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death
When I rise the world unknown and behold the own Thy throne
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee

Ray Price,"What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.",What a Friend We Have in Jesus,1993
Ray Price,"(Four walls to hear me four walls to see
Four walls too near me closing in on me)
Out where the bright lights are glowing
You're drawn like a moth to a flame
You laugh while the wine's overflowing
While I sit and whisper your name
Four walls to hear me four walls to see
Four walls too near me closing in on me
Sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
My walls have nothing to say
I'm made for love not for haiting
So here where you left me I'll stay
One night with you is like heaven
And so while I'm walking this floor
I listen for steps in the hallway
And wait for your knock on the door

Four walls too near me closing in on me
Closing in on me",Four Walls,1995
Ray Price,"Day and night I worry over you
I'm payin' now for bein' so untrue
I pray each night although it seems in vain
I know I'll never win your love again
I won your love for such a precious jewel
You pleaded dear and yet I was so cruel
A love so rare cannot be bound and chained
I know I'll never win your love again
[ steel ]
I try so hard to change what cannot be
And yet how weak my efforts seem to me
In fate's cruel hands forever I'll remain
I know I'll never win your love again
Within my heart there'll always be a chill
Until at last it's beating shall be still
My weary soul will find it's journey's end
I know I'll never win your love again",I Know I'll Never Win Your Love Again,1995
Ray Price,"I saw my castles fall today and crumble into dust around my feet
In shambles there my future lay each stone a broken dream so sweet

I built the heaven in the sky where my true love and I could stay
Then came the words that meant goodbye I saw my castles fall today
[ fiddle ]
Amid the ruins of all my schemes there's nothing else to do or say
I'll say goodbye to all my dreams I saw my castles fall today




",I Saw My Castles Fall Today,1995
Ray Price,"Don't let the stars get in your eyes don't let the moon break your heart
Love blooms at night in daylight it dies don't let the stars get in your eyes
So keep your heart for me for someday I'll return
And you'll know you're the only one I'll ever love
Too many nights too many stars too many moons can change your mind
If I'm gone too long don't forget where you belong
When the stars come out remember you are mine
Don't let the stars get in your eyes

Too many miles too many days too many nights to be alone
So please keep your heart while we are apart
Don't stand in the moonlight while I'm gone
Don't let the stars get in your eyes",Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes,1995

I just can't let you walk away forget the love I had for you

If there is no mistake and if my heart must break I want to hear it from you

Don't pitty me it never matter anyhow but oh if she could see me now

If she could see me now when the night life's gone
I'd sat I really looked without my party face on
The way I just give up sit down and cry out loud but oh if she could see me now

Ray Price,"Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
You're someone else's love now you're not mine

Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
And that's why I'm lonely all the time

So please take the treasured dreams I have for you and me
And take all the love I thought was mine
Someday my crazy arms may hold somebody new
But now I'm so lonely all the time

If you do you know that you're wrong
For it was you who was careless 
And you drove me into another's arms
The other woman isn't prettier than you
But the other woman soothes my wounded pride
And more important I feel wanted again 
I can't give up the other woman in my life

Those same lovin' arms that I miss
This foolish heart that let me part
From those sweet, tender lips, I long to kiss

I hear the ticking of the clock, as it begged me then to stop
Each picture on the wall seemed to cry
And that old rusty gate, I can hear it beg me, wait
While the curtain in the window waves goodbye

Turn around

In memory, I still can see
Two arms, that once held me tight
Oh, how I miss a tender kiss
From those lovin' lips that I kissed goodbye

Haven't got a thing to call my own

And, when I greet my neighbor with a 'Hi y'all'
I'm welcomed as a king upon a throne
And when I feel like braggin', I'll just step and say
I'm a native son of San Antone

I traveled over the country on my merry way
Been in crowds and felt I was alone

Now you say we're thru
The love we shared is just a memory
Well I had built a ship of dreams
And planned them all for you
Now I guess what is to be will be.

So I'll sail my ship alone
With all the dreams I own
Drifting out across the ocean blue
I'll sail my ship alone
Tho' all the sails are torn
And when it starts to sink then I'll blame you.

I gave a message to the wind
To take back home to you
Hoping you would hear my S-O-S
Hoping that you would come back home
My darling if you knew
Just how much my heart was in distress.

You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on

Why haven't you seen it I'm all for you body and soul
I spend my days in longing and wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it it's hard to conceive it that you turn away romance
Are you pretending it looks like the ending unless I could have one more chance
To prove dear my life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking

Ray Price,"At a bar down in Dallas an old man chimed in
And they thought he was out of his head
And all being a young man they just laughed it off
When they heard what this old man he said
He said I'll never again turn the young ladies headds
Or go running off in to the wind
I'm three quarters home from the start to the end
And I wish I was eighteen again
Oh I wish I was eighteen again and going where I've never been
Now old folks and old oaks standing tall just pretend
I wish I was eighteen again

Ray Price,"You could build a wall around you now no one would blame you
Everyone would sigh and sympathize for what you've been through
You could count the feelings that he walked on as a reason to let it in
Or count it as a ribbon in the race that you've been running when you win

But if it's love that you're playing for bet it all
There's no way to save your pride
Or leave a cushion for yourself should you fall
If it's love that you're playing for play to win
A heart is only broken when it loses the desire to try again

But you could build a wall around you know no one would blame you
Those who gather round would not look down although they're seeing through
You could let the sorrow that you're feeling be tomorrow's point of view
Or you could let the feeling that you're hoping for be what's guiding you

So if it's love that you're playing for ah bet it all...
You could build a wall around you now

Ray Price,"There are places I'll remember all my life though some have changed
Some forever not for better some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments with lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living in my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers there is no one that compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning when I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection for people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them in my life I love you more

Knows that I have to be

Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love

Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another

Run down those long shiny rails
But time's right behind you like a hound dog
That's hot on your trail

And ride to the end of the line

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

But come ye back when summmer's in the meadow,
And when the valley's hushed and white with snow.
'Tis I'll be there in sunlight or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, Oh Danny boy' I love you so.
And if you come when all the flowers are dying,
And I am dead, as dead I may well be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying, 
And kneel and say and 'Ave' there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be.
If you only tell me that you love me,
Then I will sleep in peace until you come to me.

Ray Price,"The first thing I remember knowing
Was a lonesome whistle blowing
And a young un's dream of growing up to ride
On a freight train leaving town
Not knowing where I'm bound
No-one could change my mind but Mama tried
One and only rebel child
From a family, meek and mild
My Mama seemed to know what lay in store  
Despite my Sunday learning
Towards the bad, I kept turning
'Til Mama couldn't hold me anymore

And I turned twenty-one in prion doing life without parole
No-one could steer me right but Mama tried, Mama tried
Mama tried to raise me better, but her pleading, I denied
That leaves only me to blame 'cause Mama tried

Dear old Daddy, rest his soul
Left my Mom a heavy load
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes.
Working hours without rest
Wanted me to have the best
She tried to raise me right but I refused

I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole

When the roll is called up yo-onder
When the roll is called up yonder
When the roll is ca-alled up yonder I'll be there

When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound
And time shall be no more

Ray Price & the Cherokee Cowboys,"Everybody told me what a fool I was
To fall in love with someone who would never be true
But someday I would wind up with the hopeless love
All alone be wilted and confused
So who'll be the first to say I told you so
'Cause I'm alone like they all said I'd be
Who'll be the first to say I should have listened long ago
So who'll be the first to say I told you so

Filled with love so strong that ruled my heart and soul
Blinded by the lies you kept on tellin' to me
People saw the things you've done and let me know
Things a fool in love can never see
So who'll be the first...",Who'll Be the First,1996
Ray Price & the Cherokee Cowboys,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife

Ray Price & the Cherokee Cowboys,"Yesterday brought love as sweet as clover
Every kiss was fresh as morning rain
But today you told me it's over

From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair 
And walk with me

All summer long
We sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind 

Like painted kites, those days and nights
They went flying by
The world was new
Beneath the blue
Umbrella sky 

Then softer than
The piper man
One day, it called to you
I lost you to
The summer wind 

The autumn wind
And the winter wind
They have come and they have gone
And still the days
Those lonely days
Go on and on

And guess who sighs a lullaby
To nights that never end?

The summer wind
Mmm the summer wind

You make me feel as though spring has sprung

I wanna go and bounce the moon

Ray Riendeau,"From memories of 68 when the wizard shook the world
Metal came from foundries where the midlands sound unfurled
The bullring was a lonely place of concrete towers and steel
The coal mines and the industries were all I had to fell.

Something inside took hold of me, I really didn't know
But overtime it came to be, I knew which way to go
I drove around in search of what would make this all come true
From jazz and electricity and good old southern blues

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

In Henry's and in mother's where I'd go to bang my head
The feeling took a hold of me with every word I said
The voice was born and came alive from all I saw and heard
And now I knew my destiny, I had to spread the word.

I took the scream around the world
From London to L.A.
Unleashed in downtown Tokyo
Blew Godzilla away

Then on the sound and fury went from Sydney to Brazil
It sent the Russians crazy cause they never get their fill.

Of Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell

The stage and the lights and the amps are ablaze watch them burn
From all this insanity the Metal God's will return.

Shock waves attack relentlessly, intimidating force
So many bands surrounding you with evil from our source
It screams across the universe and slams you to the floor
This blitzkrieg psycho mania is coming on full roar
The world's a stage that's waiting for its bad ass to get kicked
And we're all on the road to hell and that's route 666

Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell
Hell, we're born to raise some hell
Hell, we're gonna raise some hell",Made in Hell,2000
Ray Riendeau,"Your love is killing me, it draws me to the dark
Your veil of ecstasy, that leaves the telling mark
The spell you cast inside, is stabbing through my heart
It reaches deep within, it's pulling me apart

Night Fall, you take my soul
Night Fall, you're in control

Your love's still haunting me, it draws me into black
Your veil of fantasy, won't let my soul come back
The spell has taken all, I can't release my mind
I've lost my heart to you, you're too cruel to be kind.

Night Fall, you take my soul
Night Fall, you're in control
Night Fall, I called you and you came
Night Fall, I'll never be the same",Night Fall,2000
Ray Riendeau,"You may not like the future
And we're not here to preach to you
We'll take you to the killing floor.

You think you want to know me
You think you want to own me
But I have nothing you can buy.

I can break you
I can raise you
Bring you to your knees
Cause I'm the one you love to hate.

You can't fool me
You can't rule me
You only want to hang around

You told me that the first day we met. I didn't understand.

Beneath the broad-beamed boughs, your love changed: a slow coming apart.
You moved on and I stayed the same. I was trailing from the start.

We laid long in the tall grass. We loved for the joy of love itself.
We threw our pennies in the fountain and we wished for nothing else. 
And we wished for nothing else.

And through the crossbeams whispers were heard: undoing in every line.
And in the fall you flew little bird but I'll see you when it's time.

The tiger, he looked out of his cage and smiled
He said come here boy, I want to talk to you a while
He said I once was running wild and free just the same as you
But it's one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too
They'll clip your claws, cut your hair, make a pussy cat out of you
Its one step from the jungle to the zoo

He said son when you go running through the grass
You bet look out for all the hidden traps
They'll feed you sweets and goodies 'til you're too fat to move
Then its one step from the jungle to the zoo

Its one step from the jungle to the zoo
You better watch out or they're gonna get you too

So you just curtsey and I'll bow
And ask the band to play us Auld Lang Syne

Then I'll just take what's left of me
Right back to where it used to be
And you'll go sail your magic carpet, far across the sky

More like the movies for you
Some pretty Technicolor way it's never been
I'm sorry when I kissed you
You only heard me whisper
You never got to hear those violins
Did you girl?
No you never got to hear those violins, no

The castles that you built so high
Were just too steep for me to climb
And I guess these dirty streets of mine
Were just too rough for you

I wish I could've helped you see
Just one of your sweet childhood dreams
But though I tried I could not make not one of them come true

And I wish I could have made it

That's stained and slightly torn.
And her sparklin' jewels are rhinestones,

And the wondrous sites she's seen.
And I watch her and I pray.

Would you like someone new to talk to, ah yeh alright
I'm feeling kinda lonely too
If you don't mind can I sit down here beside you
Ah yeah alright

If I seem to come on too strong
I hope that you will understand
I say these things 'cause I'd like to know
If you're as lonely as I am
And if you mind

Sharing the night together, oh yeah
Sharing the night together, oh yeah, sharing the night.

We could bring in the morning girl
If you want to go that far
And if tomorrow find us together
Right here the way we are
Would you mind

Sharing the night together, oh yeah
Sharing the night together, oh yeah, sharing the night.

Would you like to dance with me and hold me
You know I want to be holding you
Ah yeah alright 'cause I like feeling like I do
And I see in your eyes
That you're liking it too, ah yeah alright
Like to get to know you better
Is there a place where we can go
Where we can be alone together
And turn the lights down low and start sharing the night",Sharing the Night Together,1976

Sal from the valley loved Al from the alley and they lived in harmony
Sally played acoustic and Al, he played electric and they both took turns on lead
They sang it for their friends, again and again of the places they had been
But their favourite song of all was called up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Then into the valley came a girl from the galleys, with a strange and smilin' face
Al played acoustic and Sally played electric, and the gal played a hell of a bass
And when they sang their harmonies, the lady dipped right in
She soon moved in and lived with them up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Now Al from the alley is gone from the valley, a sadder but wiser man
And Sally from the valley and the gal from the galleys they live in mortal sin
Sal plays acoustic and the gal plays electric and sometimes they hold hands
Late at night you can hear them playing, up on the mountain

Up on the mountain, up where the light breaks, that's where you'll find me
Gonna leave this worrisome world and it's trouble behind me
Up on the mountain, where the light breaks, that's where I'll be
I've barely got time to finish this song so say farewell for me

Hot lickin' and finger pickin'
Say farewell for me

I gently kiss her lips, touch her with my finger tips
Searching for the love I miss, you once gave to me
She is warm here by my side, I should be satisfied
It's sad to realise I'm still in love with you

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

She holds me close to her, I love the sweet things she whispers
But only my memory stirs, my heart still isn't free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free
There's got to be another love for me
There's got to be someone to set me free

'Cause I'm chained to your memory
Tied and bound, I can't get free

Ray Sawyer,"(D. Locorriere)

Let's talk about hearts, no two are the same
Some of them are cold as ice, others need the flame
One of them gets comfortable, the other needs a change

But hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

Some hearts break too easily, some are hard as stone
One heart cries for company, the other cries alone
Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Other loves can walk away, but still our hearts remain

'Cause hearts like yours and mine, hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine, take pleasure in the pain

There's pleasure in the pain, sunlight through the rain, daylight through the dark
And 'though we know the hurt, we know how much it's worth to stay here where we are

Hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine
Hearts like yours and mine

There's hearts like yours and there's hearts like mine

If you ever feel sad, need someone to hold you

You can lay right here beside me, like there ain?t nothing wrong,

Kill the light and say goodnight and turn the TV off,

Act as if I don?t know what it is that you can't find the words to say,

Aw baby you can leave or you can stay,

You?re gone either way


We can share the bed and share the rent but this house ain?t a home,

And if I?m gonna be lonely I?d just assume be alone,

How can you say you love me when you can?t even look me in the face,

Stay right here and disappear without a trace,

You?re gone either way


I don?t need the hurt from hangin? on to someone who?s got one foot out the door

And I can?t waste another minute of my love if you don?t love me anymore,

No, no, no


Naw, don?t need the hurt from hangin? on to someone who?s got one foot out the door,

I can?t waste another minute of my love if you don?t love me anymore


Don?t know why you sit here with me, we both know the truth,

You just worry ?bout what leavin? me would make people think of you,

It don?t matter what your mamma or your daddy or your preacher?s got to say,

Girl you can hit that door or waste another day,

What kind of difference would it make,

You?re gone either way,

Girl you?re gone either way,

So just get on.

And I was born around 6:00 AM
For the time it took her to bring me in this world, 
You'd've thought the girl was gonna have twins
I'd be a day older if that doctor hadn't told her 
I'd be better off if I came late
She said fine and that gave him plenty of time 
To get in 18 holes that day

Yeah time, time, everything takes time
From grabbin' hold of life to turnin' it loose
And in the time that went by while I sang you those lines
We all lost a minute or two

There's a 15 year old ridin' shotgun down the road, 
He can't wait to get behind the wheel
And a grandma in the kitchen washin' dishes 
And wishin' she still knew how 16 feels
Every year we get older, all the months seem shorter, 
Kinda like weeks, weeks seem like days
Yeah, the hours fly by when you're havin' a good time, 
But they don't stand still when you ain't

[Chorus]

Time only moves forward every minute leanin' towards that day
Our hair is gone or gray
We all make it and we use it, we waste it and abuse it
While the clock just laughs in our face

Yeah time, time, we got nothin' but time

Startin' now, somehow
I've gotta leave her in my past
Walk this floor right out that door
Before these walls start talkin' back

Sees the sun going down

Talking perfectly loud

Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves the silent magic in Granada today

It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow clad Sierra Nevada

Will the one I love,
Be coming back to me?

I cover the waterfront,
In search of my love,
And I'm covered by,
A starless sky above.

Here am I,
Patiently waiting,
Hoping and longing,
Oh! How I yearn!
Where are you?
Are you forgetting?
Do you remember?
Will you return?

I'm watching the sea,
For the one I love,
Must come back to me.",I Cover the Waterfront,1994
Ray Slijngaard,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky",Smoke on the Water,1999

Ray Smith,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,

And you took them all apart

Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Love is pure gold and time a thief.

Ray Stevens,"In seclusion for what seemed like the longest time. 
It occurred to me I'm not the way I want to be. 
Separated from the one I belong to. 
Made a hole inside my heart. 
Wide enough to tear apart. 
Oh baby {baby}, we can start over.

[Chorus]
Gimme a smile {gimme a smile} and I'll give you a kiss 
and I'll throw in a hug or two for all the love I made you miss. 
Won't you, gimme a smile {gimme a smile} and I'll give you my soul. 
And I'll tell you a hundred ""I love you's"" everyday we're growing older.

Lost the treasure I never knew I had. 
Failed in all I tried, had no feeling left inside. 
I awaken to find myself in need of the warm surroundings 
I once knew and my arms surrounding you. 
Oh baby {baby}.
Baby, maybe we can start over?

Ray Stevens,"Well, a strange thing happened the other night
You won't believe it, but I swear it's true
Harry the hairy ape made his escape from the city zoo
& under cover of darkness he made his way
To the middle of the municipal park
& he hid in the bushes & waited for somebody to come
Walkin' along by hi'self in the dark
Then along come somebody not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest (sound effect of this action)
Jump up & down & he say:
Wooo-hoo-hee-hee-hoo-hoo...
Which is Harry-Ape talk for ""Boo, I betcha I scared you, ha ha!""

Waaa!  Scared that poor cat so bad his eyes bugged out, his hair turned white!
He ran off through the municipal park, screamin', hollerin', diggin' up the lawn,
  tearin' up the shrub & knock down the ""Keep off the grass"" sign, run through the
  hurricane fence, fell into the municipal park swimming pool & drowned hi'self!  Woo
  hoo!

Well, Harry thought this was the funniest thing that he had ever seen
& he laughed ""Ha ha,"" jumped back in the bushes & got ready to do it again
The next guy to come along was the near-sighted local DJ
Just boppin' down the sidewalk on his way to work with a box of records on his arm
  that he was gonna play
So here he come, not suspectin' nothin'
Harry jump out of the bushes all of a sudden
Beat on his chest (sound effect of this action)
Jump up & down & he say:
Wooo-hoo-hee-hee-hoo-hoo...
Which is Harry-Ape talk for ""Smile, you're on candid camera!""

Man, that DJ was so near-sighted he thought Harry was a rock 'n' roll singer!
So he gave him the old glad hand, smiled, slapped him on the back, sayin',
""Don't worry, baby, I'm gonna play the record 'cause you're too cool, too cool, too
cool!"" & he said bye, bopped on off down the sidewalk; every 4 or 5 steps he'd stop &
turn around,
  doin' a little boogaloo-shing-a-ling!
Well, this really shook Harry up, I mean it blew his whole bit, you know, ruined his
whole day So he run back to his cage as fast as he can go, jump up on his little swing,
put both hands
  over his eyes & didn't look for 3 hours & 45 minutes.  But that's not the end of the
  story
Here's what happened:

The DJ played Harry's record (What record?) Shut up!
It was a hit and he became a star
Got him some tight britches, got him a manager
Went on a promotion tour, combed his hair back & took up playin' the guitar
& every Sunday afternoon you can go see Harry at the zoo
& the girls will scream & he'll sit on his swing & pick & sing his hit record for you

Sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning round.

Ray Stevens,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying

And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleepin' on the job
Those raindrops are fallin' on my head they keep fallin'

The blues they send to meet me
Won't defeat me
It won't be long 'til happiness steps up to greet me

Raindrops keep fallin' on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red

Cause
I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin'
Because I'm free

Ray Stevens,"(intro: Arabian flute)

Let me tell you about Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand
He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride

[Spoken] Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
the sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had
a thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
for some time now behind the sultan's back and you
could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert
air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel
sound), which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""

Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)
In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug
With
[Spoken in falsetto and possibly with female backups] ""Rings on her fingers and
bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""

[Spoken]   There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,
watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
it's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist
again like we did last summer, baby.!!""  Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
give him one of the sly looks,

She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

This made my dad my son-in-law
And really changed my life
Now my daughter was my mother

And to complicate the matter
Even though it brought me joy
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to dad
And so became my uncle, though it made me very sad
For if, if he were my uncle, then that also made him brother
Of the widow's grown up daughter, who was of course, my stepmother

And he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son

And he only had just one thought on his brain
Every evening about midnight he'd sneak off alone
And call the same lady on a pay telephone

'It's me again, Margaret
Hello, is this Margaret?
You don't know me, Margaret, but I know you.'

Well, this upset the lady and it gave her the blues
So she called up the police, said 'What shall I do?'
The chief of detectives came round to her home
And eavesdropped upon them on her upstairs phone

'It's me again, Margaret
Hello, is this Margaret?
Margaret, I know it's you, Margaret
Are you naked?

Well, they called up Ma Bell and they traced him on down
To a funky old phone booth on the outskirts of town
It was there that the vice squad with their field glasses read
The lips of that amorous man as he said

'It's me again, Margaret
Hello? Is this is this Margaret?
I know it's you, Margaret
I bet you can't guess what I'm doing '

Well, they cuffed him and dragged him to the station downtown
And they allowed him one phone call 'fore the jailer came round
He wet his chapped lips and he cleared his young throat
Then he dialed the telephone and softly he spoke

'It's me again, Margaret
They got me, Margaret
You ain't going to miss me, Margaret, I know that
But I'll miss you

And a live chicken, and some peach preserves
We'll have a good old time, Marga

Ray Stevens,"Let me tell you about Ahab the Arab
The sheik of the burning sand
He had emeralds and rubies just drippin' off 'a him
And a ring on every finger of his hand

He wore a big ol' turban wrapped around his head
And a scimitar by his side
And, every evenin', about midnight
He'd jump on his camel named Clyde, and ride

[Spoken] 
Silently through the night to the sultan's tent where he
Would secretly meet up with Fatima of the Seven Veils,
Swingingest grade ""A"" number one US choice dancer in
The sultan's whole harem, 'cause, heh, him and her had

A thing goin', you know, and they'd been carryin' on
For some time now behind the sultan's back and you
Could hear him talk to his camel as he rode out across the
Dunes, his voice would cut through the still night desert

Air and he'd say (imitate Arabic speech and finish with ""Sold! American)
Which is Arabic for, ""Stop, Clyde!"" and Clyde'd say, (imitate camel sound), 
Which is camel for, ""What the heck did he say anyway?""
Well, he brought that camel to a screechin' halt (verbal screeching sound)

In the rear of Fatima's tent
Jumped off Clyde, snuck around the corner
And into the tent he went.
There he saw Fatima layin' on a zebra skin rug with...

[Spoken in falsetto and possibly with female backups] 
""Rings on her fingers and
Bells on her toes and a bone in her nose ho, ho.""

[Spoken] 
There she was, friends, lyin' there in all her radiant
Beauty, eating on a raisin, grape, apricot, pomegranate,
Bowl of chittlin's, two bananas, three Hershey bars,
Sipping on a RC co-cola listenin' to her transistor,

Watchin' the Grand Ole Opry on the tube, readin' a Mad
Magazine while she sung, ""Does your chewing gum lose
It's flavor?"" Yeah, Ahab walked up to her and he say,
(imitate Arabic speech), which is Arabic for ""Let's twist

Again like we did last summer, baby.!!"" Ha, ha, ha!!
You know what I mean! Whew! She looked up at him from off the rug,
Give him one of the sly looks,
She said (suggestive giggles, then outright laughter) ""Crazy, crazy, crazy baby!""

('round and around and around and around, and around and around and around)

Ray Thomas,"Hey, hey mama life is a lonely time,
For a man who drinks his whiskey by the jar,
Now I do believe the life I lead
Won't get me very far
I was once told the streets were paved in gold,
Now I know them for what they are.

Hey, hey mama life has a sweeter sound,
For a man who lives his life for his dream,
Yet he must be aware there are those who care 
And those who would bring him down,
Separate trust from your cut and thrust,
The truth can still be found.

For the crossroads of your life
Will lead you almost anywhere,
You'll see tomorrow,
Your castles in the air
They were never really there.

Take the pride from a man
You're left without a meaning,
Take the wings from a bird, how can it fly,
Give him hope, give him trust and a little understanding,
Give him back his pride, you'll be satisfied.

Ray Thomas,"High above my head, there's a silver lining
In the sky, I tell you no lie.
I know that we can make it
I know that we're gonna make it
That's what I said
Cause we've got a silver lining above our heads.

High above the storm clouds
There's a new horizon, feast your eyes
Come on and feast your eyes
The beauty will astound you
The love there will surround you, open your eyes
The Lord put the silver lining into our skies

I want you to see things clearly
I hope you can feel the truth,
I know there's a hope for all mankind
Living under one roof.

I want you to see things clearly
I hope you can feel the truth,
I know there's a hope for all mankind
Living under one roof.

I look around in wonder
While the world is living under
A broken dream, or that's how it seems
But we weren't sent to change it
To change or rearrange it
Still we can dream,
And dreams were meant for living
If you know what I mean.
",High Above My Head,1975
Ray Thomas,"You can't buy a dream
Then expect your schemes
To appear brand new
Like the way you do
It's not hard to find
Deep inside your mind
Which road will take you home

Now you know that rain
Never falls in vain
For the seed must grow
It's glory shows in the summer sun
While our world is young
They reach to touch the sky

I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
How I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
How I wish we could fly

Then we'd see far more clearly
Maybe then we'd know
The best way we should go
Man just has to grow and grow and grow

All the air we breathe
And the warmth we need
It's given to us free
Like you loving me
Throughout our days
In so many ways
Helps me reach to touch my sky

But I can't explain
Self inflicted pain
When there's room for all 
To play life's game
And as we know
Our love must grow
Or we'll never touch the sky

I wish we could fly
How I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
I wish we could fly
Oh how I wish we could fly

Ray Thomas,"Somewhere the sun is always shining,
Somewhere the breeze blows in another brand new day,
So let us gather up our tears
We'll save them for a rainy day.

Come on let's fill our world with laughter,
Let's put the sunshine into everybody's heart,
Then peace will last for ever after
Oh what a lovely start.

It gives you hope for a brand new day,
Have faith in love it will show the way,
Happiness, who could ask for anything more,
So realise there's no need to hide,
Show yourself to the world outside,
Don't you know that the world is an open door,
Don't you know that love's the key to open any door.

Ray Thomas,"Let's play our song again,
Make me remember when
We both chased our rainbows through the rain,
Our lives belong within this song
That's something we cannot change,
So whatever you do and wherever you go 
The memories will always remain
Play it again, Oh play it again, for me
It maybe for the last time,
Please play it again, just for me,
It maybe for the last time.

Love's a simple melody,
Two souls in harmony,
Never seem to cast a shadow in the sun,
Our days were filled with laughter
While our nights were filled with love,
Sweet river flow make my head feel high
When I hear that haunting refrain
Play it again, Oh play it again, for me
It maybe for the last time,
Please play it again, for me,
For the last time.

If happiness lies between you tears and my sighs
Angry words won't ring true
Remember times we once knew
We lay in the sun
Joined together as one in love
When the song's over, we'll just say good-bye,
There'll be no-one left singing, no-one to cry,
I'll just be a solo man.

Ray Thomas,"The world's like a big carousel
Turning in space with the whole human race hanging on
But the sounds that are played on that penny arcade
Turn me on

Then I need a little romance
If you play me that song
Then you'll get me to dance
I can dance
Sing me a slow song and maybe then I'll take a chance

For there's something in the air
And it's turning spinning
Seems like I float everywhere

Wants to fight

For the world is a beautiful place 
So small but it's all that we have to stand on

Forever's such a long long time
And my darling I still love you

Without a care

I helped you forget life was solely only a wish to survive
And blood flows much thicker than wine

Sing you a song just to cheer you

Brother now you've got a friend

Life hurries by in the wink of an eye
Almost without meaning
Days speeding past like the wind hard to grasp
No wonder you're bleeding
Friendship is needed today
Or tomorrow is empty and we need each other please stay

For your only hope is together 
We'll live in much calmer weather
And we'll make a beautiful blend

And I sometimes play the fool
But when the lights go down
And I hear the crowd then I'm cool

Then I sing my song of freedom
And I sing my songs of love

Ray Thomas,"A simple man had the strangest dream
He stood in a garden of flowers
That overlooked the sea
And there sailing by
Were his truth and his lies going home

While all around the sweetest sounds
Filled the air with love
They made his senses pound
He saw with open mind
His life turn with the tide to go home

Memories of youth had passed before
He and he alone could count the score
For he was free he was free
This was his last dream

Such melodies are made to sing
The mellow sounds within a thousand violins
Caught upon the breeze
They play in harmony sweet harmony

At last he knew his act was through
With no applause and no encores
Though the house was full
So bring the curtain down
Lay him in the ground
For he's gone home

Memories of youth had passed before
He and he alone could count the score
Now he is free he is free
This was his last dream",The Last Dream,1976
Ray Thomas,"On and on they journey southward
To the land of warmer summers
On the way they shed their feathers
For the poet's hand to write love letters

Flying high in straight formation
Seeking out their destination
Over seas and windswept forest
Frost and snow they're soon forgotten

Trees are bare snowflakes are falling
You can hear their leaders calling
Follow me fly strong my brother
Be strong of heart and help each other home

And here I am I'm just a man
And there you are among the stars flying high
Searching for a new tomorrow
I wish I could follow

Nearer still to new horizons
Chill winds blow so far behind them
Endless days and sleepless nights
A borrowed gift navigates their flight

Still and pure this morning air
So tired now but almost there
The mysteries of nature's calling
Some will climb while others return back home",Migration,1976

For you could be the dancing breeze 
That moves the trees to shed their leaves around you
Or you could be the light in me
That shows the way my life could be around you

When you feel low you try so hard but still you let it show
Such foolish pride you're hurt inside

Et plein de pudeur

Lisse, lisse

Je t'offrirai un bout de pain d'épice
Puisque puisque 
Puisque tu le veux
C'est pas toujours que l'on peut se payer
Du plaisir à bon marché
Sur ce manège alors profitons-en
Car le bonheur n'a qu'un temps.

Quelles nouvelles ?
Absente depuis quinze jours,
Au bout du fil
Je vous appelle ;
Que trouverai-je à mon retour ?

Tout va très bien, Madame la Marquise,
Tout va très bien, tout va très bien.
Pourtant, il faut, il faut que l'on vous dise,
On déplore un tout petit rien :
Un incident, une bêtise,
La mort de votre jument grise,
Mais, à part ça, Madame la Marquise
Tout va très bien, tout va très bien.

Allô, allô James !
Quelles nouvelles ?
Ma jument gris' morte aujourd'hui !

Comment cela s'est-il produit ?

Cela n'est rien, Madame la Marquise,

Allô, allô James !
Quelles nouvelles ?
Mes écuries ont donc brûlé ?
Expliquez-moi

Comment cela s'est-il passé ?

Cela n'est rien, Madame la Marquise,
Cela n'est rien, tout va très bien.
Pourtant il faut, il faut que l'on vous dise,
On déplore un tout petit rien :
Si l'écurie brûla, Madame,
C'est qu'le château était en flammes.

Tout va très bien, tout va très bien.

Que M'sieur l'Marquis s'est suicidé,
Et c'est en ramassant la pelle
Qu'il renversa toutes les chandelles,
Mettant le feu à tout l'château

Le vent soufflant sur l'incendie,
Le propagea sur l'écurie,

Ray Ventura,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1984
Ray Ventura,"On a tous même apparence
Un nez deux yeux et deux oreilles
Malgré de p'tites différences
Au fond l'on est bien tous pareils...

On a son p'tit cœur qui bat
Comme tout l'monde
On soupire souvent tout bas
Comme tout l'monde
Par l'amour on est mordu
Comme tout l'monde
Puis un beau jour on voit qu'on est cocu
Comme tout l'monde

On a les mêmes coutumes
Les mêmes désirs, les mêmes goûts
On met les mêmes costumes
Et même les mêmes dessous

On a un beau pyjama
Comme tout l'monde
Des caleçons en zenana
Comme tout l'monde
On a des chemises coquettes
Comme tout l'monde
Et puis aussi des trous à ses chaussettes
Comme tout l'monde

On est pareil en toutes choses
Pour tout c'qu'on dit, pour tout c'qu'on fait
Voilà pourquoi les mêmes causes
Produisent les mêmes effets

Nous payons notre proprio
Comme tout l'monde
Nous réglons le gaz et l'eau
Comme tout l'monde
On paie cash le pot-au-feu
Comme tout l'monde
Y a les impôts que l'on paie quand on peut
Comme tout l'monde

Nous sommes tous unanimes
Pour rester jeunes et pas grossir
On suit les mêmes régimes
Pour mieux réussir à mincir

On grignote tristement
Comme tout l'monde
Deux radis et un cure-dent
Comme tout l'monde
On a des crampes d'estomac
Comme tout l'monde
Alors en douce on s'envoie tout l'foie gras
Comme tout l'monde

Sitôt que l'on est malade
Aux mêmes soins on est soumis
Chez soi l'on se barricade
Par crainte des épidémies

On prend des tad d'précautions
Comme tout l'monde
Des potions, des infusions
Comme tout l'monde
On s'envoie de la quintonine
Comme tout l'monde
Finalement on attrape la scarlatine
Comme tout l'monde

Depuis la p'tite enfance
On est poli et bien élevé
D'ailleurs paraît que c'est en France
Qu'les gens sont les plus réservés

On minaude et l'on plastronne
Comme tout l'monde
On dit: j'vous en prie, baronne
Comme tout l'monde
On s'exprime qu'à mi-voix
Comme tout l'monde
Et l'on crie : M...tnce! En se pinçant les doigts
Comme tout l'monde

L'dimanche quand on va aux courses
On lit chacun les mêmes journaux
Et quand on risque sa bourse
Souvent on a l'même tuyau

On n'en parle que tou bas
Comme tout l'monde
Et même on n'en parle pas
Comme tout l'monde
On prend des p'tits airs en d'ssous
Comme tout l'monde
Et finalement on est refait  de ses cent sous
Comme tout l'monde

Chaque fois qu'des amants s'fâchent
Toujours c'est pour les mêmes raisons
Et quand un jour on se lâche
Toujours c'est la même chanson

On l'oublie presque aussitôt
Comme tout l'monde
On déchire ses photos
Comme tout l'monde
On s'écrie : fini l'martyre
Comme tout l'monde
Au bout de huit jours on la supplie d'revenir
Comme tout l'monde

Puisque nous sommes identiques
On devrait avoir les mêmes idées
Pourtant dans la politique
On ne peut jamais s'accorder

On a des principes à nous
Comme tout l'monde
On discute souvent l'coup
Comme tout l'monde
On s'appelle : Vendu!... Voyou
Comme tout l'monde
Mais dans le fond croyez-moi, on s'en fout
Comme tout l'monde",Comme Tout le Monde,1992
Ray Ventura,"Viens ma chérie ne me sois pas rebelle
Belle belle 
Fleur de printemps
Tu es parmi les autres jouvencelles
Celle celle 
Que j'aime tant
Je ne pourrai pas t'offrir des bijoux
La fortune ou le Pérou
Mais je t'invite et selon mes moyens
Je ne te refuse rien.

Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois
Ca fait tourner la tête
Comme si on avait la gueule de bois
Et si tu te casses une gambette
On te fera mettre une belle jambe de bois
Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois

Tu me défends d'effleurer ton corsage
Sage, sage
Et plein de pudeur
Pourtant ma main dans ce doux badinage
Nage nage
Dans le bonheur
Si tu voulais nous ferions tous les deux
Un vrai couple d'amoureux
Tu serais ma petite vache à lait
Je serait ton cochonnet.

Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois
Ca fait tourner la tête
Comme si on avait la gueule de bois
Et si tu te casses une gambette
On te fera mettre une belle jambe de bois
Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois

Là sur mon front doucement ta main glisse
Lisse, lisse 
Moi les cheveux
Je t'offrirai un bout de pain d'épice
Puisque puisque 
Puisque tu le veux
C'est pas toujours que l'on peut se payer
Du plaisir à bon marché
Sur ce manège alors profitons-en
Car le bonheur n'a qu'un temps.

Ah! viens viens ma Nénette
Faire un tour sur les chevaux
De bois
Ca fait tourner la tête
Comme si on avait la gueule de bois
Et si tu te casses une gambette

Je vais faire un effort et je vais chanter:

Sur deux notes

Ray Walker,"Last night all alone in a barroom
Met a girl with a drink in her hand. 
She had ruby red lips, coal black hair 
And eyes that would tempt any man.
Then she came and sat down at my table,
And as she placed her soft hands in mine,
I found myself wanting to kiss her 
For temptation was flowing like wine.
 
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride.
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside.
Then we danced and she whispered, ""I need you!""
""Take me away from here and be my man.""
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw it:
 
The reflection of my wedding band.
And I was almost persuaded to let strange lips lead me on.
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home.

Love was a star, a song unsung

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

Feel my arms around you

Waited just to love you

Ring out from a bruised postcard
In the shooting yard

Out of the black slate time

But well I know you go your own way
You never needed me no matter what you say

Walking in your footsteps
I used to walk by your side
How could you leave me
On the very edge of suicide
Suicide...

Walking in your footsteps
I used to walk by your side
How could you leave me
On the very edge of suicide
Suicide?

Ray Wilson,"Something's disappeared inside 
Should I try to run away 
If I could I would escape you 

I won't argue anymore 
I have lost the will to be 
Hope you don't think I'm ungrateful 

Close the curtains, lock the door 
Left my notes upon the stair 
In the hope you wouldn't read them 

Fake emotions in my head 
Everything I've seen and read 
Can't begin to find the reason 

Why? Why are you laughing? 
Is it something that I said? 

I don't like this place at all 
Makes me wonder what I'm here for 
Someone take this pain away 
Dying to see another day 

And I don't want to be your friend 
Or pretend I can fit into 
I'm incensed, I'm blown away 
Dying to see another day 

I don't like this place at all

Weavin' through traffic, can't be spotted by my other girl
She gon' go crazy, the love turn into hatin'
When I'm in the club, bring Yak, I'm gettin' dumb faded
Gotta show me something 'cause the talk ain't 'bout nothing
It's going one way, I'm getting paid and I'm fucking
Million dollar fragrance, I ain't the one to play with
If I shoot a nigga down, bitch, you better not say shit

I need more hatin' ass internet cowards

I'm a G, you fuckin' with a veteran

No knuckles, boy, we havin' AK fights
Clear blue skies and fly on the east side
She claim to be bad but she ain't got a gun
We gon' pass those up for the real ones
You can keep the small change, bitch, I want millions

No time to wait, I want my money right now
Bendin' corners, one wheel off the ground
Two up the homies and you know we finna clown

This for my home girls that love to let me beat
She hook it up with the grits and the G's
She look fly but she stay lowkey
I'm sippin' wine and she smokin' on trees

It's eighty degrees, she all on her knees
Palm steady itchin' like the motherfuckin' trees
With my locs in the streets, you niggas can't compete
Run that mouth way too much, it get deep, uh
In the Beamer with my nigga G
Pull out a Newport, like Too $hort, I peep out the scenery
Where the killers? Where the thugs? Where them hoes at?
We in the building, cold chillin', neck froze, huh
I think it's 'bout time we get another bottle
Send my bitch 'cause she lookin' like a model
Yeah, we gon' fly around the city all drunk
Blowing pounds, straight pounds if a nigga want funk
And I be getting faded

Won't ever catch me movin' out the city

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"So, I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice, a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
I come her as the 'cause of tears, I'm just a crying shame
Seven stud or eternal blood, I'm lookin' for a game

I double crossed the State of Texas and they give me a little time
I taught myself to double cut the cards and hold scriptures in my mind
I learned to love the tumblin' dice and to believe the word
Tombstones or rolling bones, beats anything I ever heard

Patience is a virtue that I don't possess
And I can't deny that Heaven lies beneath a cotton dress
How small a part of time we share 'till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

I have walked through God's green pastures beneath these rich blue skies
I have seen the fall of man and the kingdom hidden from their eyes
I have heard the roar of thunder and I've felt the lightening bolt
And when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take along Samuel Colt

Every night I kiss the cards and I hold them to my breast
And when I see the King of Hearts I know that I am blessed
And though my eyes are blind sometimes, I know there's something there
So when the times at hand and I kill a man, I, I say a little prayer

So I come down from Oklahoma with a pistol in my boot
A pair of dice, a deck of cards, a Bible in my suit
How small a part of time we share till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

How small a part of time we share till we hear the sound of wings
I'm lost in the dust of the chase that my life brings

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"Last night I went down to the railroad tracks
To watch that train roll by
99 cars screaming into the dark
I heard the lonesome whistle cry

With her name on my arm and the rain coming down
I kissed her like it was the first time
I took her down to the railroad tracks
And her red, red lips touched mine

She said, ""I wanna rock & roll
Wanna hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love me do""

The woman's got a walk to make a man cry
Throw back his head and howl
Ruby red lips, liquid hips
More than the law will allow

If I told her once, I told her twice
I must have told her a thousand times
I got a red hot mind and a cold black heart
I am the jealous kind

Where the woman just laughed and said, ""Sweet Daddy
You know you are the only one
You're my smooth lover boy, my heartache and joy
Come on let's have some fun""

I wanna rock & roll
Wanna hoochie coo
Shake that thing
Baby, love me do

It was early last night, I went downtown
To a place called Johnny's Last Stand
Through the blues and the smoke, I saw her on the dance floor
She's with another man

The dead man's name was Louie Dupree
I pushed the little button on my knife
I walked up and I said, ""Well hello boys and girls
Have you enjoyed your life?""

It's time to rock & roll
Time to hoochie coo
Time to shake that thing
Baby, love me do

I took her down to the railroad track
And her dead, red lips touched mine

It burns on my arm like the truth
the red ink is in my skin its on my soul too
I have a crimson dragon tattoo

21 silver dollars is what it cost
Drawn by a fast left hand when I was lost
I did not choose a heart, a rose or a cross
21 silver dollars is what it cost

Sometimes it whispers my name
And tells me that this life is just a game
Whom the gods wish to destroy, first they drive insane
Sometimes it whispers my name

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"I had a dream last night I was cast into Hell by a jealous God
The Devil walked up and said, ""You don't need no lightning rod
It hardly ever rains down here, I can't recall the last storm
You ain't gonna need that leather jacket, it gets kinda warm
But there's one way in there's no way out
It looks like you're here to stay
The place is a mess, it's overcrowded, more are coming in everyday""

I said, ""Oh man, wait a minute there's gotta be something wrong
I ain't a bad guy, just write these little songs
I always pay my union dues, I don't stay in the passing lane""
And he said, ""What about all that whiskey and the cocaine""
I said, ""Well, yeah, but that's no reason to throw me in Hell
'Cause I didn't use the cocaine to get high
I just liked the way it smelled""

He said, ""Come on over here son, let me show you around
Over there's where we put the preachers, I never liked those clowns
They're always blaming me for everything wrong under the sun
It ain't that harder to do what's right, it's just maybe not as much fun
Then they walk around thinking they're better than me and you
And then they get caught in a motel room
Doing what they said not to do""

""Now the murderers and the rapists they go in this fiery lake
As well as most of the politician and the cops on the take
And all the mothers who wait till they get to K-Mart to spank their kids
And instead of showing what to do what's right
They just hit 'em for what they did
And all the daddy's who run off and abandon their daughters and sons
Oh, anybody who hurts a child is gonna burn until it's done""

""Everybody is down here"", I said
""Who's up in Heaven with God and the Son""
Oh, some saints and mystics and students of metaphysics one O one
People who care and share and love and try to do what's right
Beautiful old souls who read a little stories to their babies every night
What you won't find up in Heaven are
Christian Coalition Right Wing Conservatives
Country program directors and Nashville record executives

Now I said, ""I've made some mistakes, but I'm not as bad as those guys
How can God do this to me or can't He sympathize
He said, ""You're wrong about God being cruel and mean
Oh, God is the most loving thing that's never been seen""
I said, ""Hotshot tell me this which religion is the truest""
He said, ""There all about the same
Buddha was not a Christian, but Jesus woulda made a good buddist""

Well, I thought about my future, I didn't seem to have much of one
I looked around to leave but there was no place to run
I said, ""I don't suppose I could go back and try living again
You know like reincarnation, I hear that's the way it's always been""
""I can't answer that"", he said
""You're gonna have to wait for that response
But it's not any more unusual to be born twice than it is to be born once""

Well, it looked like I was gonna be stuck here as far as I could tell
I thought I might as well suck up, you know what the hell
I said you, ""You know that song that Charlie Daniels did
About how you went down to Georgia and played fiddle against that kid""
He said, ""Yeah it broke my heart but you know what are you gonna do
I said, ""To tell you the truth
I thought your solo was the better of the two""

Well, then I woke up and I was lying in my bed
I ran upstairs and kissed my little boy on his sleeping head
I took this dream as a sign from God, so I thought I'd better pray
I said, ""Don't ever speak to me directly and thanks anyway""
Now so much has changed about me
Besides me just giving up red meat
Some get spiritual, 'cause they see the light
And some, 'cause they feel the heat",Conversation With the Devil,1999
Ray Wylie Hubbard,"There's an old soul waitin' to be born
There's a scarecrow standin' in the corn
On of thems wishin' for the light of day
One of them is chasin' all the black crows away

Well I'm standing at the station and I don't know where I am
And the wheels are turnin' on the last train to Amsterdam

There's a preacher out spreadin' the word
There's a blond in a thunderbird
One of them tells me to kneel and pray
One of them gets to me in a real bad way

Well I got me a one way ticket to get me from where I am
And the wheels are turnin' on the last train to Amsterdam

I'm standin' just south of Fate
There ain't no exit from the interstate
There's one way in, it's a long dirty road
Only one way our Robert Johnson knows

There's a hobo waitin' on a train
There's a hitch hiker standin' in the rain
One of them knows he's never going home
The other one feels God down in his bones",Last Train to Amsterdam [Live],2000

I'd come downtown to check out a band at The Continental Club
A Mamie Van Doren-lookin' woman come in the door
She was untamed youth rebellion and truth and so much more
I don't know if she had seen the light, she seemed at home in the dark
Her eyes met mine and it was like the time they split the atom apart

She could have had any biker in the bar but she come up to me
She said ""You're done sleeping around, from now on you're with me""

Y' understand I did not know if this was my last or my lucky day
She said ""You wanna go for a joy ride or you wanna stay here and pray""
I thought about my choices and I guess I could have said no
But it was just a band I'd come to see, so I mumbled

""Let's go""
She had an old Camaro--naugahyde tuck and roll
She said ""You can't live down in Texas if you don't have a lot of soul""

The stereo was blasting ""Mendocino"" by Doug Sahm
She said ""Fasten your seatbelt, you're with me from now on""

Understand I was not sleeping at the next day's sunrise
Me and this joy ride angel were up all night it's no surprise
When we got to her house she said ""Go on and take off your shoes.
I don't smoke afterwards I prefer to listen to blues""
""I know you're an old roots rocker and that's a compliment
When she said ""Do you want to hear some Slim Harpo,"" I knew she was heaven sent

In her fine presence is where I want to be
I'm done sleeping around, from now on she's with me",Joyride,2001

Well, I got a good woman, what's the matter with me? 
What makes me want to love every woman I see?

Ray Wylie Hubbard,"Strap them kids in
Give 'em a little bit of vodka in a cherry coke
We're going to Oklahoma to the family reunion for the first time in years
It's up at uncle Slayton's cause he's getting on in years
You know he no longer travels but he's still pretty spry
He's not much on talking and he's just too mean to die
And they'll be comin' down from Kansas
and from west Arkansas
It'll be one great big old party like you never saw

Uncle Slayton's got his Texan pride
Back in the thickets with his Asian bride
He's got a Airstream trailer and a Holstein cow
He still makes whiskey 'cause he still knows how
He plats that Choctaw bingo every Friday night
You know he had to leave Texas but he won't say why
He owns a quarter section up by Lake Eufala
Caught a great big ol' blue cat on a driftin' jug line
Sells his hardwood timber to the shipping mill
Cooks that crystal meth because the shine don't sell
He cooks that crystal meth because the shine don't sell
You know he likes his money he don't mind the smell

My cousin Roscoe Slayton's oldest boy from his second marriage up in Illinois
He was raised in East St. Louis by his momma's people
Where they do things different
Thought he'd just come on down
He was going to Dallas Texas in a semi truck called from that big McDonald's
You know the one they built up on that great big ol' bridge
Across the Will Rogers Turnpike
Took the Big Cabin exit stopped and bought a couple of cartons of cigarettes
At that Indian Smoke Shop with the big neon smoke rings
In the Cherokee Nation hit Muskogee late that night
Somebody ran a stoplight at the Shawnee Bypass
Roscoe tried to miss 'em but he didn't quite

Bob and Mae come up from little town
Way down by lake Texoma where he coaches football
They were two A champions now for two years running
But he says they won't be this year no they won't be this year
And he stopped off in Tushka at that ""Pop's Knife and Gun"" place
Bought a SKS rifle and a couple a full cases of that steel core ammo
With the berdan primers from some East bloc nation that no longer needs 'em
And a Desert Eagle that's one great big ol' pistol
I mean .50 caliber made by badass Hebrews
And some surplus tracers for that old BAR of Slayton's
Soon as it gets dark we're gonna have us a time
We're gonna have us a time

Ruth Ann and Lynn come down from Baxter Springs
That's one hell raisin' town way up in Southeastern Kansas
Got a biker bar next to the lingerie store
That's got them Rolling Stones lips up there where everyone can see 'em
And they burn all night you know they burn all night you know they burn all night

Ruth Ann and Lynn they wear them cut off britches and those skinny little halters
And they're second cousins to me
Man I don't care I want to get between 'em
With a great big ol' hard on like a old bois d' arc fence post
You could hang a pipe rail gait from
Do some twisted sisters 'til the cows come home
And we'd be havin' us a time

Uncle Slayton's got his Texan pride
Back in the thickets with his Asian bride
He's cut that corner pasture into acre lots`
He sells 'em owner financed
Strictly to them that's got no kind of credit 'Cause he knows they're slackers
When they miss that payment
Then he takes it back
He plays that Choctaw Bingo every Friday night
Drinks that Johnny Walker at that Club 69

And a cherry coke we're goin' to Oklahoma Gonna have us a time",Choctaw Bingo,2005
Ray Wylie Hubbard,"I pulled into the alley behind the liquor store 
Turned out the lights, left the motor runnin' opened up the door, 
I flashed a grin and said, Jack this is gonna be a piece of cake, 
Later tonight we'll head down to the Last Stand, split up the take. 

Sittin' there in the darkness, I take a drink of wine, 
Feel'n high and fast and loose, so right 
Wait for the rush to hit me and it feels so fine. 
Then I think of somethin' never realized, 
If I get shot tonight, I ain't never been baptized. 

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight

I came runnin' back, blinded by sweat, blood and tears. 
I said, Jack the cat had a gun, hah, let's get outa here.
I didn't say nothin' as we drove away. 
I kept askin' myself how'd I ever get so mean I couldn't pray? 

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 

Now there ain't nothin' I like better than drivin' on hard concrete, 
I'd rather hold a steerin' wheel in my hands than a woman at my feet. 
Ever since I was a little kid I was always rowdy and loud, 
Now here I am 34 still runnin' around with the wrong crowd. 

Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 
Oh, Dallas after midnight 

We had such plans for when we got to Mexico
After a high-speed chase we got caught south of San Angelo,
Well the judge he asked, why'd you want to go and rob a liquor store?
I said, well your honor it's hard to live in Dallas when you're white-trash and poor.

Strength is written in the stone

Deep inside your hearts for you to keep
Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you've ever known
Yeah is written in the stone

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not standing tall
In the stone the light is shining
Ever touching all

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling
True love is written in the stone

Never, never my darling, never you'll be alone
Ever forever my darling

   Heaven In The Rain

Al : Hey, what's the matter?
Girl : My car has stalled and I'm afraid all alone out here in the storm.
Al :  Yes It's raining pretty hard. I tell you what.. Get in my car and
I'll take you home. Ok.
Girl :  Oh thank goodness you came along.
Al :  Ah, It's my pleasure. Tell me this, how far do you live?
Girl : Not far. About two miles up the road  
Al :  Oh ok. ain't no problem. 
Girl  : Oh thanks.
Al :  Mmm, sho? ain?t no problem. 
   No there ain?t no problem at all
   Fine as she is, I?d drive her all the way to California
   And all points west of that If that?s where she wanna go
   This girl is fine. I sure wish the fellows  could see me  now. 
   Ooohhh. Ooh, wouldn?t believe it. Ain't nobody gonna believe me when
I tell them this.
   I sure hope she invites me in for a cup of coffee or something hot.

Picture an angel in a centerfold,
Soaking wet, but still in her clothes
She said "" I'm sure glad you came along,"" 
"" My Mercedes is sick and I'll  need a ride home ""

I found 
Heaven in the rain
Two miles from nowhere
An angel let me in
God sent her
Never thought I'd find in my lifetime
Heaven in the rain

Al :  Oh baby
   You know this is like a dream.
   Just think we met one year ago.
   Fell in love. 
   And I've been here ever since

It's been a year and a day my friend
Since we fell in love and she invited me in
Now if you think this story's hard to believe
Just imagine how it feels to me

I found 
Heaven in the rain
Two miles from nowhere
An angel let me in
God sent her
I Never thought I'd find in my lifetime
Heaven in the rain


I've got an address
My heart calls home
There's no zip code and no telephone
My house is here
Right here in her arms
I'm staying close I can't leave her alone

I found

Al : I love you so much. And I'll never ever gonna leave you.
 I'll be with you forever

I found, I found 
Heaven in the rain
Two miles from nowhere
An angel let me in
God sent her
Never thought I'd find in my lifetime

"Ray, Goodman & Brown","You know, I've never been good at doing numbers,
But losing your love has taught me that, 
When there's two and you take away one,
You're left with something that's worth less than nothing.

Never let it be said I didn't try to rescue your heart
But how can you save a love that is thru before it could start.
We were more than the sum of all our pearls we were infinity
But now that you're gone, can't figure it out
Don't add up to me

I'm in love minus one
And that probably is
Even less than love
Ending before it had begun
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Minus one.

But most times I live in a dream that you're coming back,
But somewhere in my heart I know it's not true.

I just can't believe, forever so long
