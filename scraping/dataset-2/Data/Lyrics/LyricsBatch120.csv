David Liebman,"No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, winging low
Bye, bye, blackbird

Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye

Bye, bye, blackbird
Where somebody waits for me
Sugar's sweet, so is she
Bye, bye, blackbird

No one here can love or understand me
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll arrive late tonight
Blackbird, bye, bye",Bye Bye Blackbird,1996
David Liebman,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1997
David Liebman,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1997
David Liebman,"I saw a blind man,
He was a kind man,
Helping a fellow along,
One could not see,
One could not walk,
But they both were humming this song;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.
 
I used to worry,
I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;
 
When you're smiling, When you're smiling, 
The whole world smiles with you,
When you're laughing, When you're laughing,
The sun comes shining through,
But when you're crying you bring on the rain,
So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,",When Your're Smiling,2002
David Liebman,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2002

David Liebman,"My love must be a kind of blind love
I can't see anyone but you
Sha bop sha bop

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
I only have eyes for you dear

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky
I only have eyes for you

I don't know if we're in a garden
Or on a crowded avenue

You are here and so am I
Maybe millions of people go by
But they all disappear from view
And I only have eyes for you",I Only Have Eyes for You,2006
David Liebman,"Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,2009
David Liebman,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,2011
David Liebman Trio,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1988
David Liebman Trio,"When day is gone and night comes on
Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
Dream dancing with you

Dream dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Touching you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career
Dream dancing, dream dancing with you

When day is gone and night comes on
Until the dawn what do I do?
I clasp your hand and wander through slumber land
Dream dancing with you

We dance between a sky serene
And fields of green sparkling with dew
It's joy sublime whenever I spend my time
Dream dancing with you

Dream dancing
Oh, what a lucky windfall
Holding you, clutching you
All the night through

So say you love me, dear
And let me make my career

With you, with you, with you",Dream Dancing,1988
David Liebman Trio,"Get out of town
Before it's too late, my love
Get out of town
Be good to me, please

Why wish me harm?
Why not retire to a farm
And be contented to charm
The birds off the trees?

Just disappear
I care for you much too much
And when you're near, close to me, dear
We touch too much

The thrill when we meet is so bittersweet
That, darling, it's getting me down
So, on your mark, get set
Get out of town",Get Out of Town,1988
David Liebman Trio,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,1988
David Liebman Trio,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1988
David Liebman Trio,"Life's great, life's grand,
Future all planned,
No more clouds in the sky,
How'm I ridin'?  I'm ridin' high!

Someone I love,
Mad for my love,
So long, Jonah goodbye!
How'm I ridin'?  I'm ridin' high!

Floating on a starlit ceiling,
Doting on the cards I'm dealing,
Gloating because I'm feeling
So hap-hap-happy I'm slap-happy!

So ring bells, sing songs,
Blow horns, beat gongs,
Our love never will die,
How'm I ridin'?  I'm ridin' high!

Mad for my love,
So long, Jonah goodbye!

Why you and I
Will by and by
Know true love ways

Sometimes we'll sigh

David Lindley,"Sittin' at the laundry-mat
Trying to keep clean
Twenty five women arrive on the scene
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way, baby
Ain't no way, baby

Bye bye love, bye bye happiness, hello loneliness
I think I'm-a gonna cry
Bye bye love, bye bye sweet caress, hello emptiness
I feel like I could die

There goes my baby with someone new
She sure looks happy, I sure am blue
She was my baby till he stepped in
Goodbye to romance that might have been

David Lindley,"If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place.
You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it
Love has problems I know but there problems, we'll just have to face.
If you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
We're gonna walk and don't look back. 
Don't look back
And don't look back
And don't look back, baby. 
Don't look back

The places behind you let them re-remind you
If your first lover broke your heart,
There's something that can be done.
You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on walking and don't look back.
Forget about the past now.
Don't look back, baby.
Keep on walking and don't look back
The places behind you let them re-remind you.

Love can be a beautiful thing.
Though your first love let you down.
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby.
The second time around.
So if you just put your hand in mine,
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind.
Keep on pushing and don't look back.
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl.
Keep on walking and won't look back.
Forget about the past now, baby.
And don't look back.

And bells on her toes

David Lindley,"Everybody I talk to is ready to leave
With the light of the morning
They've seen the end coming down
Long enough to believe
That they've heard their last warning
Standing alone
Each has his own ticket in his hand
And as the evening descends
I sit thinking 'bout Everyman

Seems like I've always been
Looking for some other place
To get it together
Where with a few of my friends
I could give up the race
And maybe find something better
But all my fine dreams
Well though out schemes
To gain the motherland
Have all eventually come down
To waiting for Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand
Waiting here for Everyman
Don't ask me if he'll show, baby I don't know

Make it on your own if you think you can
Somewhere later on you'll have to take a stand
Then you're going to need a hand

Everybody's just waiting to hear from the one
Who can give them the answers
And lead them back to that place
In the warmth of the sun
Where sweet childhood still dances
Who'll come along
And hold out that strong
That gentle father's hand
Long ago I heard someone say
Something 'bout Everyman

Waiting here for Everyman
Make it on your own
Make it  if you think you can
If you see somewhere to go I understand

David Lindley,"For taking the trouble, for hanging on and tryin'
You've been working through the rubble of a shattered mind

Yeah Baby, tell me why the tears are falling from your eye
Tears of laughter, tears of grief, are they the tears of a captured thief?

You thought that you were home free, you thought you had her well in hand
But there were things about her you didn't understand

Yeah Baby, tell me how you're gonna keep that promise now?
To live your life without regret and make it work with what you get

You didn't then, but now you know
When she began to lie, you really should have let her go

You're learnin' how to talk about it, you're learnin' how to bend
It's like you're learning how to walk all over again

Yeah Baby, tell me who you're gonna give your lovin' to?
That girl who catches every eye or the one you can set your compass by

You set it by her soulful smile, the fire in her eye
And the way she goes that extra mile
The love you wanted this to be is somewhere down the line
You'll find her eventually

Your grandma and her grandma are sittin' 'round heaven discussin' the law
Lovin' that girl was not your crime, livin' without her gonna take some time
Lovin' that girl next thing you knew, you'd turned away from the thing you do
Lovin' that girl, you couldn't see, living without her gonna make you free

I look around my life tonight and you are gone

How unhappy you had become

While I was dreaming of you

And somehow the feeling still wasn't right
And still we continued on through the night
Tracing our steps from the beginning
Until they vanished into the air
Trying to understand how our lives has led us there

Looking hard into your eyes
There was nobody I'd ever known
Such an empty surprise to feel so alone

Now for me some words come easy
But I know that they don't mean that much
Compared with the things that are said when lovers touch
You never knew what I loved in you
I don't know what you loved in me
Maybe the picture of somebody you were hoping I might be

Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting alone through the night
How long have I been dreaming I could make it right
If I closed my eyes and tried with all my might
To be the one you need

Awake again I can't pretend and I know I'm alone
And close to the end of the feeling we've known

How long have I been sleeping
How long have I been drifting alone through the night
How long have I been running for that morning flight
Through the whispered promises and the changing light
Of the bed where we both lie

Together we went traveling, 
As we received the call 
His destination India,

I wouldn't say for sure

As our goodbyes were said 
And I never heard from him again 
As each our lives we led 
Except for once in someone else's

That a friend of mine was dead

I'll (D) sing the record of (G) deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time (D) ago
When a (G) man's only friend was his (D) own forty- (G) four

Now when Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man

Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Before this young manhood reached its sad end
He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty one men

It was on one black night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men that I've put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two""

Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
A big moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City's best friend
The poor outlaw's life have reached its sad end

I never got a chance to see him; never heard nothin' but bad things about him.
Mama I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just looked at him and said, ""Son, 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Mama just hung her head and said, ""Son,
Papa was a rollin' stone.

David Lindley,"There's a place where I've been told 
Every street is paved with gold 
And it's just across the borderline 
And when it's time to take your turn 
Here's one lesson that you must learn 
You could lose more than you'll ever hope to find 

When you reach the broken promised land 
And every dream slips through your hands 
Then you'll know that it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you've paid the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline 

Up and down the Rio Grande 
A thousand footprints in the sand 
Reveal a secret no one can define 
The river flows on like a breath 
In between our life and death 
Tell me who's the next to cross the borderline 

En la triste oscuridad (In the sad darkness) 
hoy tenemos que cruzar (today we have to cross) 
este río que nos llama más allá (this river which calls us further away) 

But hope remains when pride is gone 
And it keeps you moving on 
Calling you across the borderline 

When you reach the broken promised land 
Every dream slips through your hands 
And you'll know it's too late to change your mind 
'Cause you pay the price to come so far 
Just to wind up where you are 
And you're still just across the borderline 
Now you're still just across the borderline 
And you're still just across the borderline

Loves her till the sea runs dry
If Irene turns her back on me
I'm gonna take morphine and die

Stop ramblin' and stop gamblin'
Quit staying out late at night
Come home into your wife and your family
Sit down by the fireside bright

Goodnight Irene, goodnight Irene

David Lindley,"Well, baby used to stay out, all night long
She made me cry and she did me wrong
She had my nose open, that's no lie

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

Well, she used to run around with every man in town
She spent all my money trying to play that high class game

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

I used to wake up in the morning, get my breakfast in bed
Whenever I got worried, she would rub my aching head
But now she's here and there, with every man in town
Still trying to take me for that same old clown

Because I used to love her, but it's all over now
Because I used to love her, but it's all over now

David Lindley,"Jesse James we understand 
Has killed him many a man 
He robbed the Union trains 
But history does record 
That Bob and Charlie Ford 
Have laid Jesse James in his grave 

It was on a Saturday night 
The stars were shining bright 
When they robbed that Union train 
And it was one of the younger boys 
That gathered in the spoils 
And carried that money away 

In his small home unaware 
A-straightening pictures there 
He thought he heard a noise 
And as he turned his head 
Well, the bullet killed him dead 
Fired by Bob Ford, one of the boys 

Poor Jesse had a wife 
She lived a lady all her life 
The children they were brave 
But history does record 
That Bob and Charlie Ford 
Have laid poor Jesse, laid poor Jesse

Must have been that night when I took her down by the river, in a truck.

I gave her all I could give her.
The moon shining. The moon shining.
I walked the street, sometimes I see some girls I’d like to meet, maybe.

Piled high, and smoking the stuff of dreams

If you'd read it
It'd say
Could we be together
Just you and me
The wilderness stretches out forever
You and me
Could we be together

And I knew
It couldn't be

David Lynch,"Bearing all the aforementioned dialogues we discover the possibilities of
The curve towards progressive behavior and the ultimate realization of the
Goal of evolution, which grants the benefits of added awareness with
Unlimited boundness of happiness, also known as bliss, which is a result of
The laws which govern physical behavior merging with the highest levels of
Spirit, and together manifesting the magical and mystical level of cosmic
Awareness, becoming one with the longing for complete surrender to the
Higher self, which has potentially been waiting these long eons of time, 
And in fact sometimes has been dipping into a state of semi-sleep or
Unconsciousness, bordering on complete absence of thought.

Specifically, the areas concerning the new futuristic thinking have to do
With several abstract, somewhat hidden, emotional tendencies which lead one
To believe that the consequences of interaction between the positive and
Negative forces are producing a vital link between the subconscious and
Super conscious minds, which therefore can only be considered as actual
Structures with two separate and distinctly different qualities. 

As we have seen, when one or more intensely feeling energies become
Associated with the higher levels of perceptible phenomenon, and these new
Forms are then instantly acted upon by the two minds previously discussed, 
And brand new associations are given over with resulting problems sorting
Out the new strains of emotional and physical qualities we see cropping up
In schools and places of business across the country, and in the cities
Which of course have the added complications of the much-argued-over
Proposition that one cannot tolerate the existence of two or more intensely
Opposing ideas at one point in time.

Others may find it easier to say ""however,"" and that thought alone is one
Which troubles many of us here who have for so long held the light up on
The words which brought meaning to us concerning the amount of effort it
Takes to ignite a certain process leading one to the knowledge of the truce
Behind the alternating essence which is unending without actually
Beginning, and in those words of course is the key to beginning a long
Journey toward understanding which, as we have learned, is something for
Which each human being cries out, cupping his hands over the mouth.

Sometimes in the evenings a feeling of the type which haunts young children
In the forest will come in on a dark wind, and all the light will fade
Leaving a low sound penetrating the eyes, which follow the dark shapes
Running for safe nests just out of reach of small white teeth and noses
Filled with dirt going up over the mountains covered with tall trees and
Green needles and red bark with pitch oozing out into the air, which dries
It on the surface causing it to become crusty which allows for the
Protection of all that lies within the crust, for it will now remain liquid
And hold itself remaining in a state close to that of the pure essence
Which will remind us of home, which will remind us of the red cookie-jar, 
And the smiles dancing around in the golden afternoons, while the pipe
Puffs out small clouds of smoke from the mouth of the father with an axe to
Cut wood growing on the tall mountains.

In order to assure that the fundamental qualities inherent in the solutions
To modern philosophical questions are accurate, the first and foremost
Consideration lies in the field of abstractions associated with the loss of
Nature, and with them the interaction of the primary forces of life itself
Which have now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have their basis
In the field of the absolute in the vacuum state bringing to mind that
There has been a reversal of sorts of the age-old phrase, ""You can't get
Something from nothing."" As we have seen this kind of thinking which has
Been going on since the beginning of time is just a smoke-screen necessary
To block almost all truthful inquiries for centuries following, and it is
With this also on our minds that we see that the initial thinking on a
Subject is critical to all that follows, and can be an excellent partner to
The dark and evil forces which would have us living forever in darkness and
Confusion, refusing even to acknowledge that we even existed, or that there
Was such a thing as a bad tooth, or a tooth-ache.

Bringing our discussion to the realm of practical considerations, it is
Interesting to note the possibilities of dental hygiene and the remarkable
Idea of a world free of tooth-decay and all other problems associated with
The teeth, tongue, or oral cavity, which would, in fact, become a prime
Motivator for a certain disappearance of fears associated with pain
Connected with dental applications, and even the idea that plaque could
Appear upon the surface of the teeth, and the negative occurrences which
Follow such as the hideous odors emitted from the oral cavity and the
Discolorations and the resulted perforation of the once beautiful mental
Images, and the possibility of the breaking of relationships based upon the
Idea of negative distortion of the mouth, for teeth, while not necessarily
Considered one of the primary building blocks of happiness, can in fact
Become a small sore, festering and transferring negative energies to the
Once quiet and peaceful mind, giving it over to strange and unproductive
Thinking.

David M. Bailey,"Back behind the stage where the spotlight never shines, someone asked what faith means to me. I don't remember what I said - something ‘bout the spirit being free. Two more nights and a thousand miles later, his question was still inside my head. If I could just go back in time for a while, here's what I might have said instead: If you can believe in something bigger than your soul, even if it's something that you cannot see. If you can find a way to hold on to each heartbeat, even when it's beating quietly. If you can find courage in the strangest places, if you can find peace in the middle of a war. If you can walk but a portion of this journey, then you've found faith, faith and so much more. Everywhere I go there's always someone asking questions - questions without answers, but they ask them anyway. Usually I just tell them whatever comes to mind, reminding them they must find their own way. But the next time someone asks about this funny thing called faith, I'll have a thing or two to say. I suppose that by tomorrow, the words could be different, but here's what I'd say to them today: If you can find music in the middle of your midnight - after the last song has been played. If you can feel the bright sun on your shoulders, even when you're sitting in the shade. If you can touch the tender side of timeless, when it's something you've never felt before. If you can taste the fruit before it blossoms, then you've found faith - faith and so much more. ",So Much More,2000

David M. Bailey,"They met for coffee every morning in the subway
Had a smoke before the 8:13 arrived
He was always just a bit hung-over
She said it was a wonder he was still alive
He always said that life is learning to walk fences
She'd say it was more like walking through a maze
He'd reply that every turn had consequences
She'd say ""I know, I've tried at least 1000 ways.""

They used to laugh about they way they talked in circles
And wonder about the bridges they had burned
He said freedom had always been his first love
She said freedom's in the lessons you have learned

He said ""I don't know why people call me reckless
She said ""because you never look before you leap
He said ""but jumping off a fence is not so dangerous
It depends on the company you keep

She said 'is that your way of saying that you trust me
Or that you tired of living all alone
Who is there to hold you when you get lost?
Who is there to welcome you back home?

His silence was thicker than the coffee, 
Then he whispered 'you're the only one who cares
She smiled and said 'is that an invitation?' 
Cuz somehow it feels more like a dare

He said ""no, I'm pretty sure that was a question""
I know I've made mistakes along the way
But you made me to believe in 2nd chances
So I'm taking my biggest chance today

as she stared past him into the morning crowd
He said don't worry bout giving me an answer
but she cut him off and wondered right out loud

He said everyone you know is probably right
She said But you made me believe in taking chances
I never thought I could but I just might...

David M. Bailey,"It's been 20 years since I've been on this playground 
This place has seen a lot of change
The monkey bars and swings, the sandbox and the rings
Seems like everything's been rearranged

The merry -go-round is in the middle
The seesaw was moved to the side
The grass where we looked for 4-leaf clovers
Has been covered by a giant plastic slide

So I'm sitting on this bench just reminiscing
About the years when all I had to do was play
When I could make a moment last forever
And I could fit forever in a day

Since then, a lot of things have happened
I've been around the world a couple times
I've watched us go to war, not always known what for 
I've seen us all commit every kind of crime

So I wonder if I've turned into a cynic
If growing up means giving up your joy
Just for a moment, I let myself imagine 
That once again, I'm just a little boy

Cuz then I'd prob'ly go right to the sandbox
And ask if they had space for just one more
Then play hide and seek along the banks of the creek
Buy baseball cards at the general store
But instead I to the old pavilion
Where the parents sit with a watchful eye
Everything looks different from their viewpoint 
I get confused when I feel like I could cry

Maybe this place hasn't really changed at all
It's still whatever children make it be 
There's a little dark-hired boy teasing all the girls
And I swear he looks a lot like me

As I watch the sweet commotion, I feel a strange emotion
I catch a glimpse of truth that looks so strange
It's my turn to go through what everybody goes through 
And realize that I'm the on who's changed.

I check my watch and can't believe the time
The afternoon is coming to a close
I sit down on a swing; throw my head back in the air
And celebrate what my heart now knows.

David M. Bailey,"Have you ever spent a weekend in the mountains
Felt short of breath where the trees are tall
Have you been to Minnesota in the winter
Have you ever seen New England in the Fall
 
Have you ever felt seasick on a river
Have you ever Or laughed so hard it made you cry
Have you ever had a case of poison ivy
Have you ever seen a bird that could not fly
 
Have you ever put a coin upon the train track
Have you ever had a dream in black & White
Hfave you ever watched the moon cover up the sun
Have you ever seen the dancing northern lights
 
Have you ever been lost deep in the city
Have you ever turned to take the scenic route
Have you ever smelled something that made you nervous?
Or ever felt a touch that made you want to shout
 
Have you ever really lost your perspective
And found truth in the middle of a dare
Have you ever really changed your opinion
Have you ever had an answer to a prayer

David M. Bailey,"Today I'm gonna make a couple changes Do some things I've never done before Today I'm gonna try a little harder To set my sights on a different shore 
Today I'm gonna laugh a little longer Gonna turn my dream into a plan Today I'm gonna sing a little louder Even if nobody understands 
Today I'm gonna make myself a promise And keep it no matter what the cost Today I'm gonna count all of my blessings And let go of everything I lost 
Today is gonna be a little better Than yesterday ever hoped to be No time to waste ? too much to touch and taste Tomorrow is too far away for me 
Today I'm gonna find another reason To make my children glad that they are here Today I'm gonna listen to the season Tell me all about the coming year 
Today I'm gonna start another journey Find the things I never thought I?d lose Make a couple choices and disregard the voices That tell me I'm not strong enough to choose 
Today I'm gonna live a little longer Make the hours equal 25 Today I'm gonna love a little stronger And celebrate that love is still alive 
Today already started But it hasn't ended yet Today will be a day I never will forget 
And when tomorrow comes, I?ll sing this song again. And again. And again?",Today,2008
David M. Brown,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

After it brought my lover near

Maybe someday you'll bring me a beer

Stars to fill my dream

This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait 
All will be revealed

David Mallett,"In the shade of this old tree,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the tall grass, by the wild rose,
Where the trees dance, as the wind blows:
As the days go, oh, so slowly,
As the sun shines, oh, so holy,
On the good and gracious green.
In the summer of my dreams. 

By the banks of this old stream,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the deep pool, where the fish wait,
For the old fool, with the wrong bait.
There's a field of purple clover;
There's a small cloud passing over.
And the rain comes washing clean,
On the summer of my dreams. 

See the raindrops on the grass now,
Just like diamonds lying there.
By the old road where I pass now,
There's a twilight in the air. 

And as the sun sets down before me,
I see my true love waiting for me,
Standing by the back porch screen,
In the summer of my dreams. 

In the shade of this old tree,
In the summer of my dreams.
By the tall grass, by the wild rose,
Where the trees dance, as the beans grow,
As the days go, oh, so slowly:
As the sun shines, oh, so holy:
On the good and gracious green,
On the summer of my dreams.

On m'avait dit tu verras qui c'est
Cé-Cé-Cé-Célimène 
Bientôt tu en auras plus qu'assez

Tous les sous qu’elle va aller dépenser


Mais quand on s'est rencontré
J'étais tout à fait fauché
Ça ne l'a pas empêchée
De se laisser inviter
Et quand on s'est rencontré
Tout' la nuit on a dansé
On n'pouvait plus s'arrêter
Quand la musique a cessé

On se réveille pour recommencer

Dans le pays
Je suis maudit
De moi ils sont tous jaloux
Et de nous voir ça les rend fous

Depuis toujours
Ils meurent d'amour
Pour la belle Célimène
Mais en bateau elle les emmène

C'est tout cela

For the sake of having you near

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you I'm limp as a glove

I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

You're out of my heart

You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around,

So many tried so I seen the petty pass by
Listen as I take you on a mission with precision
Like a brown cent went on a hunt
Worldwide searchin for the true ingredients 
To make the pi ?? 6
Shorty want to hound me for a flick
But I got my chips, you gettin visions of my lips
Dicks swang, it don't mean a thang 
'cause when I was down, you was on the other side of town
Getting done by Starang, when he was in range
Now its gettin cold, so you actin kinda strange
Puttin my time to you broke bitches
Don't do shit but stress me out, now I'm back in my riches
To get my blue print down to my very last dot
Every move every motivation that I need
Ain't no hesitation when it comes to rockin when we speak
Just follow my lead on this jou-rney

You never heard another MC like me
Follow my lead on the jour-ney
You never heard another MC like me

Follow my lead on the journey
You never heard another Mc like me
So poetically on point its ridiculous
Hittin every key bassline when I'm rippin this
Don't act like this ain't the shit right now
You know my hits make you want to dance
But you still sittin down
Dumb fucks have a seat and keep your tongue in your throat
And don't bother to quote one note
Or in the mirror you kickin the verse to mine
'cause in the freestyle, you'll be the last to rhyme
This ain't the battle between the two best no more
Survival of the fittest...this shit is war
If you got your eyes open, you can see the light
If you need a guide, follow wit pride...right

So many people took my lyrics and hooks
If I wrote a book about you crook niggas gettin shook
In a hot second, I'm a get the hot-steppin
On first, when I'm on my verse, niggas need a nurse
Without the kill patient, ain't no hesitation 
Bring your weapon like your military mind 
And steppin on E, times over for you Mc's
All hail to G-O-D's, G-O-D's....

Though not a word was spoken

One look and I had found my future at last

Walked and worn by shoe less feet

Watched by shivering sun
Old eyes in a small child's face
Watching as the shadows race
Trough walls and cracks and leave no trace
And daylight's brightness shuns

The days of Pearly Spencer 
The race is almost run

Nose pressed hard on frosted glass
Gazing as the swollen mass
On concrete fields where grows no grass
Stumbles blindly on
Iron trees smother the air
But withering they stand and stare
Trough eyes that neither know nor care
Where the grass is gone

The days of Pearly Spencer
The race is almost run

Pearly where's your milk white skin?
What that stubble on your chin?
Buried in the rot gut gin
You played and lost not won
You played a house that can't be beat
Now look your head's bowed in defeat
You walked too far along the street
Where only rats can run

The prince of dysfunction boy on a string
From a suburban palace he walked out to freedom
Enslaved to a concept in the world of a king

And baby´s love he´s smoking in a peacoat
A ship on the ocean bird on a wind
With a poem and soul written in his honor
There´s a concrete assumption in the world of a king

A guitar and a girlfriend, just off the turnpike
Yeah, the fountain of ego learned how to sing
But the truth shall engage him with heartbreak and cold cots
In an unguarded moment in the world of a king

And baby´s gone, she´s dancing on a big stage
With a tear and a tutu
The phone never rings
And he can´t go on, he´s banging on a keyboard

And came to my sense
Well heaven was healthy

A hat for my head

When the lord showed his worth
I jumped down the well
Where the water was heard
If all fallen angels must climb back to earth
Send down a bucket of girls

Diving for pearls, I ran out of air
Swam through the world of bosoms and hair
Pristine she was, but weren't they all
Mercy, what god gave a girl

What's there to fear in the curl of a lip
The lamp lights the shoulder
And spills down the hip
South of Virginia the toes painted red
The glory of flowers in bloom

And I was asleep
When the lord showed his worth
I jumped down the well
Where the water was heard
If all fallen angels must climb back to earth
Send down a bucket of girls",Bucket of Girls,2004

David Mead,"So I'm calling you up on a very small phone
I'm in the middle of nowhere,
Population of one
Indiana's the wrong place to be stuck in a car
I'm the king of the highway, baby;
Let me conquer your heart

Come on sugar, just say I love you
You're out riding those concrete canyons
You don't know what it means to miss you
I'm still driving through Indiana

So you wanted some tales of my wild exploits
I had a couple of drinks in Cincy
And some drugs in Detroit
Then a guy in Chicago said I sing like a girl
So I bought him a round and thanked him;
What else could I do?

Come on sugar, just say I love you
You're out riding those concrete canyons
You don't know what it means to miss you
I'm still driving through Indiana

Say hello to your friends,
Guess we'll call it a night
I'm pulling off at a truck stop,
It's a glamorous life
Indiana's the wrong place
To be breaking apart
On a road that goes on forever,
Like a hole in your heart

You don't know what it means to miss you
I'm still driving through Indiana",Indiana,2004

I was barely breathing, I was crawling home
Well it's not quite London or the south of France
Or an Asian island or a second chance

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain
Watching all my life go by

You're a distant memory, you're an exit sign
I was talking crazy on the driver's side
And I know I hurt you but I won't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain on your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville, thinking about the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train rolling down the mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville, laughing at a bad break
What's the use in wondering why
Maybe I'm a storm front rolling through the valley
Tearing up a good July

And it's safe and warm where nothing ever happens
Would it be so hard to realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you

Well it's not quite evening, and it's not New York
There's a scar in the blue sky by the old airport
And I'm talking crazy on the driver's side

One place to be

When I was a boy I would dream at night
A cowboy's dream by a cowboy light
Even though I haven't got to ride in yet
New Mexico won't forget

And oh, I wanna go
Where the air is clean
And oh, New Mexico wait for me

And I'm gonna take a ride

Could be happening to me
I'm waltzing through graveyards
And surfing TV
For a face that resembles
A picture of yours
Three thousand miles
And memory that's blurred
Once again

It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl

So bring on the music, the rhythm of cars
Day breaks in Soho and covers the stars
With a blanket for lovers,
The stuff in my head
Closed eyes discover I'm walking home
Holding your hand

It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl

I'm framing your picture
And walking your dog
First of December, stumbling along
Like a drunk in the vineyard,
A whore on the street
Tongue-tied, immortal and
Light on my feet once again

It's a lonely ol', lonely ol' world
And you're only, you're only a girl

Stuck in my old hometown
Shuffling our cards at the breakfast table,
Watching the world go 'round
Well baby you look like a princess
Wrapped in my old bathrobe
Torn from a page in a paperback still waiting to unfold
And it's true I've been waiting on an angel in disguise
So could you save me from an ordinary life

Where you can't be a kid in a candy store
Smacking your lips 'cause you still want more
I tried to be good but I'm still so bored tonight
And I just don't care for ordinary life

How do we get back to Kingston
Paris and Tokyo Bay
I've got a card with a number on it itching to pay your way
And it's true we can't quite afford the sparkle in my eye
But would you trade it for an ordinary life

Where you can't be the chick I was cruising for
Shaking your hips on a big dance floor
You tried to be good but you're still so bored tonight

The city can't keep you with me
'Cause this is an island of vagabonds
A stop on the way to be free

But this is the wrong time for metaphors

So take the Queensboro Bridge to the airport
I'll stay and settle for less

Well sweet baby Jesus is watching you
From his bed at the big corner church
And he knows the highs that you took me to
'Cause he knows the way that it hurts

But this is the wrong time for saying prayers
A kiss at the taxi will do
And if the Queensboro Bridge never gets you there
I'll be here waiting for you

You're a beautiful sight over east river lights
And I'm losing you
You're a dream taking flight in a pink morning sky
Yeah you're coming true

He might be walking on water
He might be floating through air

A suburban flower tryin' to break some city rules

And though you may pretend
This is how it ends

And sweep me right along
Won't you give me your cold embrace
I'll give you one more song
Then you tell me a lie
And say you'll miss me when I'm gone

Who's always there to meet your needs

There's a mother in your heart of hearts
Who always plays the perfect part

These are their tender dreams
And oh, how it hurts when they don't come true

That's why I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Father, little children must grow up
And to grow we've got to learn to trust
And to trust we've got to cling to You

And when You tell me You will hold me close
It's the very thing I need the most
But it's the very hardest thing to do

I've got this pain inside me
It speaks to me loud and clear
When there's so much to gain there's always so much to lose

That's why I'm learning to trust in You
In everything I do
I'm learning to trust in You

'Cause I know in my heart that You're true
I'm learning to trust in You
But sometimes it's so hard to do

Keep calling me, drawing me closer
Don't let me hold back

The heart of a child is broken
But his time has come
Whatever he lost, I'll find in You

Hope soared, nearly to the sky, early in the morning

In the stone cold tomb He lay, early in the morning
Laid with Him the hope of day, early in the morning
Saints and Angels fearful, pray, yearning for a dawning
Breaking on the silent grave, early in the morning

Hallelujah, oh, the bright dawn breaks
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, oh, the sweet King wakes
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Long the anxious claws had gripped, early in the morning
Now vanquished claws have slipped, early in the morning
Now the bragging dragon trips, head so high, now fawning
Mouth denied, forever drips, early in the morning

Hallelujah, empty claws proclaim
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, now the good King reigns
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Steady in the waning night, early in the morning
Risen Morning Star, our Light, early in the morning
Dragons breed again to fight, fearful is their taunting
Yet, we trust, Lord, Thy great might, early in the morning

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, praise the risen King

I can see who speaks my name
And I can feel something stirring in my heart
How His words ring strong and true
Like a once familiar strain
And I know that I'll never be the same
I can see

And from that moment in time
I felt the emptiness subside
And all the glory of His power shining through
And for the first time in my life
I really looked into His eyes and saw eternity
And suddenly I knew
Yes, I can see
Yes, I can see who walks with me

I can see who speaks my name
And I can feel something stirring in my heart

David Meece,"Just like a fool on sinking sand
I didn't know what was going down
I let my pride and vanity turn me away from reality
All of my strength and security
Were built upon the walls of society
But all I had were sandcastles next to the raging sea

Just like the walls of Jericho
They came a-tumblin? down

They came a-tumblin? down

I saw the gleam of a distant light
I felt the warmth of a gentle touch
I felt the strength as it picked me up

""Don't put your faith in physical things,
Nothing of this world is forever, you've got to see

We can overcome it all
When we put our trust in Him
We can overcome it all
When we put our trust in Him
Everybody?s got their thorn in the flesh
Everybody's got their weaknesses
But there's no reason to give in to this
We can conquer our faults, rise up and walk
Whatever our fears, whatever appears
We can overcome it all
When we put our trust in Him
We can overcome it all
When we put our trust in Him
We've got the power, the victory is ours
We'll stand up and fight with God on our side

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Grows stronger yet

Taking her money
Watching her sun set

LA's changed a lot over the years
Since those brave goldrush pioneers
Came in their creaky covered wagons

Were hidden dragons

Swamped with every kind of false emotion

I threw a rope

Still I'll enjoy a hearty meal

Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

And I understand you've come to shake my hand.

Is like feeling the whole worlds on my side

Where a cloud used to follow instead

In a place where all my troubles depart

Let them fly
Let the rain keep falling down

David Morales,"On my way to see my friends who lived a couple blocks away from me (oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me, stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her name, a six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn, sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday

And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday 
We chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine and she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked)
And I oh, oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression, girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
All you gotta do is just call me, call me

I read the rules before I broke 'em
I broke the chains before they choked me out
Now I pay close attention really learn the code
I learned to read the map before I hit the road

Hey yo, I know you never heard this before
But I'd rather lose a fight than miss the war
And I ain't wishing competition or fishin' for it
I'm just living in the system, conditions are poor
I've been lost in the rhythm and misinformed
Too many late nights hittin' the liquor store
Too many bad decisions, half assed attempts
No sweat, no fear, no blood, no tears
I go hard and I ain't makin' up no excuse
I'm overdue, I don't do what I'm supposed to do
'Cause you can think about it man, we're supposed to lose
It ain't all picture perfect, ocean views
No, I was a first class rookie,
Takin' out bullies in my all black hoodie
Man of mystery, you know the history
Get it or forget it, 'cause poof, I'm outta here

I've been beaten and broken but I healed though

I'm tryin' to do better now, find my inner peace
Learn my art form, and find my energy
When my backs on the wall, I don't freeze up
Nah, I find my inner strength and I re-up
Here we go, I know I've never been the smartest or wisest
But I realize what it takes
Never dwell in the dark cause the sun always rises
But gotta make it to the next day
It's a feeling that you get in your lungs when you run
Like you're runnin' outta air and your breath won't come
And you (uh) wheezin', gotta keep it movin'
Find that extra (uhn) and push your way through it

I've had bad habits but I dropped 'em (I dropped 'em)

David Nail,"(Verse 1)
November's almost over,
The gentle winter's on the way.
Still I sit here on this balcony, 
And smoke my brain away,
Waiting on that phone to ring. 
Wondering which day that it will be.

(Chorus)
Oh Carrie I pray one day you'll go back home, 
To the warmth of Southern Georgia where you belong,
And leave all the pain you've felt from me,
Here in Missouri.

(Verse 2)
Oh you were just a young girl,
And I swore I could change.
Every day that you forgive me,
Is just another one you'll waste.
You came here in search of something true.
I ???? your searching isn't through.

(Chorus)

It's hard to think that everything around her.
To know that won't be happy ever after.

David Nail,"So this is how it ends
This is where it all goes down
This is what ""I don't love you"" feels like
It ain't the middle of the night
And it ain't even raining outside
It ain't exactly what I had in mind
For goodbye

At a red light
In the sunshine, on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try

Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light

I thought she was gonna say
Somethin' about that couple kissin' crossin' the street
Or somethin' about this beautiful day
But she just looked me in the eye
Said it's over
Didn't try to lie
Or pick a fight
I might have seen it comin' thata way

But at a red light
In the sunshine, on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try

Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
In the sunshine
At a red light

There's a momma calmin' down a little baby in the backseat
in front of me
There's an old man dressed in his Sunday best just waitin' on green
But I can't see,
gettin' past

This red light
In the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try

Some are comin' home
Some are leavin' town
While my world's crashin' down on a Sunday
in the sunshine (at a red light)

At a red light in the sunshine on a Sunday
Nothin' to say, don't even try

Who didn't drive a car that wasn't cool enough
Just a baby blue parking lot Gremlin
Not exactly a magnet for the women
Until I hung that surfboard out the back

For tips and caddies at the local court
The night I mixed both drinks down on the wharf
Flirtin' with the college girls getting my barefoot wet out in the world
Fell in love 100 times

Stop the car and touch the ground
Watch those streetlights swayin' in the breeze
Decorated store fronts
Rusty old gas pumps
Try to fill my mind up
With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

I don't know no town
Like the old town
Even when the miles are many
I feel like I'm still around
Deep inside me
Like rings through an oak tree
Yeah, there something 'bout a Sunday when I'm gone
That keeps me turning home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I cant re-live
Stories I'll never forget

And I don't know no friends
Like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now
Like I did with them
But deep inside me
A piece of my history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
Yeah it keeps me turning home

Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

And I don't know no love
Like the first love
When I think about the best times
She's the one I think of
Deep inside me
All though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah
It keeps me turning home",Turning Home,2009

Drowning next to me
No seven years of good can't hide the one night I forgot to wear that ring

And Mainstreet was my street that night
So I called up Samantha
And asked her the chance of us runnin' out neath the moon light

When I rewind the radio dial
And like it was then I feel her on my skin
And I'm back there for a while

When a song hits you right

And stir up an old memory
And out of these piano keys
Comes the sound
The sound of a million dreams

My 18th summer I was a cocky up and come'er
Crankin' up ""Born To Run""
Turn left out the drive with the pistons open wide
And I came back a prodigal son

My spirit was broken, she threw the door open
I love you not I told you so
When I hear mama tried I still break down and cry
And pull to the side of the road

Our first trip to the ocean, your first time on a plane
When you look over your shoulder, baby, you can choose
To remember me however you want to
That's how I'll remember you

The dress that you were wearin', soakin' up the stains
I can still see your mascara, though I can't recall the pain
Of what came after
You were even beautiful tellin' me goodbye
Maybe my version of the truth is just a lie

I've forgot the bitter, the winter's just a blur
I savor the sweet as if the summer's all we were
And ever will be, oh, and I still see

A million perfect moments go rushin' through my brain

That you found a boy and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess he gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind, Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me, I beg

Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

I know when you're silent
The silence says more than a scream
And I know when you say that you hate me
It ain't what you mean
When you say that you'll leave and you'll leave
But only for a while
For just a while

You're stubborn and strong
Crazy as New Orleans
Your faded blue denim
A diamond on the town
My t-shirt in the morning
Midnight in my hands
At day you're still here, I just don't understand
Never knew I had a fighter

I should come with a warning

Throw your arms around me  
I’ll follow that fire in your eyes

Stop the car and touch the ground

Rusty old gas pumps

With somethin' before I go
Picture postcard memories
You know they always make for good company

That keeps me turning home

I'm standin' here beneath these billboard lights
Takes me back to those autumn nights
Hometown bleachers packed real tight
As we marched down the field
My feet would swing from a dropped tailgate
Out on Airport Road real late
No one could walk a line too straight
We usually made it home alright
And glory days I can't re-live
Stories I'll never forget

And I don't know no friends
Like the old friends
I never seem to laugh now
Like I did with them
But deep inside me
A piece of my history
Yeah, I hear their voices even though they're gone
Yeah it keeps me turning home

Never twice the same way does it start
And sure enough she stole my heart
On the old gym floor, spinnin' round and round one night
And though we both tried hard to wait
We sure did love the taste
Of the sweet love being made and prayin' I got it right
Graduation came and went
Along with all the time we spent

And I don't know no love
Like the first love
When I think about the best times
She's the one I think of
Deep inside me
All though the taste is bittersweet
I see her smilin' even though she's gone
And it keeps me turning home, yeah

Is coming in the by and by

David Ogden Stiers,"What can you expect
From filthy little heathens?
Their whole disgusting race is like a curse
Their skin's a hellish red
They're only good when dead
They're vermin, as I said
And worse

They're savages! Savages!

Barely even human

Savages! Savages!

Drive them from our shore!
They're not like you and me
Which means they must be evil
We must sound the drums of war!

They're savages! Savages!
Dirty redskin devils!
Now we sound the drums of war!

This is what we feared
The paleface is a demon
The only thing they feel at all is greed

Beneath that milky hide
There's emptiness inside

I wonder if they even bleed

They're savages! Savages!
Barely even human
Savages! Savages!

Killers at the core

They're different from us
Which means they can't be trusted

We must sound the drums of war

They're savages! Savages!
First we deal with this one
Then we sound the drums of war

Savages! Savages!

Let's go kill a few, men!

Now it's up to you, men!

Savages! Savages!
Barely even human!

David Ogden Stiers,"The gold of Cortés
The jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets
By this time tomorrow
The gold we find here
Will dwarf them by far

Dig up Virginia, boys

Mine, boys, mine ev'ry mountain
And dig, boys, dig 'til ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely
Pebbles that sparkle and shine
It's gold and it's mine, mine, mine

It's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm
When they see how I glitter!

The king will reward me
He'll knight me, no, lord me!

It's mine, mine, mind
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!

Dig and dig and dig and diggety-dig!
All of my life, I have searched for a land
Like this one
A wilder, more challenging country
I couldn't design
Hundreds of dangers await
And I don't plan to miss one
In a land I can claim
A land I can tame
The greatest adventure is mine!

Keep on working, lands
Don't be shirking, lands
Mine, boys, mind
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold
Make this island
My land!
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine
This land we behold
This beauty untold
A man can be bold!
It all can be sold!

And the gold
Is

David Ogden Stiers,"Morning in Paris, the city awakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
The fisherman fishes, the bakerman bakes
To the bells of Notre Dame
To the big bells as loud as the thunder
To the little bells soft as a psalm
And some say the soul of the city is
The toll of the bells
The bells of Notre Dame

Dark was the night when our tale was begun
On the docks near Notre Dame

Four frightened gypsies slid silently under
The docks near Notre Dame

But a trap had been laid for the gypsies
And they gazed up in fear and alarm
At a figure whose clutches
Were iron as much as the bells

The bells of Notre Dame

(Kyrie Eleison)
Judge Claude Frollo longed
To purge the world
Of vice and sin
(Kyrie Eleison)
And he saw corruption
Ev'rywhere
Except within

Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Dies irae, dies illa
(Dies irae, dies illa)
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum sibylla
Quantus tremor est futurus
Quando Judex est venturus

See there the innocent blood you have spilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

Now you would add this child's blood to your guilt
On the steps of Notre Dame

You can lie to yourself and your minions
You can claim that you haven't a qualm
But you never can run from
Nor hide what you've done from the eyes
The very eyes of Notre Dame

(Kyrie Eleison)
And for one time in his live
Of power and control
(Kyrie Eleison)
Frollo felt a twinge of fear
For his immortal soul

Just so he's kept locked away
Where no one else can see

Even this foul creature may
Yet prove one day to be
Of use to me

Now here is a riddle to guess if you can
Sing the bells of Notre Dame
Who is the monster and who is the man

Sing the bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells, bells, bells, bells
Bells of Notre Dame",The Bells of Notre Dame,1999
David Ogden Stiers,"Ah human again
Human again
Yes, think of what that means

I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again

Which should cause severance husbands alarm

I'll hop down off the shelf
And toute suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again

When we're human again
Only human again
When we're knickknacks and what not no more

When we're human again, good and human again
O, cherie, won't it all be top drawer?
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair
It's my prayer to be human again

When we're human again, only human again
When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind, for a change
Really that'd be strange
Can I help it if I'm tense
In a shack by the sea, I'll sit back, sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax, I'll get down to brass tacks and relax
When I'm human again

So sweep the dust from the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel, I can tell someone might break the spell any day now

Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dust pail and broom
If it all goes as planned our time may be at hand any day now

Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years, the sadness and tears and throw them away

We'll be human again, only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-blooming again, we're assuming again
We'll resume our long-lost joie de vivre
We'll be playing again, holidaying again
And we're praying it's ASAP
We will push, we will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again

We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human again",Human Again,2001
David Ogden Stiers,"Things are not what they appear
As tonight will make quite clear
But what is real will be revealed
I can feel the moment's near
Things are never what they seem
That will be this evening's theme
A music sites for your delight
Perhaps a few to make you scream

You will be surprised to see whose disguise
Is the cleverest one of the lot
After our show the whole world will know
Who's pretending to be what they're not
If a jester's grin or a dancer's spin
Should be pleasing, please say, yea
(Yea)
If a juggler's feat should be incomplete
He's the one you greet with nay
(Nay)

If the fools we see should look like you and me
Then before the night goes by
Ask why, why, why, why, why, why

Things are not what they appear
And the finest proof's right here

How I regret when first we met
I believe my own worst fear

Things are not what they seem
So in keeping with our theme

A change of hair, a dress to wear
And our nightmare's now a dream
Clueless and wild, I saw this sweet child
As a danger to one and to all
Savage, I thought, what could have Rolfe have brought
Now I see she's the belle of the ball
Thing are never what they seem
(He's right, he's right)
Many don't say what they mean
(He's right, he's right)

A powered face is just the place
To conceal an ugly scheme

Only one thing's really clear

Y descubres que no se lava bien los dientes

Clothing I will wear on my emotions
They will never keep away the cold

I was never born to be a soldier
But I was never born to run and hide

Burned so hot I thought I'd died
Thought I'd died and gone to hell

Looked to the sky and the Spring rain fell
I drank the water from a deeper well
Well well well well
I drank the water from a deeper well

Well I fell in love like a baby child
Fell for a touch and I fell for a smile
Smile turned bitter and her touch turned cold
I could not keep what I could not hold
So I ran with the moon and I ran with the night
And the three of us made a terrible sight
Whored and we gambled with the money we'd steal
Looking for the water from a deeper well
Well well well well
Looking for the water from a deeper well

Well the moon got weak and he soon was gone
And the night got sick and he died with the dawn
Died with the dawn with a drink in his hand
Too sick to walk to drunk to stand
Time stood still but I ran wild
And I got my fill with a crooked smile
Woke up on the floor of a jailhouse cell

The air smelled like honey
The stars shone like money

And a woman's arms to hide him

I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'

But tonight the war is over

But tonight the war is over
We make love too hard too fast
He falls asleep his face a mask
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask
I put my arms around him

They die in the trenches and they die in the air
In Belguim and France the dead are everywhere
They die so so fast there's no time to prepare
A decent grave to surround them
Old world glory old world fame
The old worlds gone gone up in flames
Nothing will ever be the same
And nothing lasts forever
Oh I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how
And there's nothing nothing that can save him now
There's always another with the same funny bow
And who am I to deny them

David Olney,"My name is Josiah
I've come down to the river 
I don't care to see what's behind me 
I've traveled alone
I'm a long ways from home
There's no need for you to remind me
The past I once had's
Gone rotten, gone bad
There's no loving smile to console me
Well, the future's unknown
But back there at home
There's no one now left to hold me

My days once flew by
Like the geese in the sky
Flying high over Avery County 
In our little mountain home
I never felt alone
It was me and Mama and Daddy
Daddy worked now and then
Odd jobs for a friend
But he made most his money off moonshine
We barely had enough
But we always had love
I never went to sleep hungry or crying

Daddy left home one night
With a load of white lightnin' 
Said he was heading for Charlotte
But he never got that far
Him and his car
Crashed halfway down Kimbrough Mountain
That left Mama and me
Living off charity
And what little Daddy had left us
And pretty soon the bank
Was breathing down our necks
Saying they was going to evict us

Well a man come around 
He'd just moved to town 
He started sweet talking Mama
At the end of her rope
She'd 'bout given up hope
She believed when he promised to love her
He preached and he roared
Like a man of the Lord
His message was Hell and Damnation
When I stood in-between
My mother and him
He said, ""Your boy here's in need of salvation.""

With his high holy ways
He treated me like a slave
Said I was born of the Devil
He beat me til I bled
Then he left me for dead
His eyes shining wicked and evil
Well I ran off that night
In the autumn moonlight
I could hear Mama crying for mercy
I found a boat by the river
I got in and untied her
To the sound of his unholy cursing

Long as this river flows
I reckon I'll go
Til it runs out into the sea
If he follows me there
I'll kill him I swear
He's got no more power over me 
If my Mama were alive
I'd tell her goodbye
I'll see her someday way up yonder
Now the sun's going down
To the river I'm bound
Fare thee well Avery County
Now the sun's going down
To the river I'm bound
Fare thee well Avery County",Avery County,1999
David Olney,"Some work and slave for all of their days 
And they'll do anything whatever it pays 
Some of us search and we find other ways 
Me, I turned to thieving 
A little bit here and a little bit there 
Always some danger but i didn't care 
As long as I felt I was getting my share 
That's all I ever believed in 

From the day I was born I understood 
One way or another I'd wind up no good 
One night I got caught, always knew that I would 
The charges were robbery and murder 
I broke into a house for money and jewels 
Some old man tried to stop me, poor misguided fool 
I killed him and left him in his own bloody pool
I ran but was caught by the soldiers 

They bound me and beat me and put me on trial
It was all cut and dried, it took a short while
""Have you anything to say?"" I only smiled 
And said, ""Judge, let's get this over."" 
I was led from the courtroom and back to my cell 
For a man 'bout to die I was taking it well 
With no hope of heaven and no fear of hell 
Only silence and darkness forever 

I awoke from a dream in the middle of the night 
The door burst open and in streamed the light 
A man was thrown in more dead than alive 
On his face I could see the blood glisten 
I could tell at a glance he'd been beat black and blue 
He lay their unconscious but then he came to 
I said, ""Tell me, friend, what on earth did you do."" 
He said, ""I told them but they wouldn't listen."" 

Told them what?"" I asked but he didn't speak again 
He just lay there quiet in his blood and his pain 
The morning broke, it was starting to rain 
The guards come in and they got us 
Out to the courtyard in the cool morning air 
A crowd was waiting. Why were they there? 
Two small-time losers, what did they care? 
I'd have thought they'd already forgot us 

The next thing I heard was the governor's own voice 
He raised up his hands and the mob ceased its noise 
""According to custom I'm giving you the choice 
Which of these men should I pardon?"" 
The mob went crazy and cried out my name 
Shouting, ""Give us Barabas!"" again and again 
The governor sighed and said, ""My hands are clean."" 
The mob shouted, ""Give us Barabas!"" 

But what kind of freedom is this that is mine? 
To spend all my days in search of a sign 
To have my life saved and to never know why 
To owe such a debt to a stranger
I will go with the wind to a far distant land
I will not cease my wandering til I understand
I will tell everyone, every woman and man 
Of the strange things I have beheld here 
Of the strange things I have beheld here

David Olney,"The Colorado Kid is moving at the speed of light 
Fast as fate he fades into the darkest heart of night 
And everything that went before is soon enough behind him
Except the visions in his head that serve only to remind him 
Of other days and other nights and other arms that held him 
Of longing looks and loving sighs and other lies she'd tell him 
La la la la la la 

Was it love or was it pure obsession 
Come on, Kid, make your confession 
Then you can make your getaway 
Tell it straight or you'll wind up in a tangle 
Are those the lights of Durango
Or just the light of another day 

The Colorado Kid is moving at the speed of death 
Slow and hard and painful as the laboring of his breath 
Alamosa, Purgatory, up to Colorado Springs 
Higher always higher til the blood inside him sings 
Of other rooms and cheap perfume and the sweet smell of her sweat 
Of all the nights that went before he knows he can't forget

Luther's bleeding from a hole in his side
I don't believe he'll make it through 
Ruby cradles his head and she starts to cry

I've always been a gangster's girl
Don't die and leave me alone in the world
""Shut up,"" says John Dillinger

Under his arm a .38

Mistreated and misunderstood

Who pulled on the trigger and heard only a click
Who stood on the edge and took a deep breath
Who drank all the poison and waited for death

And the Suicide Kid slowly got old

Where does it go when its all spent and gone
When you've downed your last shot and sung
your last song
His wild-haired companions, he's out drunk them all
Now the willowy women won't answer his call
They won't answer his call, they won't come to his bed
The nights last forever for the Suicide Kid

His handsthey tremble, his voice cracks and breaks

David Osborne,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1998
David Osborne,"Growin' up you don't see the writing on the wall.
Passin' by, movin' straight ahead you knew it all.
But maybe sometime if you feel the pain,
you'll find you're all alone; everything has changed.

Play the game; you know you can't quit until it's won.
Soldier of only you can do what must be done.
You know, in some ways you're a lot like me.
You're just a prisoner, and you're tryin' to break free.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

Burning up; don't know just how far that I can go.
Soon be home; only just a few miles down the road.
And I can make it, I know I can.
You broke the boy in me, but you won't break the man.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

I can climb the highest mountain, cross the widest sea.
I can feel St. Elmo's fire burning in me, burning in me.
Just once in his life a man has his time.
And my time is now; I'm comin' alive.

I can see a new horizon underneath the blazing sky.
I'll be where the eagle's flying higher and higher.
Gonna be your man in motion.
All I need is a pair of wheels.
Take me where the future's lying: St. Elmo's fire.

David Osborne,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

And if she's beside me I know I need never care

Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay

Whose end must now wait

When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said it's harder now we're far away
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight",Ships,2006

I remember when
You couldn't wait to love me
Used to hate to leave me
Now after lovin' me late at night

When it's good for you, babe
And you're feeling alright

Well, you just roll over
And turn out the light
And you don't bring me flowers anymore

It used to be so natural (used to be)
To talk about forever
But used-to-bes don't count anymore
They just lay on the floor 'til we sweep them away

Baby, I remember
All the things you taught me

I learned how to laugh
And I learned how to cry

Well, I learned how to love
And I learned how to lie

So you'd think I could learn
How to tell you goodbye

That sly come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare

What good would common sense for it do

'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although, I know, it's strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me
My heart says yes indeed in me
Proceed with what you're leading me to

It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando

And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow

Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show

I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,

And someone way down here loses someone dear.

Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.

Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.

Que en nuestra cama se quedo

Cayendo al dulce abismo que pretendes esconder

Sé que si te pierdo perderé la esencia misma
De mi ser no sé que voy hacer

Me equivoque de nuevo
Y pago un alto precio por mi gran error
Me arriesgo con mi atrevimiento a perder tu amor
Y por mis actos hoy yo gano dolor

Me equivoque de nuevo
Vencido esta mi orgullo con esta lección
Prove del mismo amargo de mi cruel traición
Y si te pierdo nada soy

Perdón amor, no creas que es fácil rendirse
A esta realidad decir te quiero
Aunque no creas siempre te he de amar

Irónico que todo tenga este final y ahora
Sé que si te pierdo perderé la esencia misma
De mi ser no sé que voy hacer

Me equivoque de nuevo
Y pago un alto precio por mi gran error
Me arriesgo con mi atrevimiento a perder tu amor
Y por mis actos hoy yo gano dolor

Me equivoque de nuevo
Vencido esta mi orgullo con esta lección
Prove del mismo amargo de mi cruel traición
Y si te pierdo nada soy, nada soy

(Me equivoque de nuevo y si te pierdo nada soy)
Me equivoque de nuevo y pido perdón
Por haberte hecho llorar por herirte sin razón

(Me equivoque de nuevo y si te pierdo nada soy)
Y ahora no sé que voy hacer
No quiero y no puedo perderte

(Me equivoque de nuevo y si te pierdo nada soy)
Si te pierdo nada soy por no ver lo que he tenido
Por estúpido que soy

(Me equivoque de nuevo y si te pierdo nada soy)
Y si en un cuerpo encendido encontré una
Aventura pasajera eso no quiere decir que no te quiera

(Me equivoque de nuevo y si te pierdo nada soy)
Hoy he podido comprobar que quizás
Quien más te quiere es quien más te hace llorar

(Me equivoque de nuevo y si te pierdo nada soy)
Lo acepto, te prometí falle pero quiero
Que sepas que siempre te amaré

",Me Equivoque de Nuevo,1992
David Pabon,"Fue en esta misma casa, donde yo te hice mujer
Sobre sabanas de seda corría tú desnudes
Frente de mil espejos, tu cuerpo sin ciclón
Dejando entre sus reflejos, la semblanza del amor

Y ahora tengo ganas
De volver a andar tu cuerpo
Porque me hace falta
Besar tus labios, rozar tus pechos
Subir hasta la cima de tu cuerpo

Y ahora tengo ganas
De volverte amar de nuevo
Porque me hace falta
Besar tus labios rozar tus pechos
Subir hasta la cima de tu cuerpo

Sobre esta alfombra de sueños
Tus prendas se durmieron
Y por tu labios sedientos
Brotaron los te quieros

Aun conservo en mis manos
La ternura de tu piel
Que acaricie con locura
Desbordándome en tu ser

Y ahora tengo ganas
Unir tu cuerpo al mío, con amor de piel a piel
Y ahora tengo ganas
Vida te mostrare lo que es querer

Y ahora tengo ganas
Nuestros cuerpos se unirán
Por este amor que no se acaba

Y ahora tengo ganas
De susurros tus labios me repitan que me aman
Y ahora tengo ganas
Tengo ganas de que sientas como la primera vez

Y ahora tengo ganas
Que vivamos del amor cada mañana
Y ahora tengo ganas
Recorrer tu cuerpo entero con ansias
Y salvajemente

Y ahora tengo ganas
Pasa el tiempo y quiero
Amarte aprovechemos este instante

Y ahora tengo ganas
Vida has de mi cuerpo tu refugio
Y ahora tengo ganas
Para confesarte que tu amor
Y tú ternura me hace falta

Y ahora tengo ganas
Decir que has sido tú la única dueña de mi alma
Y ahora tengo ganas
Del placer estas ansias de amarte
Y al fin desbordarme en tu piel

Y ahora tengo ganas
Ya cansado y agotado descansar sobre tu cuerpo
Y ahora tengo ganas
Ahora tengo ganas de sentirte un poco más
Y ahora tengo ganas pero sabes de qué tengo ganas

Voy a borrar de mi mente
Y mi alma todo rastro de amor
Si te vas a marchar procura no volver

Pues construiré una barrera de orgullo
Para tu insensatez, combatiré tu crueldad
Ya no me vas a engañar procuraré
No volver a vivir el frio de tu invierno

Alma de hielo porque fuiste granizo
Y escarcha con mi amor de fuego
Alma de hielo porque el frio

De tu desamor se congelo mi sueño
Y aquellas noches que fueron
De pasión hoy son puro invierno

Si te vas a marchar no pienses
Que esta vez me quedaré como un tonto
Vencido guardando mi fe

Si te vas a marchar me espera lo peor
Voy a borrar de mi mente
Y mi alma todo rastro de amor
Ya no me vas a engañar procuraré
No volver a vivir el frio de tu invierno

Alma de hielo porque fuiste granizo
Y escarcha con mi amor de fuego
Alma de hielo porque el frio

De tu desamor se congelo mi sueño
Y aquellas noches que fueron
De pasión hoy son puro invierno

Puro invierno
(Por el frio de tu desamor alma de hielo)
No vuelvas porque fuiste tan cruel
Y tan fría conmigo pagarás lo sufrido
No quiero más regaños pues voy
A recuperar todo el tiempo que ha perdido

Alma de hielo fría como
El viento no quiero estar contigo
Voy a borrarte de mi mente
Y estoy decidido a vivir sin tu amor

La pasión que tú me dabas se acabo
Y yo sigo ardiendo en fuego
Alma de hielo trataré de no vivir el frio
De tu invierno de tu invierno

The cowboy's name was Jingo
And he heard that there was trouble
So in a blaze of glory
He rode out of the west
No one was ever certain
What it was that he was sayin'
But they loved it when he told them
They were better than the rest

But you don't have to pray to a little tin god
Step out of the way for a little tin god
You might hate the system, hate the job
But you never have to get down on your knees
You don't have to holler, please, please
No, you never have to get down on your knees
For a little tin god

Throw down a rope from heaven
And lead the flock to water
The man in the middle would have you think
That you have no other choice
But to wander in the wilderness
Of all the upturned faces
If you stop and listen long enough
You will hear your own small voice

But you don't have to pray to a little tin god
Step out of the way for a little tin god
You might fear the reaper, fear the rod
But you never have to get down on your knees
You don't have to holler, please, please
No, you never have to get down on your knees
Never have to holler, please, please
You never have to get down on your knees

Dressed all in black
Went down to the station
And he never came back
They found his clothing
Scattered somewhere down the track
And he won't be down on Wall Street in the morning

As years unfurl
One day he crossed some line
And he was too much in this world

And took a walk down through the park
The leaves were falling around me
The groaning city in the gathering dark
On some solitary rock
A desperate lover left his mark,
Baby, I've changed, please come back

What the head makes cloudy
The heart makes very clear
The days were so much brighter
In the time when she was here
I know there's somebody, somewhere
Make these dark clouds disappear

David Palmer,"The scattered pages of a book by the sea 
Held by the sand, washed by the waves 
A shadow forms cast by a cloud
Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them, effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""

And soon they dared to laugh

Aerial views of the ground, 
Freudian slumber empty of sound.

Meant to be seen but not heard,

There's always been ethel:
Jacob, wake up! you've got to tidy your room now.
And then mister lewis:
Isn't it time that he was out on his own? 
Over the garden wall, two little lovebirds - cuckoo to you!
Keep them mowing blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

Sunday night, mr farmer called, said:
Listen son, you're wasting your time; there's a future for you
In the fire escape trade. come up to town!
But I remebered a voice from the past;
Gambling only pays when you're winning
- I had to thank old miss mort for schooling a failure.
Keep them mowing blades sharp...

I know what I like, and I like what I know;
Getting better in your wardrobe, stepping one beyond your show.

David Palmer,"Mad Man Moon
Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon.",Mad Man Moon,1987

I should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins
And now I don't care

That I can't touch

A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""

Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

David Phelps,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.

With all our hearts we praise His holy name.

To a fallen race
Through Christ the savior of all men
There's hope in saving grace

The love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

It's power is eternal, eternal
It's glory is supernal, supernal
When all this earth shall pass away
There'll always be the love of God

It goes beneath the deepest stain
That sin could ever leave
Redeeming souls to live again
Who will on Christ believe, will believe

Oh, the love of God is greater far
Than gold or silver ever could afford
It reaches past the highest star
And covers all the world

His glory is supernal, supernal

And asked me what it was about.

He was born of a virgin one holy night
In the little town of Bethlehem.
Angels gathered round him underneath the stars
Singing praises to the great I Am.
He walked on the water, healed the lame and made the blind to see again.
And for the first time here on earth we learned that God could be a friend.
And though he never ever did a single thing wrong
The angry crowd chose him. And then he walked down the road
And died on the cross and that was the end of the beginning.

""That's not a new book that's a bible,"" he said, ""and I've heard it all before.
I've tried religion- its shame and guilt and I don't need it anymore.
It's superstition, made up tales and just to help the weak to survive.""
""Let me read it again,"" I said, ""listen closely, 'cause this is gonna change your life.

I said, ""I'll read it again but this time there's more,

I think it was mid December
I rolled out of bed to take on another day
Of bills to pay

Oh, I should have noticed the signs
When reading the morning headlines
But all I could see was what mattered then and there
Like what to wear

Before I left for work I kissed my wife and kids goodbye
Then fumbling for my keys, my eyes were drawn up to the sky
Sky is blackened, could it be a thunderstorm, it looks like rain
Wind is twirling, clouds are swirling, could it be a hurricane?

I pulled myself together
And said it was just the weather
Cause I never dreamed it could be my final day
To live that way

Yeah, I went to church on Sundays
Believed there was only one way
But when it began, I guess I was in denial
For just a while

So I turned on the radio to occupy my mind
But as I drove to work my thoughts were pulled back to the sky
Sky is blackened, could it be a thunderstorm, it looks like rain
Wind is twirling, clouds are swirling, could it be a hurricane?

Then suddenly, the sun eclipsed and tremors struck the ground
As brilliant light had split the sky I heard the trumpet sound

Tomorrow is a chasm of uncertainty
But, I will go there, if you'll go with me

[Chorus]
Gentle Savior, lead me on
Let Your Spirit light the way
Gentle Savior, lead me on
Hold me close and keep me safe
Lead me on, gentle Savior

Why can't I walk away from my regrets
And why is forgiveness so hard to accept
My past surrounds me like a house I can't afford
But You say, ""Come with me, don't live there anymore""

[Chorus]

And when I reach the valley, every soul must journey through
I'll remember then how well You know the way
I'll put my hand in Your hand like a trusting child would do
And say

[Chorus]",Gentle Savior,2005
David Phelps,"He was the kind of man that good men talk about
The way he showed his faith was how he lived it out
His hands were rough and calloused and his shoes were old and torn
And the lines that framed his smile were lines so well and deep and worn
So what will be remembered of what he left behind?
What will stand the test of time?

How to love your neighbor, how to love your wife
Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

He worked a second job to make the ends all meet
But somehow managed to always be there for me
Showed me how to listen, how to stand for what is right
And taught me all the things that really matter in this life

How to love your neighbor, how to love your wife
Wrap your arms around your children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

And as I look into the eyes of my daughters and my sons
I hope I've stood for something that they'll want to carry on
Cause life is far too short not to finally realize
That it's long enough to make a difference in someone?s life

So I'm gonna love my neighbor and I'm gonna love my wife
Wrap my arms around my children and pray with them each night
Thank God for all the good things 'cause the good things are enough
The ties that bind and leave behind a legacy of love

Oh, the ties that bind and leave behind a legacy
A legacy of love, of love",Legacy of Love,2005
David Phelps,"Watching the surf cover up my toes
Breathing the salt air from the coast
Ten years old with my eyes pressed closed
Life is a church

Remembering first love’s tender kiss
Mourning the loss of my innocence
The bittersweet taste of it on my lips
Life is a church

These are the sacraments
This is the altar, love is the spirit
Making the blue planet turn
Life is a church

Watching my baby being born
Written all over you, pain and joy
Holding your hand, it’s a little boy

Watching my baby being born
Written all over you, pain and joy
Holding your hand, it’s a little boy

Ashes to ashes, earth to earth
The preacher throws in the first handful of dirt
My little boy asks me, “Does goodbye always hurt?”

Watching my baby being born
Written all over you, pain and joy
Holding your hand, it’s a little boy

David Phelps,"Heavenly Father
We heard Your precious name

It stands to reason that a name is just a word
It can be easily forgotten as soon as it is heard
But one name was spoken before the world's first day
And it will be here when everything that is has passed away

Delivered from the lips of God
To Mary's ears on angel wings
Jesus, Jesus

The word that came to life for us
The song that all creation sings
Jesus, oh, Jesus

The proudest nations of the earth
Have come and gone
But Jesus, the name lives on

When I'm awakened by a terrifying dream
And desperation reaches up and clutches me
When I am so afraid that I don't even know what to pray
I simply speak it and I feel it and it chases fear away

Delivered from the lips of God
To Mary's ears on angel wings
Jesus, sweet Jesus

The word that came to life for us
The song that all creation sings
Jesus, oh, Jesus

The proudest nations of the earth
Have come and gone

The ever breaking dawn
When time itself is over

David Phelps,"No mountains ever moved one inch at my command
No waters parted at my feet
I'm just a witness to the wonders God can do
Through willing instruments like me

And when my best seems insignificant and frail
He offers me the source of strength that cannot fail

Power, straight from the Father
Making me stronger
And I know it's not my own
Power, straight from the Father
Love like no other, I've ever known

There are days when circumstances spin out of control
In ways I just can't understand
It's as if the best of my intentions have conspired
To reveal how powerless I am

But there is One whose voice alone
Brings me peace
And when on high, he hears my cry
He gives to me

This holy energy can save, redeem and heal
Like electricity, it flows through me and I can feel",Power,2005

David Phelps,"She gently falls asleep
Her head is laid upon my lap
The highway sings a lonesome lullaby

My daughter here beside me
My little boy is in my backseat
Outlined by the headlights from behind
And I ask the Lord to freeze us here in time
As my son stretches out his hand to mine

Silhouette sent from heaven
Paint a portrait of eternal things
A fleeting glimpse like a vapor
Bring remembrance of what is holy
Clean and pure, unblemished and unflawed
Come to me, sweet visions of God

""I made this for you, daddy""

For Peter Pan, Pinocchio, and Pooh
They cling to every word until the end
Then they close their eyes and drift to Never land

Like a shadow in the night
A familiar face I fail to recognize
But he is there in pigtails
Peek-a-boo and piggyback rides

",If That Isn't Love,2007
David Phelps,"It was 1983
On a snowy Christmas Eve
With my family
And the Christmas tree and lights

That was when it all went wrong
Someone turned the TV on
And the evening news
Broadcast the blues that night

But my dad saw my despair
He put his arm around me there
He said, ""Let me tell you this
It's my lifelong Christmas wish""
He said

If everyone believed
Oh, what a happy place it would be
We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family
If everyone believed

Now the years have come and gone
But that Christmas wish lives on
It's the thing I pray
When the holidays draw near

You see the news is still real sad
And people, they're both good and bad
But you just might cope
If you spread some hope and cheer

So as we sing 'Joy To The Earth'
And celebrate the Savior's birth
I pull my family close to me
And tell them how the world could be

If everyone believed
Oh, what a happy place it would be
We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family
If everyone believed

And I know that it's easy to say
Oh, but I'm gonna dream it anyway
'Cause a dream becomes a song
And when we sing it we pass it on

If everyone believed
Oh, what a happy place it would be
We'd live in peace on earth as a great big family
If everyone believed, if everyone believed

",If Everyone Believed,2007
David Phelps,"In the beginning there was the Word
Pure love was spoken to reach every man
They stopped and listened but all that they heard
Was language that they could not understand
No joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He left behind His throne of pure light
Gave up His crown that we might be free
He chose a manger that Bethlehem night
And reaching through time and space He saw me
With no joy, no peace, no hope in sight

So He came with starlight and love in His eyes
No regal welcome for His infant cries
There have been many babies to become a king
But only one King became a baby

He could have chosen to break through the sky
With anthem and angel wing
But He knew we'd understand a baby's cry
And learn love from a servant King

The word that's been echoing through space
Becomes a child tonight

Light to make all the wrong things right
Light to show everyone the way
Light to shine where a virgin lay

Angel wings are everywhere
Light so bright it?s blinding
Shepherds shake with fright

A warmth begins to flood the hill
Fear not, peace to you good will
Comes to earth tonight

Light to show everyone the way
Light to shine where a virgin lay

Light will be so bright
It will shine through the darkest night
Send down Your holy light
