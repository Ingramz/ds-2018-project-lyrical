Blair,"And the band strikes up a funky jazz.. 
All aboard the funk boat that I'm about to start to sailing now 
All your riggers and all your party triggers. Everybody's in a funky blow out 
You now I said cell phone just around the corner from the portobello road 
Downtown double you ten and my best baby baby to what you don't told 
I've got bottles of beer, and a deck or two, all my friends are now comin in 
Lucy Ann Juice looking good girl, So all aboard and let the party begin. 
I'm on a mike a mickey, dance a mickey, funk a mickey step foaming out till the break of dawn 
So get up the ball it's time for ball foaming out till the morning comes...and I said: 
Have fun, Go mad - Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad - Guilty of what I do 
Have fun, Go mad - Come on 
Have fun, Livin in the city 
Have fun, Go mad - Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad - Guilty of what I do 
Have fun, Go mad - So come on 
Have fun, Livin in the city 
Come along, come along, come along everybody everybody in the place to be 
It's cabetabi cabetabi on a microphone petit on the funky base tree 
Now betterabee you gotta discswap, trend swap, friends wap just what you gotta do 
I said : Ladies and gentlemen, this one goes out to yo and I said: 
Have fun, Go mad - Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad - Guilty of what I do 
Have fun, Go mad - Come on 
Have fun, Livin in the city 
Have fun, Go mad - Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad - Guilty of what I do 
Have fun, Go mad 
Have fun, Livin in the city 
Here we go: 
Sax Solo 
So let it be, let it be my, my turn to dance 
So makin' a space up on the floor. Cause I really want to take this chance 
Bust a move Trust a move Just a move you now I've got no shame. 
I want to Do it again, I want to do it again, I want to do do do do do do do it again 
I like it I like it I like it (sing it baby) Oh my God, I think I like it a lot 
When you shake your funky tush in front of me like you know what you're giving like you know what you've got. 
Cause it's a high proud, cool crowd, hang out clubhouse, Just where I want to be. I said: 
Lord have mercy, lord have mercy on me..Yes 
Have fun, Go mad - Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad - Guilty of what I do 
Have fun, Go mad - Come on 
Have fun, Livin in the city 
Have fun, Go mad - Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad - Guilty of what I do 
Have fun, Go mad - So come on

Have fun, Go mad, Do what I say 
Have fun, Go mad

That I love you

Blair Casdin,"I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And then I peeped through the crack
And I looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you",I Thought About You,2008

I can almost remember
The funny faces
That time you told me
That you were going to be marrying soon

And jet, I thought
The only lonely place was on the moon

Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh

Jet, was your father as bold
As a Sergeant Major?
Oh, how come he told you
That you hardly old enough yet?

And Jet, I thought the Major
Was a Lady Suffragette

Jet, ooh, Jet, ooh

Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me
Ah, mater, much later

Of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll
Go for a ride in the sky

Was a little Lady Suffragette

Blair Doucette,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean
The unborn grass lies waiting
For its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers
That will bloom again in spring

When I was young my heart was young then too
Anything that it would tell me
That's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's
The thing thing that I can't win

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you

The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break me heart again
Should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you
When you go
To that land of gentle breezes
Where the peaceful waters flow

Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would
Fly away with you",Snowbird,2014
Blair Joyce,"When you're in love
Some things you take for granted
Until someone pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart
How do I trade 
The best I had for less
Without giving up
Should I slowly accept that we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me
Where do we go from here
Why's my heart filled with so much fear
When all that you are
Is all I need and more

There's no winning bets
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

'Cause letting go
More and so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

So tell me

Gonna tell my friends how glad I am to see them
When I get home I'm going be satisfied

I'll have me a harp of gold just like david's

Blair Resika,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,
Blair St. Clair,"It's not like you knew me

Got too good at painting the dream

Now it's time to go alone.
And I, I just can't seem to let go.
I don't want to be on my own.
Everyone that I see, 
Every song that I hear,
Just reminds me of you.
Do you do the same thing?
Do you think about me 
every night when you're sleeping?

CHORUS:
Cause I just can't seem to let go.
No matter how hard I try.
You're just part of who I am.
I don't want to lose you to someone new 
Now that I'm no longer there.
I know I must move ahead.
But I can't let go.

Remember all those nights,
When it was just me and you;
On a downtown rooftop
Looking out at a view.
We'd drive around for hours, 
Just so we could be alone.
Now I'm on that road on my own.
What's it like where you are?
Do you feel very far from the place you call home?
Do you miss me at all?
Won't you give me a call?
Let me know what you're thinking.

CHORUS

I won't even think of you 
With anyone but me.
But that's not fair,
I have to let you be.
As long as you promise not to fade,
Fade away.

Blaison Maiven,"Worn out of racks, growin up fast
Dreamin of Jack, late nights on the ave
Bumpin Outkast, let’s take em back to the past
Let’s take em back to the past

As a fetus I had the genes of a genius
One of a kind, hand stitched like Nemetes
No leaders, pleading that God need us
Existent was non-existent, the Lord dreamed it
In the belly of it all, I just wanted to play ball
Blow like napalm, every nigga around had the vision of Ray Charles
My best friend was best friends with er and all
Getting ready for school, watching Cartoon Network
Mama said turn the TV off and get dressed first
Navy blue uniform, pants and dress shirt
6th grade, plotting how to triple my net worth
Life’s a bitch but they never did warn us
Early mornings, going to class, see my friends on the corners
Moralists, gold chains for ornaments
Watch niggas go from part 1 to the choralists

If you’ve seen what I’ve seen you’d know how I feel
And then you’d kiss the world, we lightin on the mill
Past old reminisce, going on top
Feet to the ground, your head to the sky

[Chorus]
If I had a dollar and a dream in the winds I’ll fly away
Me against the world, only when the life came by today
Sometimes all day I’ve been forgot, getting away
I close my eyes and see myself so far away

Now they’re feeling the destiny’s in my ball court
In there playing with my team and we all for it
Rookie of the year, dominant sophomore
I’m just tryna improve myself, evolve more
Come into contact with women of all sorts
When it come to greatness I never fall short
Picture me flying down with you in a Panamera,
That’s a Panameric, counting bread like dinero
If I could, I wouldn’t sleep on my mama coach
Lake Falls, get a crib as big as Obama house
Quick to find a route, every girl tonight dialing out
Black car, no limit to my amount, yo
Wise beyond years, like I read poems
Life changed but my mom made me do songs
Never was ashamed, couldn’t tell me I never will be ‘cause I’m still me

If you’ve seen what I’ve seen you’d know how I feel
And then you’d kiss the world, we lightin on the mill
Past old reminisce, going on top
Feet to the ground, your head to the sky

Fear for your life from prejudice and stereotype

It's killers in the mist who share pipes and wear tights
There's healers in the mist who bear light and wear white
There's Jesus in the mist, there's demons in the mist
There's even them rowdy 'Gorillas In The Mist'
Why ya minds so milli, see'mon brethren don't be silly
Ghetto red hot and chilly, and the burnin' inner cities
Ya best might sta', miner 'a flash ya light'a
Mind the 'S' or one night snipers gon' dim out ya life, cha'!

Can't have a ol' man
Man how could he put up wit ya?
Everybody jumpin' in the picture tryna get ya
When it comes to bad bitches, you official

I know you keep somebody comin' wit yo fine ass
Too fine to be for just somebody wit yo fine ass
Masterpiece, you got some body wit yo fine ass
Wit yo fine ass, wit yo fine ass

Rock, rock, rockin' like a fine ass

Come back to my other hoes, I say her sex was so-so
No offense, low pros
Glide when I slide
Y'all better recognize, don't be surprised that I blow mo'
Killa than a little, when I hit her tell her ride by
No clothes, she just come and go like a drive by
I ain't lyin'
I ain't know that that was yo ol' lady, no
Fuck and dive, you better eat and its all gravy bowl
Ducked off, way low
Polish up on 40 toes and they do whatever I say so
Must I say mo?
10'4 big fine ass, she already know
She only fuck wit ballas, I can't ball her that's just how it go
If you can't get my night right, I can get ya life right
In and out of trouble, box of rubbers is the night life
Tosses I may think twice, cause she might bite
To the room and to the bed first, then I go head first

Can you think and still be fine at the same time?
When its time to float, hop in can I rock ya boat?
When I'm down, can you hold me down or let me go?
Let me know your attitude is actually my one rule
Ooh ooh you is just way too fine for one dude
Buyin' clothes, matchin' shoes, girl that's all you like to do
She got her own money so that's what she go the right to do

And I got the use, and you got the need
Hold on fuck all that Romeo shit, man who got the weed?

Big fine ass, she'll make you beg her please
Done bout damn near everything, well I get that for free

Take you to paradise, go on a vacation

Then I lick ya body back up, take ya to the ground

But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

Blake,"I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

Well, it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you

I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?

But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a god above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah

",Hallelujah,2007
Blake,"Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question

I think I've found my best friend

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

Maybe it's intuition
But some things you just don't question

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

There's just no rhyme or reason
Only this sense of completion

And in your eyes
I see the missing pieces
I'm searching for
I think I've found my way home

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy
But I believe

I knew I loved you before I met you
I think I dreamed you into life
I knew I loved you before I met you
I have been waiting all my life

A thousand angels dance around you
I am complete now that I've found you

Blake,"In the bleak midwinter frost wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron water like a stone
Snow had fallen snow on snow snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter long ago

Our God heaven cannot hold him nor earth sustain
Heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ

Angels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But his mother only in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kiss

What can I give him poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man I would do my part
Yet what I can I give him give my heart

Blake,"And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the countenance divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among those dark Satanic mills?

Bring me my bow of burning gold
Bring me my arrows of desire
Bring me my spear! Oh, clouds unfold!

A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break
And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen

And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
So I would choose to be with you

You led me on 'cause all your songs, were stuck onto my heart.
Why don't you finish what you start?

I don't wanna' change like that.
People crying for old days.
I don't wanna' change that way.

Before, you had to sing your songs, there was nothing else you could do.
Well, I know all about it, 'cause I do it too.
I waited and waited and waited and waited for you to return again.

If you didn't mean it, why'd you write it? It will always be unrequited.
If I had a bullet, I would bite it.

You can't come back that many times, there's no such thing as a dull roar.

Every girl I slam they call, I told em call me back
Haters got backhanded, because they were always talking smack
Instigators chit chat, and were known for spreading rumors

I use to be a virgin, now I have menage tois

Went from hood to all good, shh playing a game like huh brah
Backyard nickel and dime that, now boys be moving birds
Use to carry my knife special, now it's gats and smoking sherm
Use to mix at house parties, freestyling to Whodini
Now I'm signing rappers to paid in full, eating shrimp and fetichini
Boy I use to ride big wheels, while wearing them Chuck Taylors
Now it's Jordans, Air Macs, even pink-green gators
Use to be sneaking in Lover's Land, or at the drive-in movies
Now it's Tinsel Town or Motel 6, where this hoe can do me
Use to watch freestyle the man, or Rap City on BET
Now I star in sitcoms, movies and got my own video show on t.v., what

[Redd]
Should of seen it I was right there, when a problem jumped off
Rounds got dumped off, leaving niggas bumped off
Always trying to get the hook up, leaving your girl shook up
Women breaking my pager, phone line you can't look up
We had ice on us, merchandise on us
Busting at other hoods, when they had a price on us
Listening to flow tapes, people saying rewind it
Pulling out my piece, and bystanders get blinded
From winter to summer time, there wasn't no leaving our block
When the laws made it hot, we was freezing our block
Man we got enough money, to make my neck look pretty
Cause we done made enough money, to make my check look pretty
Rapping at talent shows, saying phrase too frequent though
Niggas talk about Fasachi, we roll that in Regal though
Seein niggas Redd capping on, the comedy bout my chaperone
My dress code is casual, but all of a sudden I'm valuable

There's so much that I can loose
But it don't matter long as I got you, long as I got you

My heart beats so fast I just can't keep up
You pull on me like a drug
I'll never go cold cause I don't wanna give you up.
Some people search their whole life to find what I found now
I'm out of time gotta tell you what's on my mind
And pray that it's enough

In the morning when I wake up
You're the first thing that I think of
I can make it through anything
Knowing that I've got you
In the morning when I wake up
Nothing else can take the place of you
And I know this sounds crazy, but

[Chorus]

Think about it
We fit like a puzzle, no missing pieces
Never doubt it
I'm writin' a story and you're my thesis
Look around it
Its happenin' natural as can be
Since I found it
I'm not gonna let it go, let it go

As long, long as I got you now
As I got you now",I Got U,2007
Blake Lewis,"[Verse 1]
I saw your picture in the paper today girl
All 'a sudden it hit me
You're someone that should know me
Possibly drive me crazy
In the pages and all over the magazine covers
People gossip about you and your long list of lovers
You don't girl you don't know about me
But you will, that's for sure
Let's start with an introduction!

[Chorus]
I want you to know my name
Take a little sip with some conversation
It's driving me insane
What's it gonna take for some motivation?

I want you to know my name
Girl, I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain?
I'll show you that I'm not the same
I swear to you I'm not the same, oooh

[Verse 2]
I've got this question I keep asking myself
Are you my cure for addiction?
Are you love's definition?
Or just bad for my health?
There's only one way to find out
What we need is each other
Make our own little story
We could start it today

[Chorus]

I want you to know my name
Girl, I just ain't got no shame
Them other guys causing you pain?
I'll show you that I'm not the same

This is how it's gonna look, just like this
You and me pretty girl, and a future of bliss
You want a dog, white fence, maybe a couple of kids?
Anything, I'm-a bring ya, just make me a list

(I promise I can make you smile)
This is how it's gonna look, just like this

I know I was not getting my message across
I know you can't stand it when that's how I talk
When I summon a duel or when I brandish a thought
I was wrong to turn honesty against you
And sure, some of them could use a good talk

But babe, don't tell all our friends about me
Please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

I could sleep on the couch if you want me to
Or I can be a good dog and just sit with you
Do whatever it is that you ask me to do
'Til you forgive me and I forgive you
Yeah, I know you got the beating but I caught a feeling
Frankly, I don't know what else I can confess to you
Lovers may quarrel and spar sometimes, 

But babe, don't tell all our friends about me
Please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
I know I fucked up, I know I fucked up, 
But please, baby, don't tell all our friends about me

You said you just needed some time to adjust
It's been 48 hours and 3 weeks and 2 months
Hummingbirds hum and workerbees buzz
You put too much confidence in the people you trust
All the enemies and friends, they'll all tend to judge 
And I'll write songs that'll help me deal with issues, 
And sure, some people may hear too much 

But babe, they don't tell all our friends about us
You know it makes them talk too much
So please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

Please, baby, don't tell our friends about me

Just like you I'm wonderin' what I'm doin' here
Just like you I'm wonderin' what's goin' on

I have seen you standin' in the smoky haze
And I know that you're gonna be mine

Born under a bad sign.
I've been down since I began to crawl.

Life goes on glorious evening of nodding and jumping starts 
I need to make a personal dance party.

Not the best time for lyrics I suppose keep writing, keep dreaming. 

Nope, can't be awake and dream, drift in and out, in and out. 

Eye motions in out heat lightning, 
Scares us both the only two people awake at this fucking hour 
I won't remember this in the morning at least I wrote this all down 
Please pick the right song the one 
That keeps the eyes wide creepy yes, 
Creepy the idea of control controlling death 
With alertness when is the fucking sun coming up. 

Then it all changes, same scenery 
But sun involved shouldn't be much different

Exploding worlds surrounding imaginations?

I'm never expecting this... glance towards the mirror, imagination toward the stars... the endless desire for my one and only true love... this will never change i predict.... but i do get tired.. if only they knew what push we have given... for this music... this happiness that keeps us all sane... cold nights seem to force questions, not wanting to accept these thoughts... I have worked and will keep working... to keep the tradition of my one true motive in life... music... my only love... once building drum boxes and pretending to be the artist... I guess I'm here but it feels weird... so weird... to know how weird all this can be... it seems to never work out like I planned... like we planned.

Blake Richardson,"From the simple idea of Change Blindness, our minds are not as they seem.
An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge.
A brain function we'll never admit as defeat,
A constant determination to find truths
To find reason, to find comfort.
An unspoken religion in being the all-dominant
This is what we call a brain.

This step will allow the universe to run it's course.
We have a short ticket and a lot of it is in hiding
So lets take in what we can for now.
Just like here on Earth(a notion we do comprehend)
Hide what ""others"" can't understand. 
The universe is the biggest threat
Overachiever that commands attention. 
Brute force of hysterical reasoning's
There will always be a Marfa.

Close one eye. 
Step to the side.

As humans we could never be content with knowing all, 
Yet we can't be content with the fact that our brains will never know.
A mental surgery
A never ending journey, a technological drawback.
Pushing us further from our natural minds.
Even things created by other humans should be 
Considered in the experiment of an entire species understanding.

A magicians pure joy
A mind bend for the common folk
Follow the straight line 
(A full house watching what we can't see)
The ultimate deceiver

Blake Richardson,"The headless lover of three...
An unspeakable affair...

The lady on the hill creates a glorious departure from her everyday life.
Constant swelling of the ankles...A pleasant cry for help...
She began to unfold her story.
A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder.

A perfect crime, that soon lived on. A different life it had to develop...
Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas it grew onto its own.
A much needed surrender.
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed like a lifeless neck...

From a monster to a beauty in quick months...
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom.
It decided it should take advantage of this idea.
(the average traveler hints at this every single day of their lives)

A mixture of plantings soon took course in its body...
A spectacle non-the-less,
Walking proud through life letting its branches guide the way.
A path which seemed to be covered in sunshine...

It must be human, for its qualities seem
To outdo even the grandest occupant of the town...
This started to catch the attention of the un-branched...
It had never experienced an affection of this kind...

A wonderful and frightening new obstacle in its life.
Years went by as it finally found true love...
The love of others...three to be exact.
Letting them into every secret...feeding from every branch...
Every part used for their lives...
(This went on with no negative scents 'til the 5th year came around...)

It noticed its walking seemed more staggered than normal.
The breeze didn't flow like it used to...
The heart seemed to pound slower and slower...
What caused this?
It seen was noticed that these three had torn every branch, every single stem...
Torn to its last life...
How hadn't it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings...
It didn't think anything could go this wrong.

""Comfort...""

It thought life was constant
Happiness if constant happiness was all that was given out.
(It left its entire existence up to these three lovers)
Hints and all, they did as they pleased...
And not it's starting to wilt away.

Progress becomes easy due to this social situation
Unfortunate turn of events collapse this idea of the childish thought

No judgement towards one another

All as one market this change

Goddamn television god corrupt me
Separate us separate us separate us separate us
Groups of difference seem to comfort what we once didn't think of

For it will be torn down you will be torn down

gotta draw 'em in...gotta keep 'em on their toes...

don't show them how you truly are...who would want honesty...
who would want a group of people that one can relate with.
We need worship, we need devotion...
becoming gods from the image that is thrown...

thrown out in their everyday lives to comfort...
it's not a musical journey anymore...
they chose Camilla and we stood by her the entire time...
monotonous expression...a forced replica of a tired sound...

puppets for a greed-driven carnival...
the same charade as the passing years...
force me out there. Don't give them a chance.
They want to be fed...fed a simple replication of past greatness.

Personal happiness is what we strive to achieve...
so you can love or hate...it won't change a thing for us.)

And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild

Get my lantern get my gun

And I sent out a letter to my cousin up in Tennessee
And he brought down a blue tick hound she was pretty as she could be
Well they pinned her up in the swamplands
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take ol' Red for his evenin' runs
I'd just drop him off and wait

Even in a crowd she's hard to miss
There ain't a man breathing air
Who wouldn't stop and stare
And the best part is..

[Chrous:]

She doesn't know how bad we want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me

She'll close her eyes when the music plays
And the way she sways
Really rocks the room
She doesn't mean to get things stirred
It's just a thing in her that was born to move

She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it

And that's what's a gettin' to me

I'm in love a lot

Like everything the girl has got

Blake Shelton,"There's a house that's a little run down
This city ain't never found
It's miles and miles from a paved road
That's where we grew up
Seven children raised on love
When life gets hard that's where we go

[Chorus]
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home

Daddy built it with his own two hands
Overlooking his grandpa's land
Now through the years a lot has changed
But driving up this gravel road
I get that feeling in my soul
I thank God some things still remain

Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood

That's what I call
That's what I call home

The world can't touch me anymore

Blake Shelton,"The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonesome road
But here I go
Climbin' back behind the wheel
Fifty feet of chrome and steel
And a load they need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

Sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me where I like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pullin' ribbons from your hair
And your kiss
Girl, that's what I miss
Still I drive these horses
Through the rain and snow
This high speed rodeo's all I know

I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind

And I'll ride
Until I'm back in your arms again

And I'll ride

Blake Shelton,"Funny thing about dreamers
When the dream is in their sights
Just to get where they're going
They leave a lot of good things behind

Guess you could call me a dreamer
I've seen it all come true
So I smile when I need to look happy
Do all the things they tell me to

I'm a big self-made man
And a fool who can't understand

I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name

If I could only make the future
An extension of my past
I'd take these broken memories
And make those moments last

Now that my ship has come
I wonder what have I done

I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name

I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you

By the two lane
In the blazing sun
Or pouring rain
Sells tomatoes

Of his pickup truck
Reads the Bible line for line

Some homemade wine
That's who he is
And what he does
He's just like us

A crippled hand
A casualty of Vietnam

And hung 'em 'round

Just as sure as the river flows

Step right up when someone needs a friend

A fire wiped out the house and barn
The whole town showed up
To build 'em back again, all right

Blake Shelton,"John Roy was a boy I knew
Since he was 3 and I was two
Grew up two little houses down from me
The only bad apples on our family tree
Kinda ripened and rottened in our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny
Well now I was smart but I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild with no inhibition
Was about like mixin' fire and gasoline
And he'd say

Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world

Long around our tenth year
We found two airplane tickets to the hell outta here
Got scholarships to some small town school in Texas
We learned to drink Sangrias 'til the dawn's early light
Eat eggs Ranchero's and throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls we were majorin' in the rodeo
Aw but my favorite memory of school that fall
Was the night John Roy came runnin' down in the hall
Wearin' nothing but cowboy boots and a big sombrero
And he was yellin'

Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world

And I say we had a little change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney got busted in Japan
And I said we got waylaid when we set foot on Mexican soil
You see the borderman guard with a fu manchu mustach
Kinda stumbled on John's pocketful of American cash
He said ""doin' a little funny business in Mexico Amigo""
But all I could think about was savin' my own tail
When he metioned 10 years in a Mexican jail
So I pointed at John Roy and said
It's all his, now please let me go, I mean it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed, when you said

Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly

A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity 
A circle an eternal loop 
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 

Before we were babies 
There's nothing we recall and when we go back 
Will it fade to black and that's all 
Or could we be destined for some other time and place 
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased
Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 

Will we see Jesus comin' as the sunshine fills the night 
Or when we die will we fly into the light 
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away 
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe 
Someday we'll know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it

I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry

Right now that's all two distant

At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon

Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear

I was the youngest child, so I got by with more.
I guess she was tired by the time I came along, she'd laugh until she cried.
I could do no wrong. She would always save me, because I was her baby.

I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the bayou,
I drove a truck in Birmingham.
Turned 21 in Cincinnati, I called home to mom and daddy,
I said your boy is now a man.
She said I don't care if your 80, you'll always be my baby.

She loved that photograph of our whole family,
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see.
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job.
And Ronny with his to kids, how 'bout that wife he's got.
And that one's kind of crazy, but that one's my baby.

I got a call in Alabama said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly.
'Cause your mama really needs you, and says shes gotta see you,
She might not make it through the night.
The whole way I drove 80 so she could see her baby.

She looked like she'd been sleepin'
And my family had been weeping by the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been take and my heart it was breakin'
I never got to say goodbye,
I softly kissed that lady and cried just like a baby.",The Baby,2003

Enchanted by the beauty that I'd seen

He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone

Some beach
Somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growing and warm breezes blowing
I picture myself right there
On some beach, somewhere

I circled the parking lot trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of no where a Mercedes Benz
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in

Some beach
Somewhere
There's no where to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot Senoritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach
Somewhere

I sat in that waiting room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You're not gonna feel a thing we'll give you some Novocaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two
Then he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drilling before I was numb

Some beach
Somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evenin' air
On some beach
Somewhere
On some beach, somewhere",Some Beach,2004
Blake Shelton,"I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time 
Honey you are so persuasive 
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time

'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind 

I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does

But, you can't handle what's on my mind
No, you can't handle what's on my mind.",What's on My Mind,2004
Blake Shelton,"Tommy's daddy kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough to do what daddy's did.
It didn't take us long to go from drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house I stumbled just a bit.
You play it cool but its no use,
Dad ain't no fool and that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.

We lost daddy in 1999
I took care of everybody's pain, except for mine,
Then one night my wife took my face in her hands
She said, â??I think its time you cry for your old man.""
You play it cool but its no use
She ain't no fool and that's the truth
and my tear drops finally fell,
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught

I could probably do more to help my fellow man,
But life gets busy and I hope God understands
Someday when I get time, I'll do more than my share,
Funny how I'm thinkin' it sittin' in my easy chair,
You play it cool but its no use,
God ain't no fool and that's the truth,
And he won't let you fool yourself,
You can't hide one single thought,

Blake Shelton,"My brother said that I was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child, so I got by with more
I guess she was tired by the time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried, I could do no wrong
She would always save me because I was her baby

I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham, turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy, I said, ""Your boy is now a man""
She said, ""I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby""

She loved that photograph of our whole family
She'd always point us out for all her friend's to see
That's Greg, he's doing great, he really loves his job
And Ronnie with his two kids, how 'bout that wife he's got
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby

I got a call in Alabama, said, ""Come on home to Louisiana""
And come as fast as you can fly 'cause your momma really needs you
And says she's got to see you, she might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80 so she could see her baby

She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin'
By the time that I got to her side and I knew that she'd been taken
And my heart it was breakin', I never got to say goodbye
I softly kissed that lady and cried just like a baby",The Baby [DVD],2004
Blake Shelton,"Girl, when I look at you
You look through me

Blake Shelton,"This old Buick's like a needle on a compass
Pointed due west
I remember her smile like June sunflowers
And the look of her body as she slipped out of that dress
God, I'm such a mess
Never a mornin' person, but that girl's still in bed
The sheets are tanglin', her little arm is danglin'
The last dream from her pretty head
I told her I was leavin'
She didn't believe the words I said

[Chorus:]
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again

She'll put on her makeup and drink from her tea cup
Glance at that silver frame
See, I took our picture and then it'll hit her
She'll cry out with pain
Maybe, whisper my name

[Chorus]

No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'

Back there, again

Now, don't blame her mama for makin' me promise
Don't come around here, no more
She said, ""Maybe your life's gone to hell
But, that's a tour of duty she didn't sign up for""

When you can't save yourself, you save somebody else
Maybe that's how you survive
I'm runnin' away so she don't have to see
A life in slow-motion suicide
You throw in the towel, they call you a coward
Tell ya fight, don't cut and run
I ain't no hero, but the truth is I know
It's the bravest thing I've ever done
The hardest part is knowing what we could have
Should have become

Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with a new guy

I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye

I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her!

That I don't care

Almost ten
I should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in
Knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind

Oh, but I just kept on driving back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way when...

[Chorus]

When I got home, the light was blinkin' on that old machine

And, I miss you! Give me a ring""

Named for how I feel.
Yeah I could be the mayor down there,
And say welcome to Sorryville.
It won't be on a map nowhere,
You might say that it doesn't exist,
But if you make enough wrong turns
It'd be hard to miss.

There ought to be a bridge somewhere
They could dedicate to me.
I'd probably come to the ceremony
With a can of gasoline
Walk on over to the other side
And there I'd light a match
And sit and stare through the smoke and the flames
Wonderin' how I'm ever gonna get back.

Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back,
But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack.
I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be
It ain't easy bein' me.

Ought to be a side show act for freaks like me
Yeah I could be the star of the show
With my name on the marquee.
In a room with a big red button that says ""Do Not Touch,""
And twice a day I'd mash it down
And you could watch me self-destruct.

Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?

And time, time's taking way too long
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone

[Chorus]
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears
Are a hundred miles from here

I, I told her I had to go
And now I know what I didn't know
And this road could lead me back to your door
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more

[Chorus]",100 Miles,2008
Blake Shelton,"[Blake]
Well the moon just came over the tree tops
And the whipper wheel started to sing
So I slipped down the hill
Got into the still
And drank til my ears started to ring

I followed a trail to through the hollow
To a shack back in the woods
Its my eighteenth birthday
Honey come out and play
Its time that we got to no good

[Chorus: Both]
Now I ain't afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I'm a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Come lay down on my bare skin rug

[Miranda]
My dress is torn up and tattered
My daddy left a long time ago
And my hair just hangs down
I never made it to town
Momma said that's where bad people go

But me and my sister been talkin'
Shes eighteen one year older than me
She laid down with a man
I want to understand what she says
I'll never believe

Now I need a woman

Blake Shelton,"Cat Diesel Power cap pulled down low
Makin that bacon, row by row
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA
It's from choppin' cotton, cuttin' corn and slingin' that hay
Been heavy liftin' since the crack of dawn
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He wears an old felt hat on his head
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands
Drivin' cattle, ropin' steers and burnin' his brand
There ain't no lettin' up all day long
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong

Yea behind every good man, there's a woman
She's the one thing that keeps him goin', keeps him goin'

She's up in the mornin' yawnin' with that coffee pot on

Blake Shelton,"You were just some one
Some friend of mine said take her out
An' have yourselves a good time
To be honest I was far from over a broken heart
You were the furthest thing from my mind
And it didn't seem to matter to you
When I looked away when we were introduced

[Chorus]
Cause you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
And I slowly started comin' around
Now here I am

To tell the truth I did my best to tell myself
Hey don't forget the last time
And I stood there in disbelief
That how easily you got to me with your eyes
You reached across the table and you took my hand
I knew I was in trouble right there and then

Am I getting to you baby?

Baby's kicked back in the front seat
Got her bare fit hanging out the window

We take a trip down memory lane
Dirt on the truck, no chance of rain
My third generation farming friends all pray that its on the way
And if it don't show up, we'll be alright
Because folks round here wouldn't take a million
For a different life

[Chorus]
Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on sundays
I wont ever get too far away
From Home sweet home

Pull down to the cane bridge
Park in the ditch
Folks and poles are lined up
A little kid holds a stringer up
Got a mess of fish
I drive away with a smile on my face

By God's amazing grace

And I get drunk on you
I lose control and then
And here I go again

I'm falling for you even though I know you're only playing with my heart

I'll just hold on
I'll just hold on
Until you're gone

Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind

Has come and gone away
In Paris and Rome
But I wanna go home

Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you?
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another airplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
This was not your dream
But you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away
In even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
And I wanna go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it ain’t right
So if he won't call, she'll survive
And if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head and cry

From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should've told you before

She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she doesn't know which way to move
Oh no

She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
If she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart

Won't by the same dear if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling (blue, blue)
That's when those blue memories start calling (blue, blue)
You'll be doin' alright with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas

But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas",Blue Christmas,2012

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train

Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks

For me to come home

The pies are in the oven

When you're in town

Putting up with that prick of an owner's son
Making me some hillbilly pay

Working right through lunch, busting my hump
Helping his daddy stay rich
So when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
I told that little son of a bitch

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me son
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Hey I've been breaking my butt but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Yea I've been dragging home almost every night
'Bout the time that you're going out
Wearing something way too short and tight
Leaving me and the dog on a couch

Yea, now word's getting round you've been sneaking downtown
Dancing way too risky
Well I got a few dirty dance moves too
And a cute little one finger wave

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me hun
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Well I've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Here it comes

Hey I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me hun
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer

Hey I've been busting my ass, you don't care about that
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey but lucky for me you can easily see
I still got a finger that works

Oh yea
Woo!
Yes I do
Look at that thing
You know you're number one, baby",I Still Got a Finger,2013
Blake Shelton,"Think I'll grab a bottle of Patron
When I get off work on my way home
Fill that hot tub full of bubble bath, kick back, relax

We're both needing what I've got in mind
What I got in mind, that's me and you into me and you
Can't wait to get you all alone yea

Lay low, stay home and stay high
Stay up, make love, all night
I wanna run my fingers over every single inch of you
Take my time, taking it slow

We'll let our kisses do the talking girl
Take each other to another world
Feel like we're a million miles from here
Somewhere out there, without going anywhere at all

You're starin' my heart straight in the eye

Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine

I wish I could tear it to pieces
And I've tried with all of my might
But somehow I can't find courage

She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be

So we talked awhile
'Til she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know

I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you

And you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

Well I wasn't surprised
Still it hit me kinda hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart

I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone I've done some praying
Some searching for myself

And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you

And you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone

But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me

I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you

But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun

Looking for my place under the sun

Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss

How to make her momma let you have her til midnight

And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl

How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet

And I would count down every mile

It was old Thomas Conley on the radio
It punched me in the gut, man, it rattled my soul

Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word

Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song

While hip-hop, rap, and rock were cool
I was in my basement getting schooled
On George and Keith and Vernon and Alabama
I was learning bout those neon lights
Wasted days and wasted nights
And honky-tonks from Texas to Montana
And when my fingers found the fret board
I close my eyes and sing
I swear that beat up guitar only played one thing

And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting

She might have been a fallen angel
Nah, I didn't care at all
I never thought a prayer could be answered
With a whispered, sweet southern drawl
Even now when I close my eyes
I see her silhouette dance on the river
The way we spent those endless nights
That's the way I could spend forever

Blake Shelton,"Ever since you left me I've been ridin' 'round
Crankin' up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears I don't know how
Much more missin' you I can take
I pray pray prayed, for a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle
It’s got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

I take a shot of 'I don't care what you doing now'
Chase that one with a cold 'Screw you'
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of 'Someone new'
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar bar bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart heart heart

There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle
It’s got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

When we were together
I thought life was set forever
Even though I knew better that the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn gets kissed
By the daybreak got down on my knees and I
Prayed, prayed, prayed, for a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time

There’s a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain’t all that bright, but even though it’s subtle
It’s got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double

Tryin' to remember what number we are
String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

I need a shock straight to my heart
No one would want to be in my shoes right now, oh

I don't reach for the bottle of whisky
Straight on the rocks

Po-po-popping the pills
Cause if I want the pain to go away
In a second make it fade
You're the only thing that will
You're my medicine, medicine
My medicine, medicine
My medicine

You know you're an expert at complicating things
That's how I'm wired, believe me it's no fun
But you make the war seem like such an easy game
Keeps me and my arguments come under
Down in the trenches, you are the white flag
Make me surrender
Want you so bad
Baby don't stop what you started
Don't ever be done, oh

I always throw the bottle of whisky

And a smile can hide all the pain

There was peace unknown
I set out to get you
With a fine tooth comb

You do something to me
That I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain

Needs no conversation

I can't live without you
If the love was gone
Everything is nothing
If you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us
And we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

Baby, I will hurt you never

Blanca,"This isn't easy
For me to admit
I got a fire inside and some words I know I can't keep in
I see faith turning
Into a show
Of Sundays and sermons
And words getting caught in the flow

Oh, but we got real pain and real fears
Thirsting for the drying of our real tears
It's not satisfying anymore
Ain't it true that the veil was torn

I don't need no stained glass
To be washed in His blood
I don't need no perfect, put together pretty words
To be enough, no
I want Jesus and His real love
Something that I crave deep inside of my bones
So you can leave your religion at home

To keep all the rules
Now I know it's about what He's already done

Blanche McAllister,"Faith is the substance of things hoped for,
The evidence of things not seen.
It lives beyond the senses,
You can't see it, you can't feel it, you just have it.
I'm in a season that requires GREAT faith.
Fear and doubt are all around me.
But I'm standing on what The Word says.
Faith is the evidence of what I can't see.
And when people doubt the things that I do.
When I do what God told me to...
For the rest of my life I'm not making sense,
I'm making faith.

Don't know how I'm gonna get there.
But I walk by faith Don't know how I'm gonna live there.
But the just shall live by faith Can't even see the purpose that's waiting there.
But I trust the author of my faith.
And when people ask how I'm gonna do,
When I do what God told me to
For the rest of my life I'm not making sense,
I'm making faith.

By faith we proclaim (understand).
By The Word the worlds were framed
For that which is seen
Hath not come from what appears in the scene
So don't try and convince when your path doesn't make sense
God is the author and finisher of your faith
Stay In Faith You may not know how your gonna get there
But just walk by faith
You may not know how your gonna live there
But the just shall live by faith
You can't even see the purpose that's waiting there
But TRUST the author of your faith

And when people doubt the things that you do
When you do what God told you to... (tell them this)
For the rest of my life I'm not making sense, I'm making faith.","Not Making Sense, Making Faith",2011

All you fag niggaz gotta move on
(get the fuck out the way)
I kick up dust for real, nigga
fuck this rap shit nigga
you want to see me, see me nigga
Nigga I'm the nigga to see
Punk ass mutha-fucka
Don't get your pockets pulled nigga

(check it out uh-uh)
Hold the fuck up nigga why you lookin so tough
You don't know that I'm an outlaw and I'll fuck you up
Punk nigga, the street change everyday,
But I'ma change a long will 'cause the streets where I lay
Nowadays it ain't about runnin your mouth
It's bout (gun cocked) and (gunshots); assed out
Turnin me out nigga, I turn the streets out
With this underground thug shit that killers come out
Where the gunz be at, where the money be at
I stand full, nothin but the uncut shit I'm hardcore
And ain't nothing changed since back in the day
Just new money frays and new hand grenades
When the war pops off I'ma knock the street lights off
y'all some paper back soldierz nigga you too soft
And killin in my raps I'm too real for that
But if I say I'ma do it, if you say you have too, prove it to me

[chorus]
It ain't nothin but a freshin to me
And if ya fuckin with me,
Then you can die if you want to nigga
And all my life I had issues with me
you try trippin with me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
The street made a slight killah for me
And if you soft too me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
You act tough
And you can die if you want to nigga
You in a rush
And you can die if you want to nigga

I'm a street nigga, check my background
I did a couple of driveby's with the fo-pound
And I was never ever scared to bust a couple of rounds
It's all in me, my whole family was raised wrong
Nigga, my whole team strong, buck buck, double glock dead wrong
And imitatin Pac nigga, you know you wrong
And runnin your mouth will get a gun in your house
There is money down south so I gotta take some
There is money on the west coast I gotta chase some
There is money on the east coast I gotta take some
So I bought me a gun, I'm bout to rob everyone
It's like a 2000 jack the rapper, fall down
Empty down your pockets nigga and pass it around
And what was you thinkin when Pac was around
He wasn't trainin Outlawz to burn shit down
I strategize for the dough dough, cock block with the fo-fo
send four more at the po-po, his whole ass like Zorro
it's real nigga so I'ma bleed for mine
with money on my mind I'ma get it, it's mines nigga

It ain't nothin but a freshin to me

And all my life I had issues with me

Blancmange,"I must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I''m certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I''m pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came

I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there''s no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I''ve done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I''m sure my life was well within it''s usual frame
The day before you came

I must have opened my front door at eight o''clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I''m sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There''s not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn''t see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It''s funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came

And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain

Life, Life ain't hard, but it ain't easy, damn sure ain't easy hey
Life, Life ain't hard, but it ain't easy, damn sure ain't easy hey

[Bad Azz]
The world built like a jail, Long Beach ain't nothing but a cell
Today's paper read, Four injured, Two killed that's real
Life ain't getting no longer, Let's get it popping here
Really though, Just like the song is
In life, it ain't nothing I fear
With young rapper got millionaires stealing my lyrics
That's the truth, In all of this essence
And what's a few Gs? Please when you're rich with more blessings
I don't trip, What comes around, goes around again
Like I own the car of the trunk that they found you in
And ain't no telling like Jack told Helen
They'll sell you a key, but not to open the door to heaven
You was talking to the judge, when it could have been the Reverend
Tell him, you should have been free, it could have been me
What would it have tooked for us to see that life ain't easy
Believe me

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
Life will throw you a job, know you've been robbed
And purposely leave you, stuck when you're down on your luck
Life will lock you in the cell, praying to heaven just to get out of hell
It seems to be to me it ain't no way out
Life will break a nigga, picking up the pieces, ain't the easiest
I wake up every day just knowing there some Gs to get the gang
Cop a few, watch out for the obstacles
 
Tripping off the politics
Wondering what the cops is doing and they just chilling there and lock me up
My homie was scared, he from them, and they just shot him up
He didn't die, but he cried through the stress
and that's a real hard way to learn a lesson
Yes, indeed it hurts to bleed
You've gotta be as strong as Hercules to deal with this
and don't get killed with this
Cause you know that'll hurt ya mothers heart
and where do we go after we done torn our earth apart singing

[Chorus]

[Bad Azz]
I'm just here, trying to maintain
I let the good times be the medicine for the pain cause life's a headache
I have you bed sick or even dead quick
Cause doctor said to think straight, you need you're head kicked
Left the hospital with stitches, walk and feel like its over like
What could be worse then the police pull us over
Resist the trip and ask the cops
Why you stopping us? Shouldn't you been looking for the trench coat mafia?
He say we look like the type to blast and get popular
Na, we love life more than that, and God's watchin us
It's hard enough for what's up, like for having nigga ? up
Living out his truck
And some times it hurts to live
Doing all this work to live, just to die
I hope my life is justified
I know I'm breathing for a reason, maybe even a purpose
So don't live like you're life is worthless

When I think about how you love me

Everyday is like a holiday
Something like Christmas Eve
My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

When are we gonna grow up
Why do I love you so much we so touched
Excited by the drama we like when it show up
The fighting don't slow up I light you like close ups

And I call you my Calamity Jane you like my fantasy
Love cause the same chemical reaction in the brain as insanity
Holidays drinking with your family passionate folks
Imagine if they had their own reality show actually no

Desires like fire quit playing or get burned
Or give it away on camera like Montana Fishburne
Our presence is a gift a gift is our present
Breakup text call her a bitch under my breath
And then the makeup sex she forgive me in a session
I know she love me she sending a mixed message though

My worst day is carefree
When I think about how you love me

You need a chick with some fire
I mean unless you want a wife cold as ice
Living life with the biggest debutante
Me and you we considered the upper echelon

The only one I come out my fitted for in a restaurant
You can get it huh remember I was taking your digits 
Same night I was making the visit
Make it the mission to make you cum 
When we done sometimes you hate to admit it

You a little numb from the toys
And love the noise that you make when you run from the boys
And comfort your man insane how we go so crazy with it
This the asylum so we call relationships committed

You ain't a bird I ain't them others guys that get lost in the name
You the butterfly and I'm the moth to your flame
Love is dying while the mothers crying
Big brother eying me imposing their reality to Shutter Island

Our love is like a Psycho or a trilogy the drama is killing me
I'm grown but the little boy is still in me
We discuss monogamy polygamy the odds of probability
Your momma ain't feeling me it stung like a killer bee

How far from the tree do the apple fall
The things I said was it how I felt was it the alcohol 
Or do I really hate her after all
I apologize for the statements that I made to her

First I swallowed my pride then I ate my words
I tried to pass it off acted like it was nothing
The fact is I was discovering my appetite for destruction
Everything else is bland once you tasted filet mignon
When I'm full I'm taking you home your a plate for later on
I'll eat it up or beat it up
Til your love runneth over yo I need a cup

Blaque,"It's so hard to lose the one you love
To finally have to say goodbye
You try to be strong but the pain keeps holdin' on
And all that you can do is cry
Deep within your heart you know it's time to move on
When the fairy tale that you once knew is gone

When the last tear drop falls
I'll still be holdin' on to all of our memories
And all of what used to be

When the last tear drop falls
I will stand tall
And know that you're here with me in my heart
When the last tear drop falls

So now I'm alone and life keeps movin' on
But my destination still unknown, oh yeah
Will there be a time when I'll fall in love again?
When I was meant to walk these streets alone
If there was just one wish I could be granted here tonight
It would be to have you right back by my side

When the last tear drop falls
I'll still be holdin' on to all of our memories
And all of what used to be

Now it's time for me to find my happiness again
And the emptiness from missin' you
Will never ever end, baby

I'll still be holdin' on to all of our memories
And all of what used to be",When the Last Teardrop Falls,1999

Blaque,"I didn't really want to be on your team
I just want to wear the uniform
That was enough for me
But somehow you stole the ball from my court
And you voiced a game one on one
That I didn't want to play

I never had a guy to play the whole game
They always seem to quit at halftime
Leave the rest to me
I never thought love should be that way
If you're down you should be down
Until the buzzer rings

And I can't go back down that road again
Knowing that it is another dead end
Although I really want to take this ride with you
I'm not sure what our destination is
And baby this is why

I can't trust myself 
'Cause everytime I get around you
I turn into someone else
I'm learning too much about you
You can't possibly
Be this perfect, see why
Anytime I get around you
I can't trust myself
Trust myself

When we are alone it drives me crazy
'Cause I hate the fact that I don't want your love
I find myself pushing you away
Then I turn around and I want you to stay
And I know it's kind of premature
But I just gotta be sure

And I can't go down that road again
Knowing that it is another dead end
Although I really want to take this ride with you

Remember the time you looked into my eyes
I never want to be with another guy
Everytime I think of how you make me feel
I know you're the one for me 
I never had someone to treat me like you do
I pinch myself I can't believe it's true
You're the one, you set me free
I'm falling in love and it's killing me

I can't trust myself

Master kept me as I repent

Shit I ain't choose to rhyme
Rhymin' chose me
So I hit the track runnin'
Like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now
But it's much improved
Yo' album droppin' this summer?
That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment
I put my mother on it
I said my momma
It seems as if
I love her don't it?
So buckle up, 'cause
It's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's
And my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk
Gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth
But ain't no joke inside
This is complicated
At least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million
Then I'll call it quits
But until that day
Y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw
You crank it 'cause
I just leap through you
What you need to do
Is just admit you love me
The South has
Always been Dirty
But now it's gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Though I am country
Don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin' bigger
With every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin'
Spittin' that booty chatter
Out here for two days and
Came with somethin'
That truly matters
On goes the saga
Of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah
If I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now
I hate it came to this
How else can I say it
I don't speak
No other languages
I'm fairly ripped now
So this the jimmy talkin'
You hear that beat don'tcha?
That's just Timmy talkin'
Go 'head throw dem bows
Fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us
Will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose
Ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just
Forget what we discussin'
This that new South
Take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin' legend
And this is gettin' ugly

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get
Ugly, ugly, ugly
In here
Huh, in here
It's gon' get ugly in here
Huh, in here
Huh, in here
Uh-oh

Now this thang is jumpin'
Ain't it somethin'?
What makes it special
This whole moment
Came from nothin'
Now you see it triples
I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets
Hatin' broads
Clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin' to live
You with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin' brave then
Better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin'
Then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet
I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law
They can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done
Nothin' less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions
I wanna see you whylin'
And if Bubba dies tonight
Know he was smilin'

Ugly-in here
Huh, in here

Oh Babe, is it true that your girl don't do the things I do?
Are you missin' this love I used to give to you? 
Had you comin' in the front door, leavin' out the back at night
Oh Babe, Oh Babe
Oh Babe, do you stay up all night thinkin' how I did you right?
Are you missin' all the ways I used to keep it tight? 
I'm the only one who knows all the freaky things you like

And she ain't got that junk in her trunk or that bump that you want
And that girl ain't got the moves like I do
She ain't got that boom like I do
And she don't move a room like I do
And she don't put that curl in your toes when she makes her body roll
And that girl don't work it slow like I do

Babe, is it true that one day you called her my name?
It was then that you knew that it didn't feel the same
Down deep in your mind got you bonin' me again
Oh Babe, Oh Babe
Babe, Don't pretend that your girls stuff is as good as mine
If it was then you wouldn't be callin' me all the time
This love is so good, I'm the first thing on your mind

Blaque Keyz,"We're six feet underground inside my bed
And all the little letters in my head
We're spelling suicide but not by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my back breaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

The only friend I had wore black and red
The darker instruments inside my head
We're playing suicide but not by choice, by choice
Was calling out for help, but heard no noise, no noise

Only the sound of my hands shaking
But ever since you and your arms saved me

I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore
I don't hold the weight of the world anymore

Don't hold the weight of the world
I don't hold the weight, I don't hold the weight

This the flow that helped me tip the scale
I'm stackin' chips like Chippendale's without the strippin'
Get the bailiff out 'cause Mr. Bellion's out the cell
We skip the bail and out the jail
We hit the trail, the route we took is hard to smell it out
So get to sniffin' equipped with the gift of spit
Like the lisp on the chick who played in the flick next to Spiderman

I'm brighter than LEDs on your TV
Keyz is sharp as a dagger
Who walks around with a swagger of Kenny G
When you see me, chill with the chatter
Got the skill of a master craftsman whose passion is rappin'
Snackin' on actors, so pass me a napkin
Chip on the shoulder, the kid is colder than both Dakotas
The winter soldier, assassin coming after your captain
For honor and every day, I'm getting stronger
No one will shock the world, got a buzz like a mini Blanka
When they apply the pressure, it's heavier than E. Honda
Got what it takes to be great, but can't hold this weight any longer",Weight of the World,2016
Blaskapelle Gloria,"I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

But tell me does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same
When she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low
The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand
I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all

Slashed her wrists, bored with life
Didn't succeed, thank the Lord
For small mercies 
Fighting back the tears, mother reads the note again
Sixteen candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame, it's always the same
She goes down on her knees and prays 
I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor
And when I die I expect to find Him laughing 
Girl of eighteen, fell in love with everything
Found new life in Jesus Christ
Hit by a car, ended up
On a life support machine 
Summer's day, as she passed away
Birds were singing in the summer sky
Then came the rain, and once again
A tear fell from her mother's eye

You'll prop your forehead on the sink

Cut it out you feel retarded take that scissors

Après mon passage au ter-feu il te reste plus grand chose à manger
J'roule un sdeh pour me percher, rejoindre l'étoile du berger
C'est plus des couilles que j'ai, eh non, c'est des gros œufs de Fabergé
J'suis overbooké, OK zoogataga
J'ai appris une chose chez Ruquier
C'est le mot rutabaga
J'rêve que d'pouvoir, et comme vous avez pu le voir
Bah le rap français c'est pas vraiment l'truc tah Audrey Pulvar
Mon point commun avec Natacha c'est mes chicos d'devant
Que moi-même sans mes 32 dents, j'leur faisais du rentre-dedans
Ouais, bien sur que l'avenir est inquiétant
Pour des barrettes ils nous mettent 8 ans
Wesh, monsieur le président, dites leur bien que
J'représente les 3arbis et les niggas
Moi j'suis plus riche qu'eux, donc pourquoi j'irai fouiller leurs caisses
En pleine crise, moi j'suis en plein dans les 30 glorieuses
Mais j'sais que ma liberté bah, fait pas grand chose à leur yeux
Demande à Lacrim quand j'étais à l'école
C'est pour gratter les remises de peine
Du dispatching au disque d'platine
De l'affiche de recherche à la fiche de paye
J'ai pété tous les barrages, mais je n'ai jamais été odieux
Comment idolâtrer la vache, quand l'univers est à Dieu
Dites leur bien que, m'en bat les couilles de leur baratin
Que la j'suis en promenade, 3ème tour, Rabta dans un bar à tinp'
Nique l'État, ces schmetats rêvent que de nous mettre dans la de-mer
J'vais m'branler et même cracher sur leur putain système de merde

Ils préfèrent s'acheter une Rafleuse que d'faire du kung-fu
La Mecque, j'suis de ceux qui se baisse et Allah yaafo
Je t'ai déjà dis, nous on cotise tous pour la retraite à Clairvaux
Ils nous mettent des peines de pédophile pour des histoires de barrettes
Autant vendre de la cocaïne butez-nous pour qu'on s'arrête
Les 3ineurs montre pas l’œil, dites leur de niquer leur mère les chouettes
Moi, m'occupe de la vodka, woogataga gardez la schweps
Hey, d'après mon entourage moi j'reste un brave, 
J'reste un vrai c'est pour ça qu'il m'encourage
Après la pluie, y'a pas le beau temps y'a l'orage
C'est vrai que les petits sont hardcore, on était pareil à leur âge
À deux sur un scooter on vivez que de vol à l'arrach'
Puis on a connu la crave-bi et on a vite tourné la page
J'me suis mis à couper des barrettes, ensuite à vendre des plaquettes
Puis d'la coke et des galettes, jusqu'à ce que les keufs nous arrêtent
Un jour j'étais dans le 19, l'lendemain un hessess fermait ma porte
Un soir j'étais avec une meuf, l'lendemain elle était avec mon pote

J'me suis acheté 3-4 t-shirt, j'ai dépensé ton salaire
J'me suis roulé un gros sdeh, puis j'ai repensé à la misère
A cet été, à cet hiver, quand on était au val-d'Isère
Au mitar tah la Santé, les promenades en camembert
Au mitar tah Fleury, j'revois les toilettes j'me dis beurk!
A les bâtards, comment ils ont pu me faire ça?
Ils me l'ont mise j'leur est remise woogata vice et versa

Ça sert à quoi de jouer le pirate, si t'enquilles pas à l'abordage
Ils dopent en dopant, co on t'laisse le dos en deux
On est nous-mêmes en (?) exorciste avec un joint d'beuh
Tous les soirs j'dégrise, nos combines se développent
Mais des fois les quis' débarquent et dans les comptes ça fait des flops
Du crime ouais y'a la crème, Sta-ive c'est du vécu
Mon gros, chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Pas de X que t’achètes avec alcool et abus
De plus, j'baise ces nabots qui croient contrôler la rue
Les yeux cernés au poste, menotté à des barreaux de chaise
J'rêve d'Îles Vierges m'en fumer avec des barreaux de chaises
La nuit j'dors mal, éternellement tourmenté
En pensant que j'vais prendre cher si les keufs arrivent à tout remonter
Ceux qui sèment le vent, récolte du ons dans le ventre
A-L, futur ex-braqueur reconverti dans la vente

J'aimerais partir tranquille, les pieds d'vant
Un monde de fils de pute, j'suis obligé de vendre
Ah bon? 
Ça suffit pas alors on braque sa mère
M’en voulais pas dans le rap y'a trop de Zehmel

La vie c'est speed même mon ombre veut me dépasser
Oh, le sky est classé, j'suis chaud
Menacé ne sert à rien, j't'envoie 2-3 balles l'affaire est classé
Ramassé du biff, voilà dans quoi j'me suis perdu
J'sais c'que c'est d'avoir la dalle, j'en connais ces vertus
Hyper dur, fréquentation malsaine
Chiale pas sur mon sort, tu sais qu'ici personne nous accepte
On connaît le respect, Les valeurs et les principes
T'es le plus grand des hommes si tu te lèves pour bosser à Rungis
Malheureusement pas mon cas, au fond de moi je les envies
Nos vies, c'est faire du biff, mais resté en vie
Donc faut marcher armé, puis avoir la trique
Aujourd'hui t'allume demain t'es matrixé
C'est la vie du western, la vie d'moi j'suis réel
La tranquillité frérot est bloqué dans mes rêves
Impossible de l'avoir, je ne prend jamais de rotte-ca
Mais Belek au feu le couz si tu mets trop de bois
Beaucoup de salopes font les voyous, wallah que c'est pas une fierté
Dit moi qui sera là le jour ou t'auras vraiment merdé
J'ai l'orgueil d'un bébé, je m'énerve et je pète tout
J'assume les conséquences khey dans mes bras je prend le mektoub
Oui j'aime pas les poulets et je ferais recette sans eux
Une impression même jaloux de ma mère à 700E
Ils m'inventent des vies, le mythe ils veulent casser
Hum j'en ai assez, les traquer, les chlasser
Quand j'allais tu revenais, dans ta tête ça ne rentre pas
Je le ferais tout les jours, je compte l'oseille me dérange pas
Bien sur qu'on s'est fait tout seul, je sais très bien que tu sais
J'ai braqué des bijouteries quand les autres allaient sucer
Sans t'manquer de respect, dans l'rap dit moi ce qui est facile
Frérot on viens de la rue c'est des filles faciles

J'ai roulé ma bosse, j'en ai marre d'bouffer d'la merde
Coup d'crosse la vie t'assommes pire qu'un joint d'herbe
Tout ce qu'on a on finit par l'perdre
Étoile de mer 10 000 kilomètres
Perdu sur la lune verte
J'sui tellement loin des ""je veux être""
Berad d'aatay j'allume un Jaabouq à la fenêtre
T'es dans l'paraitre moi j'vais disparaitre
Les kheys passent au dispatching, une mère qui pleure c'est la faute d'un traitre
Y'a plus que des bras cassés dis-moi à qui serrer les coudes?
Six pieds sous terre quand j'me ferais bouffer par l'doud
Noyer dans le doute, j'suis toujours dans le hood
Les yeux rouges, oui dead casa negra j'suis pas un l'blood
Passe moi des feuilles ce soir j'fume mes dernières illusions
Sers moi un verre que j'tourne cette tragédie en dérision

C'est clair gros qu'on peut tout perdre sur un coup d'ker-po

J'veux réussir, j'veux m'en sortir depuis que j'suis tout petit je chabarde
J'ai bicrave, j'ai fais plein d'conneries dont j'suis pas du tout fier
Comme les aller-retours à Fleury pour battre le fer faut du fer
Pour faire du flouze faut du flouze, des couilles et d'la gamberge
Surtout quand t'es seul contre tous y'a personne pour te tendre la perche

M'en bas les couilles de c'que tu penses, depuis ma tendre enfance
J'laisse la concurrence en transe lourde sera la sentence

Hier ils m'boycottaient maintenant ils veulent faire mes bacs

Approche j'te mets une claque de roumain tu vas rougir
Plus tu vas monter plus les rumeurs vont surgir
Personne ne se fie d'personne écoutes bien tout ce que j'vais te dire
Tout ce qui est autour de moi, j'vais te l'exploser
La j'pète les plombs j'ai retiré la goupille j'fais exploser
A ma droite les frères mus' débarque pour nous faire des rappels
Pas la quand j'suis (?) les appelle
En primaire j'te frappais ouai j'me prenais pour l'king
A 10 ans au comico voiture péta dans un parking
Le quartier c'est une plaque tournante, ça défouraille de partout
Dans mon escalier j'tombe sur un sac remplis d'billets j'garde tout
Assis sur un banc toute la journée sa bibi
Dans les bois ça fais bep-bep ou cric-cric bim bim!
Au collège, lycée voilà les (?) moi j'casse des dents
Avec (?) ou pas leurs uppercuts te rentre dedans
On sais que la police nous surveille mais elle ne sait pas tout
Les malins savent très bien que l'argent ne fait pas tout
On a des avocats mais ils n'arrangent pas tout
Les médecins sont la mais il ne soignent pas tout
Pas de chance cette nuit la juge s'est fait mal baisée
Donc forcément des chance d'être acquitté on baissées
T'es pressé, t'accélères risquer sont les raccourcis
Kazou dis leur que cette est pute est plus de soucis que d'surcis

Posé à la tess j'ai rien vu, rien entendu
J'ves-qui les histoires tendu
Des fois c'est tes potes qui t'enculent
Avec du recul
J'ai fini par devenir solitaire
Pour l'Etat on a pas les critères
Donc on a fini sur le ter
J'vois des pères, des mères qui travaillent dur pour ceux qu'ils aiment

Envoie la frappe de Ketama dédicace à Khadama
J'suis obligé d'faire du sale y'a toute la cité derrière moi
Y'en a qui braquait des tabacs nous on bicravait du taga
Ouai continuer à taguer nous on à pas l'temps on tabasse
On va t'laisser aux aguets dé-ter comme l'armée du Hamas
J'savais pas que sur ce banc ouais j'allais fumer des kamas
Toute l'année tu fais des phases poto, c'est pas comme a-ç
Dans l'arène j'ai toujours la faille, flow qui tire comme un Fa-mas
Nous on est comme des hommes, on va toujours à la chasse
Y'a du biff' et des liasses obligé on s'déplace

Désolé si ça dépasse
Dans ton bigo y'a les vrais et les boloss que t'effaces

We-wesh la racaille, les raclures la police en a ras-le-cul
Ma vie c'est un texte de rap remplit d'ratures
Nerveux l'sourire aux lèvres doté d'pouvoir céleste
J'ai perdu l'nord ma direction à moi c'est l'est
J'écris des textes de fou, beaucoup métaphorique

Rosny-sous-Bois, la Sambuy, les braquos, les sous-salles
Les sous-sols, les mouses, ceux qui moussent et qui s'débat ainsi qu'les douzes

C'est vraiment pas la mort mais c'qui s'en suit
J'aime quand ça va que dans un sens (Oui!)
Quand c'est classé sans suite
Moi j'ai ramé, ramené la merde à mes rents-pa
Et j'donne tout à mes frères marlich s'ils me le rendent pas
La justice on s'la fait nous même, I'm so Hood!
Un dialogue de sourd entre moi et ma bouteille d'Absolut
Me parle pas d'la gloire n'y même du sommet (Nan, nan, nan)
Pour l'instant j'me bas pour finir la semaine
Mais guette moi j'suis la j'rappe sale vas-y acquiesce
De nos jours tu peux rater l'grand amour si t'as pas d'caisse

Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too

Then your hood down with you

More clearly had you been given a chance?
So as you struggle to find the feel with your feet
Ask yourself, can you dance to my beat?

While we get high to a rhythm with spiritual appeal

The rhythm, the rhythm, the rhythm is our power section
The freedom we feel in our soul
We dance to learn those lessons

From the givers of those gifts
We're merely the terminals to which they have passed

As they Kneel beside my coffin family say their last goodbyes
But ita the faces of my babies got me trippin' thankin' god for breath
Expressions filled with pain has got me strappin' on the vest
And I know that I ain't living right I hang on borrowed time
And this life's gone leave them bastards cause they pops has got to grind
Little mouths have got to eat so I hug them hit the streets 
Spittin' time with them and money got me feelin' incomplete
And I ain't scared of any motherfucker fight the flames of hell
But a child without his dad has got me hiding in my shell 
Got me shikin' in my boots to see them face this world alone 
Are the strong enough to cope stuck in half a fuckin' home
As I lay them down to sleep its all on me their soul to keep 
And if I die before I wake I pray to 
God he's up there waitin'
With an army full of angels strapped with gats cause 
I'm defying
Since I first became o father only fear I have is dying

After all that I have ever done
And all that you will ever see for life 
Death beyond the grave
How will they remember me
I only fear the lost of my voice
When its gone 
The only noise is the pen 
I'm a writer by choice
I can cut my tongue clean off
And smoke myself toothless
I still be on the mic 
Spittin' shit they call ruthless
The truth is 
I go deaf dumb and blind in one ear
And be the dopes deaf dumb blind guy you ever hear
I ain't scared of dyin
Death I've been there
The pine box for many years
My return ain't bull ain't no reincarnation
Get lost in translation

On my knees
The fear has got me

Eyes open but I don't remember much
I try to focus but the light is bright as fuck
I go to sit up but I'm strapped and stuck
Stuck panic can't say nothin'
Like my jaw is wired shut
How the fuck did get to where I am is still a mystery
My memories not assistin' me
As I lay here in misery 
Literally hopin' some body would give me some kind of time
I'm I dead of alive 
Is this a dream or a sign
Is there a chance I can find my mind and rewind
But paint me behind blinds and find somethin'
Its like a game but nobody told me we were playin'
And the fact that I don't know if I'm alive and sane
And inside my brain only one thing remains
The fear of no knowing paralyzes all most everthin'
An second can be my last breath
And my best guess is nothin' with on memories left
I'm sorry

Kiss her neck, now she wet, we makin' love puddles

On the spread, on her bed at her momma's house

My backs shots got her shakin' like she been to Harlem
She wanna bring a friend, okay

My love is genuine, I hope yours is the same
And like genuine girl your whole life gon' change
I know Victoria got a secret hidden on the sheets
So come, come we can do it till we fall asleep

Come, come over here so I can break you off a lil' some
Put you in positions you ain't neva thought of
In between the sheets we can grind and bump
Make the bed thump until you

Just be freaky as you wanna be

Fold you up and put you legs where they ain't neva been

Come ride with me 'cause I'm feelin' you
Big how I like 'em, I 'm feelin' you tryna' touch somethin'
I'm just crazy, just, just wanna fuck somethin'

You know what it is with me or where you might be
As somebody sorts the sweep with strong pipe, besh

Smash it to the head board, makin' your head pop

Do you how I wanna and how you like, girl
I know it sound good because it's right, girl

You want me like I want you so baby, come and get some

(Verse 1)
I?m the greatest escape artist the hardest situation is getting free
From the terror that keeps confiding in me,
I got to be Better than Houdini and David Blaine
With no magician, No illusions, No subliminal, No hypnosis to your brain, I?m untrained
Children should not try this at home at all, I?m a free lance professional
And this is on my own I staged the whole bit
I drink and talk a little shit and see who got the balls to pull a strap
And really use it, That?s where the fun comes in
Cause after they pop me they got to hide my body
So no ones suspicious about who shoot me
It?s interesting me to see the means and the tactics and tape
To make sure that my death is tucked away nice and safe

Sunshine?s for suckers and queers
That?s what they told me when they rolled me in the carpet,
And through me over the bridge just like I was some garbage
Of course I was uncounsous not dead in the sense they thought I was
But a slug in your dome will get you caught up 'cause
I?m not invincible I could die a million times
Each time more painful than the first, Still I survive
Both hands are tide behind my back as I?m breathing dirty water
And my legs are been mauled to death by the sewer rats
I move erratically to make them work for there meal
I?m dislocating my shoulder?s I slip out just like banana peel
I?m close to drowning again
Ten minutes and countin me to them
Is my record so I feel it like I'm ahead
In points was the view from the west but it's all good
Best believe that your boy will be back to walk the neighborhood
In no time water logged and bullet ridden
They be like, ?I can?t believe that he did it, He really escaped.?

No stun, I'm runnin with some gangstas
Not no bitchass wangstas
But some real gangsta fed my legs into a woodchipper
But the blades got caught on my bones I woke up screaming
And noticed that my right foot and... leg was gone
My eye popped out the socket and dangling on the cheek
They must have strangled me to sleep 'cause I'm unable to speak
Must have screamed just inside of my head
'cause they still think that I'm dead
They usin a shovel to scrape away clumps of the red
From out the chipper they pop my legs out
So they can chop me up manual bag me up and throw me out
No sweat, give me a week and a roll of some duct tape
And a shovel to dig the rest of my body up and I'm straight

Better not to play the game than never to win at your turn 
Better to be on your own than trust a friend might betray 
Better not follow a dream they don't come true anyway 

Play to win not scared to lose 
Walk the path you choose 

Fortune favours the brave 
Risking it all again and again 
Fortune favours the brave 
Fall after fall they climb up again 

Ignore the doubt and the fear, traitors to all you believe

Ending is never as good as the start 
Nothing is ever as good as your dream 
Nothing is ever as bad as 

Psychological confusion 
Is caused by the inability 
To reconcile different elements 
In my own pesonality 

I'm feeling all the wrong things, I have become my own shadow 
If I could justify things, then I could believe in my life 

Who am I, what is me, losing my Identity. 
Who am I, what is me, Something's taking over.

I have wrestled with this nightmare, now I live inside a dream 
I'm going through a crisis, losing my identity 
How can I reconcile this 
Have I been living a lie 

Who am I, what is me, losing my Identity.

Nothing is ever as good as it seems 
Nothing is ever as good as your dreams 
The ending is never as good as the start

What doesn't kill you can make you feel stronger 
What makes you stronger gets you through each test 

Oh, god speed to you 

He looks to heaven and feels it surround him 
Unknown unknowable foreverness 
What lies at the end of this historic journey 
No one can know you just take your best guess 

Each thing he faces just seems so uncertain

Blaze Bayley,"What is the reason God blessed me with sight? 
And shows me these signs in the sky 
Where my observations are now leading me 
I am just so afraid to describe
My certainty
The center of the universe is the earth
The Holy Father has decreed
But I believe this heliocentric truth
Will they burn me for what I believe?

In holy flame be purified
In holy flame

How can all this be offensive to God?
Who created all that I see
How can I deny what I know to be real?
Will they burn me for what I believe?
In holy flame be purified

Injuring the holy faith with my blasphemy
I will face torment, and I will taste pain
I will be purified in holy flames
I pray for my salvation
Offending the Holy Church with my heresy
Before this court and before Holy God
I beg for mercy please forgive my sin
I pray for salvation
This fact cannot be disputed
The center of all creation is here
No debating and no discovery
Pray for my salvation
I abjure curse and detest all my errors
They are contrary to the Holy Scriptures
I recant for everything I have said
Pray for my salvation

In holy flames I'll be purified

Blaze Foley,"I almost felt you touching me just now
I wish I knew which way to turn and go
I feel so good and then, then I feel so bad
I wonder what I ought to do

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run
Another sinking sun and one more lonely night

The wind keeps blowing, somewhere, everyday
Tell me things get better, somewhere, up the way
Just dismal thinking on a dismal day
And sad songs for us to bare

If I could only fly
If we could only fly
If we could only fly
There'd be no more lonely nights

You know, sometimes, I write happy songs
Then some little thing goes wrong
I wish they all could make you smile

Coming home soon and I wanna stay
Maybe we can, somehow, get away
I wish you could come with me when I go again

If I could only fly, if I could only fly
I'd bid this place goodbye to come and be with you
But I can hardly stand and I got no where to run

This Jed Thumpman
Let me tell y'all a little story
About a muthafucka that I know named Blaze
Now everytime we roll up a joint
Muthafuckas always be talkin' about Blaze Blaze Blaze
Man fuck Blaze
This muthafucka act like he puttin' it down for the hood
Talkin' bout everybody know Blaze, big baller
I don't give a fuck
Dead muthafucka don't get no special treatment from me
Look at Sarie's son little Eric
You know that muthafucka down to wear a wheelchair
I hate that muthafucka
And I don't show him no special treatment
So Blaze can kiss my ass

I put in work for my hood
So fuck a 9 to 5
You can find me on the corner
Hustlin' on the grind
They call me Mr. Lump Lump
So when their heads hear the thunder and the bump bump
They come out runnin' like the kids to the ice cream man
Children I'm sorry it's Blaze in the loony van
Playin' Atari, and I gotta do a crime to loot and 8 ball
Semi automatic with a clip for the law
All I want to do is make money and smoke
Fuck hella bitches, and slang my dope
The law ain't good for a muthafuckin thang
But eatin' mad donuts, and gettin' all in the way
I been gone for more than a day, and some things changed
Some many died and some faded away
I represent the ghetto from Harlem to Pinewood
I ride for the hood, I put it down for the hood

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

I've been dead to the world for the last 11 years
My body's decomposing, I'm missin' part of my ear
Still gonna rock till the day I die again
Get up back from the dead, and ryde again
Walk again, talk thug shit, right
Empty mack clips, right
Keep it old school, want to see that bitch? Uh huh
When it's thugs in King's coats and Raider's caps
Killers, jerry curls, and baseball bats
Ready to die like everyday
I put it down like a muthafucka, everyday
I drink brew and smoke weed like, everyday
And we all trying to get paid but anyway
Killas don't talk, but this one do
Talk you out your wallet let the 45 blast you
Twice in the chest, once in the face
Plus the extra heater on the safe side in case
Your bitch is wack well she can catch one too
Cause if you're down with your hood
Then your hood down with you

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck
I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Psychopathic just like thugs
We ball, and we fight
And just like the freaks I come out every night
Holdin' down the sidewalk
Standin' amongst muthafuckas that's soon to be outlined in chalk
Sippin' on a cold ass 40 of OE
Live from the DET we OG
Pissy drunk always, we dead bumpin'
Stay thug with the throw away in the trunk
Bitch slapper, fuck a bitch rapper
Bitches were made for fuckin' but that's another chapter
Bitch you don't know me, don't approach me
Thinkin' that you're down with Blaze ya dead homie
G Blood imbedded in street blocks
That's why I put it down, and blast with many shots
Bullet holes in my chest, it's all good
Man I even died for my hood, muthafucka

I put it down for the hood
I ride for the hood
And all my muthafuckas is up to no good
Cause everybody in the hood is trying to come up
So gimme all of your money before you get your ass stuck

Do you want to know about the box
A casket with padlocks
Broken off the hinge, bitch, eat a cock
Buried in the earth then forgotten about
Feelin' good like a mothafucka first day out
Took air in my lungs, been awhile since I did so
Smoked me a blunt, fucked a hood rat ho
Kill a couple niggas, smack a couple bitches
Runnin' mothafuckas for the rips and they riches
Ain't shit changed but the month and year
Broke mothafuckas scrounging for squares and beers
Pigs scatter on the street when the dead man arise
Real muthafuckin' killas never gon' die

Break the hinge and rise up from the cold ground
I could be deamin', what the fuck is with my head
6 feet deep and I'm surrounded by the dead
I hear a noise, someone's cryin' my name
How should I react, am I just goin' insane?
All my thug niggas hold it down on the streets
And watch these muthafuckas on they grave robbin' spree
Froze in my box, hearin' people chatter up above
They sayin' can ya ""kick the do' up?"" I'm still stuck
I'm dead as shit, I know where I'm at now
Chillin' with the dead, one with the underground
So why these niggas out fuckin' with my grave?

Break through the door to unlock the mystery

Came to release me to His handles
First sacrifice over to the demon
That's why I'm a killa any season
Watch me clueless when I was alive
Happy with a muthafucka till the day I died
Now they callin' me back to walk with the dead
Anyone disagree catch a slug to the head

I can't fix my hair or check my clothes
I can't even see it if there's a booger hangin' out my nose

You can have em' come and bless the house
But if I get the chance, then ain't nobody gettin' out

Don't nobody care that I'm trapped in a pine box
Smooth with the buttoned up shirt and the dress socks
It's getting harder to breathe, hello, I'm dying
The air is getting thinner, I'm past the point of cryin'
Okay, the joke is over

Blaze Ya Dead Homie,"A motherfucker recognize a thug mashin' hard
Straight out the plot of my cemetery yard
Buried so long, nobody gave a shit
Blood and tears, embedded in my casket
Been surrounded, old folks everywhere
Smell of dry piss covered the air
When I heard the voices say arise from the grave
I quickly dug myself out and went to find the 12-gauge
Shotgun, double barrelled sawed off pump
Safety runs through the target if you test me
Psycho thug, mashin' outta control
Spent too many fuckin' years deep in a hole
But still I'm a killa, feindin' for the streets
Slangin' rocks on a 9 to 5 beat
All that change, now got maggots on my face
I'm back from the dead to give yo ass a taste 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 

The grave ain't no place to be
Too much like the penetentary
Locked away in concrete
I'm buried 6 feet
Guess so, so when you roam
You can find your way home
Cuffs tight around the wrist cause I was bustin' my chrome
Dark visions in the smog when I walk with the dead
Bad dreams in the night keep you shakin' in bed
Is it all in your head cause you're locked in a cage?
And clear your mind and get shanked and live the cemetery way 

I'm sittin' in the cemetery
I got a plan to kill a pig so I placed a phony call about a bitch I buried
Fuck a cell, I won't ever go back
I got you creasin' in my pocket like a folded up rap
I look in the back, a squad car pullin' up slow
I grabbed the pistol in the hand with the glove, and let it blow
Dashin' off like a thief in the night
To me it was right
I had to end his muthafuckin' life 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 

They can't keep a dead body locked down
In the ground
Of the pen
Came through the dirt, break free again
Leave my home of the grave, shared with the roaches
Back on the street, keep an eye on the vultures
Flip, my escape out the front gates
When the pigs check yo' friends, ain't no trace
Of a gangsta, I'm already out robbin' suckers
Pistol whippin' bitches, puttin' holes in motherfuckers
Act like you know, Psychopathic on the glock
And I gives no fuck when I'm mashin' up ya block
Empty out the chamber, so long to your family
Everybody history
Nothing left but memories
Friends start to cry and you're one with the earth
Ain't nobody cry for me, not even the church
My rebirth was greeted my a police chase
But I'm a thug motherfucker, I ain't catchin' a case

And beyond, recognize thug shit
Poundin' out the trunk bitch
Runnin' wit' a mother fuckin' hatchet
You haters, you suck dick was a thug, became a G
B to the L to the A, Z, E, still dead
Still don't give a fuck (give a fuck)
Sportin' all black kahkis with the mother fuckin' cuffs up
Smokin' Hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's
So a thug can get back on his feet
Mean muggin', steady thuggin'
And I'm tryin' to find the hoodrat's all about fuckin'
Still loked out
All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out
Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat ass ride
So I can drop the top, and parlay through the east side

Close your mouth, 'fore I put the barrel in
Dumpin' clips in yo ass is what I'm all about

Still slappin' off fake bitches with the Louiville
Beat a nigga' to the pavement, another bitch killed

We bring the thunder, givin' half the advantage
Fuck a style and a status
Half of y'all hummin' off a half ass deal
And got the nerve to tell a mother fucker 'keep it real'
We see through y'all fools, like cellophane on the square pack
You bite our shit, you can keep it, we don't want it back
We don't give a fuck, east side for life
And if you aint got heart, don't expect to have your shit tight
There aint no room for the hoe-hearted
We give a fuck where you at, or who you wit', or how you got started
Fuck you and everybody in yo clique
If you don't run wit' a hatchet, or claim the Psychopathic
I aint got time, to say no names
It's only eight rhymes, no holla', we been in the game
Besides fuck it, no speakin your name
You're just a bitch in the game

Mashin' in the bucket, sippin' on formeldahyde
Pockets lookin' sore so you know I gotta go
Pull a 2-11 on the neighborhood sto'
Mash on the gas, then I hit the pavement
Jumped out the bucket, headed straight in
Told the fuckin' clerk, put the money on the table
I'm a lunatic and my mind is unstable
He stuttered like a bitch
Tryin' to stop the hit
Shakin' like a twig
So you know I dumped the clip!
16 shots left his body on the flo'
Break the register, took the money, and I broke
Out the fuckin' back do' straight to the bucket
Put the money in, start the ride, and I punch it
Been from the hood, straight shots in the daylight
A normal Saturday for Blaze on the Eastside

Every Saturday afternoon!

I go robbin' these bitches and hoes!

Headed on back the crib to count my dough
Got 200 dollars and I'm lookin' for mo'
'cause I'm greedy and I'm back on the streets
Rollin' through the hood, to another store I creep
Now I'm on my feet 'cause the cops is on my tail
They want to see me go to jail with no bail
But they can't 'cause I'm rockin' a hoodie
A .45 cal. in my waist, so don't push me
Same Saturday, still hittin' licks for cash
Walked into Carlins, demanded all his stash
The sucka talked shit, but filled the bag up
Guess he thought his homie in the back was gonna tag him
Blaze, and he came out from the back room
Runnin' at a dead homie, Blaze, with a broom
I put two slugs in they muthafuckin' chest
Saturday afternoon, I laid them hoes to rest

Every Saturday afternoon!
(Who want to ride?!)
I go robbin' these bitches and hoes!
(Who want to ride?!)
Every Saturday afternoon!

I go robbin' these bitches and hoes!

Walk out the Carlin's, headed 'cross Grashiot
Cops rollin' by, my hoodie up, I'm mashin'
Went to count my cash, got 5 see-notes
Need 5 mo' for some weed to smoke
So I know I gotta rob a suburb store
In the suburbs they keep real cash in they drawer
Not like the ghetto just nickel and dime shit
Tired of walkin' so I car jacked a bitch
At the stoplight, I jumped in, told her get out
Call the cops, I know where you live, I'll put your lights out
Now I'm mashin' down the block
To the liquor spot
Found a purse, went through it in the parkin' lot
Whaddya know, the bitch had $600 dollars
The sun's still out so you know I'm gonna follow
Through with the plan, robbib' suckas for they cheddar
On Saturday, still a G, down to the letter

Every Saturday afternoon!

Back from the dead, tell my story on the front page

Squeeze the trigger off for criminals and axes

Goin' off on any bitch like that

That's pointed at yo' dome!
So give it up sucka
I'm down with Anybody, ""Drive-By, muthafucka!!""
He's a murderer, best keep yo' distance
Down with the Family, like Charles Manson
Crook throwaway is a mothafuckin' tool
Don't make me act a mothafuckin' fool
Me and you can go, toe to toe, maybe
On the corner, strapped, slangin' rocks daily
And turned weekly, monthly, and yearly
All the thugs in the hood represent me
'cause I'm down with a capital D-E-T
Bitch, you can't fuck with me!

Mashin' on you bitches, I think you get the point

""Yo, Anybody, tell em' where you from!""
Straight outta Detroit, the name is Anybody Killa
Every bitch I choke, yo, my rep gets bigga
I'm a thug muthafucka, and you know this
But you playa hatin' bitches better never ever show this
I don't give a fuck, I make my cheese
Middle finger in the air screamin' ""Fuck the police!""
Straight servin', we call a cop car, jack it
Run your donuts, your guns, and your badges
Shoot a muthafucka in a minute
For some hood rat pussy and go up in it
So if you at a show
In the front row
I'ma call you a bitch if yo' ass ain't a juggalo
Bitches gettin' mad, bitches ain't shit
Bitches and hoes can eat a muthafuckin' dick
I'm a crazy muthafucka from the streets
With them thug ass lyrics and them thug ass beats
Anybody controls the automatic
So any punk muthafucka that start static
With my dead homie, or by myself
Everytime, I pull the AK off the shelf
Security is maximum and that's a law
K-I-double-L-A, I'm raw
Bitch, I'm a muthafuckin' villan
Stand in my way and you're witnessin' the killin'
Creepin' up without a clue
And once you in the scope, yo' ass is through
So bitch, you better get a grip
'cause Anybody Killa's on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Detroit!

""J is his name and the boy's comin'...""
Straight outta Detroit!
Is it nut that I'm cut
Like whut?
And make your sister eat butt
Dangerous
A thug claimin' Southwest
I'll leave an axe hangin' outta yo' chest
See I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a muthafuckin' cop, I'ma stop him
Play it smart and ask for directions
And then shank him in the fuckin' midsection
To me, it's kinda funny, this Prozac
I don't know where the fuck I'm goin' or where the fuck I'm at
I'm just rollin', lookin' for some ecstasy
So I can get high and fuck this bitch next to me
Ruthless...is the label that's floppin'
But the hatchetman be choppin'
'cause it really don't matter bout me
It's all Anybody Killa and Blaze Ya Dead Homie
Feel a little gust of wind and you're dead
'cause an axe just severed yo' head
And what about the bitch that got shot?
She gave me herpes so I shot her in the back
This be an autobiography

Blaze Ya Dead Homie,"Ever since back when I was alive
I always thought to myself what it would be like to die
Today I'm more dead than a doornail
Whether I succeed or fail, only time will tell
And if I ever fall short of the gold
I'll fall back on a nickel-plated chrome and take everything you own
I'm a pure-bred hustler, gang-bang affiliated
I pack a heater bitch, this ain't entertainment

[Chorus:]
If I fall only time will tell 
And if I fall of out of control
My pockets is bound to swell
If I keep reppin' the cheese, will they feel me?
You know you know it my nigga'
That's treal best believe me

The shadow, back up in you like a pap-smear
No I'm not a player, wearing sweaters made of cashmere 
With matching boots
I came for the loot, I'm riding shotgun and bitch 
I'm prepared to shoot
Duck low unless you want to get hit with the blast
I'll blow a motherfuckers hair in and out his baseball hat
And if I catch him hard grinding with some shit that's fat
I'm gonna lay him on his back, you bitches better believe that

[Chorus]

Fall down, if I fall, get back up again
I'm gonna get back up again, when will this ride be over
Did it begin, no more slipping
Yo' I had it up to here, cause I've had enough
This s***'s all fucked up
When times get tough you need to pick yourself up, and brush off

I'm not afraid to fall, I fell, got up
Kept moving while my body repeatedly got shot up
I even tried to stand up
After taking a the clip and a half from a bitch-ass rocking a ski mask
In a dark alleyway, I was killed on a Sunday night
Body recovered on a Monday
News covered the gun play
The same dude that killed me, 
Dead body discovered in the subway

[Chorus]

Madrox and I'm round like the earth
I done fell so many times, I'm accustomed to all the hurt
No work, and no jobs, and people are unemployed
Most of the people just filling the void 
And I'm one of them
Just because I'm in front of them 
Mean I'm ahead of the game
And when you clear away the shit, we basically all the same
All going against the grain and hope for some better days
In the meantime, we all just trying to maintain

Err'ybody get your
Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off
Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off
Me I be a G from way back in the day
With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality

(Blaze)
I'll shoot you in the day, like my heater stay on toast
And Grundy build a casket for you as soon as you a ghost
I got an itchy trigger finger and I'm scratching like a DJ
15 shells in my pocket, who wanna see me
Khakis stay on fold, brew ice-cold
And my homeboy rapping to a chicken that he know
Here come a car up the street, rolling real slow
With a wannabe, baby G, hanging out the window
Looking close, like he knows me
Fuck set!, Buck shots splattered his ass all over his homies upholstery
Trying to play me closely, but my approach be
Buck'em all till they fall with my shotgun

(Chorus 2x)
Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off
Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off
Me I be a G from way back in the day
With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality

(Anybody Killa)
If I keep my self alive, something just might happen
Like my gun clapping, or a motherfucker's head crackin'
My nerves are shot, I'm sweaty and hot
Always shaking, looking just like Michael J. Fox
Save me, help me take me out this mind frame
Without the choppin' on you hoes cause I'm insane
Me and Colton be getting Grundy in the hood
Knocking down your doorway, jacking all your goods
Look into the barrel of my shotgun, watch yourself
Fucking wit me, is just bad for your health
So when you see me coming, best be thinking whether you want to live or die
Cause my anger's increasing, so watch out
Cause we ain't playing pimp, move the fuck over
All up our face, acting like we know ya
But if you really want to get that close,
Then prepare yourself, to be filled with holes

(Chorus 2x)
Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off
Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off
Me I be a G from way back in the day
With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality

(Esham)
Sawed off shotgun and I'm about to dump
Sippin' on some syrup, speakers on bump
Cruising down 7 mile, cash bed of pile
You think my shotgun won't blast, bat a thou-
I'm all cheddar style; throw your body off Bell Isle Bridge
Don't push me cause, I'm over the edge
Been fell off the ledge, with a hole in my head
Only reason Colton Grundy see me cause he been dead
Boy I'm nothing to play with; my shotgun murdered 9 federal agents
I kill them all ages,
Bloodstain the front pages
This shit is outrageous,
Me, Blaze, and ABK need to be locked in cages
Police been after me, I cause a catastrophe
All because my shotgun said Blasphemy
Now another shotgun casualty

(Chorus 2x)
Shotgun, shotgun double barreled sawed off
Stay strapped homie this shit is about to pop off
Me I be a G from way back in the day
With that I don't give a fuck about your set, type mentality

(Blaze)
4 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman
Three more people wanna test me
3 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman
Two more people wanna test me
2 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman
One more person wanna test me
1 bullets left in my pocket, I'm a madman
Don't nobody wanna test me

(Verse 1)
I?m the greatest escape artist the hardest situation is getting free
From the terror that keeps confiding in me,
I got to be Better than Houdini and David Blaine
With no magician, No illusions, No subliminal, No hypnosis to your brain, I?m untrained
Children should not try this at home at all, I?m a free lance professional
And this is on my own I staged the whole bit
I drink and talk a little shit and see who got the balls to pull a strap
And really use it, That?s where the fun comes in
Cause after they pop me they got to hide my body
So no ones suspicious about who shoot me
It?s interesting me to see the means and the tactics and tape
To make sure that my death is tucked away nice and safe

(Verse 2)
Sunshine?s for suckers and queers
That?s what they told me when they rolled me in the carpet,
And through me over the bridge just like I was some garbage
Of course I was uncounsous not dead in the sense they thought I was
But a slug in your dome will get you caught up 'cause
I?m not invincible I could die a million times
Each time more painful than the first, Still I survive
Both hands are tide behind my back as I?m breathing dirty water
And my legs are been mauled to death by the sewer rats
I move erratically to make them work for there meal
I?m dislocating my shoulder?s I slip out just like banana peel
I?m close to drowning again
Ten minutes and countin me to them
Is my record so I feel it like I'm ahead
In points was the view from the west but it's all good
Best believe that your boy will be back to walk the neighborhood
In no time water logged and bullet ridden
They be like, ?I can?t believe that he did it, He really escaped.?

[Not too sure about these!]
No stun, I'm runnin with some gangstas
Not no bitchass wangstas
But some real gangsta fed my legs into a woodchipper
But the blades got caught on my bones I woke up screaming
And noticed that my right foot and... leg was gone
My eye popped out the socket and dangling on the cheek
They must have strangled me to sleep 'cause I'm unable to speak
Must have screamed just inside of my head
'cause they still think that I'm dead
They usin a shovel to scrape away clumps of the red
From out the chipper they pop my legs out
So they can chop me up manual bag me up and throw me out
No sweat, give me a week and a roll of some duct tape
And a shovel to dig the rest of my body up and I'm straight

Blaze Ya Dead Homie,"Stay out!

You couldn’t see the clearing from the road
So, alone I sit, my legs folded and eyes closed
This is the place that I go
To come to grips that my sanity’s juxtaposed
With insanity, overload
And I’m afraid of my soul
When I’m back here, I’m all alone
There ain’t no screaming for help
When you're gone, they’ll never know

All the way to the drowning
Heavy stick in my hand and my heart, it keeps pounding
I'm holding them under
And their faces turn blue and I'm watching for wonder
See I hunt them like wild lions
And I catch em and kill em and cut em with hunting knife
Taxidermy like Mormons, stuff their body with leaves and replace vital organs
The thing that's important, is to never dispose of the edible organs
Delicious and morbid like a bucket of blood and a handful of organs
A place in the woods, where no one will hear you dying or seeing you live again
Rest here, you're home now, I'll keep you here with all of them

Sometimes when you look in the woods, the woods... Look back
""I don't like to be-"" there's no one in the…
I am the woods
Do you believe in the devil?
I- I shouldn't of gone in there
Stop going there, -do you go in there for?
""Hey, stay out of the woods!""

Off in the shadows on darkest of nights
There stands the heartless, his targets in sight
Underbrush overgrown, death stays hidden
Moss growth camouflage, body parts missin'
Trophy collection connected to the prize
Like to hear em scream, always look em in the eyes
Where my disguise is the face of a victim
Get excited everytime I knife sticks em
Watch em die in a place in the woods, the sensation feel so good
Drag em to the cabin, singing and laughing
Addicted to the feelin', so appealin' is the killin'

Sometimes when you look in the woods, the woods... Look back
""I don't like to be-"" there's no one in the…
I am the woods
Do you believe in the devil?
I- I shouldn't of gone in there
Stop going there, -do you go in there for?
""Hey, stay out of the woods!""

I'm taking them antlers, night is black as a panther
Lost in the rapture as I torture the victim I've captured
No hearin' the screams of me stabbin' behind, on the side of vacational cabins
There’s darkly shadows somewhere deep in woods where I have them
Tall trees, and the leaves they love the breeze
It’s so peaceful and secluded with horror you can’t believe
The begger repeating ""please"", broken down upon your knees
Hands quiver, come now bleed out until it reds the streets

They wanna get up inside of my head, never
I don't care what the doctors said
In the woods with a bag full of smoke for cover
It just makes me feel better, just keeping it real when I
Tell you not to go in the woods
Cause I’m back there and I will sever
Head from neck, put em in a hole
And I call the show cause it’s dug fresh
Anything left, dig another hole
And burn that shit like I’m learnin' it

Get down, get laid, get bread, get head
Anyway you want it, get it bitch, get it till you're dead

(You can't save me, I'm a- )
I'm the living dead pounding out the stereo
Rip the speakers in half, turn it up, here we go
I brought the cemetery with me on the track
And I'm cruising down the strip with dead bodies in the back
Human skeletons, come on, nod your cords
Zombies, vampires, killers and all of y'all

I keep a small circle
Got a lot of acquaintances, I'm universal
This is a business so don't take it personal
Invisible, I’m an outer space alien in pencil
Vein you draining your blood for real
Tell the officer watching me we just filming a commercial
Dead girls, they don't say no
Best friends are phlebotomus
I'm at the rock bottomless
Mimosas the colleges, psychologists analyze
How to get that Molly in a poly metabolically, Alli
Over your head, peon
Hoping the bed we on
Leaving you glowing neon
You can't fuck with the flow that we on
I would offer you Menaka
It's for all that shit that you talking
I'm a nightmare when I'm walking, bitter really killing me
You can looking into my soul as I'm stalking
Decapicate all of you hoes in a coffin
I soften them first, chop 'em up then hop in the hearse
Shit could be worse
Come on down, we the living dead
Basket case, now let's get in your head
I'm a ghost

(You can't save me, I'm a- )
I'm the living dead pounding out the stereo

Stand next to you 
Be there in the middle when your passin through 
In the middle meet you at the crossroads 
Between love and hate 
Between good and evil 
We can see right through you 
When you tell the truth 
All single lie 
We brake sumthin 
Your gonna make a man cry 
Don't want to talk about the day your gonna die 
Sooner or later that day will come 
When you have to make a right or wrong decision 
Its hard to take and make 
Curlin by they just separate you 
Want to do that sht 
Prime resists at the end of the day 
Its up to you 
Ill be there in the middle when your passin through.

People walking past looking at you in shame 
But they don't really care who's the one 2 blame 
You're gonna take the wrong turn your gonna lose the game 
You no its not you're fault that life turned this way 
But ppl don't care don't hear what you say 
The way it is now is the ways it gonna stay 
There's no choice left but to hope and pray

Blazin' Squad,"I just want you to listen
Troubled minds of the troubled times
Keep yourself together
Don't listen to other peeps
Cause a lot can happen on the streets
And peer pressure is a killer so listen to there wide
Words that I preach, it ain't safe out there
I know this from experience, 'cause this is serious
And that's how lives get messed up, I took this time to
Just eight bars to explain to the kids what's up

You're livin' in dangerous minds
Dangerous times, thug life
You're growing up on the street
All that crime, I've been there before
I've been through it, I realize the pain, I'm drawn into it
It feels terrible, when you're on another level
To the rest of them, trainers, clothes
You're not in with the trend
It's just a teenage beef that's bothering you
It's just a phase in life you'll have to go through

You know I never will amount to you
But is it pain you gotta put me through
You know I never will live up to you
And all that you do
You never tell your enemies from friends, and life
Will never be the same again
You never know where the story ends
That's right my friend
That's where the story ends

I hear these things again and again and again
Dress to impress for a friend, all it does
Everytime I hear will it ever stop
It just sends me round the bend
It ain't easy to be a teenager
I should know it puts your life in danger
Do you ever really think that it will stop
All the muggings and the bullies and weapons I think not

I can sit and write lyrics all day
But my teenage problems never fade away
My fashion sense never lead astray
My smell, my phone is what portrays
Perceive, a brethren or a chief, educated or naive
My popularity brings, friends and enemies

You know I never will amount to you
But is it pain you gotta put me through
You know I never will live up to you
And all that you do
You never tell your enemies from friends
And life will never be the same again
You never know where the story ends
That's right my friend
That's where the story ends

Teenage life you've gotta deal with it somehow
No point in complaining, gotta live with it somehow
Unfair job but you're still with it somehow
It ain't fair but you've gotta get through it somehow
All the teenagers that have had enough
That are tired of scuffs and just want love
Just take some time unleash your mind and you will find it somehow

What's wrong kid could be making it
Teenager in trouble and you're hatin' it, you wanna leave
The crowd your with, lead your own life
But I know you're scared of it
In a week there's 7 days 168 hours and a million ways
Everyday's different but your life will change, trust me 
It will never stay the same again

You know I never will amount to you
But is it pain you gotta put me through
You know I never will live up to you
And all that you do
You never tell your enemies from friends
And life will never be the same again
You never know where the story ends
That's right my friend
That's where the story ends

Growing up seems so hard when you're young
You never wanna listen always wanna have fun
Try to make things right but it soon's wrong
People say the best years come when you're young
You never listen to what people say
Always wanna try and do things in your own way
Never think straight, always play life as a game 
And in the end it's another life thrown away

Teenage troubles, thoughts that run through your head
Trying to impress cause of what your mates said
Wanna get in the crowd, you ain't got the clothes 
So you're out for a teenager that's what life's about
The pressure of the drugs violence and racism that faces them 
It's a part of life, don't ruin it for yourself 
Or you might end up by yourself

You think about back in the day
Of what you could have had but you threw it away
To be the top boy on the street
To be the boy everybody wanted to be, can't you see

You know I never will amount to you
But is it pain you gotta put me through
You know I never will live up to you
And all that you do
You never tell your enemies from friends, and life
Will never be the same again
You never know where the story ends
That's right my friend
That's where the story ends",Where the Story Ends,2002

Bitch I got my weight up, now my dues is paid up
It's niggaz falling off in this game, I'm trying to stay up
I treat this shit just like George Girvin, it's a lay up
You don't need no do's, cause my flows'll make you wake up

I'm the baker put the cake up, we real put the fake up
If your broad rolling with us, she coming back with no make up
The game needed a shake up, so I'm here to get that paper
Big Rob the Rhino, six-five earthquaker

Got hoes in Jamaica, moving dust like a snake-a
I roll with with Big Ake-a, cause he's a mic breaker
If your gal beeping us, the Kingz is gon take her
And don't bump your gums, or get heated like a vapor

And niggaz gon hate you, whether you broke or got paper
It don't matter, cause my lines'll put your career in danger
This one here's a banger, to the booth I ain't no stranger
Now you got your money's worth, cause the Kingz won't short tracer


[Chalie]
Your friend of a friend said this, your friend of a friend said that
Better tell your friend of a friend, that Chalie Boy said to back back
Before they get they head cracked, fucking with my bread stack
No need for no conversation, bitch cause I'ma did that

Little relief soldier, military minded
Knock off your block and drop it, where your secretary find it
(that's thoed, I'll rewind it) pay attention you'll find it
Sickening how I be spitting, giving sight to the blinded

Perfectly timed it, showing my ass
Conscience clearer, but all these hating hoes in the past
Want smouse on my cash, on the track I'ma blast
You can compare and contrast, I'm the best the rest trash

[Tite]
Move fast but I bet you, only be playing catch up
Niggaz that hold plex, end up leaving on a stretcher
Dripping red ketchup, for fucking with my ghett-a
Let the sun do it, cause I ain't gon sweat you

Tite revving up the Nikes, as far
Dime piece in the drop, I keep the nicest broad
The good life is what I live, with a nice support
And anybody trying to take it, getting life support

Feel my speech I reach out, still I T
I'm like a stove when I spit, you could feel my heat
I got flows like the lotto, you can take your pick
Put the Tite on your song, and it could make you rich

You bastards sick, thinking I don't hear the chatter
I got a nice Smith and Wess', that'll squish your bladder
A line this side, the ghetto got me crying inside
I never go without a fight, shit I'm down with pride

I'm a man not a mouse, never trust the gritty
King Kong got the hood, and I'll crush the city
It's do or die, you want to know who am I
The same gangstas on them cd's, you choose to buy

[Coop]
Another day another year, and it's still no fear
Never thought to bite my tongue, when I spit in your ear
All these messy ass niggaz, talking bout bidness they taking
They want the hoes that I'm taking, the money I'm making

Most boys want to walk, before they crawl
Man it's real in the field, everybody can't ball
Need that eye of the tiger, a heart that won't quit
Ain't no question bout your blood, you a full bread pit

Sit back relax my mind, over dranks and blunts
I'm thinking yacht with two cots, and a bitch on the front
Ghetto fab how I keep it, so that's how you receive it
Might not believe it, but nigga mo' money I need it

Ways I'm thinking be major, and it might bring pain
Can't nan you boys stop me, cause this style's my fame
Tarnish my name, you got a nigga fucked up kids
Don't let your folks have to read about, the shit I did

Looking at you in shame
But they don't really care
Who's the one to blame
You're gonna take the wrong turn
You're gonna lose the game
You know its not you're fault 
That life turned this way
But people don't care
Don't hear what you say
And the way it is now
Is the way it's gonna stay
There's no choice left but to hope and pray

Fashion consultants only ask for a few,
Look in the mirror, your new face is here

But on the inside there is not much there

Are you nothing more than just a fashion scene

New and improved, you think it's the one
You let Him in, let Him begin
It's amazing what He can do with sin
The outside's not what you want it to be
The inside's got everything you need

It's time to live from inside

As a child, we could be friends.
Now that we have grown older
That's come to a bitter end.
Trucks and horses, replaced by guns.
Ethnic hatred replaces the fun.
We go on fighting and murdering brothers.
But the greatest gift is love.
Chorus: An eye for an eye,
A tooth for a tooth, or a cup of tea for two.
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
Or a cup of tea for two.
So again we relive the story.
The same old story man after man.
And we think we're just so wise.
Then why can't we get back to the sand.

Never finding much.
Believe like a child believes in love.
