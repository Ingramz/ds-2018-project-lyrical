Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Laugh and sing, be happy 
It's the thing, be happy, 
Wink your eye, then fix your tie 
Be as I, be happy! 

Fall in line, be happy, 
Waste no time, be happy 
Time won't wait, why hesitate 
Call it fate, be happy! 

When the guy called trouble 
Throws you for a loss 
Heads or tails, win or lose 
Show him that you're still the boss... 

Start today, be happy 
Why delay, he happy 
Don't you to try to alibi 
Be as I, be happy!

Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"In a little honky-tonky village in Texas 
There's a guy who plays the best piano by far 
He can play piano any way that you like it 
But the way he likes it best is eight to the bar 
When he plays it's a ball 
He is the daddy of them all... 
The people gather round when he gets on the stand 
Then when he plays he gets a hand 
The rhythm he beats puts the cats in a trance 
Nobody there bothers to dance 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Beat me daddy, eight to bar!"" 
 A plink, plunkin' on the keys
 A riff, well, a-riffin' out with ease 
And when he jams with the bass and guitar 
They holler all, ""Come on and beat me daddy, eight to bar!""","Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar",1991
Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"The moon was high below the equator 
And you and I were so in love 
The sea was blue below the equator 
Our dreams were new and so was love 

We strolled where the Andes kiss the sky 
Through palms filled with silken moss 
'Twas there that we cried and kissed goodbye 
By the light of the Southern Cross 

My heart will stay below the equator 
Until the day we meet again...!",Below the Equator,1991
Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Bless you for being an angel 
Just when it seemed that heaven was not for me 
Bless you for building a new dream

So bless you, my darling, my angel 
Heaven is mine and life is divine with you!",Bless You,1991
Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Blue evening after a lonely day 
Blue evening spent in the same old way 
My future looks as dark as the skies above me 
There must be someone here in this world who loves me... 
A sweet love song would be so grand to know 
But my love songs are all from the radio 
Another dawn is waiting for me, another day and then 
Another blue evening again...",Blue Evening,1991
Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Blue moonlight enfolds the night 
And you are my arms? delight 
Sweet are the secrets to tell 
Here in the spell of... 
Blue moonlight that fills the skies 
there's some of it in your eyes 
Or is it what I'm dreaming of, 
Whisper and say it?s love... 
The world could stand still, I?d never know, 
I'm lost in the thrill of loving you so, 
Here in the glow of... 
Blue Moonlight that seems to shine 
Right into this heart of mine 
Tell me this heaven is true 
Tell me you love me too!",Blue Moonlight,1991
Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Blue Rain, falling down on my window pane 
But when you return there'll be a rainbow
After the blue, blue rain 
And there's a blue star 
Looking down asking where you are 
But when you return there'll be a sunbeam 
Hiding the blue, blue star
Skies will be much brighter than they were before 
When you and love come strolling through the door 
Then there'll be no more blue rain 
Just the sound of my heart's refrain 
Singing like a million little blue birds 
After the blue, blue rain",Blue Rain,1991
Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

But all of those vows we made
Were never to be)

Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

Come climb the hill with me, baby
(On Blueberry Hill)
We'll see what we shall see
(On Blueberry Hill)
I'll bring my horn with me
(When I found you)
I'll be wit' you where berries are blue
(The moon stood still)
Each afternoon we'll go
(On Blueberry Hill)
Higher than the moon we'll go
(And lingered until)
Then, to a weddin' in June we'll go
(My dreams came true)
Ba-ba-da-de-buzz-buzz va-de-n-da-day

The wind in the willow played (Do you really love me)
Love's sweet melody (As I love you)

Were never to be (When the night is through)

Though we're apart, you're part of me still

What makes a fella' start thinkin' of fallin' in love?
It's not the season, the reason, it's plain as the moon
It's just Elmer's tune

What makes a lady of eighty go out on the loose?
Why does a gander meander in search of a goose?
What puts the kick in a chicken, the magic in June?
It's just Elmer's tune

Listen, listen, there's a lot you're liable to me missin'
Sing it, swing it, any ol' way and any ol' time

The hurdy-gurdies, the birdies, the cop on the beat
The candy maker, the baker, the man on the street
The city charmer, the farmer, the man in the moon
All sing Elmer's tune

Glenn Miller & His Orchestra,"Just a melancholy echo 
Lingering when the day is through 
It's the call of the canyon 
Once again I'm dreaming of you 
Every night I search the moonlight 
Up and down the river shore 
It's the call of the canyon 
Maybe I will see you once more 
Standing there alone by the ashes 
Of the fire we said would never die 
Will I ever find an ember 
Burning from the days gone by...

Bringing back your answer to me!",The Call of the Canyon,1991

I talk to you but you're not there 
Can I help it, sweetheart? 
I try to sleep 
My dreams are haunted 

By a million stars that pry

In the valley of my dreams 
And the organ's playing just for you and me 
There's a choir in the chapel

I can hear their voices sing, ""Oh, promise me""

When she raises her Venetian shade...

Thou shall see paradise

Thou shall see paradise... 
Go to sleep, close your eyes

Waitin' for a bus to take me crosstown
Someone I adore is waitin' for me 
By the door way over crosstown

I used to go uptown but that romance fell through
I used to go downtown but she found someone new
Never realized they advertised

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,

And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy (Londonderry Air),1991

Who's giving that line to you?
You think it's divine, do you?

You're letting a grin kid you,
You never did win, did you?
Just a silly Humpty Dumpty heart.
Don't mean to criticize, or say I'm wise,
But if you will just recall, you sat on a garden wall,
And you know what happened
You'll still have a chance won't you?

Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring
Where my heart can go journeying?
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom-covered lane?

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music of the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will-o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

Haunts my reverie

How I'll hate going out in the storm!

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Don't go walking down lovers' lane with anyone else but me
Anyone else but me, anyone else but me
No! No! No!
Don't start showing off all your charms in somebody else's arms
You must be true to me

Will fade away and you're bound to stray if the stars get in your eyes
So, don't sit under the apple tree with anyone else but me

Old folks praying everybody swaying
Loudly, I chanted my praise
How I sang about the Judgment morn
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn

I had no complaints
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""

I had no complaints

So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,
Glenn Miller & The Army Air Forces Training Command Band,"Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.
Here is the gist, a practical list of ""donts"" for you.

Don't throw bouquets at me
Don't please my folks too much
Don't laugh at my jokes too much
People will say we're in love!

Don't sigh and gaze at me
Your sighs are so like mine
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't start collecting things
Give me my rose and my glove.
Sweetheart they're suspecting things
People will say we're in love.

Don't praise my charm too much
Don't look so vain with me
Don't stand in the rain with me
People will say we're in love!

Don't take my arm too much
Don't keep your hand in mine
Your hand feels so grand in mine
People will say we're in love!

Don't dance all night with me
Till the stars fade from above.
They'll see it's alright with me
People will say we're in love.",People Will Say We're In Love,2012
Glenn Miller & The Army Air Forces Training Command Band,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone till the day draws to an end,
But when the sun goes down and the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night you're sio close to me!
All through the night,
From a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy!

When dawn comes to waken me,
You're never there at all!
I know you've forsaken me
Till the shadows fall,
But then once again I can dream, I've the right
To be close to you all through the night.",All Through the Night,2013
Glenn Miller & The Army Air Forces Training Command Band,"I'm recalling times when I was small, in light and free jubilee days
Old folks praying everybody swaying
Loudly, I chanted my praise
How I sang about the Judgment morn
And of Gabriel tooting on his horn
In that sunny land of milk and honey
I had no complaints
While I thought of Saints
So I say to all who feel forlorn:

Sing ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!"" and you'll shoo the blues away
When cares pursue you, ""Hallelujah!""
Gets you through the darkest day
Satan lies awaiting and creating skies of grey
But ""Hallelujah! Hallelujah!""
Helps to shoo the clouds away",Hallelujah,2013
Glenn Miller & The Army Air Forces Training Command Band,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2014
Glenn Miller & the Modernaires,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo,1998
Glenn Miller & The Modernaires,"Why are the stars always winkin' and blinkin' above?
What makes a fellow start thinkin' of fallin' in love?
It's not the season, the reason is plain as the moon
It's just Elmer's tune
What makes a lady of eighty go out on the loose?
Why does a gander meander in search of a goose?
What puts the kick in a chicken, the magic in June?
It's just Elmer's tune
Listen, listen, there's a lot you're li'ble to be missin'
Sing it, swing it, any old way and any old time
The hurdy gurdies, the birdies, the cop on the beat
The candy maker, the baker, the man on the street
The city charmer, the farmer, the man in the moon

Glenn Miller Alumni,"The night was filled with sweet surrender
I had a million things to say
We shared the moon in all it's splender
You pressed your lips to mine, and by the way
 
Did I remember to tell you I adore you
And I am living for you alone?
Did I remember to say ""I'm lost without you""
And just how mad about you I've grown?
You were in my arms and that was all I knew
We were alone, we two, what did I say to you?
Did I remember to tell you I adore you

Glenn Miller Big Band Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

That night of love and glory 
A night that left my heart romantic scars 
We stood so near to heaven 
That I reached clear to heaven 
And gathered you a handful of stars 

Sweet remembered hour 
When love began to flower 
With moonlight through the trees like silver balls 
And as the moon grew older 
I reached across your shoulder 
And gathered you a handful of stars 

I placed my fingertips upon your lips 
And stars fell in your eyes 
Moonglow made a halo of your hair 
Suddenly you looked at me and dreams began to rise 
Oh, what things unspoken trembled in the air 

Our hearts were madly beating 
And then our lips were meeting 
And Venus seemed to melt right into Mars

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Another illusion I chose to create
You don't know what you got until it's gone

I was acting as if you were lucky to have me
Doin' you a favor, I hardly knew you were there
But then you were gone, and it all was wrong

In your heart was a place

Yet it all seemed amazing

I wanna know
What it took to leave me

I wanna know

How would you

Goodbye and it starts to snow
In the streets of Mexico
Goodbye, I am left alone

There's a space you used to take
If I'd have known
What we made
Would be gone like yesterday
I'd have loved
You with grace
I'd have fought the darkness away
All your lies
Showed my way
Now I'm lost between the faces

An airline ticket to romantic places

A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Holding hands and yawning, see how late it gets
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light

Here we are, in the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone, from the frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
But too much in love to break away

Do you remember, the nights we used to linger in the hall
Your father didn't like me at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall
To rent this little nest, get a bit of rest

Here we are just about the same
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people by dawn's early light
And so much in love, so much in love
Too much in love to say, too much to say, to say
goodnight

And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud

And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear,
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

Would I wander through this wonderland alone

My hat from my glove,

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

You will be hangin' on a string from your

You will relieve the only soul

Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat

Glenn Osser's Orchestral Pipe Organ Moods,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.

Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2008
Glenn Osser's Orchestral Pipe Organ Moods,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2008

Watching trains go by.

Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly.
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me.

Something's telling me it might be you
It's telling me it might be you
All of my life...

Looking back as lovers go walking past
All of my life,
Wondering how they met and what makes it last.

If I found the place,
Would I recognize the face?
Something's telling me it might be you.
Yeah, it's telling me it might be you.

So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And we've so much love to make

I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time

Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face

Just let you leave without a trace?
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh ooh

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now

And there's nothing left here to remind me

Well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry

So many reasons why

Well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me

Take a look at me now
Well there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do

Glenn Reynolds,"I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Turbo charged bars
Slot cars on tracks, falling off, game scars in these rap wars
Ain’t nothing band-aids won’t cover
Touring with 7D coverage
Live bands, two buses, my own cash
No budget, no major label fundings, Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running
You can’t say nothing, you under gag order
Hopping out of Audi’s hurting y’all with kicks, I’m the Transporter
Think about it, never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to yo muhfuckin self
Nobody else gon’ do it for ya, nobody else
Every now and then someone’ll offer ya help, but they ain’t doing nothing
‘Til they really see you tryna do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing on you jive turkeys
Stuffing stockings with these gifts
Audible applaudables homie take a wiff

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

When you a man, action is what’s expected, nothing is spoken on
Producer never got time for no excuses, gotta go beyond
My flow is tom-foolery
I smoke these pork rappers so fast they call me charcuterie
I beautifully exude the vibe that’s free of ambiguity
Ya goonery for the sake of goonery is cartoons to me
It’s coonery, it’s lunacy, let’s make it plain
Only way that you hang is attached to a tree
The moon talk to the sea and speak the body language fluently
She makes it rain
When I’m on fire, she always try to douse me
Only reason that you make it rain is ‘cause your diamonds cloudy
I see you from a mile away when it get overcast
Old people feel it in they bones, invade your home like I broke the glass
And let myself in, fighting for freedom like the people in Tunisia
Spread through Sudan and Egypt, this the music for the movement
The score to your achievements, never join ‘em so you gotta beat ‘em
It’s carpe diem hey (hey) yeah

I rise as day breaks
Clouds hide the sun’s rays
Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through
I fight the good fight
Even on the bad days
It’s darkest before light
I’m gonna push through

Like kindergarteners
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in-
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached
I’m on some other shit, like fuck the government
I'm higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing by my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life's a bitch when you ain't focused nigga
I'm focused

I rise as day breaks

Quick sand and mistakes
Smash walls to get through

'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,

Rip away the rotten wood

The risk no greater than the gain

Your soul evaporates away 
Cyclonic winds 
Will blow away the sins you gained 
A tidal wave 
Can take you where you've never been 
Clear the haze inside your brain 
You've been reborn 
End it all and start again 
Gonna lie in wait 
For a hurricane 
And for sure when I'm 
Inside I'll shed my skin

You are doomed 
In the stratosphere 
Only way to escape 
And get out of here

Wondering where I've gone 
Tell him I stepped into the storm 
Tell him I've been reborn

And see my heart is black
I see a red door
And I have to have it black

Maybe I'll fade away
And not have to face the fact
That it's not easy
When your whole world's turning black

Paint it black
My whole world's black

If we look hard enough
Into the setting sun
These things will last with me
Before the morning comes

I see them walking by
All dressed up in their clothes
I have to turn away
Until my blackness goes

Paint it black
It's all black

Sitting alone every night

And I was desperate to find
The things I have here by my side
Now that I've let it all go
I cry for the children so

And I've spent all my life
Searching for nothing
And I've wasted my time
To end up with nothing

And I tried so hard to understand
The yearnings of a younger man
I know that I would change my plans
If I could take my time again

Well that's okay, baby, I don't mind

Seven seas that run high

But our good times are all gone
And I'm bound for moving on
I look for you if I'm ever back this way

Think Ill go out to Alberta
Weathers good there in the fall
Got some friends I can go to working for
Still I wish you change your mind
If I asked you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more

If I get there before the snow flies
And if things are going good 
You could meet me if I send you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
ain't too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there",Four Strong Winds,

Glenn Yarbrough,"Way out west in blankety blank 
A bull frog jumped from bank to bank
Cause he never could find 
Nothin' better to do
Well he corked all night 
And he jumped all day
Till he corked and jumped his life away
Cause he never could find
Nothin' better to do
And a lot of folks are like that foolish frog of mine
Runnin' into trouble just to pass away the time
And the devil is always looking around and waitin' to grab that kind
Cause he never can find
Nothin' better to do

That frog of mine was mighty fond
Of jumpin' in his neighbors pond
Cause he never could find
Nothin' better to do
Well he jumped around to beat the band
Till he jumped into a frying pan
Cause he never could find nothin' better to do
Well all you people who sing this song
Remember why that frog went wrong
Cause he never could find 
Nothin' better to do
So keep on workin' and any old pay
Till the big horn blows on judgment day
Cause you never will find

Some men swim the sea,
Some men fly above the sky:
They are what they must be.
But, baby the rain must fall,
Baby, the wind must blow,
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby, I must go, baby I must go.
I do not love for silver,
I do not love for gold,
My heart is mine to give away,
It never will be sold.
So, baby the rain must fall,
Baby, the wind must blow,
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby I must go, baby I must go.
I am not rich or famous:
But who can ever tell?
I don't know now what waits for me
Maybe heaven, maybe hell.

Baby, the wind must blow,
Wherever my heart leads me
Baby I must go, baby I must go.","Baby, the Rain Must Fall",1970
Glenn Yarbrough,"A hundred men went off to war
A hundred men
Their hearts were heavy, their heads were high
As they kissed the ones they loved goodbye
Some were eager some were scared
Nobody knew and nobody cared
When a hundred men went to war

Then a thousand men went off to war
A thousand men
A few now said that it wasn't right
And a few said prayers in their beds at night
But of those so eager and those so scared
A few now knew a few now cared
When a thousand men went off to war
Ten thousand men!

Then a million men went off to war
A million men
Now fear came a'creeping down many a street
Borne on the dust of a million feet
And many now said that it wasn't right
And many said prayers in their beds at night
When ten million men went to war!

Then all mankind went off to war
Yes all mankind!
And the people fought
And the people cried
And the people prayed
But the people died
And fear like a flood covered every street!
Mixed with the blood on a billion feet!
All now said that it wasn't right
And prayed as one through the fiery night
Their hearts were heavy as they watched the sun
And kissed the ones they loved goodbye
Now none were eager but all were scared
Now they knew that they should have cared

Glenn Yarbrough,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

CHORUS:
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.

CHORUS

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?

Angel songs and birthday tunes
Valentines and wishing wells
Magic stairways, moods, and Junes
Silly rhymes and monkeyshines

Round and round the records go
Time to turn the page

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together
There's no other way to say good-bye

Misty faces, far off places
Came and danced across the stage
Sha na na's and doo be down's
The sounds that chased away the blues 
Yesterday is yesterday
The past is dead and gone
Nostalgia just gets in the way
Let's stop hanging on

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together

And the world we used to know
Scratchy worn out 45's

Those days of you and me
Now we know that breaking up is
Really hard to do

Glenn Yarbrough,"Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day
(uh huh no laughin' during this song please it's bein' recorded)
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home 
And pity the miner digging my bones

Glenn Yarbrough & The Limeliters,"Riding on the City of New Orleans,
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders,
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey
The train pulls out at Kankakee
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

CHORUS:
Good morning America how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

Dealin' card games with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.

CHORUS

Nighttime on The City of New Orleans,
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee.
Half way home, we'll be there by morning
Through the Mississippi darkness
Rolling down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem
To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.
The conductor sings his song again,
The passengers will please refrain
This train's got the disappearing railroad blues.

Good night, America, how are you?
Don't you know me I'm your native son,
I'm the train they call The City of New Orleans,

Angel songs and birthday tunes
Valentines and wishing wells
Magic stairways, moods, and Junes
Silly rhymes and monkeyshines
Pictures on a stage
Round and round the records go
Time to turn the page

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together
There's no other way to say good-bye

Misty faces, far off places
Came and danced across the stage
Sha na na's and doo be down's
The sounds that chased away the blues 
Yesterday is yesterday
The past is dead and gone
Nostalgia just gets in the way
Let's stop hanging on

This will be our last song together
Words will only make us cry
This will be our last song together
There's no other way to say good-bye

Now we go our separate ways 
And the world we used to know
Scratchy worn out 45's
An echo on the radio
Tra la days are over now
Those days of you and me
Now we know that breaking up is
Really hard to do

Glennis Grace,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

And did it my way",Waarom,2011

That I almost believed that the pictures are all I can feel

Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in 
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

Remembering you
But in a soft through the night
You were bigger 
And brighter 
And whiter than snow
Spring at the make believe
Spring at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

Remember you
Falling into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

Remembering you
How you used to be
So drown
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time
Then slip away
Quietly
Open my eyes but I never see anything

I could've held onto your heart
If only I thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart

I'd be giving my heart away

Had to be this way all my love gone in one day

As the tears you cry for me it's a diff'rent game;
The songs I sing for you they never end
I'll write @a million words my love I'll send
Now it's all over find a new shoulder
Someone will give you the things that you need
Don't forget me
Think of me sometimes
Soon t.he sun will start to shine.

As the tears you cry for me

The way I feel
It's time for me to go

Don't ask me why
Don't even try
To stop me as I go

I'll be back somewhere, someway
Don't feel alone
One fine day
You'll heard me say
""Darlin' I'm home""

I will love you all my life
Just one thing I pray
When you dream of me each night
Remember me this way

A tear that falls
A voice that calls
Is all I've left to you

A last goodbye
The tears I cry
I dedicate to you

I'll just go on missing you
So, until then
I'll just dream of kissing you
Again and again

I will love you all my life
Just one thing I pray
When you dream of me each night
Remember me this way

I will love you all my life

Glitter Band,"[Chorus]
If you don't know me by now 
You'll never, never, never know me 
All the things that we've been through 
You should understand me 
Like I understand you 

Now baby I know the difference 
Between right and wrong 
I ain't gonna do nothin' 
To upset our happy home 

Oh, don't get so excited 
When I comee home a little late at night 
Cause we only act like children 
When we argue, fuss and fight 

[Chorus] 

We all got our own funny moods 
I've got mine 
Woman, you got yours too 
Just trust in me 

Like I trust in you 
As long as we've been together 
That should be so easy to do 
Just get yourself together

You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I

Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
when will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
is it a lesson that I never knew? 
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you 
and that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see 
you made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye? 

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
when I was being what you want me to be? 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by

Heve nordmannen fenge sin heim
Der han sjølv heve tuftene grave
Og set sjølv sine hus oppå deim

Han såg ut på dei steinute strender
Det var ingen som der hadde bygt;
""Lat oss rydja og byggja oss grender
Og så eiga me rudningen trygt""

Han såg ut på det bårute havet
Der var ruskut å leggja utpå
Men der leikade fisk nedi kavet
Og den leiken den ville han sjå

Fram på vetteren stundom han tenkte:
""Gjev eg var I eit varmare land!""
Men når vårsol I bakkane blenkte
Fekk han hug til si heimlege strand

Og når liene grønkar som hagar
Når det laver av blomar på strå
Og når netter er ljose som dagar
Kan han ingen stad venare sjå",Nordmannen,2004

I swear by my tattoo.
There was Mermaid Minnie, met her down in Madagascar.
She would kiss me,
Anytime that I would ask her.
Then one evening, her flame of love blew out,
Blow me down and pick me up, 
She swapped me for a trout.

She was the captain's wife.

Then there was Harpoon Hannah,
Had a look that spelled out danger.
My heart quivered, 
When she whispered, ""I'm there stranger.""
Bought her trinkets,
That sailors can't afford.
Sailors can't afford.
And when spent my last red cent,
She tossed my overboard.

You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again.

Glori Gage,"To lead a better life
I need my love to be here

Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

[Chorus: x2]
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere

Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Is gonna feel so right
Baby when you're loving me 
I feel like I could cry
'Cause there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you, no no no

Here we are 
All alone
Trembling hearts, beating strong
Reaching out, a breathless kiss 
I never thought could feel like this
I want to stop the time from passing by
I want to close my eyes and feel 
Your lips are touching mine
Baby when you're close to me
I want you more each time
And there's nothing I can do
To keep from loving you

There's nothing I can do
I'm helpless in your arms 
Oh baby what you do
I'm in love, this is it
There's no turning back this time
No no no

Here we are
Once again
But this time we're only friends 
Funny world
Sometimes lies
Become the game, when loves the prize
And though no one knows what's going on inside 
And all the love I feel for you 
Is something I should hide
When I have you close to me
The feelings so sublime 
That there's nothing I can do 
To keep from loving you, no no no
Can't keep from loving you baby
No no no
That there's nothing I can do my baby
To keep from loving you",Here We Are,1989
Gloria Estefan,"Why is nothing ever new for long
And things go wrong in time
How come love is never new for long
We feel a change inside
Things no longer feel the way they did
People never care the way they did
Lovers never love the way they did
Were got to make it last
Got to fan the spark

People know that love is often cruel
But still they fall in love
I believe that only goes to prove
That loves what we dream of

Even if things can never be the way they were
But if you just hold on your luck might take a turn
We should put in practice
What were learned
That loves the only way
We got to make it stay

Life goes on
Nothins ever new
Maybe different than before
You may not believe me
But nothings ever
Nothings ever, nothings ever new

Don't know things will never be the same I've heard
But if you just hold on your luck might take a turn
We gotta put in practice
Everything we've learned
That loves the only way
We got to make it stay

Life goes on no matter what you do
And though its crazy, nothings ever
Nothings ever new
You may not believe me, but its true
But nothings ever new",Nothin New,1989
Gloria Estefan,"Take me only for what I am
You've got a right to speak your mind
You've gotta take the stand

No one has the right to say
This is right or that is wrong
It isn't just one way

Find common ground, go in between
Things aren't always what they seem

Someday it'll be alright
Changes happen overnight

People, let's give each other room
If we're gonna work it out
We better make it soon

Love is, love is such a common word
When it's pride we mistake for love
Isn't that absurd

Why always take
The upper hand
It's better to understand

Say it's not there and maybe it will go away
(Go away)
But the truth is it won't
Down the line, will be back again
It will be back again

Rather than examine it
Maybe I should handle it
What good is it, to close my eyes
And tell myself another lie
I gotta get along somehow and sometimes the only way
Is to close my eyes

Somtimes I have to close my eyes
Let you think, you can make a fool out of me
Guess I set myself up each time
By trustin' you, so openly
Yeah, that's the way I wanna be
That's the way I wanna be
Woo

Somtimes I have to close my eyes
",Close My Eyes,1991

Should I stay or should I play?

Make a serious commitment to the nine seven six date

What good did it do?

And have yourself a merry little Christmas now
 
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay

From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now",Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,1993
