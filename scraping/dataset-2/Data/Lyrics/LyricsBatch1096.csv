The Beatles,"Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much, it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, girl

When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl

She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh
Girl, girl, girl

Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

Ah, girl, girl",Girl,1965

Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

Or should I say she once had me

About the good things that we can have

A crowd of people turned away

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today, oh boy

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

""Five, six, seven, eight, nine
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen
Twenty""

Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Made my way upstairs and had a smoke
And everybody spoke and I went into a dream

""Oh shit""

I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you

Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle

And looking up, I noticed I was late

Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Or sue me when I cry,

I wish that I could die.

Where all blinds can see.

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away

Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man

Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again

Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two

Give us a wink and make me think of you",Lovely Rita [Mono Version],2009

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
And she's gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies,
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
That grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
Waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
And you're gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Picture yourself on a train in a station,
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds [Mono Version],2009

Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more

In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear

Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

You got the brews but the cool is just save ya
Down and just daze ya, Beatnuts want to blaze ya
Raise ya give you junky juice that was major
(And you don't stop) comin' from the soul
cause the heart is the funk spot
Diggin' through shit that I found out in the park lot
Talk not, bustin' crazy shots at the don't squeeze
Ju come down spray these niggas with the funk please

JuJu:
Somebody said you were looking for static G
Those who try to play me close could die tragically
I got a merciless flow that's infatically fatal
That attacks the brain automatically
Unleasing lyrical wrath to leave you open
Crew that choose to bite might find yourself toking
Dirty alone I never do what the pope says
I'm tryin' to get money like Felipe Lopez

With a 1-2-3, 3 and 2-1 only type ? preacher could be this nun
Hun don't it sound sweet to the drum?

Run to poppa come get what you never had
I'm (superbad) and ducks get mad cause it's all good
I know you wish you could (get funky)

Fashion aka Al Tariq:
We got you want to more puff from the Nut 
Go on take a hit from my shit but it's a rough one
Bust one, remember what they said never trust one

Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair

Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin' ""fuck Lester""

Don't give a fuck where you been what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this favorite
In black shades like a secret, agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese

So much drama goin down
Everytime I look around, I see
So much fakeness goin down

Why I'ma- be stingy when I could share?
Why I'ma- be hateful if I could care?
Why would I hate my own?
Or forsake my own?
Why would I- fuck around and get a jake on my chrome?
I wouldn't- have to stick you if we all could eat
It wouldn't be no need for beef
Dyin over streets we don't even own anyway
You could get bucked off anyday

While I'm tryna find a good price for a nine
Feel like my life on the line
That's why a nigga be hype all the time
Ready for the revolution at the drop a'a dime

I got a duty to have security for my niggas
My duty to serve the beautiful black sistas
A duty to stand wit' anybody that's wit' us
And fully criticize all bullshittas
There should be awards presented- to niggas who fight back
Like Panther jackets, or sistas who light gats
I'm a full-blooded warrior, ready for change
Recognize any soldier that's doin the same
Because I love who I am, and that means everything to me
My life ain't worth a damn unless I'm dealin with reality
When I look myself in the eyes, it's just me
And I don't have to tell nobody no lies, I feel free
And I would rather deal with the truth and falsehood
Than bein fake with my people and claimin 'it's all good'
You can't run away from ya self, so that's useless
If your word is bond, then you don't have to make excuses

Everytime I look around, I see
So much drama goin down

Three TV's and twelve-changer cd's

Sit down fatso, watch me blast boats like gas blows

So butter me, bitches want to mother me 
Take they bras off and smother me 
Irkin' me, for an appointment 
'cause they love jerkin me off the ointment 
It's Pyscho, the new pimp, the new pimp 
Dead all the bullshit, get wit this new hit 
As I hit the bong so, stay Puff like Sean Combs 
Bang heads like bongos, you get the like The Gong Show 
Catch you comin' out the tree spot 
Cripple you wit a knee drop 

Now you struttin' real cute like a peacock 
Personal injuries when faces run into these 
Y'all niggas need more treats, fuck them keyboard beats 
Hip hop hippy, jump in my whippy 
Light up the clippy and let the vibes hit me, c'mon 

""Cha cha cha, forward back 
Cha cha cha cha, back forward"" 

Yo I used to spit outta anger, now I just spit out a banger 
Flip and pull your lungs out wit a hanger 
I'm not a trouble-making nigga, but I handle my beef 
You on some Eric B. shit like ""What happened to peace?"" 
Got no problem wit smashin' teeth, fuckin' your wife 
Robbin you nigga, kidnappin' your niece 
Bless your cheek wit a permanent crease 
I'm a problem you don't need 
Y'all probably go run for police 
Y'all could sell all the drugs in the world 
Hang wit all the thugs in the world 
Won't be the first hole that I dug in the world 
Taste dick when you kissin your girl? 
Well you should 'cause she swallow more nut than a squirrel nigga

It's Big Psych long time no hear from
Bangin' tracks out so wax out your ear drums
Max out prepare to blackout

Here comes open candela
Once again it's off the cadena
Tell you with confidence, I don't believe in promises
Niggaz slippin' with the dough

So you got's to stay on top of it
If you wanna a lot of it and never be broke
(Be broke)
Get ready for more problems like puffin Tito
(Tito)

Everyone's a gambler, nobody plays fair
You wanna be a stupid player, yeah, yeah
Well you're half way

Prendelo, to my niggaz on the streets
Prendelo and to whoever want beef
Prendelo, what, prendelo, what

I go click, click pow off of the snare drum
It's the junkyard nigga, long time no hear from
Headed uptown to cop the finest
Gotta get some first, no matter how long the line is

All my music is timeless
Gotta keep the pretty girls shaking their masses for your highness
Juju, could you buy me a beer
What the fuck's happenin' here, no drinks 'til I'm tappin' the rear

Is there a problem, am I making that clear?
Get the fuck up outta my ear
I ain't buying shit this year
All y'all gold diggas, give it a break

What you need to do is buy my tape
And hear them gems from inside my crate
If you like a niggaz style that's great
But please forget about my cake bitch

Aiyyo who ever got weed
Prendelo, about a pound is all we need
We about to get it chronc
Prendelo, everybody getting drunk
Prendelo, to my niggaz on the streets
Prendelo, what, prendelo, what, prendelo

Who's up next to bat
Llego El Caballo, Tony joda

It goes uh ah off the snare drum
Tony Toca long time no hear from
So wake up and smell the bustelo and say hello
To this fly fellow word to my abuelo

Prendelo whether you're a friend or foe
Entiendelo kid I got the endless flow
I made money off the books but I spent it though
Still running with these quirks wearin' expensive clothes

The triflest talking about light the splift
Everybody in the room, swingin' right to left
It ain't a Tribe Called Quest, it's Psycho Les
Tone Touch Big Ju getting you hype to death

Hype as fuck talking about light it up
Shorty gave me no play is she a dyke or what?
I don't like to walk fast man I like to strut
Man I'm done here, another one bites the nuts, kid

What now? what? What?
You tricked me, that's right, we tricked you
You tricked me, what you thought
You tricked me

You knew I was on to you, how?
Ha, ha, don't make me laugh
The Beatnuts, you tricked me
Tony Toca, El Caballo

I blaze ganja like Jamaicans in Kingston
And shit on you and leave you stinkin'
Light a match

You don't want it, don't want it

I don't love hos who catch me on the Ave with a snub nose
Late night ridin' a bike watchin' for po po
At a red light right in plain sight
On a summer on the low on the dead night
Why y'all niggaz don't want it with us
And they ain't really shit to discuss
All that shit you be spittin', it's us
Step to you with the steel out
Juju ain't the type of cat you want to feel out

It's all you you can hate if you want (u don't want it)

And beats banging the truck (u don't want it)
Gettin' money worldwide we provide them up front (u don't want it)
All you women in the club we know what you want (u don't want it)

Catch you with the cross bow
Right through your torso
What you said (nuttin') thought so
Pass by your crib riding a horse slow
Just checkin' out the negocio 
Time to collect from the inner streets belly
Nigga want to come short like Joe Pesci
Before I wack em I crack a cold pepsi
Click back all leave the space messy

Blowin guns like Jesse
Pulled my glock out who want to test me
I feel like the devil just possessed me
Burn more weed, I'm moving at hyper speed
Always carry two knives with me
For why y'all niggaz who be trying to hate
You fucking fake man
You know these are the records you be dyin to make
Think you're hot nigga yeah right
Hot in the ass fuck around get shot in the ass

Yo it's my turn

Eat at the spot like Pac you could believe it or not
In the streets in the drop you know my boys is hot
We spit fireballs you heard my click got my thousand yours 
Hammer quipped we die for the strips defy the law
We the squad that do the job and beat the charge
A gold T with a old key will beat the job 
You never know when you're 'bout to go 
You never know when you're 'bout to blow
Niggaz get locked when the back is slow
On my pops we gonna pop the Mo
Pop the krizic cock is clicked
Til Seis get killed by the apocalypse
Ain't no stoppin' this
We splurgin' and mergin'
Icein' up the verse so nice they call me surgeon
Fuck what they heard twin
We the truth smoke weed on the roof
Puff live on the deuce get live off the 1-5-1 proof

I'm stompin you out, leavin you in scuffed Lugz
What the fuck is y'all cryin about?
Bottles at the bar, I'm buyin em out
Hookers on the dancefloor, I'm tryin em out
Doin things in the club you should only try in the house

Or even pay admission to go in a night club
I'm Lester and must be calm, never hyped up

You know I bought a lot of guns since ""Reign of the Tec""
Regardless, my only concern is progress
Leavin all y'all monkey-ass producers jobless
I'm hungry, man, maybe like never before
Bigger and better shows every tour
More money, more hoes, I don't need no problem
Some rap nigga get out of line, we gon' rob him
Have a nigga terrified to be in the street
Man, don't make me have to verify niggas is sweet
Come on homie, I just want a piece of the pie

You're an alcoholic
You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph
I'm here to tear the roof off
And if you want to take it to the guns, I'ma shoot off

Your head before you reach for the pistol
And when the bartender turns around I'ma reach for the Cristal
You not ready for this style, I'm straight Psycho wit it
And I bet you in love with, yeah Psycho hit it

A long time ago, I'ma keep doing my thizzle
Till it's time to go, but for now it's time to blow
Good as me in the club popping bubbly
I can't complain life is lovely
Either you hate me or you love me

Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next
It doesn't matter competition is no contest
I don't mean to brag, I'm just being honest
Where my dogs at smoking up at the college?

Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on
Put your drinks up, if your blazing get you ounce on
Girl I'd house you, but this ain't no house song
And no kissing, I dunno what you had your mouth on

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Look, don't approach me in a physical manner
'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer

I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas
I speak through those switches, spit like Obama
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
Thats A to the K with a fucking bandanna

Seize your empire, believe in no lies
Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire

That's it though, no more games
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuffs
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

uh, uh, uh

I was swerving thru Queens
Fully growin' benz
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec
Rappin' to my mens
Then spotted the most exotic, cheekiness, half Rachel, half Holly
My shit is
The slo mo, crept up nice and slow
Breathin' on my ice, so it shine real nice
Crease my scar peice
Laid back in my seat
Right near Bazely projects, on the back streets
Her name was Keisha, full of street knowledge
Pumped a little trees, but she planned to go to college
Staring at my ice, smellin' my cologne
She lived on the southside, so bring things on
Honey got flavour, and it just don't stop
Does she want me for me, or me for my rocks

Your carmake me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'm a take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check this out, uh

She slid up my whip, like the queen of New York
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat
I glanced at the fatty, I'm a see about that
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde
Scooby dooby hizza
I'm feeling the vibe, cop the blue for some video type shit
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get, uh
I've got her right where I want her
Reality about to creep up on her
Stroke her softly, gently with my G
While the light reflects off my icp
Waiter, ice the crystal, let it simmer
Lights to bright, here's a grand make them dimmer
I kept fronting and I just couldn't stop
I don't mind spending paper when it's looking that hot

Your car makes me hot hot hot
You just make me just hot hot hot
I Iike you're rocks rocks rocks
They make me hot hot hot
Baby boy just don't stop stop stop
You keep me hot hot hot
I'll take you for all you've got
Baby girl just stop stop stop
Check yourself, uh

You burst out of semi-???
She pulled down the staps to her dress
Reached in the ? sparked up sess
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the ??
She said ""Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips,
and give up girl to push whips?""
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone
Why you takin' jumbo in that zone
She said ""I would do anthing for ?????
Give deep ? to ? man coats
Take off my ??
Drop to my knees""
Talking in my face
Breath smelling like cheese
I asked her
Shorty you degrade yourself
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf
You turnin' me off, I can't lie
Keisha said ""why?""
I said, ""yo, how can a man respect that, knowin' if he paid,

Packing everything she owns and rides away

Would give anything if she would only stay

Racing all the trains down along the track

Screaming as the days go slipping by.
Working two jobs just to get on by these days.
Two kids, no husband, on the streets.
Been spending all her money on some food to eat.
Been sleeping in her car on the back seat these days.

Keep moving, get through this, get to this, don't do this.
She's sick of her life, living this way.
Keep flowing, keep going, been so long since knowing,
Just how it feels to be ok, these days.

Rollin', parking her car in the alleyway.
Leaving in her keys for the getaway.
Dropped her kids off at her folks today so they,
Wouldn't see what it is mama had to do,
Just to get on by, just to push on through.
""There'll be a better day and it's coming soon"" she prays.

The Beautiful Girls,"Girl, I''ll meet you underneath the tree where I first tried to kiss you.
Well when I was 4 and you were 3 you know we were meant to
Be married someday but life goes away before you notice it leave.

Now all those places have all gone away
Where we used to hang out with our friends and say 
""One day we're gonna live, we're gonna live, we're gonna live, gonna live it up.""
So close to the surface our hearts beating.
Was the only sound we'd hear deciding
What we were gonna do, we were gonna do, 
We were gonna do to push on through.

And if I told you I was worth it would you tell me you won't go?
Lord knows I try but I'm not perfect.
But I told you so. Yes I did you know
And if its all show, then we're already gone.

And I know its only been a while, but I still miss you.
I'd give anything if it'd make me be here with you.
See the more that things change, the more they're the same.
But there'll always be you and me.

Since all we ever tried to do's been undone
Maybe we can maybe someday run away
We could be new, we could be new
We could be new girl, me and you.
Or we'll laugh at stupid things that we've done
Never realising what we've become
Until it's too, until it's too
Until it's too late to be true.

And if I told you I was worth it would you tell me you won't go?
Lord knows I try but I'm not perfect.
But I told you so. Yes I did you know
And if its all show, then we're already gone.

Well I won't fear a thing or hear the things I've done.
Only know that you're in a place inside my heart,
And no matter where I go, we will never part.

I thought I saw the face of an angel and I heard her speaking to me.
She said my boy, don't fill up your head with trivial things.
'cause life's too beautiful for you to leave.

Just like periscopes up in the sky,
Well I have never seen a girl as beautiful as you, in my whole life.
And things don't always go the way you plan them,
But if your rolling with the flow well then it makes it easier,
Makes it easier to bare.

I'll give you kisses on your neck just like I always promised.
You float into my mind like pictures of an earthly godess.
She said my boy don't fill up your heart with nothing but love.
That truth is truth to you is truth enough.

The Beautiful South,"Queuing with the old folk 
There's and old man with a wicked smile 
Not through smug politeness 
He's doing it in style 

No savings book or flannel slacks 
No ""Pardon"" when I heard them ask 
Just a vodaphone and a filofax 

When I'm 64 
I'll dream on 

They all bore the milkman 
Stop him for hours at their front gate 
He just sits and thinks 
I'll make the bastard wait 

No dribbling or incontinence 
No longing for the old sixpence 
Just smoking weed till age makes sense 

When I'm 74 
I'll dream on 

They all save for Blackpool 
Just for the cheap companionship 
Meanwhile he counts pennies 
For a different trip 

No smoking pipes and drinking bitter 
No eyeing up the baby sitter 
I'll trip up kids and I'll drop my litter 

When I'm 84 
I'll dream on 
When I'm 84 
I'll dream on late 
I'll dream on

Exercise your muscles

Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse

The Beautiful South,"Don't whisper love and dream of wedding bells
Don't do all the talking, let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself

So when you feel a little tatty and unhappy with your face
Let it breathe into us and put you back in place
Let it breathe, let it breathe
From the day it came into us till the day it wants to leave
For it will, it will go
And it will not say goodbye just like it didn't say hello
There will not be a send-off, a funeral or mass
Just a pathetic little vodka from a dirty little glass
'To the world's greatest mum
From the oldest swinger in town'

Let love speak up itself
Let love speak up itself
Let it rise up in the morning and take us for that walk
Let it do the talking when we're too tired to talk
When we're too tired to talk

And when you feel unhappy that I'm not the one I was
Let love rot inside and let love palm you off
Let it rot, let it rot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot
In a knot, in a knot
Let it take your feelings and tie them in a knot
Hang them from a cleaver and say 'Look what we've got
A man and a woman and guess what they forgot'
'To the world's greatest mum
From the oldest swinger in town'

Flowers for ladies of fashion to wear

Amidst all the blossoms, she had fashioned by hand 
And watered with all her young tears

In heavenly gardens and bowers 
And instead of halo, she'll wear round her head

and it made me long for little last night

But a sweet worth every bite

5 days, 6 days. the whole of the month
wouldn't satisfy my only sweet tooth

It can take a lifetime to get close

used our hearts as a map
and we still got closer than most

Well excuse my staring but it's just your looks
are a standard well above myself
Your face might mean zip to you
But to me it's something else

All I can do is thank you
and wish that every dream you have will come true
5 years, 6 years, the whole of your life
I'll be wishing for the riches for you

[chorus]

You dashed pretty's only chance of a compliment
and gave the plain the blues
Turned supermodel into last year's pull
and got her down shining your shoes

And I don't mean to be hod carrier
of the ordinary folks bad news
But tell Miss World to fly to Mars
If she really doesn't like to lose.

And gave the bullet train option to this old abandoned tram

How do you make expensive look budget cost
If it's power to the workers then you are the boss
You make bluebells look like moss

If prostitution was not illegal
you'd make cheap sex look so regal
Make the hottest little joint in town look like frost

Just instrumental not too long
As sure as sure could ever be
You'd only get the lyrics wrong

No solo Chet Baker ever played
lowered me slowly to my grave
The prose that Keats and Yates would save
was for King and Queen not knave

I have no poem that describes my charm
No story told that's short and sweet
I have no hymn, I have no psalm
This song I have it has no beat
Yes it has no beat
No tapping of feet
Yes it has no beat

Miles Davis played the black 'n' blues
Did he play for me to lose?
Cause just when round midnight falls
That tune's not his it's Kenny Ball's

Now on that graveyard on that grave
On that tombstone in the shade
No poem written, no accolade
No ""We loved you"" ever sprayed

Devils always search for the high

Love knows no boundaries
Unless your in one of love's ghettos

But some of us are stuck in a cell
All you need is love, love, love
And a bloody good tunnel as well

You could get here by aeroplane or boat
Not unreasonable demands
But I could save myself the price of a ticket
If I didn't let go of your hands

Never mind killing me getting there
But somebody has to make plans
First embrace shoots you into space
And doesn't give a damn where it lands

Why not take a chance on love?
Even at hundred to one
If we promise that we'll never let love die
Within a week one of us'll be gone

Love sure makes the world go round
And takes you for a hell of a ride
But I don't wanna waste time searching for love
When it's already stood at my side

Love will make you blind to the truth
Romantic novels all tell
So I'll spend a little time romancing by myself
But that turned me blind as well

You can get here by crossing sea or desert
I can barely make Blackpool Sands
Railroad, caravan, save it for the mad man
Lets see if love just stands

Really provide any proof?
All it really proves is love never moves

But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me

",Dream a Little Dream,2006
The Beautiful South,"Don't think of what we can and can't achieve
Perfection like this can't be guaranteed
Hearts get lost, lovers leave
Let's just see what friendship actually needs

And if ever you do wrong I'm right behind you
If ever you may sin, count me in
If that devil doubt should come to find you
Count on me and you don't count on him

If luck should quit this town
If fortune sails
If conversation breaks down
If love derails

I'll be that back up call
If all else fails
I'll swap this bed of roses
For a bed of nails

I wouldn't mind being left up on that shelf
If I hadn't actually built, built the thing myself
But since there's only you and no one else
I don't get too wound up about my health

And if ever shelf may fall I'm right below you
In need of DIY then I'm your guy
If lack of confidence should come to know you
Don't let those tears you cry stop you and I

If luck should quit this town
If fortune sails
If conversation breaks down
If love derails

I'll be that back up call
If all else fails
I'll swap this bed of roses
For a bed of nails

The Beautiful South,"Water the plants, feed the cat
Leave that door key under the mat
I'm your number one from now on

Set the code, close the door
You don't live there anymore
I'm your number one from now on

Nothing grows so quickly as the vine
That wraps you up so tight and says 'You're mine'
No time so exciting as the time

You pour away that bottle containing last night's wine
Last night's wine, last night's wine
What you're taking part in is the cleverest of crimes
Last night's wine, just a flickering sign
But a necessary sin from time to time

Fold your dress, leave your hair
Put on your jeans, you ain't goin' nowhere
I'm your number one from now on

Cancel the milk, unplug the phone
Close the blinds, you ain't gonna be home
I'm your number one from now on

No time quite so easy as the night
To hold her far too close or far too tight
No catch quite so keen, so quick to bite
Than the one that thinks love's possible first or second sight

Love at first sight, love at first sight
Swinging from the chandelier, it's a one way ticket flight
Love at first sight, so wrong it's right
Swing you by your pigtails, set your world alight

Nothing hooks you quicker than the line
Thrown straight and from the bank into your spine
For family and for friends you'll surely pine
But sentiment and nostalgia, they just ain't worth a dime

What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?
You can leave those financial worries well behind
What worth's a dime? What worth's a dime?
I don't want that bank manager on your pretty little mind
Now that you're mine

The Beautiful South,"From Northenden to Partington, it’s rain
From Altrincham to Chadderton, it’s rain
From Moss Side to Swinton, hardly Spain
It’s a picture postcard of 'Wish they never came'

And whilst that deckchair in the garden it makes no sense
It doesn’t spoil the view or cause offense
Those Floridas, Bavarias and Kents
Make gentlemen wear shorts but don’t make gents

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

From Cheetham Hill to Wythenshawe, it’s rain
Gorton, Salford, Sale, pretty much the same
As I’m caught up without my jacket once again
The raindrops on my face play a sweet refrain

And as winter turns reluctantly to spring
For the clouds above the city there’s one last fling
Swallows build their nests, chaffinch sing
And the sun strolls into town like long lost king

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

And the mood of this whole sodden place is melancholy
Like the sun came out to play, shone through the clouds
But dropped its lolly
And everyone looks so disappointed, so, so sorry
Like the rain blew into town, kidnapped the sun
And stole its brolly

So convertible stay garage bound
Save after sun for later
If rain makes Britain great
Then Manchester is greater

As you dry your clothes once again
Upon the radiator
What makes Britain great
Makes Manchester yet greater

That he’s filing for divorce
Catherine gives her promise
To keep it secret but of course

They’re sharpening their claws

Especially bride to be
There’s three of them, she’d rather have
Gone down on bended knee

Credits roll on, “Speak up now
Or forever hold your peace”
Meanwhile my whole world is collapsing

Can somehow grip the nation
But maybe to us sad old mares
It’s a form of consolation

Makes us feel creative in a life minus creation
Meanwhile our whole world is collapsing

Returns to find his sister and his wife
Tucked up in bed

Feed me fantasy instead

They bring into our home
We actually tend to laugh about
'Cause ours would not get shown

And suffering's so much funnier

The Beautiful South,"There he stood, gun in hand
At the door, the day she chose to leave
Half of him stood comforting
The other half that couldn’t quite believe

Believe that she had left him
Believe that she had found another love
Believe that she decided
When push came to shove, she’d really shove

Friendship after friendship
Can’t begin to count the ones I’ve lost
Voyage after voyage
Couldn’t see the water for the docks

Lost my way up mountain pass
Couldn’t see the signposts for the frost
I lost every game, I’ve ever played
But I’ve never lost a chicken to a fox

I like that stick thrown into lake
You watch as move you make
Turns into mistake, your love away
Like that snail on the leaf
You watch as right beneath
That cold hearted thief, your love away

There he stood still hours on
The only movement, the only trace
The position of the gun
And a single tear running down his face

Inside he was screaming
Outside you could barely hear him cry
Inside orchestration
Regulated outside to a sigh

Friendship after friendship
Can’t begin to count the ones I’ve lost
Voyage after voyage
Couldn’t see the water for the docks

Found my way home late at night
Couldn’t see my bed for stranger’s socks
I lost every game, I’ve ever played
But I’ve never lost a chicken to a fox

I like that stick thrown into lake
You watch as move you make
Turns into mistake, your love away
Like that snail on the leaf
You watch as right beneath
That cold hearted thief, your love away

Your love away, your love away
Turns into mistake, your love away
Your love away, your love away

Surely your little heart can make some room
If there's room in the hemisphere for so many stars
There's surely a satellite we can name ours

They're building brand new centres, brand new bars
Shoving lonely people into boots of cars
If you want to share the failure or you want to share the flop
We'll both go in the boot right off the top

And if there's ever time in life for genuine mistake
Surely then you got the means to make it
And if you'd like one final slip before you get it right
This moon's asleep, you got the means to wake it

So left alone we're just simple bricks
No more than the stone that the child kicks
But as soon as we're together we are wall
And the stone the child kicks is bouncing ball

They're building brand new motorways, brand new roads
But when travelling on your own that road is closed
I'll be your co-driver and together we'll be tank
And watch as “no through road” sign slowly sank

And they're building brand new hospitals
Building brand new wards

So when it comes down to your turn
Don't be afraid of admitting you're weak
Cause these are tears that you earn

Who hasn't been there? Hold up your hand
Strangers, neighbours, none of them planned
Tears are the wage of this land

When raindrop first fell to the ground
It seemed like the brightest idea
Even though teardrops were already around
No one yet linked them with tear

Raindrop you notice when stood under trees
Pin-drop you can hear if down on your knees
But if teardrop anyone sees
It's time, gentlemen please

Scars you know take longer to heal
Whilst tears you'll not see again
So which do we try so hard to conceal
The ones that make fools of us men
Bricklayer, teacher, firefighter or vet
One thing in common, the hankies they've wet
But hidden away in the bedroom I bet
Tears in public, not yet
Drums have rolled for hundreds of years
Since we've blown one another to bits
Generals and soldiers still holding their ears
Cause drumbeat and teardrop don't mix

Makes out their music's slipped from the stand
Leaving the singer, his head in his hands
Public emotion, be damned

Those who sat there once but didn't make it through
There are names carved deep in bark on every tree
By those who spent their time like you and me

And wherever geography may place you now
There's a piece of history all folk carry around
Whatever your situation, whatever it may allow
There's an even larger piece in every lost and found

There is song, there's always a song
Wherever there's perfection there's a wrong
There's always song but a broken bond
And an unkissed frog in every village pond

There's a name that we graffiti'd up on a wall
To the folks who live there now, makes no sense at all
And in every underpass, on every street
A promise someone made but couldn't keep

A tiny piece of chalk in every coat
In every film the smallest lump in throat
In every song you've sung in every novel read
That unkissed love will rear, rear its head

There is song, there's always song
Wherever there's a right there's always wrong
There's always a song but a broken bond
And an unkissed frog in every village pond

Your make up in a toolbox somewhere in the shed
His face is unshaven, the grass overgrown
From the shed to the bed is a web you call home

That deathly cold blast from his side of the bed
Your dreams frozen over, your nightmares on ice
From the bedroom to the bathroom you say everything twice
(Everything twice)

And you’ll know when romance is dead
You’ll burst into tears at each record that’s played
He sits in the sun, you sulk in the shade
You’ll know when love starts to fade

You’ll know when romance is dead
From the brambles and thorns growing out of your head
Whenever you touch her she tuts or she sighs
One kiss goodnight and she’s rolling her eyes

And you’ll know when love starts to fade
That balancing act is no longer made
Like penny stacked high in amusement arcade
It’s not what you’re worth it’s the way that you’re laid
Yes you’ll know when love starts to fade

Like you knew when romance was alive
Each couple you passed they’d smile and high five
Like you’ll know when love’s back on track
Uncontrollable laugh at each joke that you crack

Giggle and cackle and throw her head back
Her mouth is still smiling, her veins turning black
Her head is elastic but her neck is all slack

You’ll know when love’s on the rocks
You wearing headphones, him vest and socks
You’ll know when love’s on the slide
Whenever you’re talking, the kids go outside

You’ll know when romance is dead
When the look that you get is as hard as the bread
You open your mouth but your stories are stale
From front door to back door it’s blowing a gale
You’ll know when love starts to fade

Crumbles down for my love
The pressure's down when your love
Lifts me up to the moon like a dove

You can do the left foot stepdown

Needs to be full of light
And when the sun meets the night
Prepare yourself for the world and the fight

You can do the left foot stepdown

Don't be too proud to turn around
Don't let it pass, it's here to last
Raise it up like a flag on the mast

And show my weakness
Tell me right on the limewire
Fighting for progress

There's a post in the ground so what we gonna do?
You can have all your dreams if you really believe
In something that's something true

Living life without reason
And they know who they are

Don't come forward too much
Don't go back so far

You can stay where you are

When you're out in the open
Where the sea meets the land
When you're tired of your running

Stand by my side

Stay still or you shatter

Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain a fallin'
Seems I hear your voice callin'
""It's all right""

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

Neon signs a flashin'
Taxi cabs and busses passin' through the night
The distant moanin' of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain to the night

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
I believe it's rainin' all over the world

How many times I've wondered
It still comes out the same
No matter how you look at it, think of it
You just got to do your own thing

I find me a place in a box car
So I take out my guitar to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest
And I'm all right

I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord
I can pick and shovel too
I can pick and shovel too, Lord, Lord

Gonna bring me a steam drill 'round
Gonna bring me a steam drill out on the job
Gonna whup that steel on down, Lord, Lord

Oh a man ain't nothin' but a man
'Fore I'd let your steam drill beat me down,
I'd die with my hammer in my hand, Lord, Lord

Looka yonder what I see,
Hole done choke, drill done broke,
And you can't drive steel like me, Lord, Lord
Can't drive steel like me
Oh no, you can't drive steel like me, no no
Can't drive steel like me

Well John Henry drove into the mountain,
His hammer was strikin' fire
He drove so hard he broke his poor heart
And he laid down his hammer and he died, Lord, Lord
Laid down his hammer and he died
He laid down his hammer and he died, Great God
Laid down his hammer and he died

When I heard my child in prayer.

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons,

I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

You can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That came all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could se Him
He said ""All men shall be sailors,
Then, until the sea shall free them""
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind

There are children in the morning

With her sweetheart by her side, 
Through the windowpane, she looked at the rain, 
""We must stay home, Joe,"" she cried. 
""There's a picnic, too, at the old Point View, 
It's a shame it rained today.""

And she heard him softly say,
""Wait till the sun shines, Nellie, 
When the clouds go drifting by, 
We will be happy, Nellie,

But he's just too frigging old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock
And the day John Lennon died
How the music made him happy
And the silence made him cry
Yea he thinks of John sometimes
And he has to wonder why

He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

He was sure back in the sixties
That everyone was hip
Then they sent him off to Vietnam
On his senior trip
And they force him to become a man
While he was still a boy
And behind each wave of tragedy
He waited for the joy
Now this world may change around him
But he just can't change no more

'Cause he's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

Well he stays away a lot now
From the parties and the clubs
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday
And pretty soon the species
Will just up and fade away
Like the smoke from that torpedo
Just up and fade away

He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie

He ain't trying to change nobody

Well, she dreams of white plantations
With ballrooms just for dancing
From a time when romance made girls' hearts beat fast
She's looking down that dirt road
For a handsome rebel soldier
Home from war to her arms, safe at last

I volunteer my love
To save her from herself
But if she can't have terror
She don't want nobody's help

And we don't believe you oughta be a bringin' up your little girl this way.""
And it was signed by the secretary, ""Harper Valley PTA.""

Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room
And as she walked up to the black board, I still recall the words she had to say
She said I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley PTA

Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there, and seven tims he's asked me for a date
And Mrs. Taylor seems to use a lotta ice, whenever he's away
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades a pulled completely down

Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip of gin
And then you have the nerve to tell me, you think that as a mother I'm not fit
Well this is just a little Peyton Place, and you're all Harper Valley hypocrites

No, I wouldn't put you on because, it really did happen just this way

The Bellamy Brothers,"I've had good luck, and bad luck
And no luck, it's true
But I always get lucky with you

I've been turned on, and turned down
When the bars close at two
But I always get lucky with you

I keep two strikes against me
Most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call
I'm minus a dime

There's been good days, and bad days
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you
Oh, I always get lucky with you",I Always Get Lucky with You,2006
