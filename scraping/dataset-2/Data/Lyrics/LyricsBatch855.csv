Planet Funk,"Baby I'm runnin' away, while the sun still burns
Whiskey don't sting anymore, so I'm drivin'

And now the air don't taste the same, in these ultraviolet days

The whiskey don't sting anymore,
It's like I've been screwed to the floor for such a long time 
Now something's bangin' the door and I'm gone

And now the air don't taste the same, in these ultraviolet days

I'm keepin' everything I find now
I'm savin' everything I see

Through the smoke I see you smiling

It's all gone and its all wrong",Ultraviolet Days [DVD],2005
Planet Funk,"Just when I'm thinking it was always you
The sun has gone and let the rain come through
The things I'm hearing I've already heard
But now I'm walking in a different world

Just when I'm feeling like I made it through
And still had something that they never knew
The artificial is controlling me
And I don't recognize a thing I see

And when it gets too late I'll be chasing you home
And when it gets too late I'll be chasing you home

Is this the dawning of a vacant age
I'm turning over to a ripped-up page
You look around with every step you take
'Cause someone's watching every move you make

Is this the morning we've been waiting for
You think you're walking through a shining door
You wait for nothing and it never comes
At least you know you're not the only one

And when it gets too late I'll be chasing you home
And when it gets too late I'll be chasing you home

Everything I needed
Every day I know

And when it gets too late I'll be chasing you home
And when it gets too late I'll be chasing you home
I'll be chasing you home",Everyday,2006

Sangue-bom você vai ter que me escutar

Fumo maconha porque não faz mal

Militares torturam e não foram pra prisão

By squeezin' me and just let my finger get to workin' with that
You know the game that I'm kickin' is fat
I met you last night and I already got the game in check
When you heard my words
I struck a bloody nerve
I see the way I got you jumpin' when I'm kissin' yo neck
Don't be afraid of them playa effects
Silly whoa don't you know that my game got you goin' for broke
So when you choke off that contact smoke
I got that game to break you down and plus a lil' some for yo throat
And when I'm done I'm ready to go
I'm walkin' out yo do'
I leave ya down butt-naked on the flo'
Understand that you messin' with a pro
When this night is over ain't no need for you to call me no mo'
Cause I'm headed to the next show
To get the next whoa to scheme her outta all her dough
y'all know what I came here fo'
A playa from the South spittin' true thang run 'em low
I want to be yo Candy-nigga

[Chorus]
Candyman
I want to be your Candyman
I want to be your Candyman
Let me  be your 
I want to be your Candyman
Your Candyman, your candy-licker, your Candyman - Candyman
I want to be your Candyman
Make you say
Oooooh

[Da Gangsta]
I know you want to bring yo cheese to me
Is it to keep it steady pleasin' me
That what it seems to be
Now let me tell ya what it means to me
I'll show you what you really need to see
If you come sleep with me

[The Pimp]
Now look here shawty called me up when he leave
I'll come on over beat you down all night to this song
You know the situation so wrong
Me creepin' and sneakin' up in yo house when yo man leave home
But this gator head on bone
You makin' it worse because you babblin' about yo thong
Boostin' me up on the phone
To come on in and creep what I can
And then I dash on
I got yo mind - oooh it's so blown
You know that it's gone
I bend you over headfirst to the floor
Girl I got the keys to yo door
You know you do understand when I lay you down I gotta go
You know what I came here for
So don't be trippin' when I come try to claim you don't know
We finna make a flick trick
So get on yo knees
We gon' call it ""Strip Deep Throat 4""
And to all the whoas that don't know
You need to stop teasin' and let a playa just splash in them hips
You need to lick around on the tip
I'm the Candyman so you know I got some sweet for them lips
I want to be

[Chorus]
Candyman
Your Candyman, your candy-licker, your Candyman
I want to be your Candyman
I want to be your
I want to be your Candyman
Your Candyman, your candy-licker, your Candyman
I want to be your Candyman
Make you say, make you say, make you say
Oooooh-ooooh-ooooh

Lay down on the floor let me hit it from the back
Why you trippin' baby why you actin' like that
I want to be your Candyman
I want to be your Candyman
I want to do things you never felt before
Let me be your Candyman - Candyman

To the point that my toes is out,
To the point that I can't look back and even if I did
Couldn't see where I started out,
Can't see home for miles,
Lost like another orphan child,
I'm only grinning cause I'm supposed to smile,
So I do it for the ones that are down and out
Proud one of theirs is gonna be a spokesman now,
But I'm still running, running, and I don't know where,
All I got to my name is one pair, of laced up chucks,
Five bucks, and a chip on my shoulder that's so big that I cannot bare,
I done lost my friends, family, and home for this,
And for that I have lost my mind,
Kept my faith, lost my direction
I'm just praying that I haven't lost my time, go!

I'm so tired of ducking,
Tired of coming home from my job being fired from nothing,
And shit I'm tired, from the nights a motherfucker took that ride,
To make that dream come alive,
Then wake up in the morning to a 9 to 5,
But I gotta do it if I wanna survive,
Because in the city where I'm from it's Either do or die,
So choose it wise because you could lose it in the blink of an eye

Love your brother

Because no one looks perfect except in Jesus' eyes
Take time to know your brothers
And open up their eyes

Mad from the world's lies he sees you
Preaching to a crowd
And comes to seek Jesus Christ
And when you tell him about the Lord
You'll see the fear in his eyes...

Cause you're my baby, my darlin'
So promise, promise me and I'll promise you
Promise and I'll make a vow to, to you girl
Cause from the moment I set eyes on you
I knew that fairy tales come true

[Bridge:]
Now I know I'm kind of young but I got an old soul
So I'ma break it down for you for a moment
And tell you how much I appreciate you
When you whisper in my ear ""baby it will be okay"",You make it better
Rub my body after a hards days work, you make it better
Wakin' up to you in the morning, you make it better
Late in the midnight hour, you make it better
Now I can be the riches man on earth and not have much at all
But we got something priceless

Planxty,"I had a first cousin called Arthur McBride
He and I took a stroll down by the by the sea side
A seeking good fortune and what might be tide
'Twas just as the day was a dawning
After resting we both took a tramp
We met Sergeant Harper and Corporal Cramp
Besides the wee drummer who beat up for camp
With his rowdy dow dow in the morning

Says he me young fellows if you will enlist
A guinea you quickly have in your fist
Likewise the crown for to kick the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning
From a soldier he leads a very fine life
He always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And always lives happy and charming

Ah now me bold sergeant we are not for sale
We'll make no such bargain, your bribe won't avail
We're not tried of our country we don't care to sail
Although that your offer is charming
And if we were such fools as to take the advance
This right bloody slander would be our poor chance
For the Queen wouldn't scruple to send us to France
Where we would be shot with out warning

He says me young fellows if I hear but one word
I instantly now will out with my sword
And into your body as strength will afford
So now my gay devils take warning
But Arthur and I we took in the odds
We gave them no chance for to launch out their swords
Our whacking shillelaghs came over their heads
And paid them right smart in the morning

As for the wee drummer we rifled his pouch
And we made a foot- ball of his rowdy dow dow
And into the ocean to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
As for the old rapier that hung by his side
We flung it as far as we could in tide
To devil I pitch you sez Arthur McBride
To temper your steel in the morning",Arthur Mcbride,1973
Planxty,"A blacksmith courted me
Nine months and better
He fairly won my heart
Wrote me a letter.
With his hammer in his hand
He looked so clever
And if I was with my love
I would live forever.

But where is my love gone
With his cheeks like roses
And his good black Billycock on
Decked around with primroses.
I fear the shining sun
May burn and scorch his beauty
And if I was with my love
I would do my duty.

Strange news is come to town
Strange news is carried
Strange news flies up and down
That my love is married.
I wish them both much joy
Though they can't hear me
And may God reward him well
For the slighting of me.

Don't you remember when
You lay beside me
And you said you'd marry me
And not deny me.
If I said I'd marry you
It was only for to try you
So bring your witness love
And I'll not deny you.

No, witness have I none
Save God Almighty
And may he reward you well
For the slighting of me.

It made a poor heart tremble

And he proved deceitful.

He came unto a farmer's door a lodging for to gain
The farmer's daughter she came down and viewed him cheek and chin
She says, He is a handsome man. I pray you take him in

We'll go no more a roving, a roving in the night
We'll go no more a roving, let the moon shine so bright
We'll go no more a roving

But he would in the corner lie down by the kitchen fire
o then the beggar's bed was made of good clean sheets and hay
And down beside the kitchen fire the jolly beggar lay

The farmer's daughter she got up to bolt the kitchen door
And there she saw the beggar standing naked on the floor
He took the daughter in his arms and to the bed he ran
Kind sir, she says, be easy now, you'll waken our goodman

Now you are no beggar, you are some gentleman
For you have stolen my maidenhead and I am quite undone
I am no lord, I am no squire, of beggars I be one
And beggars they be robbers all, so you re quite undone

Planxty,"As I roved out on a bright May morning
To view the meadows and flowers gay
Whom should I spy but my own true lover
As she sat under yon willow tree

I took off my hat and I did salute her
I did salute her most courageously
When she turned around well the tears fell from her
Sayin' ""False young man, you have deluded me

A diamond ring I owned I gave you
A diamond ring to wear on your right hand
But the vows you made, love, you went and broke them
And married the lassie that had the land""

""If I'd married the lassie that had the land, my love
It's that I'll rue till the day I die
When misfortune falls sure no man can shun it
I was blindfolded I'll ne'er deny""

Now at nights when I go to my bed of slumber
The thoughts of my true love run in my mind
When I turned around to embrace my darling
Instead of gold sure it's brass I find

And I wish the Queen would call home her army
From the West Indies, Amerikay and Spain
And every man to his wedded woman
In hopes that you and I will meet again.

But bad luck to my father that made me serve the queen

Deep was the talk as we lay on your bed.
It didn't seem wrong to sing a sad song.
Sabra girl, soon you'd be gone.

Early, the morning and sad the goodbye.
With a wave of your hand and a smile of your eye.
So lately did meet, no sooner to part.
Sabra girl, homeward must start.

Rosy, the lines that you wrote with your hand.
Reading between them to misunderstand,

I made the mistake you said not to make.


Yes, reading your letters conviction did grow.
I thought it a chance and I knew I must go.
It's hard to believe I could be so naive.

I'm forced to repair the breach in my wall.

I bid New Orleans adieu.
And I took the road to Jackson town,
My fortune to renew,
I cursed all foreign money,
No credit could I gain,
Which filled my heart with longing for

I stepped on board a railroad car,
Beneath the morning sun,
I road the roads till evening,
And I laid me down again,
All strangers there no friends to me,
Till a dark girl towards me came,
And I fell in love with a Creole girl,

My money here's no good,

I'd sleep out in the wood"".

But we never turn a stranger out,

To try and paint her beauty,
I'm sure it would be in vain,
So handsome was my Creole girl,
By the lakes of Pontchartrain.

I asked her if she'd marry me,
She said it could never be,
For she had got another,
And he was far at sea.
She said that she would wait for him
And true she would remain.

We don't know how to cope with ourselves,
Or to love our mates for being themselves.

Plastic Ono Band,"I flew a kite, I held on tight to its string
Each time I go anywhere, I held on tight
In the middle of the night I woke up in fright
Thinking maybe in my dream I let go my kite

When I was in a restaurant talking to my friends
Watching their mouths move faster and faster
I thought of the kite that was flying the sky
And made sure that my hand was holding the string

That was long time ago
Many skies went by since then
Now my hands stopped holding anything
And I've learned to take a walk instead

Then one day in an evening light
I saw something strange shining bright
The sky was dark with swarms of larks
And in the midst of it all, yes, it was my kite

How did the kite get there? I never know
Floating away among the clouds to where nobody knows

I held my gun with both my hands
Slowly aiming at the shining dot
The shot went off, that dot blew off
Since then I've never seen the kite again",Kite Song,1973

But they never tell you which is up and which is down.

The weight gets heavier when you've bled thirty years.
Show me your blood, john, and I'll show you mine,
They say it's running even when you're asleep.

No trace of resentment, no trace of regrets,
One blood's thinner but both look red and fresh.
If I ever die, please go to my daughter
And tell her that she used to haunt me in my dreams.

I listen to the soundless phone.

My thighs are sweaty, freezing inside,
Our bed's empty as ever.

What a bastard you are,
Leaving me all night missing you.

Slowly the door opens, you stand for a while,
See if I'm asleep or just closing my eyes.

I quickly get up and throw my pillows,
Throw an ashtray filled with butts.

Where were you all night if I may ask you so?
Though I don't care at all, I'd just like to know.

Right! you weren't near the phone to call me from,
Or is it you were afraid to wake me up?
I'm sick and tired of listening to the same old crap.

You know half the world is occupied with you pigs,
I can always get another pig like you.
You've heard of female liberation, well, that's for me,
You'll see me walk out one day and then where will you be?

But don't you be too happy,
I ain't walking out yet to give you satisfaction,
I'm first gonna find something other than the walls
To have some human conversation.

Then I'll glow, I'll be happy inside, my limbs will relax.
And I can walk out into the world, singing with my people.

But now I couldn't even move my muscles to go near the door,
I've been sitting here too long and my legs are numb.

Are you listening, you jerk, you pig, you bastard,
You scum of the earth, you good for nothing?

Are you listening?

Oh, don't go, don't go, please, don't go,
I didn't mean it, I'm just in pain.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Making herself a breakfast.

Watching the trees grow day by day.

Taking my man away from me,
Taking the world away from me.

Female lib is nice for joan of arc,
But it's a long, long way for terry and jill.

Few of us are encouraged to get a job for skill.

Closed her diary she'd kept for two scores

Salem, Salem, witches must be hung

Let my daughter burn my book
Let her learn to sew and cook
Teach her not to read but weave
Ask her not to speak but weep

Salem, Salem, witches must be hung

Sally Kegley knows how to cure the ill
Sally Kegley sees through us at will

Salem, Salem, witches must be hung

All the town's people rushing to the hill
Their eyes shining, ready for the kill
Sally's flesh bound to the cross
Her eyes searching for the ones who are close

Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Help! Help! Help! Help!

Must kill, must hang, must kill, must hang
Must kill, must hang, must kill, must hang
Must kill, must hang, must kill, must hang

We allow men who wanna join us

Playing the mind guerrilla
Chanting the Mantra peace on earth

Love is the answer and you know that for sure
Love is a flower
You got to let it, you gotta let it grow

So keep on playing those mind games together
Faith in the future out of the now
You just can't beat on those mind guerrillas
Absolute elsewhere in the stones of your mind
Yeah we're playing those mind games forever
Projecting our images in space and in time

Yes is the answer and you know that for sure
Yes is surrender
You got to let it, you gotta let it go

If you could drink dreams like Irish streams

How the English divided the land
Of the pain and the death and the glory
And the poets of auld Eireland

Let's walk over rainbows like leprechauns
The world would be one big blarney stone

Blame it all on the kids and the I.R.A.

Ya ha salido una reforma de resolución 
Yo he buscado los insectos dentro de mi cabeza 
Y un amor se ha comido mi noche de acción 
Ya
Yeah! 
Dame toda la resequedad que hay en tu aroma 
Vengo dentro de una espora 
Soy el resultado de tu genio de autora
 
Subes por tu vicio de diva psicópata 
Me encanta una parte de tu vida erótica 
Por eso aquí te espero moldeando tus huesos 
Que tal ves yo algún día te rompa los sesos 
Sales de la esquina de la luz fluorescente 
Grito de emoción, se va integrando la gente 
Corro por mi abrigo empapado de vino 
Esto no tiene sentido solo se que estoy vivo 
Porque esto es 
El banano's bar 

Corro a besar tu carne 
Son los besos de una gran institución 
Que brilla por la pasión 
Ya llego la solución para esta masa de infección

Me revienta la manera de pensar
En que no existes
Que solo eres mi soledad
Buscando otra pieza
En esta pobre habitación
Que no conoce de colores
Aunque intenta buscar amores de 16 bytes
Y se nubla mi mirada ante la luz de una pantalla
Que produce mil sonidos que se mezclan
Entre el vino, un cigarro y mi destino

Me disuelvo entre sistemas
Lo hacen todo diferente
Para mi no existe nada mas que verte
Es inútil deshacerte
He soñado con besarte
Corro hacia los bares de ilusiones
Donde cantan las canciones
Buscando emociones para reflejarme en tu silencio
Te sigo comiendo

And when you feel your intentions stray
Remember that love is the reason
The good things in life don't come easy

On the telephone when I could be touching your face
For me emotion takes a mighty long time
But soon the light will shine in
And you will start to understand

Buy me a blunt, 'cause I love to get high
Got nuthin' but time

I once used to play ball 'til the lights came off
Somebody mama shoutin' loud 'cause they gotta go home
I just wanna roll around in my brand new car
Gotta brand new son, I'ma brand new star

Roll through the hood, and I call my old friends

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Weil sein Bauch fetter ist als der Mount Everest
Merk' dir, dass dich das Label mit dem Boxhandschuh killt
Er ist so fett, dass ihn nicht einmal die Bosst-TraFo hilft

Ich ficke Mütter und ich werd' dabei vom Banger gemanagt
Ihr blufft so mies, bis man euch in die Köpfe schießt
Ja, ihr möchtet Beef, doch endet dann bei uns als Köftespieß
Deine ganze Truppe verkauft unter tausend Platten (tze)
Aber rappen so als würden sie die Hunderttausend knacken, ja
Vor ein paar Jahren war ich noch supportlos
Mein Album fickt so sehr, ich lad' die Scheiße bei YouPorn hoch, ah
Pornodreh (ja), volles Portmonnaie
Farid sagte, „Fick Mütter!“, ich sagte, „Sofort, okay!“
Diese Szene ist ein Puppentheater
Erst kollaborieren sie, dann dissen die Mutter und Vater (he)
Guckt mal, das hier sind schon wieder echte Lieder, die dein Ende bringen (ja)
Wir ticken nicht mehr richtig, so wie Dealer, die in Rente sind
Die Kripo ist an nicht gezahlten Steuergeldern dran
Bringst du mein Album mit nach Hause, geht der Feuermelder an, arh

Wer hat deutschen Rap gefickt? Fragen über Fragen
Wir rappen unser Leben, sieh, die Marken, die sie tragen

Back wid plenty work to do, Playa job is never through
Just another busta bustin' hustla cause my game is true
Do or die, down wid you, jumpin out Fly wi-zay fool
Work is bought and time is short, that won't keep this playa cool
Must I come up wid it from decision sittin' on the bluff
Workin' out to rock the house, many youngsters get it buck
Rollin' wid the rough and tough, risin' wid the early sun
All about my hog, standin tall, when my job is done
Then you know that I'm the one, only one, for the one,
One who gives me power over cowards till thy kingdom come
Fly will be second to none, toastin' every chauvinist
Male or female makes me bail when I choose to dis
My time that rock market pacin' poppin' on Fly paperchase
Not illegal ain't sequel the playa moves on me makin' pay
Sayin' what I want to man, cause I'm backed up by a crew
Down wid me to clown wid me, what Flizy got work to do

Oh ohohhhh, Fly, Fly, Fly got work to do

[Verse 2: Playa Fly]
Tell me how to do my job, boy that ain't your job to do
If you plan on yankin' Playa, Playa plan on yankin' you
Most unlawful entry of the century that you ever seen
Don't attack my dollars you will holla as this playa gleam
Stealin' robbin' killin' mobbin' never is a job ah mine
But if Funkytown take me under, I'm bonin' you all the time
Insist to commit a crime, Allah is not likin' you
When you play wid the child of God, my God gon' play wid you
Still wid plenty work to do, speak or hold a brother's peace
Playa choose to represent with intent to make mil increase
Opposition is deceased, Fly response for some and pay
Ain't got time for cuttin' games that you suckas choose to play
Your plan I will infiltrate, I'm strapped wid the piece of manner
Like other down brothas Flizy got sense and that ain't my kind
Playa is the subject of the public with nothing to prove
Don't you try to tell me Flizy know what Playa gotta do, gotta do

Rappin of my mission with intention to this pimpin' now
Stackin' up some paper cuttin' capers takin' lemons out
Workin' out and showin' out to be the best that Fly can be
Easy done and easy said will sure and that's forever G
Chuckle back me up, if a playa  have to handle this
Fly ain't got no work boots cause my family who I'm rollin' wit
In this click you can enlist, it's reserved that you deserve
For the unique motivated playa showin' skill superb

Pee wee we gon' get 'em if they crossin' out yo fi-zo G
Since you issue idle threats, boy you betcha come correct
More determine than Kermit and you Miss Piggy so get it checked
Stay away from this Playa Fly, hangin' low and chiefin' high
I'll be found with the crown on me with the sound like no other guy

A mellow level big and better still I'm all in ya face

And spread it out through Minnie Mae cause that's who runnin' with me
We movin' up and stayin' down maan that all that we know
We walk the top of bean stalks
While hatin jackers below
And if I felt that a step taker sat in my place
I'm takin two and droppin' you and Flizy do it so haste
Maan! You and Reg we was down here so young
And Mr Mark from SPL 
2nd graders we hung
As years past, I thought I knew what birthdays meant
But never knew until I recalled all the time that I spent
People think they thankin' bankin' but they only maintain
Before they know they bout to blow it and they losin' the game
Ain't nothin' change but the days and the dollars I make
And shit I take but playa fly gon' keep ahold of some faith

2nd round more down than I was before
And like BP I'm on the move because I stay on the go
And got a mean lookin team on the side of my hip
To put some smiles on our face you need to toss us some grip
It's playa ship take a trip all around the world
With me and frost tossin' crowns to the ones that deserve
Full of herb, so superb, and Fly ain waitin' no mo'
I have no patience but you won't playa face in the blow
Cause wastin' time is a crime and it ain't on my mind
Rollin' gold and I'm prized til the day that I'm dyin'
I ain't lyin' cause I got a back and boy that's tuff
I mean they ruffer than the soldiers in the persian gulf
And when we buck you out of luck
Cause it's time to drop
Once we commense it gets intense until the time that we stop
So understand in ya brain
I know the rules to the game
And when a playa say its ova
You'll be feelin' some pain

[Playa Fly]
Yeah it's number three and Ibn hopin' that you rollin' with me
As a matter of fact a playa know it cause you show it to P
And all this love for the Fly I'm trappin' deep inside
To motivate and pick me up
When I'm choosin' to glide
As I go from coast to coast again proposin' a toast
But this one here is to my baby that be lovin' me most
So watch me roll across the globe until ya eyes get tired
And I might slow it down when my child retires
I know it's real but it's just a lil mess that I made
Super trill so I'm movin' on perfectin' a trade
And Flizy raised any which a way I'm choosin' to flow
Droppin' bows to the floe'  with they face in the snow
So don't oppose or uphold any grudges with me
Fly gon' bring a tone and bone and knock you flat off your feet
When Minnie Mae get in ya face
We ain't comin' to play
We gettin' it on and movin' on and that the way it'a stay

No mo procrastination, this time I rock the nation,

I wrote lil Fly a letter, and read it to his fizace,
and let that Many Mizade, you local vocal nutcase,
complete this integration, and max irratication,
of those who try to block me, from Fli-zy destinaion,
a modern day plantation, is where them crackers trapped us,
them bustaz took our culture, them bloody Dego bastards,
but Flizy in rebelous, with rightoeusness to tell ya,
you take this lit and run wit it, or sit and be a failier,
and Fly refuse to answer, to iligetiment bastards,
them G.O.D and Flizy, gonna bring natural disaster.",Situation,1998

I wake and shake and love the way Fly throw these dirty dice of life
They keep me right and hype and super sharp just like a carver's knife
Out of sight, like a step I keep myself when ima see some mo
More than I been seeing and being in the sight of Mary Joe

Kiss of death ya like I'm Sonya, hang ya like the Lisa Mona

Kiss the only son of bill see-h-i double L, can't you tell

The deal is done in fly and won, the wiz-un that made you run.
Run when flizy start to gun, gun you with my lyrics son
Unique like the chosen one. On tony I'm the frozen one.

Bustin all up out the wall 'cause all this love we can't contain
Fly need love like Fly need blood,

This is ain't no endin road I'll mob as far as far can go

So fly gone wine and dine and entertwine some music with my mind,
WATCH ME SHINE, like the sun , shine until thy kingdom come,
Shine till each and every hoping face come taste the realest one

Ups and downs and turn-arounds surround me on this mortal ground
Pump it like a shotgun, holes in the back will quickly take you down
I break up out submission holds, with the bearings I control
The entire 70 minutes that you feelin from your stereo, HERE WE GO 
M's and Ones extend his arms ,
Cool and calm we cannot be, 
Buckin like a zulu tribe cause from inside like a LUV
off the hook like Fly streak be, R.I.P. big D.O.G 
Fly gone do it to 'em like ya told me make 'em feel me
Keep the kindness all up in me, keep the realest rollin' wit me
Tricklets are the realest in ya sight so don't you try to trick me 
Stick me with the family first, real so real so real it hurts
This game will get to much and start to lovin how this mafia works
With dirt fall from off the hurt
that's when I-be	-N choose to give this up
And Flizy giz-on diz-ie tryin [gon die tryin]
to piz-you'll miz-i ends on up
Strut my stuff and get it up in such ways you thought you wouldn't see
See me cause I am the real and know you gone be feelin me.

And I'm older than a motherfucker, but they still ask me
For my ID, when I buy MGD, feel me?

'Cause I've got [Incomprehensible] in my family, uh huh
And I've got bitches that's finer than Vanity, hmm
Plus I'm not living above my means, buying Rolexes and rings
Flossing cars that I can't afford, lovin' these bitches and whores

You know, I never broke myself to see no hoe
Never did time, never took no pride in bein' cruised
Don't give a fuck about a pink slip, loose lips, sink ships
Hundred miles at least, when I sign a new lease

I never trick off my fanny with these bitches
You got to be clever, gots to keep your mind on your riches
And stop doin' the things that keep you broke
And keepin' niggaz names in your mouth
That you shouldn't have spoke, no doubt, I'm dope

In this game eight years, some of my peers have moved on
I proceed to succeed, I've stayed within my zone
I'm the baddest motherfucker, yet it's me that you despise

Up in somethin', keep 'em comin', Playa Hamm be the source

Of the force you now witness, and this is just
Another stone in the succession of the nutties I bust
The homies told me don't put no cut on it, keep it raw
If you want 'em bangin', P clique swangin' down the shore

Tricks out here, tryin' to make hits instead of makin it hard hittin'
And perpetratin' frauds when they spittin'
The game is full of twisters and misters quick to do low
Victims of vendettas and busters infraredders, you know

What type of forty it is, when in the presence
Of the G's, pushin' P's, players, we be the essence
For life, it's the JB and pimpin' Carl

Messin' with what I stand on, but trick you find to get ate up

Disintegrates her kind like battery acid

I'm a pimp, but you don't know
You better stand up, now empty out your purse I told you
Get out, I don't trust your ass, now throw your hands up

Take it to the bump-bump-be-ba-dump
Dip, give me my chips, witchcraft
Now let me see what I can check you with now

Excuse me baby but, didn't I look you in your eyes
And tell you what you was?
Told you somebody sent you, but this here's what a pimp does

Ho, what, you can't see me with it, why, probably 'cause

And subject to make your trick, go get it

Y un pie tras otro pie se arrastran hacia el día
La fruta y la miel me saben a hojas de papel
Y las 9:33 se sienten tan vacías

La vida cambia de dirección
Las horas pierden su sentido y su voz
Y van dejando lentamente mi corazón

Y así el tiempo va pasando lentamente
Y en un instante lo que siento va perdiendo color
Y va saliendo poco a poco de mi mente
Devuelve el tiempo cuando la vida tenia sabor

Las horas que se van, doy la espalda y ya no estas
Y cada suspirar se lo lleva el día
Las diez para las diez se hizo tarde otra vez
El agua y el café se llenan de apatía

El llega primero y la imagina alta y con los ojos miel 
Lleva en su mano el papel con el anuncio 
Que solicita un apuesto hombre de bien

Sera aquel que sonríe y la mira 

Ahí algo que ilumnina 
Algo que sienten hoy 
Por que aunque no se ven mueve al mundo y 
Lo llena de fe 
Es la mas hermosa sensación 

Como era primera ves un silencio tierno los domina 
No se atreven a creer que les puede suceder 
Solo con mirar entenderían que ella era para el 
Y sus ojos de miel erizaban su piel 
Y ella encuentra en sus manos la vida

Still candy in the paint, still riding them things
And most my folks would say I'm happy but I still feel pain
Until I, jump in my ride, that's my only escape
Me and my automobile's got these neighbors screaming, ""Gimme a break!""

Television on the gas tank, the fuel make the ass stank
I mean to be rude, my bass tubes are in a glass tank
Go strap your seat-belts on, go put your money up
Go put your life on the line, go put your honey up

Hit with the ratchet thats how shit happens

Y que mi padre me recuerde
A Dios le pido

Que te quedes a mi lado
Y que mas nunca te me vayas mi vida

De amarte se trate mi cielo

Un segundo más de vida para darte
Y mi corazón entero entregarte
Un segundo más de vida para darte
Y a tu lado para siempre yo quedarme
Un segundo más de vida yo

Y si me enamoro sea de vos
Y que de tu voz sea este corazón

So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone

A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Playdough,"When the moon shines at noontime, and the sun blazes at midnight
Dark and Night coincide, I stay inside and keep the lid tight
Catch side of the morning that passes by through my window
Another child is born, another dies, and still the wind blows
Spin slow, drawn into strong voice of reason
Standing there in soul thinking of summer ?
Just longin' for another season
For no particular Reason hear I stand-
Just rocked another show, just can't remember where I am
And my families far from here, but the stars are bright this evening
On this morning on this afternoon, just got here now I'm leaving
And I shall remember the marble just as clear as I do yesterday
Never dance with the Devil, 'cause I can't afford the hell to pay
When I blast through your speakers every time your pressing play
When I fish the phonograph so we could set the record straight
Dear god I pray-
Just let me show this world a better way
How you helped through to your heart and all the times you fade away
I get to, say these words and speak my piece to Catholic Crowds
Not certain if it's Day or Night but I know the time is NOW
And if we ever lose the purpose as a prelude to the sound
Lets just call it a Day, and burn my empires to the ground...

Ya, amazingly, Cask of Amanciatto
Cracks wide open and vibrates your bravado
So I escape, body-bagging, like I'm kinda like Monte Christo
World Tour, DL, Koffeshop, and I'm coming to your Bistro
We show bright when it comes to your ability
I'll be yellin' out homonyms 'cause I dwell in possibility
We gonna call it a Day, 'cause I know your feelin' me
Listener, Rapper, Popuri of Life- all synonyms of Cornucopia
I'm so glad you have a wife- In this wolf eat samurai world
You better grab your swords and saw your nads off
You'll get chopped off by the needle as it spins over to my rhyme, yo.

Day and night
Wrong or right
Spill our guts with every breath on the mike
And hope you call it tight
If it's blind give it sight
If it's Dark make it Light
Some call it Music
Deepspace calls it Life

Workin' it out (out), placin' my feet to concrete
Hittin' the street with vengeance, steangence, so sweet
What bitter we consider every circle we pass
Probl'why the reason that I reason with class, so step fast
We pushed and finally pushed that was burnin' staying determined
And yearnin' 'cause the lessons we learnin' were life long (life long)
Its my song, I place to erase
And transpose all these average Joes
With weak flows-
Who knows not, -
The true livin' roles who ascended, blended
With the beat, compete, and apprehended
Today's feelin' all right, color all right
 Being blocked by the shotgun and pray every day and night
Now I've gone a full day without some wackness heard
The One's speakin' absurd-
Are finally heeding my word.   (ya right)
And now I'm left with nothing else to say
That be the Night that I Called it A Day (Called it a Day)

I'm gonna throw thoughts to a page
Let 'em fall where they please
Let 'em rise to the sky, rain down, on four seas
An ocean of possibilities that dwellin'
Yellin' at the top of my lungs convicted by stone tablets as a felon
A nocturnal being of love since the grown of time
Watch the sunrise with both my daughter's eyes
Permanent Shine, refine my reflection inside
Livin' to die, dyin' to live, and all glory given back to God

It was the Night that 24 turned into 12
Had to adjust my spiral off, from the top of the shelf
On the blank page, using the utensil of potential
I'm diggin' in my Brain so I could Rip the Instrumental
With 20 bars left, and I'm consistent from the intro
Lighting candle sticks, as the rain hits my window
Need to focus in, take the topic and let it flow
Got 8 down for the count and 16 to go
The Writer's blocks are stepping stones
Towards the metronome
I'm racing dead last
I'm head last
Placed on my prose
Nocturnal with my journal, a wordplay professor
The aggressor, resembling soda cans under pressure
I'm shakin' but not stirred, deterrent from my train of think
Now I'm aligned, readjusted to infuse the ink
I want to handcuff the hands of time
No great spirit here allotted for here's the sunshine...

[Chorus]

Bet I'm casting nets and dreads
The deep blue ways are wet?????
God's Silhouette, I want to palettes painted pink by suns and sets
BURNT from a long days work, but feelin' fine
Tip his cap and path the moon on his back, his day declines
Candlelight Switch as you slip into the evening
A courtesy to the sun, as it dips below the ceiling
Feeling sort of satellite, like the wind beneath my wings
Or the tightrope, or gravity keeps lunar kites on orbit strings
Man on the moonlight, dream before my time
Like the moon reflects the sun, I make the black begin to shine
Like the moon rewinds the waters, makes the ocean recline
I collapse your mind; I'm Syntax, but melancholy kind
Redefine the best, framed fresh in terms of holiness
Bless the mike, device, 'cause I get nice to keep the conscious
And I split tense mint's spit words like sentence fragments
Moon dust the must 'cause I ain't' in it for the cabbage
The incandescent presence spins, as I'm your present flame
But my name would flicker out my name syntax the wax and wane
For the name above names, I'm so glad that Christ came
The black bird bright the night, we called it a Day...

Shadows step on the one, on, under every tongue, run
Spoken sentence frags., spoken on shattered breaks
It's a black hole soul with my faith as I take

Break Minutes back with father time to coordinate seconds
I surround the 11th hour with sound as my weapon

Villain threatened to sweat the syndrome of the wicked
Heading for your Auditory where the Listener would stick it

Fiction, we're steel, when it breaks from the construction
Crushing your framework and far surpassing your presumption

Sunrays, like a score with notes my surfacing
Great mad at meteors or record the all heed

And when the, Sun Sets
Some one lets the mike down
We pipe down, unplug it and leave it hide down
But not before we retire the pen
'cause yo tomorrow we'll be back just to do it again

Uh, shackled and scarred
I still maintain my praise of dark days
A sullen world covered in pain
So from Dusk 'till Dawn, I represent his word

that little lamb took my sin made it white as snow 
and every where that the lamb will go

kicking freestyle raps for scraps of spare change 
to change my money range and cry like Danny Ainge 
till I make enough checks to win back my ex girl friend 
I can't pretend I didn't wish that I'd never seen her ill demeanor 
and this fly dish and the spoon ran away broke out to Santa Fe 
left me cold ain't seen her since Saturday 
but hey I got to say I been dissed since way back 
bought a girl a knick knack but patty was wack 
in fact I'll get em all back using my rap sheet 
and make em outcast singing bah with the black sheep 
and take them to phat beats and show them my work 
and have them say I'm the man and play them out like a jerk 
and flirt with a wink and eyebrow on tilt 
and leave them there while I go to the house that Jack built singing..

don't get me started on Jack be Nimble 
I mean that cat's the kind of dude who just always seems to stay in trouble 
he always got to hustle kicking it with the 3 blind mice 
on the corner selling magic beans rolling dice 
now I be giving him advice but he can't understand 
Patty Cake? she used to chill w/ the bakers man 
she got God in her life now and if you see her right now 
it's a whole another sight now 
see I be quite proud just to see how Christ showed and blowed up 
and just turned her whole life around 
sometime I'm wishing I was living in a nicer town 
you know a place where London bridge ain't always falling down 
ya boy Old McDonald he's a little older now 
he had a farm but well it's kind of gone for now 
but see I'm a hold it down cause I got to stay praying 
and every time I come around y'all can hear me saying

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

At the risk of being crude

To leave your lover

Make a new plan, Stan
You don't need to be coy, Roy

You don't need to discuss much
Just drop off the key, Lee
And get yourself free

She said it grieves me so
To see you in such pain
I wish there was something I could do
To make you smile again
I said I appreciate that
And would you please explain
About the fifty ways

She said why don't we both
Just sleep on it tonight
And I believe in the morning
You'll begin to see the light
And then she kissed me

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Pleasant Gehman,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Pleasant Joe,"""I'm the Sheik of Araby, 
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep 
Into your tent I'll creep.
The stars that shine above,
Will light our way to love.
You'll rule this land with me;",The Sheik of Araby,1992
Pleasant Peasants,"It's been a miracle from what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

The question is what do I know about love
They ask me all the time do I know about love
Naturally I say yes but I don't know shit
'cause if I did I wouldn't be in and out of relationships
Why? Do I get caught up in eye candy
A few days I pound she ain't nowhere to be found
Everyday I pull so many dimes
I need to change my middle name to one line
'cause I got so many one liners
I try to tell her I was ready to go all the way
But she couldn't be patient with me
And now look at the end result
She ain't here to get these roses I brought
But I'ma keep my self-esteem up
And keep looking for some real love
You know its true what they say
Love's as precious as a rose
Will I ever find a rose I don't know

It's been a miracle from what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

I seen it coming way before we got here
You want me to put you over my whole career
My career was here first and its here to stay
Don't trip girl you're still a prior life and
Movie sets, rhyming, singing, and world tours
If I ain't got a rose in my life then what's it all for
You think I wanna be in private jets
Laid up in five star hotels by myself
Nope I want a rose to share with
The blessing of a backbone but I can't stay alone
I come home to a home cooked meal
A manicure pedicure without seeing a bill
Am I describing you I don't know
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life living single
Patience is a virtue that's the way that it goes
The question is will I find my rose is that you

It's been a miracle from what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one
The righteous way to go
Been a while but no
I'll believe if I'm told so
You're second to none

My moms taught me not to wear emotions on my sleeves
So when I leave please believe I'ma leave man
I'm not a charity case
But you might have to donate some love tips and show me the way
'cause if I really knew it all
You think y'all would have to talk to me about how to love and all
Naw I'd be on top of the world
At twenty seven with a wife, pregnant, and white picket fences and shit
It's cool I'ma get there soon
Running around in the yard having fun with my little ones
Thinking to myself I had my share
There's gonna be women everywhere
Not like the one I got here
Independent, fine as hell and got her own career
And if I ever needed her
She'll be right there
Is that you damn

I don't know what else to say man
I feel like I got something
But at the same time I don't
It's lonely out here
You can have all the money in the world
That shit don't matter
You know what I'm saying
When you broke you want money
And when you get money
You just want a girl to lay up with
And chill and relax and shit
You know",Roses,2008

Even though I'm not your man, you not my girl

Soon as I seen her, shit told her I'd pay for it
Lil mama the baddest thing `round here and she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her I'd let her blow it
The hottest nigga in the city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was a real nigga and she went for it
First time I [called ?] her shit, she ain't even know how to throw it back
Now she an animal, I got her sex game right
I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life
I gotta train her, now she suck me with ice
I call her my lil bustie baby cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, ain't gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right

Know why they wanna beat [badly ?], look at all that ass on her
Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love when she act like she bo-legged and bend the [corner ?]
She proud to be fuckin me, cause I'm stuntin on `em
It feel good to be fuckin a real nigga don't`uh
Ain't called her in two days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her
That's why I don't mind breakin her off, cause she aint with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil mama
You know she gotta be somethin, cause I done beat [her under ?]
[?] snatchin [?], I'm tellin ya, I promise
I exposed her to real, and now she hate lame
Member she used to run from me, now she like pain
She call me sometimes just to ask is it her thing

Pleasure Club,"I am a shotgun rider,
For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

We are heroes of the homeland, American remains
We live in many faces and answer many names
We will not be forgotten, we won't be left behind
Our memories live on in mortal minds
And poets pens
We'll ride again

I am a mid-west farmer,
I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,
I'm a liberated man
But the rain it hasn't fallen,
Since the middle of July,
And if it don't come soon my crops will die
The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win
I'll ride again
