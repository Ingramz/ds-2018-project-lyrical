Nota Bene,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show

A sudar caldo de oso panda

Fuera de ritmo con las piernas sambas

They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?

Love always leads to the highest sound

We loved with every step we take, I'll be okay

How do you love when your heart is broken?
How do you speak when you feel outspoken?
I can forgive and be forgiven
By learning to heal with a heart wide open

With open hearts, despite the stakes
We take a chance on our mistakes
A brand new day, we will embrace
An open wound that heals with grace
All the fears that we will face
In this time, and in this place
When you can say, and I can say
We loved with every step we take, I'll be okay

How do you speak when you feel outspoken?

We live in the rain, a sea of change
You can't keep anything you take
The lovely face of lives we chase
Is but dust for wind to take
When all is gone, the only loss
Is to not have loved at every cost
When you can say, and I can say
We loved with every step we take, I'll be ok

How do you love when your heart is broken?
How do you speak when you feel outspoken?
I can forgive and be forgiven
By learning to heal with a heart wide open (how do you love when your heart is broken?)

I'll be okay (how do you love when your heart is broken?)
I'll be okay (how do you love when your heart is broken?)

Nothing More,"When you opened your eyes on the world for the first time as a child; 
How brilliant the colors were; 
What a jewel the sun was; what marvel the stars; 
How incredibly alive the trees were 
And to love again and again, 
And have people to whom we are deeply attached go to sleep and never wake up
And the laughter echoes only in one's mind... but then the echo goes
The memory, the traces are all gone
 
All your efforts, all your achievements, 
All your attainments turning into dust, nothingness
What is the feeling? what happens to you?
 
The idea of God as the potter, the architect of the universe, 
It makes you feel that life is, after all, important, 
That there is someone who cares. 
It has meaning, it has sense, and you are valuable in the eyes of the father 
But after a while it got embarrassing, the superstition, the myth, 
The absolutely unfounded idea why does anybody believe that?
 
So you become an atheist, and then you feel terrible 
After that because you got rid of God
But that means you got rid of yourself, you're just nothing but a machine
And your idea that you're a machine is just a machine too (a machine in the system)
 
So if you think that that's the way things are, you feel hostile to the world. 
You feel that the world is a neurological trap into which you somehow got caught trapped  You run from the maternity ward to the crematorium and that's it that's it
So if you're a smart kid you commit suicide
 
Now I want to propose another idea all together 
The real you, is not a puppet which life pushes around. 
The real you, the real deep down you, is the whole universe. 
You cannot confine yourself to what happens inside the skin. 
Your skin doesn't separate you from the world, it's a bridge. 
But just as a magnet polarizes its-self in north and south but its all one magnet, 
So experience polarizes itself as ""Self"" and ""Other"", but it's all one.

What you call the ""External world"" is as much you as your own body
Most people think that when they open they're eyes 
And look around that what they are seeing is outside
It seems, doesn't it, that you are behind your eyes
We haven't realized that life and death, black and white, 
Good and evil, being and non-being, come from the same center
 
When you look for your own particularized center of being 
Which is separate from everything else, you won't be able to find it
The only way you'll know it isn't there is if you look hard enough, 
To find out that it isn't there
It isn't there at all, there isn't a separate you
There are, in physical reality, no such things as separate events
 
People can't be talked out of illusions 
If a person believes that the earth is flat, 
You can't talk him out of that, he knows that it's flat 
He'll go down to the window and see that its obvious, it looks flat 
So the only way to convince him that it isn't is to say, 
""Well let's go and find the edge"".",Pyre,2014

Stuck inside, half alive

Drowning just to keep score

We always start with good intentions
But lose ourselves along the way

This is the time that we let it go
These are the words that will take us home
Singing the song that's inside us all
If we don't open our eyes we're walking blind

Anchored in anger, we exile ourselves
Bitter blood builds our prison cell
Darker water now fills our lungs
The depths of our heart have blacked the sun

You can't see because you don't know

Fools we are, to hold tightly
We are the jail, we are the key
We are free, we are free

Now outside these lines
Through your own eyes never lies

Why can't you believe
I want it all back, all back
Still you showed your sleeves
I want it all back, all back

You know it's coming
I caught you dick in hand
Please don't say nothing, you'll box yourself again
It's nice just to be right again
But you sacrificed a friend, you're the ony shit I know, you knew it
It's all right, change your own words
Tell the truth inside me
Never seen

[Chorus]

There's some that you've wronged
There's some that you set free
There's some that deny
There's some that fall on their knees

Today I set aside a friend
But still I wait for dead
Before this takes time from me

Painting circles around your crimes
What if I told you to die
Would you hate me and burn up inside
No traces, no picture
No sacred glowing scriptures
So control your chaos
Relax and you can save us

Your throne of unjust
A dirty sole of mistrust
It pushes down, forces us down

What if it all came crashing down all around you
How will you save yourself
If you need one more fix to let it lift
Just stop and think, because it's over

So it's fine if you can't define
All the reasons for losing your mind
But if I could turn back time
I'd walk and pretend it's a lie
No faces, no voices
No falling concrete takers
No control, all chaos
A severed screaming circus

The time, the pain
Forced us to run away

What if it all came crashing down all around you
How will you save yourself
If you need one more fix to let it lift
Just stop and think because it's all over

You're the birthplace of disease
Ending all, ending me
Forever wrapped in chains

What if it all cam crashing down all around you
How will you save yourself
If you need one more fix to let it lift
Just stop and think, because it's all over",Beneath,2003

Désolé maman, ce texte sera pas pour toi
Je suis discret en vrai mais en musique il faut que je parle
Sa voix vibrait dans mon oreille quand j'étais dans ses bras
Les chansons à la guitare, les bisous avec la barbe
Il parle de l'époque du lycée avec mélancolie
Je m'endormais sur le canapé, je me réveillais dans mon lit
Il m'a laissé veiller devant les films que j'aimais bien
Il m'engueule jamais, le pire c'est quand il dit rien
On fait des matchs et je prie pour que ça dure
Il prend de l'âge, je l'ai lu dans ses courbatures
Les jambes tremblent quand on se fâche par moments
Plus ensemble, mais il me demande toujours pour maman
Il m'a transmis son charme et sa poésie
Mais j'ai aussi hérité de sa calvitie
C'est mon idole, avec lui rien est impossible
C'est un peu mon avocat, mon cuistot, mon taxi
Ses histoires et ses blagues quand il picole
Ses vieux pulls et ses chemises à auréoles
Maintenant c'est bon, et bêtement on en rigole
Mais j'étais con et j'avais honte devant l'école
L'odeur du café le matin, la voiture, les souvenirs
Les au revoirs, les câlins, ses blessures, ses soupirs
Ça sera toujours mon père et je reste son gamin
Et quand j'en aurais un je lui parlerais du mien

Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait
Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait

Y ya sé que soy viejo
Nunca te olvidaré
Cuando miro el espejo
Son mis hijos que veo
Me acuerdo del mío
Y cuando se fue
Aprendí que la vida
No vale más que el Papá, papá
Papá, papá
Papa, papa
Papa, papa

Derrière moi depuis mes tout premiers pas
Tous mes amis le trouvent vraiment très sympa
Ils les invitent à partager les repas
Mon père c'est le meilleur mais ça se compare pas
Il est ridé, la jeunesse l'a quitté
Comme tous les pères il a l'air déprimé
Pensif dans le salon, je le vois à chaque fois
Je crois qu'il regrette l'époque où il était pas papa
Mon père c'est mon boss, mon roi, mon héros
Moi, je suis son gosse, son minot, su hijo
Quoi? Il tourne tous mes problèmes en dérision
Je suis une des raisons pour lesquelles il peut finir en prison
Quoiqu'il arrive il accomplit sa mission
La berceuse du soir et les bisous qui piquent
Devant la télévision, le sport devient une religion
La sueur des joueurs de foot devient de l'eau bénite
Si ton père n'est pas là, tu sais, ne soit pas triste
Tu évites les engueulades pour le bouchon du dentifrice
Et j'appréhende déjà le jour des grands adieux
Y a pas de bons pères, y a que des hommes qui font de leur mieux

Celle-là c'est pour nos pères, nos padre
Ceux qui disent ""je t'aime"" sans même parler
Pour ceux qu'on regrette, ceux qui sont pas passés
Mais si t'es papa, tu sais que t'es pas parfait

Nottz,"Blaze, niggas, let's behave, niggas
Tha onez in the club now dictate, niggas

This is going out to my homies with Dr. Dre
Why do you think that Sam is gay?
Does he stare at your arse all day?
Isn't that gonna be the 2nd month in a row in May?

Blaze, niggas, let's behave, niggas
Tha onez in the club now dictate, niggas

So you think you can take my life?
Think you can take my wife?
Well, I'll like to see you try when I've got my knife

I'll stab you in the back
Run to your house, then give your mum a slap
Don't fuck with me
Otherwise 6 feet under is where you're gonna be
",Blaze,2001
Nottz,"[Chorus]
I've been trying so hard, 
To erase the scars, 
Of living this life, 
On the boulevard.
(Oh on the boulevard)

Every morning Kenny wake up 'bout five am, 
And jog about seven miles before class start. 
Had dreams of being the next superstar, 
Like that boy who sang Bo'. 
Kenny's ambition was crazy, 
In his heart he was determined to get it, 
So he stuck wit' to it. 
Six days out the week Kenny hit the track, 
With his goals set high, he ain't turning back. 
Lost one too many friends over guns and crack. 
Kenny put it in his mind there's something better then that. 
His daddy called him flypaper the way he stuck to the track,
His momma said ""it's your time baby you can't turn back."" 
And through all the blood, sweat, and the tears, 
Kenny promised the fan for forty years 
To come, got to get it. 
He shall prosper, 
Jumping hurdles in life 'til the next one pop up.

[Chorus]

Every morning Kenny wake up at nine am, 
Hit the trap house and stay there til its five am. 
I call that trappin' pages. 
He always holdin his dick, always busting off, 
But I don't call that masturbation. 
He all about heart. 
And you will never hear ""Oh my god they killed Kenny"", 
Bitch this ain't South Park. 
This the dirty mittens scurvy conditions, 
Workers is stealin', stealers is workin'. 
You only as real as the nigga you murdered. 
Bullets fly 'til your chest leak, 
Treat you like you a crownless chess piece. 
Middle finger never up, that's a substituted waste. 
Why would he do that when can just tell you niggas ""Fuck You"" to your face? 
He could fill up y'all with Philly's boulevard bully, 
To pull your card with no regards for the laws, wearing a hoodie. 
Police on his trail, he toss the bird, 
Roll his window down like ""Can I help you office-err?""

I've been hustlin' for so long.
The streets just won't leave me alone.
It's a battle I've got to win.
I can't give in.

[Chorus]

Bound for destiny, for greatness
Yet they both struggled with the nonsense
As evidence they were meant to be more
Yet they can't seem to finally find the score 
'Cause the game they played was rigged from the beginning
And in the end I sit on the sidelines and cry
Both cues stuck in a parallel universe will lose their lives",On the Boulevard,2011
Nottz,"One day you will return
Baby, don't cry
Love over fear, the stars have aligned
The end of a time

The highest realm, she never saw yellow submarines
And human beings from outer space, out of space, out of mind
Dotted line grinds, got 'em signing up for Columbine
Columbian white lines, ring around the rosie's, pocket full of homies
Only one god, sat up above all with the mastermind
Yo, she dreamt like digital data, autobiographic pixelated magic
Blowing kisses at her
From the last moon woke up to the gold sun
Put a gun in one hand, told him have a sweet life
One day we gonna live it like them summers that we never left
Pictures that we never took of bitches off that top shelf
Help me to the promised land, I promise you can have it
You can bag it like cotton for slaves, water for chocolates
Pilot my pivot, piss in a bucket
Kick our feet up as our children grow up nothing like us

One day, you will return
Baby, don't cry
Love over fear, the stars have aligned
We are the secrets they kept all of this time
And i don't give a damn if this the end
They won't sin in the end

If this is love, fuck it, I could be a god
If I'm a god watch me pull a heaven out a star
360 billion trillions miles away from home
I heard a heartbeat and decided I should make a song
Momma read a song tell my father I'mma see him where that grass gets
Greener than Seattle after storms, about to read my last poem
Hope you forget it, I told her that it's only one way
I took a million steps, must have read a million scripts
'Fore I picked the perfect role, churches, corporations
Slave wages, pretty hoes
Whoever told the police he could take my life?
Take my brother's life! Fuck it, take my mother's life!
Take my land, take my manhood, my fucking rights! (Biatch!)
Then enforce the laws
Pray to God one day we gonna be free like the children in the king's dream
I remember being free on King street

One day we'll be free like forever
Heart of Gandhi, side of Mandela, yeah
I See you on the other side, not only in my dreams
I See that it's the end of time
Someone, somewhere, every day
I see

Somebody's fag, pulled the dick out they ass and I shot the fucker
I could never stop to love her when shots flutter
Cock suckers with pretty wives and gay children
Wear badges and cry, At beauty pageants my sister won a prize
I was in the prison hiding presents from the guards
And local racism, 8 minutes and this whole world is finna end
I watch the fringe film 'the fin', infant again
She says she got to see where infinite ends and it was beautiful
I said I know I make the music

You will return

They won't sin in the end",Endof the World,2018
Nottz,"A black man said his name was Apollo Creed
Born as a novel seed in the land of a thousand kings
My third eye forever open, living out my dreams
Climbing down the mountain to drink water from a baller stream
No taps in my system, my land-line clean
My bloodline reconnected under my family tree
Was it an atom or Adam? Science or religion?
Was it the spirit in man or molecules in him?
Beer in my hand till I can't stand the system
I walk through ghetto alleys like the titans through the valley
Turn the wisdom into a tooth in my mouth
And spit the Judas out
Producing songs like farms to put my music out
Fruits of my labor, vegetables and turntables
Bringing day with the night
Watching the light cross stage you
The future bit the computer 'fore it chopped up the snake
'Cause they say, apple a day keeps the doc away

I bowed my head and the crown fell out my slave roots

Now I fix a pyramid every time I count figures
Kissing Venus with a Visa
Sitting on Chichen Itza
It's the heart I told her
It's the heart that keeps me living
Turn the mirror to a prism
Saw the zenith through the ceiling
If you live in a glass house, buy a surround system
This is crack, play it too loud, your house won't make it back
Paint the White House black
Rearrange the whole map
I swam under the ocean
Found Atlantis and a poem
Left a rap book in Pomona
I could take the planet over
Told a soldier if he finds it
He should take it home and rhyme it
And I did, Blu adventures of the gods and the titans

The best of everything
Too breathless then to wonder
I died a thousand times
Found guilty of no crime
Now everything is thunder

Daytime all I want is
Nighttime I don't need the
Daytime all I want is
Nighttime I don't need the

Once we were years ahead but now those thoughts are dead
Let me go
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet I never say goodbye
Let me go
A change of heart a change of mind and heaven fell that night
Let me go

The best years of our lives
The hope of it survives
The facts of life unspoken

The only game in town
I'll turn the last card down
And now the bank is broken

One man come and go
One man come, he to justify
One man to overthrow

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love

One man caught on a barbed wire fence
One man he resists
One man washed on an empty beach
One man betrayed with a kiss

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?
In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

Early morning, April 4th
Shot rings out in the Memphis sky
Free at last, they took your life
They could not take your pride

In the name of love
What more in the name of love?

They could become a cloud
They could be anyhow
Just a small portion of the ocean, soâ?¦

Give me some feathers so that I can stop it and glide
And glide up

The morning light plays in your eyes
With floating blue and white skyline

We're gazing through the clouds
We sail the wind rose (four winds)
The break of day sparks my desire 
And ocean waves won't quench the fire 
We kiss we're high, we're riders in the sky
The city lies below
A silhouette, a glow
A tale of passion
I close my eyes (full flaps downs)
You hold me tight
We touch the ground

We search the busy streets

Molha a tua boca na minha boca
A tua boca é meu doce é meu sal

Mais um palhaço no teu carnaval
Casa de sombra vida de monge
Quanta cachaça na minha dor
Volta pra casa, fica comigo

Cai do cavalo, perdi Gabriela
Oh lua de cera, oh lua singela

Nova Y Jory,"Un 5 de Julio del año 1986
Llego al mundo Bull and Raice
En un pueblo de la costa norte de la isla Corl Carolina
El chamaquito conoció el lado oscuro de la isla
Viendo como los panas se mataban en el cacerio por kilo o por libra
A veces solo por poder o por guía
Y una noche sintió una música en el huesos
Y en su sistema sanguíneo
Y el chamaquito entonces tubo esta misión
Vivir de la música brother no es imposible
Cuando de la música es que deseas vivir

Any solo dream ya vivo en el siglo 25
Mami sin dinero, papi no es precinto
Y yo me acuerdo en las noches me pasaba pensando
Algún día seré rico o moriré tratando

Pero ahora todo es diferente
Ahora le gusto a la gente
El que estaba pichando
(Lo digo mamando)
Su carrera esta en peligro
(Lo digo mamando)

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Tienen que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Y hay que aceptar la realidad
Que acabo de arrancar y no voy a parar
Y aunque hay un centenar que me quieran ver mal
Yo no voy a parar, no

Ahora no hay break
Seguiré matando hasta que yo lo decida
Mataré a to el que siga envidiando

Ahora no hay break
Me importa to correr lo que la gente diga
No me voy a quitar (Mientras siga respirando)

Un 3 de Octubre de 1980 llego al mundo en el seno de una familia humilde
El chamaquito fue criado por una madre soltera
El chamaquito jamas permitió que eso se convirtiera en una dificultad papi
El chamaquito agarro lo mejor que pudo de la experiencia
Y con la música como norte
El chamaquito comprendió si misión en la vida
Que la vida a veces esta llena de depresiones tropicales
Y que never stop five and the level
Y dios no the raith papi
Ahhh

Jaja
Cuando empece en esta cuestión fue sin mirar atrás
Sin saber que el camino es duro pero hay que luchar
Con un entendimiento y mientras canto pasa el tiempo
Veo como mi carrera gira, oh que bien me siento
Ahora se, que lo que cultive ha rendido frutos
En absoluto no fue en vano como lo disfruto
Y solo es el comienzo (Colega me escuchas)
'Toy viajando el mundo entero, intenciones tengo muchas
Muchas puertas que toque, mil estudios visite
Sentía que me quitaba, pero nunca me quite
Y aquí estamos, dos seres humanos que se juntan
Dejando de que hablar, hay muchas preguntas
Gracias al señor por la fuerza que me diste
La madre que me pusiste, la familia y lo que hiciste
Contesto sus preguntas con la dura realidad

No se ni como empece a quererte a ti
Solo se que el amor tiene la manera
Para enredarlo todo

No se, si tu corazón guardaste con cadenas
O si guardas una llave para mi
Solo se que el amor tiene la manera
Para enredarlo todo

Y yo dispuesto a todo
Y que no haría yo para tenerte
Siempre cerca de mi corazón

Para nunca echarte de menos
Que no haría yo
Para cuidarte y protegerte
Dándote mi amor

Para hacerte la dueña
De todo mi corazón

No se si la vida mi complazca con tenerte
O si para ella es mucho pedir
Solo se que no me conformo con verte

Yo quiero un beso tuyo
No se si la vida nos lleve a otro continente
Y caminando por las calles de parís
Te detengas y me digas de repente
Yo quiero un beso tuyo
Solo un besito tuyo

Y que no haría yo para tenerte
Siempre cerca de mi corazón

Para nunca echarte de menos
Que no haría yo
Para cuidarte y protegerte
Dándote mi amor

Para hacerte la dueña
De todo mi corazón

Si yo te tuviera tu eres la mujer mas feliz
Tengo un mundo de amor completo para ti
Que podamos compartir la noche bajo la luna
Eres la única testigo de tanta dulsura

Y te enamoraría que no te daría
Por que seas mía viajar conmigo te llevaría
Yo quisiera que sea la reina de mi hogar
Tanto amor pa;' regalar no lo puedes despreciar

Si quieres ponme pruebas
Para yo demostrarte que haría
Todo por mi amor
Por que mas que pienso no logro imaginarme
Algo que no haría por ti…

Y que no haría yo para tenerte
Siempre cerca de mi corazón

Para nunca echarte de menos
Que no haría yo
Para cuidarte y protegerte
Dándote mi amor

Para hacerte la dueña

Crying lying in the trash with the lid shut
Ain't got no family my mind is tender my
Daddy's invisible my Mom's is Brenda uh
If I survive I'm grow into what
Society considers trash the rope is to us
That means I'm hanging myself by living
The noose is getting murdered that or going to prison
My minds controlled before I learned mind control
What you call living life I call dying slow
I'm genetically predisposed
The reaper the only thing that can ease my soul freezing cold
Feeling like I was given life and if I take it at least I choose
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I'm hearing is wind and rain drops

Dear auntie I still feel your timeless sorrow
Before you died it's like your body was mine to borrow
Like I jumped in your physical shell
While you was going through miserable hell saying goodbye to tomorrow
Everyday it make me sad, angry, mad how you were sent to heaven sacred path
Duct taped and gagged plus raped and stabbed body draped in blood what a faith to have
Such a pitiful end I'm popping Ritalin like they skittles cause
When I sleep I can feel it again and again and again it's difficult
Killing is the wickedest biblical sin I'm talking about momma's identical twin
I see your face when I look at her
Her reminder of how I've been in the cold
Since 14 years old
Swear to God I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops

Headed to you and just thought about how good he was brought up
Coulda woulda outta one track mind
They say man of many hats buys a hooker for a quarter
And now I'm writing a book and the hoods the author
Called the ""Obvious Poker Face The Look of Torture""
Teach you how to climb your way out that ditch then
Me all I need is this pen and thick skin
Being so bright could mean you lit then
Cause you start trying to figure out a figment

So they had us back and forth to court in the months of the blizzard (Freezing)
My sneakers leaned the rubber was missing
No one on ones they always jumped me no brothers and sisters to hold me down
Along with headphones plugged into a cheap Walkman that ate tapes
Gun shots and me sleep walking I hate weights
A whole lot of crying police chalking that fate tape
Ambulance never on time they like a day late
My cousin ain't had to vacate my best friend since age eight
Sometimes I can't hold them I kid you not

Novel,"Go right to left, left to right
Middle passage connection
Yeah, about to build
Tell you which way to go

We go right to left, left to right
If you fight to the death, what's left to fight
Yo, here we go

I want to write away
I want to write here
I want to write brave words to fight fear
Write dreams and nightmares
Might scare the folks stuck in the day
But nothing to say
Well I'm way ahead by light years
So beware we keep the lights on
I want to write the songs from right to wrong
Right on
Riding the light so you see in the dark
So deep you gotta be still like your beating heart
My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop
See the art, living right, eating smart
I want to right to life, a right to death
Police read your rights from right to left
But I never write to remain silent
I fight through police line
Cops walk the beat that I write to
I teach minds, write rhymes with the right sound
Right now, journalists write up
I write down

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why
Do they make it so hard for a man to provide
You better get wit it, or stand to the side

And the story line goes on
Right to left, who's right who's wrong
Fuck the politics and pride
I just to try to stay alive
To witness where the battle lines are drawn
Speak my mind and sing my song
I'm passin on the moral y'all
This is ain't play
True, you got to know the way
It's hard now
Open eyes
See hopeful lives
Sing it now

Making my way through life
Talking to elders and taking advice
Ignoring their words and paying the price
Living in the world where false preachers got us praying to Christ
Get with the young girls in the choir and laying the pipe
No control of our soul we all wait at the light
So comfortable they we hating to fight to make it right
Late at night I'm controlled by the DJ on the mic
I love hip-hop and every joint he playing is tight
A day in the life is a brick in the foundation of like
A maze in Egypt amazing when I'm creating a sight
For the world to behold and the story to last
So one day ghetto children can visit their glorious past
After Pac and Notorious past what do we have
Niggas worth more when they dead, it's so sad
Started with the slavery we finish the plan
But I broke the cycle, and became a man

Party people put a hand in the sky
Grab a cloud and squeeze til no man is dry
We wet it up, go ask the people if they plannin to die
Can't stay to live, consumers is plannin to buy
Smoke death operators is standing by
They take you order for the slaughter of the family why

I'm hopin' prayer works 'cause the walls can't hear me

So I drop to my knees and I scream with my might

Sinkin' in my sorrows got me drowning
Tempted to empty bottles and throw 'em off in wind

Sou o gringo que não fala brasileiro

Forever cold to faith in life
Mother of night, embrace me

With so much pain to bare
I am broken

Nights forgotten its son of brave
And turned her back on bitterness
Torn is my duality
Judging the force of things yet old
Trivia in forsaken thoughts
Of tomorrow's crushing blow

Two fold, I stand to ache
Given to me by pitiful life
Desperate time, to pass in stride

Sweet is the falling in those bubbles and colors
When you leave nothing you care about behind
When the state of mind is drowning and all the world is drunk
The reads I walk are even sadder than ever
Every word has a reason and every line has a rhyme
All the things which used to be dark are suddenly clear
All that broken glass on my hand to spill all the inferno I feel
All the thorns of my crown to fill you with the blood you deserve
All the tears I mixed with wine are tastier than your fading lips
And the mud in which I crawled is warmer than your melting kiss
And the lights that other eyes brought to me couldn't light

I still dream of Orgonon.
I wake up crying.
You're making rain,
And you're just in reach,
When you and sleep escape me.
You're like my yo-yo
That glowed in the dark.
What made it special
Made it dangerous,
So I bury it
And forget.
But every time it rains,
You're here in my head,
Like the sun coming out--
Ooh, I just know that something good is going to happen.
And I don't know when,
But just saying it could even make it happen.
On top of the world,
Looking over the edge,
You could see them coming.
You looked too small
In their big, black car,
To be a threat to the men in power.
I hid my yo-yo
In the garden.
I can't hide you
From the government.
Oh, God, Daddy--
I won't forget,
'Cause every time it rains,
You're here in my head,

You are my treasure to find

The rain lingers on
War only was
To bond us all

Hell no, no war can paint this more sore
The path is packed with bags of coal

And bags of coal from some monstrous soul
And no, no rain can clean this at all

You say, ""there's no way-out at all"", is something false
But way-out, if it is not far is still getting narrow

The prayers for light result in failure and dismay
But almost yawn, it's a Deja Vu sounding horror

Someday I'll take you by the hand
And leave this place without a face
I won't let our world to crumble down and come undone
But it's not now, just let me gather strength,
We weren't meant to be perfect
Some things ain't easy even if they seem to work just fine

Somewhere over that bridge it's done
Hey, the rain it splits as we walk

But war lingers on and some pain lingers on

And Beatrice, my bride

And far away it comes a train

Don't ever want to miss a moment
As we've just begun something
I just wanna be someone
That makes you believe you are not breaking away

And I wonder what on Earth are we awaiting
For the train to tomorrow is here and it is longing
To take us away

And tomorrow there'll be landscapes you just dreamt about
And the sound of the bells
Will sound much realer in this brand-new dawn
Yes tomorrow there'll be still shades of yesterday
But they'll get vaguer and vaguer
As the winter's caress approaches close

I run to you
And I see the sky crying
Crying tears of widow, tears soon wiped dry
And thousand windows look at us dance
This sweet'n'sour theme, a romance
Dance, dance, dance...

Engulf me in your soul
And let those feathered arms fly.",Croma,2006

Non saprei dirvi il perchÃ¨
Di questa storia che ha messo
Amore e dolore
In una sacca sgualcita

Capisci, il tempo del gioco
Ã? oggi l'era del vuoto
E poi son solo preghiere da porgersi al mare

Sound the chime
Sound the chime
Like a sign from high, up high

Yeah, it seems like rain
But no, it won't hurt us again
And the whole landscape is mine
Oh friend of mine, of mine

All alone in this peak of a time
You can only hear this one voice
Tell him what you desire
And it's going to happen...




",Geppetto,2006
Novembre,"Penso il passato tornerÃ  solo un giorno
Per portar via questa notte anomala

Quando domani tornerai
In altra vastitÃ  latente

Penso il passato tornerÃ  anche solo un giorno
Lacrime azzurre asciugherÃ 

Quando domani tornerai
Sostanza e veritÃ 

You were alone that day
Behind the screaming crowd, that day
And the rain started falling down
To soothe the thirst for slaughterings

And tomorrow other thunderstorms will come
From east as usual
Then we'll enjoy them with a smile

You were alone that day
Behind the screaming crowd, that day

Novembre,"Sometimes the night
Brings memories, sometimes the night
Brings feelings you thought they are dead
In some dusty, forgotten lost hall of your mind yes, sometimes
The night

This time a sea of ox-eyes
Painting the irises of white
Flooding mi senses with light
Filling my forgotten halls with bright

Because the lanes of the night
Always lead to railways blind
Always lead to the most pointless rhymes
Rhymes of life that sometimes we must write
Take the hand that is given to you
Let yourself to this Sunday morning

We're riding this shore to someplace beyond
So don't ever believe we'd stop by
A thousand years we've got ahead of your eyes [Repeat x 2]

The further sight,always the farthest of sights
The farthest sight
Pride and might
We believe it's Nothijngrad.",Nothijngrad,2006
Novembre,"Whose tears on a gaping voice
Who's stretching arms match
The hunger of mine
There lips will they never join
But always draw me closer
And further entwined
With a promise dealer understand
All freedoms fade away
To a point of view
Where many different pathways meet
And we're standing on this precipice
With nothing much to gain save
But the deep blue screams
Of falling dreams
With our next move

Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry

The shades of a thousand steel
Come flashing by my face
In the fury of war
In desolation and abandoned fields
The hungry make their stand
When they'll stand for no more
Hear the passion in their voices
See the heaven in their eyes
Their hopes and schemes are waiting
Dreams of less than paradise
And sometimes we make promises
We never mean to keep
For blackmail is the only deal
A promise dealer sees

Heaven hide your eyes
Heaven's eyes will never dry",The Promise,2006
Novembre,"Upon the rivers of the day
It blows a cool breeze in the air
Of thoughts and shimmering hours of May
And all its feelings

I dared to walk down by the lane
Calm and fearless in the rain
I felt that you were by my side
Calm and tender

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May
Has washed the purple clouds away

You are the reason for this May

Listen, all the time we witness miracles,
All the time!

We thought that anyone that has a life
Bear the cross of the passion and of the time
Oh, the way I was blind!

The time I stumbled over your blue eyes
I felt like falling into a pool of joy
And a sort of miracle happened
The ancient fortress vanished at your smile

"Now, Now","Find a thread to pull
and we can watch it unravel

Only enough to keep from giving up
If I could go back to the start
To break the pattern forming between us

A needle dragging thread
To form the chapters only we could know
But they would override and cast a shadow on what little is left

Nox Aurea,"Since I once heard the enticing call
From the depth of the most secret core, 
The very rebellious lust of triumph
Burns wild in my black longing heart

And now as it enchants me again, 
Stronger and clearer than ever before
I run in ecstasy towards the utmost edge
Disregarding any border, striving beyond

I saddle the maelstrom of a burning Charybdis
Without an ounce of fear, nor stumbling or doubt
For no chains of profane can ever prevent me
Even though my world's foundation tremble

Nor even Death... 

As I once left the pity fellowship of man
And my liberation shook their conception, 
They scorned and feared the essence of my quest
Since it made them question their deceitful reasons

Yet their taunts and attempts to enslave me again
Were all in vain, for Lucifer himself shines within me
""The higher we soar, the smaller we appear
To those who cannot fly"" 

Driven by an urge to experience the concealed
And now I shalt conquer God's throne itself
Through aeons I have travelled, floating through tunnels
For nothing I seek but the gold of divine
No chains of profane can ever prevent me
Even though my world's foundation tremble

Out from earthly cliffs, into the unknown
Where those who dare to enter will burn, 
Yet ascending in triumph...",Ascending in Triumph,2010

Gently caress me with it's benevolent hands, 
Yet so dark and gloomy in it's soul

The passion of dying... 

For it is Death herself who sweeps the landscape, 
Embracing a lost world in shades and vapour

I will never forget the dread of November, 
Her grievance and stillness of lonely nights
The desire of heart, in minor adorned, 
Dancing so gently as dim northern lights

How I do love this pleasant seclusion, 
This old bitter-sweet feeling, 
The passion of solitude

Let me transcend into a sleep without dreams, 
Let me wither in your cold white arms...",The Delight of Autumn Passion,2010

An entrance for the great Ones beyond

Thus we must obey their summons
Or vainly we will fall in despair
For they are the keys of ascension
To the hidden gates of liberty

By injustice we are enslaved
In a curse of order and time
So adherents of the greatest Cause, 
Now let us to this circle give rise

An entrance for the great Ones to come, 
To strike into our cosmic world
An entrance for the great Ones beyond,

We were chained into blinding halls
Of the creation's cloaked labyrinth

Stared at me with mocking despise
From the silent distance of their cosmic thrones, 
In a night sky so cold and vastly dark

And refused the shackles of matter's intrusion
So I closed my eyes and travelled deep
Into other specters, so far from earth

Towards the void of spiritual tranquillity
I float among stars and nebula dust
Crossing all restraining limits, one by one
On my voyage through galactic aeons

I waken from an indistinct mirage
To dissolve all the chains of creation, 
The cosmic dreams of mind
Slowly do I now disperse
Into the abyss of Ain

Eternally I proceed, 
Into the black hole of my dream, 
To release myself from the circle of time

By my purified spirit's will to emerge
With the infinity of Nothing beyond
To transcend into the Absolute,

Where the forces of my desires lingers

Here, I can no longer comprehend
The illusion of life
No empty shadows wanders, 
Thus there are no walls

The asperity of breathing seems to lighten
As I imagine the beautiful vision of an eclipse

The hymn of absolute eradication reaches my ears
This swan song fills my heart with joy

Desolate and in myself seeking the golden depth
Rapturously immersing
I long for the day I shalt escape this confinement
The day when my constraining flesh is abolished

The heart's most beloved, 
I do breathe nevermore... 

In the distress of life I demand
The plagues from below to storm again, 
And so they swept through the world, 
Yearning for liberty
As I witnessed once in the mournful visions
I now behold the grandiose gate
To the vastly unknown

For this I do proclaim; to the grave I belong
Since all I perceive brings me anguish and doubt
For which poem in the world could portray
The woeful absurdity of inception's cause
From nothingness to sordid matter?

We do not belong to this stillborn world, 
But to the endless void, the void of it's grave...

Forty days, forty weeks, either these raps are back in the streets
Stackin cracks up in the fleece, so Hav blaze the bees
And pass that to me, and I'll bless piece
So this way the whole fam eat
Be the Infamous of this shit, pioneers of this
Survival of the Fittest, nobody's fuckin wit this

You fuck around wit me, then you fuck around wit P
You fuck around wit us, then you fuck around wit three

Ga Head we don't front in dem streets when it comes to that beef
You know we shoot 'em up and leave 'em dead on the concrete
Need more heat for more beef, more thuns we more deep
More guns on more streets, the beef on it's no sleep
There's more heat for police, Check the guns we squeezing

And wear them out until they worn out

Knee deep in the grind like ""fuck it""

È ghiaccio sul mio cuore marcio ormai non faccio altro
Niente è bello cresce muffa nel cervello e merda sull'asfalto
Cresce un cazzo di virus che ci infetta a tutti
Conto milioni di neuroni distrutti
Cambiano tutti tranne i brutti vizi
Quando per la testa c'hai 2000 cazzi e un cielo nero sui palazzi
Quando bazzichi all'inferno troppo spesso e
Quando da bambino ti chiudevi al cesso ""è successo""
Sto male pure il giorno appresso e quello dopo dormo troppo poco
Lascio la mia casa mentre prende fuoco
Lascio che lei mi bacia
E mi trasporta nei suoi giochi assurdi
Mi lascia graffi in faccia e messaggi di insulti
Sono bravi tutti tranne me Truce
Tu te ne vai a male con me
È strano quando ognuno ti ama se hai denaro o fama
Strano quando se finisce tutto nessuno ti chiama

Un'abbazia romana sbragata dar Lucas
Truceklan tutto inizia qui
Pensi di esser G
'Sta merda è sick come Freddy da trip
E va cosi mischia il catch co' lo speed
Death squad no acqua alcool proof la mia giacca
Sulla boccia sticker della Loggia
I pezzi delle sneakers sotto la pioggia
Il giaccone da Kojack
Senti il peso di ogni goccia quando
I battiti del cuore vanno rallentando dammi un altro grammo
E una raglia ti scanna la gola
Lo zombie della vecchia scuola
Ti squaglia la stagnola
Ricognizione in zona rossa
Richiama i morti dalla fossa
Truceboys la cosca non resta nascosta
Niente stecca stecco buste
Roccette o fruste
Marchetta a narici robuste
Brutta base sulla pipa
E puoi vedere zombie pe' la strada e nella vita e se li vedi grida

Io, vendicherò
Il mio crew
Bevo rum fumo crack faccio rap
Noyz porta morte
Carter porta morte
Compra la tua sorte dallo spacciamorte

Entro in discoteca con un mitra e ammazzo tutti
Prendo la percentuale sopra i lutti poi
Cosa resta un ronzio nella testa di ventiquattrore
Magari fosse un film dell'orrore
Assumere merda ogni giorno è il fattaccio
È che senza non ce la faccio, spaccio
Turbe mentali al migliore offerente
Co' du' sguardi ti metto in mutande
Ti sputo in faccia fatti amari veri
Mo paga i tuoi sicari mo per farmi fuori
Cristo e la madonna sulla schiena curva
La tua vita è una burla che mi disturba
Urla d'illusi che chiedono giustizia
Cercano diamanti ma trovano immondizia
Sangue da bere
Bare da aprire
Per guardare i morti negli occhi
Frantumami i ginocchi
I miei cocchi ti guidano all'inferno
Ho la riserva di pasticche pe' l'inverno
Chiedi di me al C.S.M.
Vedi da te
Perché disperano le mamme
Fiamme di rancore e di violenza nelle strade
Le persone deboli vengono schiacciate
Per du' soldi ammazzeresti tua madre
Lo leggo nei tuoi occhi, io vengo dalle strade
Spade conficcate nella giugulare
Nel tuo quartiere atmosfera spettrale

To hear the Angels sing

Sing, I do hear them singing

When I heard my child in prayer.

And all the streets were dark and bare. 
In our town, no scarlet ribbons, 
Not one ribbon for her hair.

And just before the dawn was breaking, 
I peeked in and on her bed, 
In gay profusion lying there, 
Lovely ribbons, scarlet ribbons.

If I live to be a hundred, 
I will never, never know from where, 
Came those lovely scarlet ribbons, 
Scarlet Ribbons for her hair.

If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

To whistle while you work.

Verse- I admit its some decisions 
I made that was real messed up 
But I thank God errday for 
Still keeping me blessed up-
And guess what the folks who thought 
I would be dead or shot up
By now I’m yelling now what 
Your predictions is chalk dust
Its times I know I should’ve 
Been outlined in that chalk but
God saw summin in me and that’s 
What’s getting this crowd up
My gift my ability to uplift 
New rappers aint got no drive 
Let’s give this atmosphere a shift
All I know is to be real and never think negative
Had to open my own company 
Supervisors lie thru they lips
(We just another number)
Taught me what not to do
So go chase what’s calling you
Rid yourself from fake friends (Why)
They don’t apply to you my fam I ride with you
My wife I die for you I never knew what
Real was till I saw what God can do
If you real I vibe with you 
You reaching I climb with you

Guess that’s why that wedding 
Invite wasn’t in my mailbox
Jus the byproduct of having to pops to help you shadow box

In like hopscotch and showed me how to call shots
And said that I cannot stop

We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous wake-up show!

Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, M-C's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin' holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up wake up wake up!

When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin'
Look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin' M-C's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9nes's vild""

This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house,
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch, bitch!""
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose first wit the top off landin' upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway and Tech, two disk jokeys
Breakin' so many friggin' needles I wonder if they inject

Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon

Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of Jake investigate

What? Sway can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but whatcha gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what!

Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all

Nu Colours,"They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
""Something here inside
Cannot be denied""

They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You don't realize
Smoke gets in your eyes

So I chaffed and I gaily laughed
To think they would doubt my love
Yet today, my love has flown away
I am without my love

Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide

[Verse 1:]
Now see it was Monday afternoon
Very first day of school
Back of the class makin' girls laugh
Teacher's mad 'cause I'm cuttin' a fool
I'm just doin' what I usually do
Errything's cool, chillin' with the crew
Sayin' ""finally, the bell's bouta ring""
That's when this new student walked in the room
My jaw dropped, I felt my heart stop
She's flaw to flaw
This girl's so raw
So this girl got me hooked like a bra
Like climax, man I paused
See this girl is sick like the flu
Wish I knew who she was
She's hot like curry, my vision is blurry
But why should I worry

[Chorus 2x:]
'Cause I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

[Hook:]
But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G
(I'm a G)
So what could it be
(What could it be)

[Verse 2:]
Now later on got home set down my bags
Got homework, chores: need to take out trash
But see this girl's got me all off task
My hearts beaten fast who could I ask?
Got the phone called Tez
He said ""Lloyd what's crackin'?""
I said ""Dawg you won't e'en believe what happened.""
""I'm chillin' and this girl walked up in the class and
Swear she look just like Janet Jackson
So should I write a letter to her
Or should I send a messenger
I tried to vibe and connect with her
But I didn't have enough guts to step to her
And I really want the best of her
But can I get the rest of her?""
So he told me ""Lloyd don't sweat it.""
And I said ""You're right. Forget it.""

[Chorus 2x:]
Because I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

But I'm a G

Nuance,"Starts Off Doo-whop Ballad


[Verse 1:]
Now see it was Monday afternoon
Very first day of school
Back of the class makin' girls laugh
Teacher's mad 'cause I'm cuttin' a fool
I'm just doin' what I usually do
Errything's cool, chillin' with the crew
Sayin' ""finally, the bell's bouta ring""
That's when this new student walked in the room
My jaw dropped, I felt my heart stop
She's flaw to flaw
This girl's so raw
So this girl got me hooked like a bra
Like climax, man I paused
See this girl is sick like the flu
Wish I knew who she was
She's hot like curry, my vision is blurry
But why should I worry

[Chorus 2x:]
'Cause I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

[Hook:]
But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G
(I'm a G)
So what could it be
(What could it be)

[Verse 2:]
Now later on got home set down my bags
Got homework, chores: need to take out trash
But see this girl's got me all off task
My hearts beaten fast who could I ask?
Got the phone called Tez
He said ""Lloyd what's crackin'?""
I said ""Dawg you won't e'en believe what happened.""
""I'm chillin' and this girl walked up in the class and
Swear she look just like Janet Jackson
So should I write a letter to her
Or should I send a messenger
I tried to vibe and connect with her
But I didn't have enough guts to step to her
And I really want the best of her
But can I get the rest of her?""
So he told me ""Lloyd don't sweat it.""
And I said ""You're right. Forget it.""

[Chorus 2x:]
Because I'm a G
Can't let her get to me
But her voice sounds sweeter than a symphony
But I know, know that eventually
She'll find someone else and forget of me

[Hook:]
But I'm a G
(I'm a G)
I'm a G
(I'm a G)
So what could it be
(What could it be)
Oh yeah

I'm a G

J’ai grandi parmi les débrouillards et les dépouilleurs,
Antillais, j’ai les bons papiers mais pas la bonne couleur,
Gwada c’est ma terre, y’a d’quoi bluffer les touristes,
Le ghetto s’donne pas en spectacle, il est caché derrière les coulisses,
Mon paradis côtoie le Sheitan, le scandale, les vandales,
On n’a pas toujours les doigts d’pieds en éventails,
Si tu voyais l’autre facette, dans mon île les rues sont malsaines,
Les p’tits t’angoissent à la machette et le crack pousse plus vite que la zeb,
Timal, vient pas t’la jouer, ni t’inventer une vie d’taulard, (vie d’taulard !)
Change de couloir quand les vrais font du fric au noir, (ah ah !)
Devant l’oseille, les chacals n’ont plus sommeil,
Moi aussi j’veux briller jusqu’à c’que t’attrapes des coups d’soleil,
Panam, là où les impôts te soustrait,
Là où la police te suit d’près,
J’suis cramé d’avance comme un colis suspect,
J’ai retrouvé les miens mis d’côté dans les blocs de ciment,
Qui arrondissent les fins du mois à dealer d’la drogue en silence,

J’aurais pu naître en pleine guerre, en tant qu’enfant soldat,
La zermi est partout, te fauche au premier carrefour,

L’immigré qui passe la frontière de police,
Et se rend compte que la France est loin d’être une terre promise,
Partout c’est la merde, la chance finit par s’envoler,
Dans les quartiers beaucoup pensent que Dieu les a abandonnés,
L’Etat nous dit d’voter, ça n’allège pas nos fardeaux,
Rien n’a changé à part les taxes et le salaire de Sarko,
La jeunesse n’a plus qu’la rue comme abri,
Mais c’est parce qu’on a du mal à voir la vie en rose comme Barbie,
J’ai pas la gueule de l’emploi, j’vais pas m’éterniser,

Save me
As I take my last breath
From these
Madmen
Licensed to give death

Watching the clock
As the hour draws near
Nervousness making you sweat
Now comes the time
And you're given a shoot
You wonder if that's all you'll get
You are wheeled into
The room where you'll die
A thought that is morbid but true
The last thing you see
As you're slipping away
Is the scalpel they're sticking in you

Help me
Save me
As I take my last breath
From these
Madmen
Licensed to give death

Safe from the monster
Safe from it all
You watch but you no longer pain
The body you've left
Is a pile of guts
It's obvious that they're insane
And as your spirit
Is leaving this plane
You know that they cannot be stopped
The practice you thrive
The deaths will continue
And what they don't eat just will rot

Save me

You're running in panic,
Away from the guns
Panic is striking at those all around
Beware the Grim Reaper,
He rests all around

Soon you shall see
You will obey me
Or watch yourself bleed

Fight for your life, with cold steel at hand
Run for the forest, live off of the land
You'll seek the dark shadows
For there safety lies
It rests with the tarot,
You hear the wolves cry

My name is evil
Soon you shall see
You will obey me
Or watch yourself bleed

Stop for a rest, jump at all sounds
Hot on your trail, pursuit all around

Make your last stand

You're under a death spell

To run and hide

And scream your pain out loud

We'll cut you down

We should just go to hell
Although we claim to fight
For right and god

We're served by goddamned fools
Who've put themselves completely
In our hands

And we know in the end
Resist and you are dead
We're bursting out and now
Shall rule the land

Will rule this night

Will win this fight

And sent me far away
To a stinking prison
Where I could but stay

While you hoped my life would end
But all your ill-gotten gains won't stop

Waiting in the shadows

The nightmare wasn't over, I was stooped over in pain
And taken to the emergency room
Waiting for two hours, by the time they got to me
I passed out, felt like I was flushed down the drain

Somebody help me, please get me the right doctor
I'm sick of being used as an experiment

Finding limits, learning rules by pushing hard
Earning the right to choose by making the right choice

No insecurities, I'm not subject to your whims
I'm not swayed, I'm who I want to be
Cast aside the status quo and maybe you'll be free

Into the paths I follow, choosing how I spend my days
Running up against people with narrow minds
Who impose thoughts on me, make me one of their kind

Living life I've got no regrets
No insecurities, I'm not subject to your whims
I'm not swayed, I'm who I want to be
Cast aside the status quo and then you will be free

Trapped inside conformity, live through someone else
Hiding from reality, crawl inside your hole
Growing near insanity, fashion casualty junkie

A struggle of our will, victory is my result
I'll not be swayed by your cheap tricks or your abuse
My life's my own to live, I'll do things in my way
What's so great about your world that I must be the same

Maybe I wouldn't be an outcast
If I'd drop the attitude at last

Di sogni infondati e di strane passioni.

Non cambierai mai
Quelle parole dritte al petto, come pugnali a sangue freddo
E altre immagini nella mente volano via.

Volano via … volano via … volano via … volano via … volano via …

E con le rondini distanti e le colombe che lasciano incanti
E con le storie che vanno avanti a piccoli passi.

Mi sono specchiato nel buio per sconfiggere i dubbi
Ho donato il mio sangue per toglierne un po' del tuo.",Aria di samba,2011

Princess is here, Princess is here

Now I'm free Yes I'm free
And I'm just in time for tea
Yes I'm free Look at me
What you get is what you see

And if I tell you all the truth
Would you promise not to cry
I prefer it back inside
It's nothin' that you did or said
I'm just kinda scared
I've just heard life is a fatal disease

She got the grip
New virgin lip
Tornado sip
Synthetic bright blue berry colored eyes
Ten thousand cries
Ten thousand smiles
Unknown, the swollen Princess is here
Princess is here, Princess is here

Now I'm free yes I'm free
And I'm just in time for tea
Yes I'm free look at me
What you get is what you see

And if I am your pride and joy
Could you find it in your hearts
Could you let me back inside
You know I must apologize
If I did offend
I've just heard life is a fatal disease

And if I tell you all the truth
Would you promise not to cry
I prefer it back inside

Nuno Bettencourt,"What you want
A million marbles and an ice cream car
What you want
A melted nova wouldn't get you far
What you want
A million acres for a rocking horse
What you want
Is not enough
I don't know much the future prophecies
I don't know why they're walking on their knees
But I do know that emptiness you feel
I know the sun will always chase away the moon
What you want
A white chocolate wedding in a lego church
What you want
A beauty pageant with a kung fu grip
What you want

Nuno Bettencourt,"A certain scent in the summertime
Of yesteryear, that would remind

Daydream on a rainy day
Favorite tune the D.J. played
Sunbeam through a window pane
Black and white captured in a frame

A baby's smiling does to mother's face

But more than all of the above
Some of the things that I'm thinking of
Reminding me, how much I love you

Snowstormin' on a Monday mourn
Hot chocolate keeping, keeping me warm

Kiss goodnight and tucked in safe
Waking up then sleeping late
Good old days remember when
Distant call from an old friend

A baby's smiling does to mother's face",You,1997
Nuno Bettencourt,"You and I we got a long way to go
You harbor a tear in your eye you don't let it show
People go on hurting people It's just the way of the world
And I ask you where we're goin', but you don't know

We got a long way to go

Here we are in a time unlike any before
We have everything that we need, but we want more, we always do
People go on hurting people, it's just the way of the world
and I ask you where we're goin' but you don't know

We got a long way to go

Somewhere down the line there will be a peaceful time
We have no choice, but wait for the voice that tells us what's up

You and I we got a long way to go

Nuno Bettencourt,"And they know your name
And they want you bad
Yeah they want you waving society's flag

In a perfect world 
Where the living dead dream of living as ghosts
And don't do this and don't do that
Just do it all
It's your life
Don't you forget it
Think twice
You're gonna regret it
But you have to hide
From the corporate jive
Or you'll lose your power to keep life alive
You're your own judge
But you post no bail
Like an emperor makes his palace his jail
Hey all you traffic jam zombies
Just honk your horns
Don't obey the teacher
Who tell you to shut up
Who'll mold you into useless robots
Who are not aloud to feel
Just quit your job tomorrow
Just quit your job today
You take a permanent vacation

Esse olhar cansado, profundo
Dizendo-me coisas num grito
E ensinando-me tanto do mundo

E esses passos lentos de agora
Caminhando sempre comigo
Já correram tanto na vida
Meu querido, meu velho, meu amigo

Sua vida cheia de histórias
Essas rugas marcadas pelo tempo
Lembranças de antigas vitórias
Ou lágrimas choradas ao vento

Sua voz macia me acalma
E diz muito mais do que eu digo
E calando fundo na alma
Meu querido, meu velho, meu amigo

Seu passado vive presente
Mas as experiências contidas
Nesse coração consciente
Da beleza das coisas da vida

Seu sorriso franco me anima
Seu conselho certo me ensina
Beijo suas mãos e lhe digo
Meu querido, meu velho, meu amigo

Eu já lhe falei de tudo
Mas tudo isso é pouco
Diante do que eu sinto
Olhando seus cabelos tão bonitos
Beijo suas mãos e digo

Nuns Chorus,"She climbs a tree
And scrapes her knee
Her dress has got a tear.
She waltzes on her way to mass
And whistles on the stair.
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair!
Maria's not an asset to the abbey.
She's always late for chapel,
But her penitence is real.
She's always late for everything,
Except for every meal.
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel
Maria's not an asset to the abbey!
I'd like to say a word on her behalf.
Maria makes me laugh!
How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?
A flibberti gibbet!
A willo' the wisp!
A clown!
Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her,
Many a thing she ought to understand.
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say,
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?
Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?
When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused,
And I never know exactly where I am.
Unpredictable as weather,
She's as flighty as a feather,
She's a darling,
She's a demon,
She's a lamb.
She'd out-pester any pest,
Drive a hornet from his nest,
She could throw a whirling dervish
Out of whirl.
She is gentle,
She is wild,
She's a riddle.
She's a child.
She's a headache!
She's an angel!
She's a girl.

Nuq-Leus,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,2005

Nural,"Can you feel the tension in the air?
Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust,
You break my heart
I'll break your fall

So I lied
Don't say you've done the same
Without a smile upon your face
'Cause once you've but tasted
Of this fruit that lay,
A serpent swayed your ways
Which brings me to my next thought
Walk these roads as crooked as they be
So I lied, and so we lie

Can you feel the tension in the air?
Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust,
You break my heart
I'll break your fall

So I lied,
This time I face the sky without a smile,
Without a trace
And I don't just see blue I choose to
With still no sign of you
Which brings me to my next thought
Don't be fooled by the cunning ways of the truth
So I lied, and so we lie

Weakened knees
Belong to those who find it hard to believe
But so intrigued
By the thought of someone,
Somehow, meeting their needs
By the thought of someone,
Somewhere, meeting our needs

Without tension in the air
Assuring you one again I'm there
You break my trust,
You break my heart
I break your fall
You fall, your fall
Your fall

But can you feel the tension in the air?
Assuring you once again I'm there
'Cause you break my trust,
You break my heart
I'll break your fall
You break my trust, your fall
You break my heart, your fall
I'll break your fall

Finding another world.

Shahbaaz Qalander (Red Falcon) another Sufi Fakir renowned for amazing poetry in love for God.

English Translation: To understand this Qawwali, you need to know a little about the History of the Sufi Saints. Jhoole Lal – A saint from Sindh who as a child was always found on a swing reciting the name of God. Shahbaaz Qalander (Red Falcon) another Sufi Fakir renowned for amazing poetry in love for God. 


Mast Mast – 


Dam Mast Qalander Mast Mast – Upon My breath and in my intoxication is the great Qalander.
Dam Mast Qalander Mast Mast

Mera vird hai dam dam Ali Ali – My worship and upon my breath is the name of Ali.
Saqi Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with the beloved Qalander
Jhoole Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with Jhoole Laal who is intoxicated with Qalander
Aakhi Ja Malanga Akhi Ja Malanga – Keep repeating his name you follower of Ali
Tu Ali Ali Ali Akhi Ja Malanga – You Ali !!! Keep saying his name.


These lyrics mirror exactly the name of the Qawwal – to be in intoxication “Mast”.

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan,"The message is perfectly simple
The meaning is clear
Don't ever stray too far
And don't disappear
No don't disappear
 
Ever had the feeling almost broke in two?
Said that you were leaving like you do you do?
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more 
In tears in tears
 
Be near me  Be near  Be near
 
Never had that feeling until I first me you
Never felt I like kneeling now I do, yes I do
All my dreams came true last night
All my hopes and fears
All my dreams came true once more 
In tears in tears
 
Be near me  Be near  Be near
 
What's your reputation?
Ecstasy!
What's you destination?

Jhoole Lal – A saint from Sindh who as a child was always found on a swing reciting the name of God. Shahbaaz Qalander (Red Falcon) another Sufi Fakir renowned for amazing poetry in love for God.

Dam Mast Qalander Mast Mast – Upon My breath and in my intoxication is the great Qalander.
Dam Mast Qalander Mast Mast

Mera vird hai dam dam Ali Ali – My worship and upon my breath is the name of Ali.
Saqi Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with the beloved Qalander
Jhoole Laal Qalander Mast Mast – I am intoxicated with Jhoole Laal who is intoxicated with Qalander
Aakhi Ja Malanga Akhi Ja Malanga – Keep repeating his name you follower of Ali
Tu Ali Ali Ali Akhi Ja Malanga – You Ali !!! Keep saying his name.

Livin' the life of a ghetto star

Makaveli

Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn't have tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
Eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)

I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Street smart, proficient, intelligent
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waitin to get done in
Back, we tossed his ass out
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G
Now the next generation's lookin' at me through (?)

Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
2 shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
His family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Why, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Set up shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
Put cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star

Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star

When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star

This goes out to all you motherfuckers (to all you motherfuckers)

What's yo name? Where you from, girl?

Ride with a gangsta, I'm a type of gangsta

It ain't 'bout the change, she said, ?I want the paper?
I'm feelin' ya style and ya classy ways
I want my child in ya stomach but not havin' my baby

Anyway I'm a one night stand man
And after this night I'm a dump you like a trash can
Like I set you on fire I can put you out

Yeah, I gotta Sprint and a T Mobile and a Nextel phone
And all three of 'em ringin' from bad ass bitches that wanna bone
Take one or two calls, take one to the telly and take one home
Cuttin' corners barely missin' the curb, tryin' not to break her bone

I'm sittin' on choppa eighty-threes and fresh ass meat
A nigga tried to jack me for 'em so I opened up his chest last week
I'm rude as a mothafucker but I get nice when I receive head
Might fall off for a minute but I get back right when I receive bread

Talk up on somethin' short and thick, go straight to the bed with it
But on the low, low 'cause someones always watchin' like a Fed visit
Crucify the coochie then cut a couple of corners
Cruisin' with me in the Bentley soon as I borrow ya

Just because I'm pushin fancy cars
Freak Out - Chalk up another notch
Could it be the diamonds in my watch

You think somebody tell her I got dough
Freak Out - Whatever, only do what you feel is clear
Long as we can freak out, I don't care

Hit the spot laced up like I usually do
The way I shine is a crime, cats might want to assume
Nothin' new, I been on the walk out here with a few

Has to wonder, Nut gotta slide with her
(Backwards), check your riches, son, I concur
Hit her long from gutter loans, get her sprung from wetter tongues
Body bangin' like a whole set of drums

Damn, wit time flat, spit my game
Drop a quarter by her nice thighs, ""This your change?""
Who these fake-trackin' field cats runnin' the see?
You can take this both ways, you're comin' wit me

On the real, need to feel some of that, lay wood like a lumberjack
From the side, little hair from the back
Of course, wit protection, never ever let em leak out

You know I ain't seen this [BACKWARDS], look at the hips on her
Shorty's mad phat, see every inch of her stack, black
Gotta act like groceries, bag that

(Word, son, take one, no, take two)
Too late, son, you know I seen her first, don't hate, son
Forget it, I spit at her to get her wit it
Like a friendly game of baseball, we all can hit it

That sounds doper, stet it, now Teddy set it off and rope her
End of the night we all get closer
What up mutt? See y'all might know who I am
Gotta sec, 'cause you need to meet the rest of the fam

Nothin' I'm sellin' but this is quite true, chicks like you
No tellin' what [BACKWARDS] on a nut might do
You lack, no if, and's and but's
'Cause when you're done, you'll know why they call me Nut

[Chorus]

Uhh
First of all, before you freak out the foreplay
Don't rush the lady, POP the chardonnay
Let her know the gentile manners you mental

Meanwhile she's wonderin' whether the in was out
No doubt, tip your glass, let the white wine soar
It might taste so-you're to a tongue that's poor
She want to know if I gotta girl, of course

Does the Teddy Riley have a mansion and dogs?
Keep it true, fool, so my time invested will be youthful
[BACKWARDS] puttin' em up for poo poo
No need to lie when your lingo's so tragic

She could be made the mandingo and gotta have it
Two [unknown], pink hearts, and blue diamonds as I stab it
You must think I'm lucky charms, silly rabbit
No tricks for the tale, that's the big cash to man

My only mission in this is kick dis a plan, freak out

[Chorus: x2]

[Interlude]
Time to freak, let's go get the boys
Now we reached, oh what a joy
Just come on down, to the hits, boy
Hit the spot, we're havin a ball

Nuttea,"Il est rentré dans la maison où le jour baisse

Il est assis au fond du métro, où personne ne regarde
Silence pesant, trois mecs montent, visages menaçants
""Allez, tombe la veste, on est accroc d'elle""
Mais lui supplie, commence à pleurer, son père lui a offert à Noël
Elle change de main
Il a beau dire que ses parents n'ont pas un sou
Au fond, tout le monde s'en fout
Les trois types, les gens autour gratuitement, la lame est soudaine
L'Opinel pénètre, dix centimètres dans l'abdomen
Ça fait déjà un an, il aurait seize ans
Son père ne s'en est jamais vraiment remis
Lorsqu'il entre dans sa chambre, rien n'a changé
Les jouets, les livres, cependant les murs sont tristes
Pourquoi vivre si tuer c'est facile? On veut tourner le couteau
Quand tout s'écroule d'un coup au fond d'un métro, il gît là
Les flics enquêtent, bouffent des sandwiches, même sourient
Racontent leur vie, ils parlent même pas de lui
Il a du mal à s'imaginer, jadis son enfant innocent
En une seconde, pour 400 francs, mourant dans une flaque de sang
Une flaque de pleurs, une vague de peur, la bague du bonheur
Fruit de l'amour, fauché par le tranchant d'une dague de malheur
C'était pas l'heure de partir, il ne lui avait pas tout dit
Tant pis, ce sera au Paradis
Et des remords la racine, s'élève un arbre
Et de l'arbre pousse des fleurs délicates qui viennent caresser le marbre

La nuit on assassine et chacun crie ""à l'aide!""
La nuit on assassine et chacun crie ""à l'aide!""

Encore une tombe à fleurir
Un ange part dans un dernier soupir
Un fait divers dans une ruelle
Un cri court, personne n'entend l'appel
Encore une tombe à fleurir
Un ange part dans un dernier soupir
Un fait divers dans une ruelle
Un cri court, personne n'entend l'appel

Rue sombre, éclairée aux néons
Deux heures déjà qu'elle fait les cents pas
Et dans le sac toujours pas un rond
Trottoirs glauques, bars sales, bagarres d'ivrognes
Les talons frappent le goudron, au feu rouge un mec klaxonne
Elle en a marre de ces tarés qui passent, repassent, la condamnent
Blessent son âme et dix mètres plus loin se marrent
Ça marche pas bien aujourd'hui, les mecs n'ont pas envie
À cause de la pluie ou la vie, le sexe perd face au souci
Un manteau, un parapluie, l'enfer en costume gris
Se rapproche, son regard fuit, elle dit son prix, c'est parti
S'ouvre la porte, couloir vers le purgatoire, pour elle l'histoire
Tourne tel un train fantôme de foire
De sa rue au glissement des bas noirs, miroir
Dis-lui qui est la plus belle
Ne la laisse pas croire seule le soir
Que les fées se foutent d'elle
Belle au bois dormant pour un matelas sans ressorts
Ancrée à son sort comme un bateau usé, jamais ne sort du port
Blanche-Neige a croqué le fruit amer sans amertume
Pour eux, elle n'est qu'un pute, pour son fils elle reste une mère
Une peau d'âne princesse le jour esclave la nuit
Mais les escarpins sont maudits, il ramène Cendrillon vers son taudis
Les murs témoins de l'étreinte plus brève que tendre
Capturent son regard rêveur, seul remède contre la démence
Sorti par la fenêtre un cri sans bruit hante les rues sans vie
Sorti par la fenêtre un cri court dans la nuit

La nuit on assassine et chacun crie ""à l'aide!""
La nuit on assassine et chacun crie ""à l'aide!""

Encore une tombe à fleurir
Un ange part dans un dernier soupir
Un fait divers dans une ruelle
Un cri court, personne n'entend l'appel
Encore une tombe à fleurir
Un ange part dans un dernier soupir
Un fait divers dans une ruelle
Un cri court, personne n'entend l'appel
Encore une tombe à fleurir, encore une tombe à fleurir
Encore une tombe à fleurir

Nuttea,"PARTOUT OÙ J'IRAI
Que vaut la vie d'un homme dans certains pays
Pas plus qu'une poignée de billets
On s'entretue pour rien ou pour presque rien tcho?
Je partirais au lever du jour
Plus rien ne me retient ici
Ils ont tué le peu d'amour
Qui restait dans cette chienne de vie
La misère qui ronge nos faubourgs
Ne fait qu'endurcir mon esprit
J'irais chercher ailleurs
Un peu d'espoir
Qui sait si la roue tourne
Demain me sourira
Refrain
Je sais que partout où j'irai
Faudra payer le prix
Ici ou ailleurs tout ce que je sais
C'est qu'on est en droit de choisir
Je pars et Dieu seul sait où je vais
Sûrement loin d'ici
Je sais ce que j'y trouverais
Le meilleur, comme le pire
Je ne crois pas à la terre promise
Je ne vois pas l'horizon
Même si la tyrannie s'éternise
Je garderais toutes mes illusions
C'est tout un symbole qu'on brise
Pour s'affranchir de l'oppression
Quoi qu'il arrive
Je n'ai plus rien à perdre
C'est à la force des mains
Que je me construirais un avenir
Au refrain
Comment vivre jour après jour
Si on t'enseigne l'ignorance
Qu'il n' y a que les fusils en recours
Face à la trop grande arrogance
De pays servant de beaux discours
Pour larguer leur bombe à outrance
Je prie le ciel, pour que vive l'espoir
De voir un jour mon peuple se lever
Pour le droit de vivre libre
Au refrain ad lib.",Partout Où J'Irai,2004
Nuttea,"Le sûr de rien, le manque de tout empêche de rester lucide
Et le doute charge au pas de course, voiler les gens qu’il décime
Les yeux rivés sur ce tableau ou tous ces chiffres défilent
Combien d’avenir se décide? Combien vont grossir la pile?
A la dérive, bien sûr qu’on l’est quand on se sent inutile
Pour exister, il faut ramer comme dans un drakkar viking
Planter au bord de la route, avec nos tronches de victimes
Chaque jour qui passe, nos dos se voûtent et peu à peu ils s’effritent
On punit plus les trop avides et les faits nous le confirment
Quid de leur justice? Une vieille infirme
Un peu sourde, un peu myope, un peu presbyte
Très maline quand il s’agit de tour de magie
(Ils, sont tapis des fois ce pays, comme une grosse gourmandise)
Toi tu penses avoir des miettes en remplissant leurs valises
Tout appelle à l’unité, tu fais des choix qui divisent
C’est comme donner les clés de ta vie à ceux qui te maîtrisent
Les idées foireuses, on sait ce que ça attise, on sait ce que ça attire
Surtout ce qui les motive, cracher leur venin comme une vipère aspic
Ces serpents là ne peuvent évoluer qu’en terrain aride
Ce qui se dessine au loin me pétrifie, je vois à quoi ils s’identifient
Quand l’air se densifie, alors la lutte s’intensifie

Ce que tu veux construire, nous on en veut pas
Pour tes erreurs passées, on ne paiera pas
Ta vision de ce monde c’est le non-retour
T’étonne pas si un jour ça fait boom, boom, boom
Tu verras, ce jour-là, tous les poings s’élever
Refuser d’une seule voix, mirador et barbelés
Tes lois scélérates nous on en veut pas
Ton contrat moral, garde le pour toi
Quand t’impose tes vues sans aucun recours
T’étonne pas si un jour ça fait boom, boom, boom, boom

Pourquoi passer une vie entière à ressasser la colère?
C’est pareil à la fin, le monde gagne, on a beau faire
Des gesticulations, quémander un peu d’air
Mais nos villes, grises, crèvent, alors ils plantent un peu d’herbe
J’habite là où les bougres ne voient que leurs prés carrés
Dans le secteur, les droits de l’Homme faudrait les redéclarer
Le béton mange l’espace, même pas un petit parc
Le petit chef d’hier est devenu leur petit mac
Du coup on manif, la violence fait écho massif
Déguisé en alter, des casseurs néo-nazis
Ça ne passe pas aux assises, open-bar au racisme
Revenir aux racines, non je place plus haut ma cible
Entend claquer le fouet sur un gros amas de peine
Il porte bien son nom ce con de travail à la chaîne
Le taff disparaît, ne reste que le bleu des veines
Écœuré par la vie, emménagé chez BFM
Répression, je vois écris le plan gras
Le citoyen lambda subit la loi des gens bad
Regarde l’horizon, les gros nuages s’épaississent
Je rêve démocratie, pas tyrannie des dépressifs
A défaut de nous faire passer tous au fil de l’épée
On nous distribue la Vaseline en tube de l’été
Bientôt le prix eau étalonné par un baril
Foulé par nos pieds, de plus en plus de terre aride

Ce que tu veux construire, nous on en veut pas
Pour tes erreurs passées, on ne paiera pas
Ta vision de ce monde c’est le non-retour

Nuttin' But Stringz,"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me 
And then
Spin me around 'till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me 
And I knew for sure 
I was loved

If I could get another chance
Another walk
Another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
How I'd love love love 
To dance with my father again

When I and my mother 
Would disagree
To get my way I would run 
From her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me
yeah yeah
Then finally make me do 
Just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he 
Would be gone from me

If I could steal one final glance
One final step 
One final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never ever end
Cause I'd love love love to 
Dance with my father again

Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear how mama would cry for him
I'd pray for her even more than me
I'd pray for her even more than me

But could you send her

Many years spent hop skipping and a-jumping
We cracked the golden egg and cooked our goose
There's no excuse, accept my truce
There's a tremor in the air of all hell breaking loose
And people, you like it or not, you'll go unheard
Like the unknown soldier who didn't say a word
Rounded up like the blood beaten rest of the herd
At the crossroads of life in itself seems absurd
But I'll hopscotch, cartwheel across, pointing the finger of fate
Oh, I'm in the mood to create

People, it's been a short term marriage
The overnight revolution caused so much damage

When it comes to butts we are the masters 
Ain't a butt with a kitty in front gettin' past us 
But there's a part of the butt that we want to introduce 
It's nasty and wet and it's called booty juice 

[Chorus:]
That booty juice, juice, juice 
That booty juice, juice, juice 

Booty juice comes right from the source 
What's the source an ass of curse 
The kind that spreads out extra wide 
The kind that's nice when you come inside. 
It's fresh an meaty all pasturized 
But I always rise when I tap the thighs 
'Cause I like'm big , I like'm greasy 
I like'm round and I like'm easy 
I like'm when the girls steps on the floor 
Shake'n them booties just like a ho 
I like it when it shakes in the pants so loose 
But I love it when it's drippin -- that booty juice 

[Chorus]

When booty juice falls gotta go for yours 
When it's really wet you gotta mop the floor 
When I look fine fade to dance 
I make my decision by the shape of her pants 
Cause the bigger the butt, the bigger the shake 
The bigger the shake, the more it's gonna make that booty juice 
Ain't made by hand but yes it does come from a can 
Pop it open and take a sip careful not to catch you lip 
In a can is where the river runs and quench your thirst between those buns 

[Chorus]

See I like the fit with the nasty ass 
The kind that hums when the shit goes past 
Grab a cheek when the girl goes by 
Slap it hard make the booty juice fly 
Yo baby doll pull down those tight draws 
When your butt expands it'll slap the walls 
I'll grab it from front and from behind 
We'll do the nasty and do the grind 
Slip and slide all over the sheets 
Cause booty juice is just like grease 
Buck so hard that your butt gets wet

Take off those draws, take off that lace 
Have a seat on my face and let me taste

Don't say it's okay that's oral masturbation 
Hats offer enclosure from deadly exposure 
Of sucker imposers ready to close your Coffin 
And lower you down black 
Bald buried and beaten into a pre-dug track 
That's whack- the way they dis the black 
How can a brother complain when we don't fight back? 
It ain't hate cause we retaliate 
With the gat in my hands and the hat on my pate 
See back in the day out in the fields they kept us 
Exposed to the rays, without no shields they left us 
Without a hat we wuz exposed 
Without a hat we wuz sunstroked 
The African sun was pure and good 
Never needed a hat just brotherhood 
But the good old days are a brothers worst enemy 
Tell me stay bald I say it ain't me 
Look in my eyes and you'll realize 
These ain't lies I wouldn't lead you wrong

Como as coisas mudam e ficam pra trás
O que era bom hoje não faz mais sentido, é
Uma hora isso ia acontecer
A vida cobra e a gente tem que crescer

Eu vejo a vida, tem vários caminhos
E entre eles o destino improvisa
Nos pequenos detalhes da vida
A resposta está escondida

And I'll be rolling, rolling
Baby get me dope
And I did all wrong, although your heart was gold
Now I may be numb and lonely and heartbroke
Facing that before this heart starts smoke
If you wanted I should, could, would get it
Maybe I should a couple miles, just a little bit
But I was thinking about the present, I was way too selfish
Trying hard not to call you, I just can't help it
Girl you changed me, know this ain't a praise
But it's kind hard to speak without my faith
If you left, leave me I'll act I was all brave
I want you in my life, no one can please me
Rush in to the phone when I hear your ringtone
Hear you when I think, like you push your things on
I'll wrap, but you make me want get my sing on
Gotta sit back and wonder how you get the jeans on, shut

Memórias e lembranças, certezas e duvidas
Nada parece mudar
E apesar de tudo, enquanto o tempo passa
Ainda espero sua resposta

Aonde estiver, espero que esteja feliz
Encontre o seu caminho
Guarde o que foi bom (foi bom) e jogue fora o que restou
Aonde estiver, espero que esteja feliz
Encontre seu caminho

Just after I'd wiped away his last tear 
I guess he's better off than he was before, 
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because he was my only friend 
Those kind of cars don't pass you every day 
I used 2 cry 4 Tracy because I wanted to see him again, 
But sometimes sometimes life ain't always the way... 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad, so bad 
Sometimes I wish life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

Springtime was always my favorite time of year, 
A time 4 lovers holding hands in the rain 
Now springtime only reminds me of Tracy's tears 
Always cry 4 love, never cry 4 pain 
He used 2 say so strong unafraid to die 
Unafraid of the death that left me hypnotized 
No, staring at his picture I realized 
No one could cry the way my Tracy cried 

Sometimes it snows in April 
Sometimes I feel so bad 
Sometimes, sometimes I wish that life was never ending, 
And all good things, they say, never last 

I often dream of heaven and I know that Tracy's there 
I know that he has found another friend 
Maybe he's found the answer 2 all the April snow 
Maybe one day I'll see my Tracy again

Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, (On meurt qu'une fois)
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh

A nous,
Et à nos frères,
S'il faut mourir demain,
Avant qu'on nous enterre,
A nous,
Si le bonheur est sur terre

A nous,
A ce qui est pris qui n'est plus à prendre,
A aujourd'hui si le ciel peut attendre,
A toi et moi,
A toi et moi",À Nous,2013
Nyco Lilliu,"Lui,
Il est mes lèvres
Il est mon souffle
Celui de tous mes rêves
Lui
Il est la sève
Il est l’amour
Et le désir qu’il m’enlève
Loin
Loin de tout loin d’ici
N’importe où avec lui
Maintenant que je sais 
L’homme Pour qui je suis faite
De me jours à ses nuits
Ce que seront nos vies
Puisqu’il en rêve aussi

C’est déjà trop tard
J’ai dit oui
Plus rien nous sépare
J’ai dit oui
Prête à l’impensable, 
Je le suis, je le suis

Pour lui
Je suis l’ailleurs
Où il se couche
Je suis le cœur qui bat pour
Lui
Je suis la route
Et le dessein
Qui tient à l’emmener plus
Loin
Que les jours et les nuits
Que nos vies d’aujourd’hui
Puisque j’en rêve aussi

C’est déjà trop tard
J’ai dit oui
Plus rien nous sépare
J’ai dit oui
Prête à l’impensable, 
Je le suis, je le suis

Demain on sera loin
Personne n’y changera rien
Puisque rien ne retient demain

C’est déjà trop tard
J’ai dit oui
Plus rien nous sépare
J’ai dit oui
Prête à l’impensable, 
Je le suis, je le suis",J'ai dit oui,2014
Nydia,"Si estas pensando que sufriendo estoy 
Estas soñando, no sabes quien soy 
Soy insensible a heridas de amor 
Jamas exclamo un hay! de dolor 
Te has engañado me siento muy bien 
No te e extrañado no tengo por que 
Fuiste aventura como muchas mas 
Amor a oscuras sin felicidad 
Tal vez te quise lo mismo que tu 
cuando te fuiste volvi a ver la luz 
Otras vez! otras vez! otras vez
Vivo en paz! Vivo en paz! ah! 
No estas con migo, no estoy con tigo 
Por eso ahora mismo vivo muy en paz 

No estas con migo, no estoy con tigo 
Por eso ahora mismo vivo muy en paz 
Si estas pensando que sufriendo estoy 
Estas soñando, no sabes quien soy 
Soy insensible a heridas de amor 
Jamas exclamo un hay! de dolor 

No no no no no",Insensible,2001
Nydia,"No vale la pena
Lo que tú me quieres
Porque es muy poquito
Eso no me llena, no me suficiente
Quiero otro tantito

No vale la pena
Tus distantes citas
Casi no te veo
La intención es buena
Nadie te lo quita
Pero más yo quiero

No vale la pena, corazón
Es amor de un rato
Si siempre yo te veo, corazón
Muy de vez en cuando

No vale la pena
Date cuenta de eso
Que lo que tú me has dado
Es una miseria, son muy pocos besos
Para un enamorado

No vale la pena, corazón
Es amor de un rato
Si siempre yo te veo, corazón
Muy de vez en cuando

No vale la pena
Date cuenta de eso
Que lo que tú me has dado
Es una miseria, son muy pocos besos
Para un enamorado

No vale la pena
