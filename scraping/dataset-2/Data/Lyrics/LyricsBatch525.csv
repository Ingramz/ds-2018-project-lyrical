Kalmah,"Watery rubber boots
On the field of moss
Inside the boots weary legs
Of the man I always meet

Swamp full of mist
Icy embrace
Nothing left of
Sense of direction

[Chorus]
Swamphell
Kill me, let me sink in your lap

Once was the air crystal clear
Secular joys were so near
Glory days have left behind
Swamplord calls now misty mind 

Swamp full of mist
Icy embrace
Nothing left of
Sense of direction

[Chorus]

When there is nothing left on the surface
And the wind is blowing slow
Under the carpet of moss
Finally I meet my Swamplord",Swamphell,2002
Kalmah,"Rhythm of wings in the sky so high
Music in my ears I can't wait to see
I' m hiding in the grass death in my hands
Surprise is my only defense

My private war against wilderness
Human mastermind versus animal instinct
And when the flock settles I pass my sentence
But none will die after the report

They rise into the air and fly away

[Chorus]
But they will return
And I am all alone
Yeah, they will return
Then I will revenge

[Chorus]

Still some day I'm hiding again
Waiting for the sound of stroking wings
And they will come spirit within
And in same place I miss them again

They rise into the air
And fly away
Yeah, they rise into the air
But they will return!",They Will Return,2002
Kalmah,"Thoughts of hope in the minds of those whose
Lives are on decline
A thousand lies told them with bright eyes
And believed without doubts of employment 
Now itÂ´s time to think very positive
Deny all the evil things
Hah, right time to face this reality
Take all the pain

Coming with me, bird of ill omen
Living in me, bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen

Purity behind the mask of innocence
Weakness of this world
Blind-eyed fools will never rise from unfairness
Until theyÂ´ll join the Good!

Coming with me, bird of ill omen
Living in me, bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen

The carrier of the crown of thorns
Hides behind a dollar smile
And will judge the Poor!

So letÂ´s throw away all our useless hope
Nothing will ever change!
Hah, right time to face this reality
Take all the pain

Coming with me, bird of ill omen
Living in me, bird of ill omen
Bird of ill omen",Bird of Ill Omen,2003
Kalmah,"There is a net under the ice
With a thousand knots tied
And unchecked amount of slime
Hanging down 
There is a burbot on the net
Into the mesh he has put his head
Now struggling for his life
Entangling more and more
And there is a fisherman on the ice
Drilling a hole with sweat and blood
Trying to draw the net above
The icy surface
But even though how hard he pulls
The net won't budge
Under the ice the net has stuck 
With thousand knots into the ground
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds
Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge
With frustration and despair in his mind he decides
To fight to the bitter end with all his strength
But with his latest wrench
The net will tear to shreds

Burbot's revenge
Burbot's revenge",Burbot's Revenge,2003
Kalmah,"You take a frogÂ´s eye and give it to a man 
Pleased with your cyborg proudly you stand
This glorious madness that is not in gods hands
Makes you believe youÂ´re all powerful 
This inhumane robot 
Becomes a heathen god

Will be idolized and takes all control
Spreads over the planet and infects us all
With this evil act the main race will be
And too late resisted by you or by me

Kalmah,"Things move when IÂ´m not watching them 
They have their own will
And I donÂ´t even feel insane
Because I know IÂ´m ill 
I know there is an eye and IÂ´m under observation
I am a marked man got some information

Governments use millions for supervision
Global message interception
Satellite receivers of Echelon system
Carnivore technique for digital control

It is said that terror lives behind the wall of privacy
But what do the rights really mean in our society?

Finger prints, personal I.D, credit card, database
A paradox of privacy

Doubtful about it all 
Doubtful about it all 
Doubtful about it all 
Doubtful about it all 

Eyes of god, secret crimes, causality, reckoning day

Kalmah,"In the middle of nowhere
Where the wild spruces grow
Stands a man with his chainsaw
Gloomy thoughts in his mind 
Until my foot has gone to sleep I must have sawn
A million blocks of wood, no payment before
What a hell did I do wrong to deserve this trade
Feels like IÂ´m a marionette, an errand boy, a slave

But I never give up
I will never give up

Gnawing bones, muscle cramps, backache
Coldness, warmth, heavy rains, mosquitoes
And this goddamn saw that will never work
But with a madmanÂ´s eyes I carry on, nothing they can do

A man with mystery
A man without history
A man with his story

Kalmah,"I've chosen my way of life IÂ´ll drink my every coin
And even if IÂ´m broken IÂ´ll drink my homemade moonshine
Until it is all in my head and I will meet my fellows
Those who creep around at nights and will not allow me 
To be acceptable, to be respectable, to be normal,
To be a decent man
But IÂ´m neurotic, I am vehement, I am withdrawn,
A psychotic man
Unsuccessful, hesitant

DonÂ´t have much lifetime left the rest IÂ´ll spend in deep
Tordah!
DonÂ´t have much lifetime left the rest IÂ´ll spend in deep

And with all my fellows we will take our place on the bottom
We will gather in your neighborhood to reach our destination
We will drink our past, weÂ´ll drink our future for you my friend
So, that youÂ´ll have a fixed point, a point of comparison

To be acceptable, to be respectable, to be normal,
To be a decent man
But IÂ´m neurotic, I am vehement, I am withdrawn,

Kalmah,"Wasting feeling breeding inside me
A shadow of something crawling behind me
And Im pretending theres nothing in there
But hearing those whispers makes me to believe

Here, I lay in my bed tasting bitter sweet
Smell, in my breathe reminding smell of death
Dreams, in my head slowly fade away
The end is nearby me and I want it to be

The king, inside my head seducing me to betray
You, the only one making myself me
The loss, in my life great it will be
The game is taking me and the prize is defeat

Defeat
Inevitable, my destiny
Best friend I've ever met
Hands stretching up to reach the sky

Grobing for a life-hold a place to stay
Fingers are slipping and Im falling down
Into the world I know the world of sadness

Room, in my heart empty as a well
Still waiting for the victory to take
In vain, I've lost this game before I've even born
Defeat, my destiny all I ever get",Defeat,2006
Kalmah,"And life goes on with harmony
Day after day those same routines
And lifetime filled with happiness
The most greatest joy

So great is the sea so small your boat
But you don´t know if you don´t row
And so great is the sky above your blue eyes
But you can´t see behind the lies

In the smallest crack of your life´s track
Is a chance for me to attack
Now the time is right for you to say
Your last goodbyes

Face yourself, your own dreams
I am your real demon hidden in your mind
I´ll show you my own world, I´ll take you down to the
Bitter metallic side

You´re lying next to me and you´re too good to me
And I think you know I can´t let you go

Bitter
But don´t throw away your last coin
I have to do this all my own
I only want you to know
I´m buried deep down in your soul",Bitter Metallic Side,2006
Kalmah,"And she walks her way so treatled
Leads away from the bless sheÂ's earned
Gone away the meaning
Before the day against the morning

Down the path of the blind souls she walks
Through the dreams of mystery
Tryin' to reach the touch of human
Finds the way to the secret lands

Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts
Calling is guiding
Dazzling her instincts

Hymn of temptation keeps calling
Makes her to believe the dream
She wants to lay to rest
And to take away her veil

Soon will feel the touch of the Taker
And will see the eyes of the Caller
CanÂ't resist the feeling
Hand in hand they will fall into sleep

Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz

Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz
Dancing with me
Forever the black waltz



",The Black Waltz,2006
Kalmah,"The groan of wind
A hiding deadly disease
A killer that hides in the wind
And cannot be seen
A powerful enemy a threat that truly exists
By a hair hung our lives
We see that but we're blind

Ever-transforming, reproductive, worldwide pandemic

Our time is running out
The clock is striking on
And in spite of our drugs
We'll stay powerless

The groan of wind
A silent killing machine
There's no place we can breathe
Deep down in our lungs symptom breeds

H5N1 Lethal time bomb

Maybe we have earned our urns
We cannot endlessly breed
Our scientific achievements
Nature simply will beat
The groan of wind a hiding deadly disease",The Groan of Wind,2006
Kalmah,"A condemned man in a prison cell charged with a crime he has done
He draws a picture on the wall a symbol of victory
He clothed peoples thoughts in words declared peace and liberty
The iron fist clenching his throat depriving humanity

A political prisoner a propagandistic weapon
Of the proletarian dictature against the other world
After he has been released
Got his name on the paper
A part of a macabre tradition
Released as a gift
And we´re all staring at the news
Nodding our heads in approval
We think that the the world is better now
Although he is already dead

A condemned man in a prison cell charged with a crime he has done
He draw a picture on the wall a symbol of victory
He clothed peoples thoughts in words declared peace and liberty
The iron fist clenching his throat depriving humanity

A political prisoner a propagandistic weapon
Of the proletarian dictature against the other world

We don´t give a damn
He is not one of us just one from the stands
And afterwards we have cleared ourselves
Justice has done

Soon another one will come declares peace and liberty
Speaks the words want to be heard words of alteration
But he will be arrested he will be condemned
But never mind there are more in the stands",One from the Stands,2006
Kalmah,"Waken by the scream of a buzzard
Sending cold shivers down his back

Now across the barren desert gallops a horse
The only thing alive maintaining hope
soon the steps will slow and horse ends up dead
The rider´s hope now gone too tired to resist

The bonfires behind his back
The chasers wait for their last attack
The long arm of law has reached him
This time he cannot fight back

Now walking in procession hands around his back
Surrounded by the people who only want him dead
In his eyes the look reminds he´s not ready to tap
Yesterday a hero now a victim of combat
In Judge´s eyes the look - you´re mine

To the gallows
Says the voice through the white hood
To the rope
Shouts the crowd around the dark hill

Now climbing the stairs with distress
Cannot feel hunger or fear of death
Defiance in his face he is standing
In front of the law he resisted",To the Gallows,2006
Kalmah,"Tonight I'll see the line of thousand ghosts
Those once were alive behind my eyes
And I'm on the crossfire of my manic thoughts
Under the yoke of the hidden evil

Why did you follow my footsteps?
Why did you present yourself against me?

Now I have to run, I have to leave behind
The things I've done
Over the plains, over the mountain tops
Covered with snow, to the unknown
Into the foreign lands there shall I go
But I know they're after me and it is my time to bleed

Those restless dreams keep on teasing
I can see your eyes just before you died
And the blood red scar between my shoulder blades
It's making me mad

Dead man's shadow
Wavering above me
Dead man's shadow
Restless soul haunting me

Now I have to run, I have to leave behind
The things I've done
Over the plains, over the mountain tops
Covered with snow, to the unknown
Into the foreign lands there shall I go
But I know they're after me and it's my time to bleed

Those restless dreams keep on teasing me
I can see your eyes just before you died
And the blood red scar between my shoulder blades
It's making me mad

Dead man's shadow
Wavering above me
Dead man's shadow
Restless soul haunting me

",Dead Man's Shadow,2008
Kalmah,"Desperate cry of a child
Who only wants to live
An innocent human being
Deprived of all his dreams

Painful faces of the others
Who once were the chosen
Innocent eyes of the child
Never going to see

The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation

Remembrance behind the scene
Of unjustice and injustice
In the forsaken faces
Expression of frustration

The voice of crystal children
Of deaf ears it has fallen
And the preacher delivers a sermon
But who's ready for salvation

Kalomoira,"Can you see it? can you see it 
You have to discover me 
What goes wrong when I'm crying 
Or what I want when I'm smiling 

can you feel it? can you feel it 
That I'm not a little girl
You're misunderstanding my way
And all the rules that I like to play

My secret combination it's a mystery for you
Use your imagination I'm not easy but I'm true
My secret combination boy you have to try hard 
To win a destination in the center of my heart
An open book an open book well I'm sorry but I'm not
Sometimes I'm acting like a lady sometimes woman sometimes baby

Kalonoa,"[Shoestring - talking]
I'm ready to tell you my secret now
I see dead people, but they don't know that they're dead
And sometimes, when it get real cold, that means they're mad

[Shoestring - singing]
Can't go to sleep I hear a beat, it sounded just like feet
Jump off my seat, see they hit my window, cause I gots the beat
I've seen a shadow pulling cattle from an early battle
I've seen this snake up in my shoe and all I heard was rattle (rattle sound)

Picked up the phone and it exploded like a fucking bomb
I'm seeing shadows biting me like they was Jeffrey Dahm
So many clicks, so many crews trying to blow my fuse
So many shadows in my yard that I feel abused (gong sound)

I'm hearing voices in my head and I can see a tread
I'm seeing scores, a pitbull and he's smelling dead
Slipped on my slippers, the ones with the chromed zippers
Knocked out a shadow in my room, all these Jack the Rippers

I fight with tigers, the shadows say they're Michael Myers
Just like Jack Nickleson played ""The Wolf"" I hear my neighbors driers
All this pain in my brain makes me go insane
I'm hearing chains and tracks and running trains (train running, gong sound)

A lot of these soldiers in my kitchen with their bloody blades
No hands, no knives, just bodies and their hand grenades
I started ducking, them soldiers started busting at me
Flashbacks when I was two father hollered at me

Hearing whistles the click from pistols got me live annoyed
Past beef won't let me rest, I live like Sleepy Froyd
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow (echos, gong sound)

[Bootleg - talking]
We're all walking in the valley of the shadow of death
So concentrate on your family, friends and loved ones
Because you never know when there's a shadow

[Chorus: Kalonda, Ryan]
Shadow, every time I turn around there's a shadooooow
Though I walk through the valley of a shadooooow (gong sound)
Life's too short to take for granted fearing shadooooow
I can't take this pain I'm feeling from these

[Bootleg]
Woke up, hopped out the bed this morning, felt somebody watching
Opened my door no one was there I swear I hear'em knocking
Cocking my pistol cause I'm paranoid and in a zone
Somebody said whip me, but I know I'm home alone (gong sound)

Jumped in the shower, trying to wash away this eary feeling
Walked out my bathroom seeing shadows dancing on the ceiling
Put on my clothes and smoked a cigarette and brushed my grill
My pitbull Puppy barking at so what I know ain't real (dogs barking)

Turned on my T.V. watching CNN, I heard a boom (explosion)
Two shadows having sex, I hear'em fucking in my room
Exit my residence the only face's a gust of wind (wind whistling)
Too hard for wind, a shadow's what it must have been

Ain't no such things as ghosts, I'm tripping dawg and I know it
Walked towards my car, the horn went off, a shadow had to blow it (car honks)
I need a drink to think and sort out all these weird events
I killed a man, my life's been haunted ever since

I can't believe the shit I'm seeing turning up my bottle
I keep my eyes and I'll rip you, I swear I'm being followed
Can't goto sleep at night unless I take a sleeping pill
Reflections in the mirror fucking with my head for real (gong sound)

I never thought that there was nothing wrong with how I think
Until my momma told me: 'Leg, go see a shrink!
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow

[Chorus]

[Bootleg - talking]
I thank God every morning when I wake up
'Cause you never know when you're gonna walk out your front door
And get murdered in your driveway
So I'll be telling you this: Keep your mind on your family, friends, and foes

'Cause most niggas is hoes (gong sound)
And they shoot you cause you bawling more than they is
So stay out them whole in the Warclubs
Nigga show love to your family and friends
And get your ass, fuck'em

Kam,"""Whassup nigga? Whassup for the weekend nigga?""
[Kam]
The weekend?!
That shit ain't nothin but another two days
that niggaz act crazy on
Then it's gone, and everybody feel FUCKED UP THE ASS
cause they spent they last
on shit that they wouldn't get, no other days of the week
""Why is that?"" Because they too damn cheap
Been keepin the act up, for forty-eight hours
They weekend warriors, but weekday cowards (bustaz)
All of a sudden, everybody got so much heart
You know some shit gots to start
But believe you me, between now and then
a gang of motherfuckers lives gon' end
but yo, if they lucky they will know how to get away
Then they'll live to punk out another day
But am I wrong when I say that?
""Hell nah, cause the homies don't play that""

And y'all know, it's happenin ""every single weekend""

It's the same routine, every seven day period
The opposite sex, got us all doin weird shit
It's all about gettin credit, for bein that
hell of a nigga, and so you slang for the putang
Figure it out, cause see it's just for the skeezin
Ain't no other reason
And a season don't go by that niggaz don't show off
and break some laws so they can take some drawers home
Or straight perpetrate, all cause they learned wrong
Wearin beepers, that ain't even turned on
A fake Rolex, tryin to look like a star
A phony phone antenna on a rent-a-car
Wait, it don't stop with the men though
I know the same amount of hoes tradin ass for the indo
Tryin your best, but you can not fool me
into thickin that you rich, with no costume jewelry on

Ten and two, fingertips on the steering wheel
Sittin on the phonebook, smellin like Clear-a-sil
A young boy's weekend on the Eastside
Caught the bus and came back with a G-ride
The little homies put the tank on E
So it's on one of y'all to rush another G
And now everybody knowin how he felt
Damn, here come one time, put on y'all seatbelt
Heart beatin so hard they shakin
If one-time pull us over nigga I'm breakin
cause they comin up fast in the rearview
So don't nobody'll look until the coast is clear too
They all on the ass like a tiger stalkin
y'all put on the grin, and pretend we all talkin
and, if he don't sweat the rest is simple
Everybody hit his ass up out the window

And, you know we doin it, ""every single weekend""
""shit happens""		""every single weekend""

[Kam]
Well this was strictly for the underground parties
who can relate, straight to all these events
The ones happenin, ""every single weekend""
We all look alike, ain't nobody unique
when every little girl is a prostitute
And every nigga outside police gots to shoot
because here, if a nigga ain't rappin
then he must be affilaited, slangin or kidnappin
But he trapped in a stereotype of bullshit
a four-fifth, couldn't even save him from
And then you gave him a rope to hang with
Divide and conquer him with all this gang shit
So for the streets I'ma close like this:
Fuck y'all, all that can kiss my
skinny starvin po' short low-class
stressed out fraggedy ghetto ass

So I figure I'm due for a yellow tapin
But it ain't today, thank God
So I kiss my mother and count my bank rod
And then it's back to the warzone
In Southern California you gots to get yours on
A real East Side Story
I'm talkin Compton and Watts, for thyne is the glory
A tale of two cities where it's non-stop drama
Not the Apollo joint
But from the hollow-point
-blank, I sleep to the sound of a siren
The shit is so tirin
And other nights I can't even crash
Without the same fuckin mutts turnin over my trash
It's just drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

[ VERSE 2 ]
One-time got my street blocked off
And I wonder what's poppin
But I ain't stoppin
>From what it look like a officer got smoked
And most likely it's from some shit he provoked
But regardless the police is kickin up dust
So now it's like 'in glock we trust'
And everybody in my hood is suspects
But ain't nobody snitchin, so what's next?
They try to break the unity
Make an example of a nigga to frighten the whole community
So put out an all-points bulletin and on Kam
And Watts-Up - goddamn!
Ain't nobody said a word
But now somehow I'm under the ghetto bird
On a high-speed chase
The right time in the wrong place
I caught drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Damn, I just heard about the homie
That's fucked up, give my condolences to the family for me
Cause I know they took it hard
The shit caught us all off guard
That was my dog, he ain't never meant no harm
I went and got his name tatooed on my forearm
Right after the funeral
Goddamn, that's two in a row
Homeboys I done lost to gang violence
And I ain't been able to smile since
I know everything happen for a reason
But now the blood in my veins is freezin
Ain't no more feelings left, I'm cold-hearted
I wasn't dearly, but nearly departed
So I know I got a purpose
But L.A. is like a circus
It's too much drama

(More drama, more drama, more drama)
It's just too much drama
(More drama, more drama, more drama)

[ VERSE 4 ]
So another day, another dirty dollar
Like Marvin Gaye sometimes it make me want to holler
While I try to make a livin, I'm givin
You pee o-n t-h-e U.S.A. - hey
So how much for the ski-mask?
Ain't none of your business what it's for, so don't even ask
Cause America is on the fall
It's every man for himself and God for us all
And action speaks louder than words
>From what I hear the Mexicans got the birds
I seem em puttin up stores
I say it's time I kick in some casa doors
And play Robin Hood, I been good too long
Takin this shit, you can't expect me not to do wrong
So the stage is set for an Academy Award
And oh my Lord

Lift every voice and sing
Yeah, but we gon' lift every fist and swing
So save the negro spiritual
It's 1992 and niggaz need a miracle
And no more song and dance
like we shall overcome, and ain't got a chance
y'all stuck on ""I have a dream""
Need to put the picket sign down and get on the team
Stand up and do somethin
Stop beggin for a meal, cause everything is real
Nigga look at yourself, you in hell
Claimin wel-fare, or should I say fare-well
Mr. Christian, you was too spooky
Now Bush want to slave, and Russia want to nuke me
And the most you can tell me is love thy enemy?
Stay off the Hennesey
Pops I want freedom, so hand me the nine
You can pray for yours, but I'ma go get mine
Now how long has it been?
For a hundred and thirty-seven years, but neva again

[Kam]
God bless America.. but for what?
How bout God damn America, the slut (yeah)
Now I can name that tune
Cause the land of the free is sellin negroes at noon
But how soon we forget
Mention the holocaust, niggaz have a fit
Sorry it's real but I'm fresh out of tears
Cause lynch that nigga's still ringin in my ears
I want freedom, justice, equality, Islam
So it's hard to keep calm
when I'm accused of bein racist for lovin my people first
Now they want to put me in a hearse
but black people never made white slaves
And we was too lovin to put Jews in a oven
But the pilgrims wasn't so friendly then
And by the way, I never ate a Indian
So who's the real savage?
Six feet tall on the average
Mark the number of the God damn beast
To the East my brother to the East say neva again

[Kam]
Oh say can y'all see?
It's the home of the slave, land of the never free
America me, the so called negro
with another verse, so here we go
As long as y'all been givin me hell
No wonder there's a crack in the Liberty Bell
to tell on America the Beautiful
The bitch need a facelift, for this race myth
And now for you to pull a caper, kidnap rape her
The penalty is DEATH
Cause we ain't forgave or forgot
blacks bein murdered, tortured and shot
Six hundred million, one-eighty-sevens
It's bringin wrath down from the heavens
So let my people go Pharoahe, the arrow
is point at your dome, and if we don't make it home
Cancel Christmas
Like EPMD we got some ""Unfinished Business""
From way back, payback for your sin
So paleskin, tell a friend, neva again",Neva Again,1993
Kam,"Don't call me nigga, whitey...

Big fat extra-crispy bucket of chicken
2 liter of pepsi-cola drinkin' ass...

They say a negro ain't good for nothin' but a show
Talkin' slang and walkin' with a radio
Drippin' sweat on basketball courts
Dominatin' but that's at all sports
Or inventin' a new kind of handshake
To get they picture on a box of pancake mix
So I kick some hip hop
And go to church sunday to hit me a flip-flop
But prayin' ain't all we do, see
Next we play bingo and barbecue
Them days I could praise the lord and still gamble 
And eat more dead meet than little black sambo 
But I gotta hear a lot of old ladies
Catchin' the holy ghost most in their 80's
And I don't want to hear no yellin'
Naw, I just kick it and finnish this watermelon
Cause I'm the stereotype...

They think all black folks look alike
We either goin' strike or hut, hut, hike
Or up on the microphone makin' their neighborhood nervous
So I get poor service
Wherever I go they steady tryin' to put jackets on me
Cause I ain't one of they fake-ass homies
Naw, I'm just a negro who knows what's jumpin'
So they be actin' like I'm tryin' to steal somethin' 
When I go to the store or out to eat
Ladies start puttin' purses by they feet
Pullin' a mace out they bras like one-time
Waitin' on some crime
For me to commit so they can unload
That's how tricks get floored
y'all can't let y'all imaginations 
Get the best of y'all
And that goes for the rest of y'all
Cause I'm the stereotype...

So I'm just your typical so-called african-american
Back in your hair again
At your door for more free 
butter and cheese, please
Let me take my cake-cutter 
And tease this buckwheat hairdoo
To fit the stereotype scenario 
That I gave on my application
Unemployment information
Like moms can't find no affordable housin'
How many kids she got? About thousand
And everyone got a different daddy
And I had to quit my job cause of my bad knees
But before my injury I was fine
Did everythin' from a jack to a shoeshine
I was allways down to work then
Until I got stretched out in the pen
Now I'm the stereotype...

So, yeah, i get it all from the big screen
Showin' black girls hoin' at sixteen
On the corner outside in the cold half-naked
Ain't nothin' sacred?
Cause all they know is what they seein' on daytime dramas
So now they like teenage grandmas
Who gotta stop they work and roll
To the nurse for a purse full of birth control
And that ain't so proper cause in my hood 
They need to cancel soap-operas
Cause black females be belivin' all that
That's why they fall flat
So young and innocent
But by the time they reach eighteen 
They been done went crazy, hittin' that P-I-P
Every Gladys Knight with the silent E
So I'm the stereotype...",Stereotype,1993

And in Compton, we got the same shit.

Murderin' blacks and just smirk.
Ain't nothin' but another day at the office.
So now it's damn near illegal to be a negro.
So do I make a run for the border?
Or - fuck Bush, and his ""New World Order?""
The law is the straw that broke the camel's back;
Just one more punk attack
On the black, and now the shit is on.

See, now all hell is finna break loose,
And Uncle Tom ain't got no juice.

But he ain't had a heart, for another Watts riot.

So we done lost all patience.

See, we gon' handle this right, tonight.

Make sure that somethin' is broken,
And then you can smoke him. (C'mon.)
Got a clip on the news of me, with a TV,
And I don't give a fuck, who done seen me.
Fightin' the police with my peers,
With head and shoulders, and no more tears,
And they can't stop me.
'Cause, I'm eatin' more crackers than Polly,
For the Jack that smoked the black.
I gotta do the right thing for you, and Rodney King;
Burn down his market.
But then you claim, Ice Cube had to spark it,
Puttin' Beverly Hills in fear.
'Cause Hollywood burnt down last year.
So if you throw me Ozzie and Harriet,
I fuck around and bury it, huh.
Ain't makin' the hood look shitty.
Watts riot, insert your city, motherfucker!

The whole city is on fire,
And now it's down to the wire.
Time to call for a national emergency,
'Cause white folk goin' up in smoke.
Too fast, they ass is out before they know it.
So when I light this cocktail, Cube throw it,
And make sure that it reach.
Yeah motherfucker, that's for Howard Beach,
And Brother Olivert X, so what's next,
With y'all punk-ass cowards?
Each of us bring fo' devils,
And let's get this over with, yeah, no shit.

Liz Clayborne dresses, diamonds to white pearls 
Wild thing though, do lot of things low 
Make a wise man grow to a live man a show 
Only problem with the trife one is I stay low 
Blowin' lye with guys who got they eyes on my dough 

[Chorus]
We got riches, we got bitches 
You want drama, we got guns 
I'm that kid, from Harlem World 
and you know where I'm from 
Now my team, is out for cream 
and you know exactly what I mean 
So any click tryin to stop us 
is the click that gets seen 

Yo, yo, yo, Ceaser Leo, aiyyo 
Aiyyo wherever I go buy all hydro 
Lie low so I don't get harassed by five-oh 
Used to be in the red star, gettin' my head slobbed 
from the old school hoe that swallowed the egg nog 
I chill of course until I feel I'm the boss 
Until they got Lil' Cease face on the Source 
Got girls that be clever, that's on another level 
Tell me I'm your hero, Cease DeGeanero 
Need a wild thing, so the town can swing 
Pull the hair back and forth, layin' pounds of cream 
Bet Cease break your crutches with a crowded team 
Fulfillin' wishes to they misses with a thousand dreams 
I got, mouth to feed, pretty childs to breed 
If you really drinkin' babies, youse can swallow the seed 
When it come to the sex I like it better on your knees 
Fore I hit the kitty cat, gotta check it for flees 

[Chorus]

Aiyyo nobody used to speak to me 
To launch paper got me Geechie G, now every broad 
keep beepin' me, frequently, know the frequency 
Just to speak to me, yes leave with me, but recently 
Get Proposals, of Indecency, but can't cost a penny 
'Cause now I want Moore than Demi, but I ain't mousy 
Matter fact, we can get rowdy 
But only green papers with the faces arouse me 
Now I know what a woman think, but girl I'm top ten rank 
But I only get hard when I see Ben Frank in the bank 
It don't pay to baby don't show up 
But know what? Better catch me fore my price go up 
I'm a hoe slut for the dough but, I want the paper 
To come, til I throw up, so girl grow up 
You need to slow up the stash, I ain't all about us 
'Cause a nigga like Kam all I need is my cash 
I want my money.

[Chorus: x3]",Young Casanovas,1997
Kam,"Aiyyo wordup Dunn 
Man you know how I feel 
Gotta be more to it than this word up

Nah man it's not it's not yo word up 
I'm tellin you right now 
I know this shit though aiyyo

Absorb my energy, knowin it's the strength of me 
Take a few to give me a edge

On the mission, to pull fire on your opposition

You'll print about Black Mayors, Black Senators 
Why you ain't got no Black Editors? 
Every time I do an interview in Rolling Stone 
They sendin' me a writer that look like he's Home Alone 
Ignorant, to the culture and the microphone 
This has got to stop -- your whole spot 
Is blown sky high, battle why try? 
My view is bird's eye, scopin' with my third eye 
You don't understand, why you're publicly banned 
Until you recognize the writing skills of a black man 
Black Editor, all of us ain't thuggin'

You want to stop and talk to me? 
Bitch ass journalist, is this your fake hip-hop publication? 
Look I'm burnin' this 

How many didn't want to see it happen 
Street moves, live from Staten, if life is a joke, nobody laughin '
Hate to see a brother do good through legal action 
So you sabotage and throw a Def in the Squad 
Fo'-fo's blastin', keep the po-po flashin '
These Dark Soul Assassins, Jake's hate the Gods with a passion 
So I keep it movin in an orderly, fashion 
Pedal to the floor -- peep the Jim Crow law, mind control theory

Droppin' fast who's next, next to get wet 
By the reign of the tech-knowledgy, follow me 
Open up wide now, swallow me, every calorie 
Is reality the truth, the whole truth and 
Nothin but the truth, taste is the proof 
These niggaz want the Juice, and in the crossfire 
Be the youth, who didn't learn to duck when they shoot 

What kind of party is this, it's that political kind 
Where America's best, most hypocritical minds 
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind 
And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime 
Behind suits, and clean shaves 
I confuse em and use em as tools and slaves 
Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations 
I robs the damn nation 
So I can live in luxury, you fucks with me 
You marryin' the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free 
I tell the people what they want to hear 
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year 
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin' 
And start back doin' dope, cussin and fuckin' 
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks 
That's my style, my pol-I-tricks 
Triple-Six convicts, lyin is automatic 
In the government, Republican or Democratic

So yo check this out
This is Ice Cube from the Westside Connection
Callin all the way from Johannesburg, South Africa
The world has never seen a million black men in one place
But on October 16, in Washington, D.C., a million black men will gather

""This is a mission, not a small time thing"" (sample repeats)

Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Windows 95 updated high tech lynchin
Crosses of the colored man who claims he holds the keys to the safe
Secrets of the world, blow him in his face
Who's the master of the universe, galaxy and planets
Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in two thousand)

[Ice-T]
Brothers gonna have to put themself in check
Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck
Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone
You tell me brothers got no options today
You best to listen to the Ice closely fool, crime don't pay
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent

[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene knahmean
But I've been knockin em out the box like ??
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear

In unity there is power, none can devour
Hour after hour, we shower

[RZA & Killah Priest]
Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth
Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

[Chorus]

[DA Smart]
Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause why'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
The homies say that they rollin
Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin

Can I talk to why'all for a minute
See the game has become a lil twisted
See you gotta cat like me imma east coast playa
Str8 from up state
Then you got my man Cam he a west coast playa
Then you got my homey saafir..se he a westsiiiiderrr!!
And we get down like dis

[Cam:]
You See I'm standing strong
But still don't want to break no bread
Now why'all gonna think I'm wrong when I start going up side your head
Str8 left you for dead
And that's the reason why
I still be riding on these Niggaz like giddyup horsey ride
I'm on the wind on my saddle
Bout to herd up some cattle
Cut the head of a snake and save the rattle
You willing to battle
Partna but you fail to see you losing the war
I stand up for what I believe in not leaving enough to score
Bet to show that why'all can't ignore my rep for making people shout
Whether popping they ass on stage..or socking they ass on out
I'm like Luke on this money..Dont stop!
Get it Get it..down south they bout it! bout it!
But out west we Widdit Widdit
If you fools admit it
Maybe you wouldn't be on the ground
And everything would be OK I wouldn't have to lay you you down
why'all haters ain't doing me no harm I'm still rich
Just like Old Macdonald on his farm.bia bia ittch!

But I ain't scared of none of why'all

[Saafir:]
Now watch how daddy ball on all of why'all
While why'all plotting for my downfall
Always gotta watch my back around why'all
When I touch the turf, everybody slow down
Shit is getting worse, 'cause ain't no money in the town
For what its worth, I have to give my hustle a rebirth
Research another circuit, so I can really work it
I'm sick of sending ripples down the stream of ounces
In order to triple my scratch on the scheme of things I'm bouncing'
Outta town to get mined fuck these mousetraps
Niggaz fighting over cheese like rats
My whole family is against me, pullin out gats, what type of shit is that?
You got me strapped with a tight grip, 
when I'm around fools they tight lipped
But want to jaw jack me to death around a tight bitch
I know the script but while you stuck on some town shit
I be ballin nationwide bound bitch!

[Chorus (3X)]
[Saafir:]
One year later with from inflated plan
Just me and my man, touching back down in the town
But in the background, wishing into whispering
He's back! With all the scratch and all the contact
Now what why'all lack contracts mackin the gats (I got that)?
See I'm mobbing with a permanent plan, you say he came up quick (damn)
While you still on the corner standing in quick sand
You think you know what time it is, but your hourglass 
Let the hour pass right by you
Why fool? You should have taken more than an hourglass in high school
Instead of snorting dog coughing wit your tweaking ass
I speak fast, stick a move in and out
Now I'm the man with all the clout
Nothing but big shit, mobbing in big ass whips
Own big ships, floating on big battle ships
Fuck a yacht,I'm trynna own a block like the Jewish
Watch how daddy ball this year Saafir knew it!

Imma tell why'all one more time..listen!

Did it all like a hawk, so I'm totin my stripes
Will I quit it, I'm comitted til the day I drop

I'm bound to have your whole town sewed, 
Niggaz drinkin' and gettin blowed
To the sound layin' tracks down like the underground railroad

Can't no jail hold me, or no crackers control me
I shed tears for dead homies (and what) and fears Allah only
So haters don't want me to hit, tryin' to pitch ball four
Makin' peace with the beast but with me, bitch it's all war

And spit the lead, let's quit this black and brown bloodshed
And get this bread, lay these crackers down in a mudbed

Like Spud Webb I go to war with the giants

You try to shoot game at me but I shot it right back
I wonder why you niggaz figure that you got it like that


[Big Solo]
Cause I'ma hog baby, straight up, you think I'm ugly?
Well I keep it so real girls still want to fuck me
You see what gutter niggaz do to catch a houserat?
Just use peanut butter and a bigger mousetrap

[Ms. Red Bone]
I'm afraid it ain't that easy to please me (oh well)
I got too much class to be f**kin in some cheesy-ass motel

[Big Solo]
Shit, you can go to hell with that, cause if I really want to fuck
I'll have your ass buttnaked in the back of my truck screamin

[Kam]
So many women give that lay back to take a spin
in my wheels, I feels like Pat Sajak {*WOF: puzzle revealed*}
See baby I'm not your average nig' honey {*WOF: wheel spun*}
So when you finally get a turn you be like, 
'c'mon big money! Big money!'

[Ms. Red Bone]
Oh you funny but sonny I ain't just some hoochie you can yank up
By the time you finished with this coochie you be bankrupt {*whistle*}
Drinkin fifths on the corner, shootin dice, countin rips
But don't trip, at least you got some nice partin gifts

[Kam]
Shit, I lifts up skirts and pull panties to the side
F**kin with me, you be swallowin more than your pride
I ride like Bloods and Crips between them hips
until you sayin 'Hold up!' I leave both your lips swoll up

[Ms. Red Bone]
I don't know about all that goin down South biz
But if you want to bet then put some coochie where your mouth is
I'm pussy-whippin niggaz and laughin as I'm walkin out
Just for the thrill leave they ass still talkin bout

'Til my people delevered, Man I don't give a fuck
Stay pushin' the line with mine
Treat peeps I'm with good

Tryin' to get it crackin', Wassup, I'm sayin'
You tryin' to go or what, I mean, You playin'

My daddy told me this industry ain't what you think it is
And everyday you will be gone, you will think of your kids
No matter what they throw at you, get your biscuit and grits
Get your kibbles and bits, ain't no riddles

I spit see the devil is a shady one, he lay up in yo' crib
And just when you find happiness he run away with it
Then you back to the drawing board and don't know what to do
And feeling like you all alone and don't know who is who

But it's just like you, it's just like me, it's simply, it's 1 and 2
It's just like 3, don't try to cuff it, let it flow and let it breathe
And if you love it let it go and let it leave and if it's so
It come back running then you embrace

Don't be like any other woman and turn your face

The rhyme animal, back to play the part again 
Clear the madness, and put the message in 
D, the enemy is back to rip the mic 
We come together, so don't believe the hype 
Check my tone, there's a war here at home 
We united and strong, and never move alone 

We rep justice, equality and freedom now 
Put fam first, man, woman and child 
Never mild, keep it hostile 'til we raise

So right now is the time and you turf the location 
Y'all about to see the rebirth of a nation

Wit a confident swagger, international
Game so tight the girls had to go
And you don't stop!

Sicker than your average
Money too long, can't stash it
In the closet or the mattress
Paper, stretch like elastic
Checks from advances, the bank can't cash it
So the price for that, never ask it
Just sign my name or pop plastic
Hating ass cops want to harass 'em
Searching for a glock in the pocket of his fashion
Bitches wit SP stitches on they asses
And they left breast (Yes!)
Let's get dressed and toast to the occasion
Cops couldn't page 'em, flow so amazing, hot like Cajun
You fucking wit the champ
Pop corks on champ' like I just took the chip

Yeah eat a dick wit AID's on the tip, keep my name off ya lips

Three quarter croc, sharper than a pastor be
Sig bring the light to the masses
Of these rap bastards, who gives street passes
One shooting can lead to three caskets
Jump suits, state boots, at least three stabbings
You softer than a Reebok Classic
Folding under pressure when confronted by them badges
I was taught stay low and keep blasting
Po only know questions that was answered
Keep a number on the high price lawyer
It's five ways now days, everybody saw ya

Once again I'm sicker then 'em all
Niggas see see's, start shitting in they drawers
When I kick in the door, stop the blood clot crying
Wipe the piss off the floor

De repente lloras
Cuando una cancion que antes no entendias
Ahora te emociona

Estas enamorada
Why el pasado ya no importa
Cuando en la humedad que tiene un cristal
Pintes corazones
Cuando al estudiar no puedes pensar
Why tu mente flote
Estas enamorada, estas enamorada, estas
Enamorada
Why tu amor ya tiene nombre
Te siente el centro del mismo universo
Why crees que puedes volar
Enamorada, enamorada, enamorada,

Cuando puedas ver que el amor es algo
Mas que una palabra
Cuando al caminar en la multitud
Creas ver su cara

So many times I've played around

Kamahl,"You fill up my senses like a night in a forest,
Like the mountains in springtime,
Like a walk in the rain, like a storm in the desert,
Like a sleepy blue ocean.
You fill up my senses, come fill me again.

Come let me love you, let me give my life to you,
Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.
Let me lay down beside you, let me al-ways be with you.
Come, let me love you, come love me again. 

You fill up my senses like a night in a forest,

Let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms.

Kamahl,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,1995
Kamahl,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,1998
Kamahl,"Sunset glow fades in the west, 
Night o'er the valley is creeping! 
Birds cuddle down in their nest, 
Soon all the world will be sleeping

And now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea, 
While you're away, o, then remember me, 
When you return, you'll find me waiting here

True lovers often must part, 
Kiss me, then leave me to sorrow! 
Here love, I give you my heart, 
You will return some glad morrow

But now is the hour when we must say goodbye, 
Soon you'll be sailing far across the sea,

That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me

That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1998

Kamahl,"Sometimes in the morning, when shadows are deep, 
I lie here beside you, just watching you sleep, 
And sometimes I whisper, what I`m thinking of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
Sometimes in the evening, when you do not see, 
I study the small things, you do constantly, 
I memorize moments, that I`m fondest of, 
My cup runneth over with love . . . 
 
In only a moment, we both will be old, 
We won`t even notice the world turning cold. 
And so, in this moment, with sunlight above, 
My cup runneth over with love . . .

Kamahl,"I cried a tear, you wiped it dry
I was confused, you cleared my mind
I sold my soul, you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me, you needed me

And I can't believe it's you I can't believe it's true
I needed you and you were there
And I'll never leave, why should I leave, I'd be a fool 
'Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost, you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again

On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
On the real all you crab niggas know the deal 
To my seed May I lead you into no breed of evil 
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel 
You know the money blues blunts broken 22's 
Monkey see Monkey do 
A shorty sipping sunny dew 
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. that's mad smokey 
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me 
Up in the Marriot, Sweet dirty tint, Don't make no noise cause we dirty 
Tell the ho's to hurry in 
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom 
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens 
Rolling on you non descript niggas 
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas 
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough 
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust

On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x 

Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use 
This is your sorry excuse 
Get your neck put in a noose

Over the snare drum 
We reproduce like cum 
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was 
Giving life to idea 
Through the verse is what he does 

See a close call about two clicks from my fortress 
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses 
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us 
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is 
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess 
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch 
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers 
From the ruckus 
Your gone and your crew still love us 
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit 
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent 
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles 
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile 
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound 
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town

(Play some treats on us) 
Drugs in my shirtsleeve 
The side bubble converti 
Eyes low cause the lye blow 
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow 
Write a line sipping a glass of wine 
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind 
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with 
Exhale precise shine like cocian white 
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know 
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinite's and lexus 
So send my enimies a message 
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot 
I'm still protected 
So never ask why I write so violent 
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island 
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and 
When I performed niggas mic's went silent 
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this

Life is a journey, to live is to worry
To love is to lose your damn mind
But living's a blessing so I am not stressing
'Cause some of my friends ain't survived
That's the release, but in much bigger pieces, I'm living on limited time
Like how do you look in the eyes of a friend and not cry when you know that they're dying?
How do you feel 'bout yourself when you know that sometimes you had wished they were gone?
Not because you didn't love 'em but just because you felt too weak to be strong
You couldn't bear to see someone who prided themselves on the strength to feel weak
The cruelty of randomness, hold it for ransom, that life will not fade in your dreams
You see that they're fighting and know that they're losing but still you make jokes and you laugh
'Cause you know despite all the sadness that you better get the good times while they last
Now every new word that they speak you are already feeling like it’s in the past
And when they all gone you just try to move on 'cause the memory's hurting too bad
Grown up so much and I wonder who you'd've become if you stuck for a while
Just know that I love you, good friend, ain't forget you, and when I remember I smile

And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left
'Cause I never let myself forget

An eye for an eye, and a tooth for the tooth
Will leave us all mumbling and blind
So we stumble blind through depths of the dark
Looking for something divine
Life is a journey, to live is to suffer
And I have been suffering through mine
But living's a blessing so I ain't no stressing
'Cause some of my niggas ain't 'round
And he got no drama but his baby mama is still on my line and she cryin'
I searched for the words to give her some comfort for her soul and spirit and mind
I tell her that it'll be fine
But deep down I know that I'm lying
The family came took rings and his chains
The bank took the house and the rights
The only thing left was his child, and she had a smile in his eyes
So much to the soul, when the grandmama kept her, she'd look at her sometime and cry
The very next day she cried
And day after day she cried
Then called baby mama and told her ""I'm sorry, can't keep her no more, I have tried""
No killer was captured, but I know he listening
So I'd like to tell you in song
The streets was a jungle, I pray that you made it, I hope that you righted your wrongs
I hope that you learn, I hope that you changed so your mama won't know this pain
So my homie's name will mean something more than a nigga got killed for a chain

And I guess I'd say I'll see you soon
But the truth is that I see you now
Still talk to you like you're around
And I guess I say you left too soon
But the truth is that you never left

Kamasi Washington,"It's much louder than before
Can you hear me?
Who were we before?
It's much louder than before
When we lived 10 thousand lives?
Can you hear me?
I would like to know
It's much louder than before
All the secrets of our tribes
Can you hear me?

Mountains of gold (It's much louder than before)
Diamonds and pearls
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know (Can you hear me?)
Arrows and bows (It's much louder than before)
Gunshots in the snow
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know (Can you hear me?)

Only thing we learned from history class
Nah, we ain't learned from the past
Build it up, burn it down, leave it as ash
Build it up, burn it down, build it up, burn it down
Damn, man, it turns into a reason to laugh
Think about the cats leading the pack
At least half got
Clapped, scrapped, meeting they match
Slow down, no numbers, don't believe in the facts
That I spew when I'm reading these raps
All I know is what I see, I'm seeing bridges get burned
And then I see lessons get learned after that
On a smaller level out in Parkchester in the six just skipped
Thinking last time I ditched my chick
Man, it really ain't shit as big as the bridge
But goddamn, man, this cycle is sick
Goddamn, man, this cycle is sick
Goddamn, man, this cycle is sick, ya heard?

We'll spread the love that we all deserve
Chasing this global pain undisturbed
We'll have faith
It's much louder than before
What comes around, goes around someday

Mountains of gold (It's much louder than before)
Diamonds and pearls
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know (Can you hear me?)
Arrows and bows (It's much louder than before)
Gunshots in the snow
Where will we go?
I guess it's all that we know

Kamau,"[Chorus:Repeat x2]
Hey, it's the same once again
Microphones fully loaded and friends
Funny I try to make this end
But it seems I'm returnin' the name

Yeah, papercutz
Papercutz, Paper
Here we go, papercutz
Papercutz, paper
Paper, cutz, papercutz, paper, paper
Are you gonna do another album man?

Yo, I know I said I'd exit
But I couldn't do it the minute
It flowed from my lips
Futures can't exist
In a past time paradise
Rollin' dice, holdin' Christ
On a platinum chain, surrounded by ice
Sinister Cyrus, you can't deny this
Because the lightheads
Brokin' and tokin's been replaced by legal tender
Great pretenda, tried to upset my agenda
I dismembered, they fought patterns
And Now they move in circles like Saturn
Spinning out of orbital formation
The radio station is my motivation
Cuz the pen and the pad are the only friends that I had
When the light can not be seen
I'm a feel for the rap game and skatin' like I'm a figurine
That move in articulate shadow boxin' the peel
What is real is irrelative, it is relatively revealed
That's why I sharpen these words
To you like papercutz
And I wreck visual images like I'm Julian Lutz
What's the name of this runaway train?
We call it thought, harassin' the brain
Droppin' you bitches sane
This thing called the rap game, I'm claimin' insane
Lyrically all arcane, and such as papercutz

[Chorus]

Catacalysmic, mystic, with a bic
Only to think on a diamond mine
Gotta take it back, from the heart attack
That I felt when I saw the sign
Comin' down from the sky
Like a supernova, Jehovah
Got a grip on the land rover
But so what, I'm not sober
Just takin' sips but I don't skip
Just makin' trips so I don't tip
These papercutz just ain't enough
They makin' hits, and I can't touch
Just look at Hammer now
My grammar is tighter, provider
In light of freedom fighter, rhythm writer and rappin'
And yet you don't try it
Because you can't buy it
I saw you grippin' and slippin'
And fool, I'm so tired
Of fake emcees and you best believe
Got tricks than trade up my sleeve
And I pray to God when I'm on my knees
That I can break it, cut this paper, paper

[Chorus]",Papercutz/The Mirror,2004
Kamau,"[Chorus]
When it bends you try to walk a straight line
Something more for less and in the meantime
It changes shape and shifts it takes you over
Its just a warning sign

Because the writing's on the wall
The writing's on the wall

You make a deal you swear that its the last time
No sudden moves or else your soul will be mine
And when you dance you're dancing with the devil
Its just a warning sign,
You're running out of time

You can't relate, you still escape
Because you think you've seen it all
You're right on time until you find
They've just been waiting for the fall

Because the writing's on the wall
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]

You can't relate, you still escape
Because you think you've seen it all
You're right on time until you find
They've just been waiting for the fall

The Writing's on the wall
The Writing's on the wall
It's seven-hundred stories tall
The Writing's on the wall

Take your time it's a state of mind
Take your time just until you find
Take your time it's a state of mind

J'viens tout niquer comme les Généraux en Algérie
Ouais la rue me kiffe, elle m'appelle ""mon chéri""
J'ai toujours pas d'femme j'fais l'amour à ma feuille
J'aime la misère, tous les jours elle m'accueille
Traîne à Kremlin, traîne a Krinihoud
J'fais toujours l'même chemin j'suis pas radin j'suis pas un lihoud moi
J'aime mes frangins, toujours à jeun, on rêve de compèt' on rêve de cage hein !
Les MC s'la pètent, mais qu'est-ce que tu veux frère,
mais qu'est-ce tu veux faire, ils ont rien dans la tête
À part des rimes, moi le rap c'est secondaire, la tête sur les épaules et les pieds sur le tèr-tèr
1, Jean 501, une paire de TN, un banlieusard, Kamelancien
J'suis simple comme mon hall, comme mon ghetto
Jamais d'anniversaire, jamais d'gateau
Et l'vieux 'adess dur comme la pierre
Et vive moi l'hass, moi j'kiff la hass
Tu réussis bsahtèk, moi je m'en fous
Bientôt l'rap c'est fini, bientôt je m'enfuis

ouf, l'argent qui rend ouf
On est pas reconnaissant, vive le Tout-Puissant
J'rappe en même temps j'pense à c'qui nous attend
Tu l'a bien deviné, j'suis un taré
Terré dans mon quartier, j'suis toujours paré
T'as la rage cousine, j'te calcule pas
Ne lui en veut pas, Kamel il est comme ça
J'répond jamais, avant personne me sonnait,
Maintenant un par un, tout l'monde me connaît
Les p'tits jeunes me tchèkent, prennent la confiance, j'résiste, à l'époque c'était direct violence
Lance, Bimbadaboum, toujours timide comme à l'époque des boums
Des fois j'reste chez moi, dehors y a rien a faire, y a rien a voir c'est toujours la même mon frère
On s'regarde vieillir, y a pas plus tard qu'hier, on était une bande de gamins qui attendait l'hiver
Le quartier nous a marqué, rien qu'on s'fait remarquer, si tu tombes j'suis là pour t'remorquer
On s'entraîne, à bas les traîtres! Des baffes dans leurs gueules, c'est comme ça qu'on les traite
J'suis fils aîné de la tristesse, elle m'a élevé, je l'aime, devant le monde entier je l'atteste

Elle a fait d'moi Kamelancien, un chien d'la rue
Hein rue ! L'égalité, moi j'viens d'la rue
Là ou, les darons galèrent à mort, la où la jalousie passe par les rats morts
Là ou l'Aïyn met fin à des carrières
3, 4 frères pas plus, surveille tes arrières

Kamelancien,"V'là le shlass la voix qui part à la chasse
Le guerrier Ka-Ka-Kamelancien, le premier rebeu renoi confondu,
L'autre jour j'ai rassemblé des mc dans mon hall j'les ai défendus
V'là le grand méchant loup, le méchant banlieusard je rode tard le soir
dans tous les tier-quar j'suis venu j'ai fait peur au rap, quand mc m'invite en featuring
dans la cabine, il met d'la mort aux rats, ils veulent me dead pour eux c'est dead
Les mc déçèdent et moi jamais je cède, J'suis de l'acide dans une soirée coca-cola
Oh la, même les ennemis font la olla, J'suis là les autres font pas long feu comme Fofana
Ils sont trop chim, ils devraient tous rapper en Chine
Kamelancien dogue argentin eux des chiwawas, tout l'monde fait wa-wa j'éclate les watts moi.
Refrain :
V'là le grand méchant loup, ils s'demande il sort d'où
surdoué d'la rime tout l'monde fait wa-wa
J'ai fait trop de oui, eux ils poussent trop d'cris
C'est du travail de pro tout l'monde fait wa-wa
Ils vous arrive quoi les mc, vous faites pas l'poids
Ça tout l'monde le sait tout l'monde fait wa-wa
J'kiff trop la viande crue normal j'suis un loup d'la rue
Tout l'monde fait wa-wa
Ils s'prennent pour les plus fort, c'est les plus faibles
Dis-leur de ma part que leur flow n'est pas en règle
Revenons à nos moutons, il en reste quelques-uns en vie
De eux j'ai envie, le grand méchant loup vie la nuit,
Loupe jamais sa cible est décidément trop précis
Danse avec les loups danse la danse de guerriers
la danse des banlieusard, c'est la fête c'est toujours férié
Le rap m'a confié un secret en gros, il m'a dit de tout niquer en restant discret,
sacré, sacré mc c'est Kamelancien il n'est pas comme les autres
c'est ça qui est bien il en fallait au moins un parce que les autres se héchém
flow zéro et leur physique trop chim, j'suis déter
Ils méritent que des tartes, de jour en jour mon rap à moi se démarque.

Kamelancien,"Quand tu vas partir, Papa, j’aurai mal
Mal au cœur j’aurai le mal de vivre
Mal de ne plus te revoir
J’espère que j’aurai le temps de te dire au revoir
De t’embrasser le front, de te prendre dans mes bras
De te prendre par la main et de te dire je t’aime papa
Quand tu vas partir y’aura plus personne pour me dire ci ou ça
Quand tu vas mal je multiplie les dou3as
Sans toi je suis perdu, je vais me renfermer sur moi même
On va peut être m’enfermer, m’interner
Quand tu vas partir la maison sera vide
Rien que d’y penser mes yeux deviennent humides
Alors je te regarde pour me blinder en souvenirs
Pour pas oublier ton visage et surtout ton sourire
J’appréhende ce jour, je le redoute
Le temps court et la mort continue son parcours et c’est comme ça

Quand l’ange de la mort viendra t’emmener loin de moi Papa, Papa
Jusqu'au dernier souffle je t’aimerai

Quand tu vas partir Mama, j’aurai mal, mal au cœur j’aurai le mal de vivre
J’ai mal quand je te vois prendre des médicaments
J’espère que la mort viendra te prendre tendrement
Tu me manques déjà horriblement
Je veux partir avant toi pour pas connaître ca mais c’est pas moi qui décide
T’es la seule qui se fout de l’oseille
Quand tu me cries dessus jamais tu me chauffes les oreilles
Parce que le paradis se trouve sous tes pieds
Toutes ces souffrances endurées je me dois de te respecter
Je me dois d’être là à tes cotés, à ton service
à te chérir comme tu l’as fait pour ta fille et tes fils
Me parle pas de maison de retraite, chez nous on connaît pas ça

Est-ce que mes oreilles ont été sourdes toutes ces années là
Je déteste de toute mon âme le jour où tu ne seras plus là
Tu déclenches une avalanche d’amour en ouvrant tes bras
J’ai tout pris,et rien donné en retour, j'n’ai pensé qu’à moi
J’ai puisé dans tes yeux l'avenir le plus précieux
Et aujourd’hui je te donnerai ma vie, prendrai ta place aux cieux
Essaierai de faire mieux pour toutes les fois où je t’ai déçu

Maman un jour tout ira mieux pour le moment ici on trime grave
L'argent est sur messagerie notre espoir est en gardav'
On priait le seigneur, on sera pas ingénieur
La misère emportait la promesse de nos jours meilleurs
Frérot famille nombreuse
La vaisselle, les poussières
Rajoutez des couverts ma mère est à découvert
On rêvait de se barrer partir chercher la vie belle
La chance n'est pas consentante comme dans les suites du Sofitel
Je connais pas le futur, je me rappelle du passé
J'apprenais la zik' avant d'apprendre à faire mes lacets
Ici on cherche les sous, on tend pas l'autre joue
Sur la route on fait du mal on perd des frères comme Bandigou
Je rappe pour les Blancs, les Africains, les Créoles
Le rap est mort c'est pour ça que sur mes chèques y a autant d'auréoles
C'est perdu d'avance, marlich je retente ma chance
Concert guichet fermé moi qui blindait les salles d'audience
Des fois je suis le Sheitan, des fois je suis la Sunna
Les absents ont toujours tort à part Zyed et Bouna
Un jour on t'oubliera frère un peu comme Larusso
Laisse-les foncedés les portes du succès frérot j'ai le trousseau
Je me rappelle des hivers, l'eau froide dans la baignoire
Quand maman pleurait les huissiers lui tendaient des mouchoirs
Dédicace à Ben et Haroune
Je vais percer sans baisser mon Ice moon
Trop de bâtards parlent sur moi je les connais à peine
Depuis j'écris des textes sur ma motherfuckin pain
Je passe mes nuits en studio, la routine comme d'hab
Je sors des doubles albums car mes fans veulent du rap
Baisser les bras c'est pas pour moi, première classe à bord du Airbus
J'en ai fait du chemin depuis mes textes à l'arrêt de bus
Un jour je rapperais torse nu pour pas retourner ma veste
Rapper avec le cœur sœur c'est tout ce qu'il me reste
Un jour je finirais comme 2pac, Big L ou Biggie
Inchallah je serai dans le din quand je rejoindrais le père à Ziggy
Lundi on se fera la guerre, Mardi on sera des frères
Peu importe la semaine ,dimanche on dîne au cimetière

Grosse pensée pour Jonathan Camara
Et tous mes frères au card-pla enfermés comme Samara
Viens, je vais te raconter mon histoire
Je reviens de loin moi je reviens du Sahara
Tout commence en primaire
On m’annonce le décès de mon grand frère
Je vois les larmes de ma mère
La mère elle s’est jamais remise de ta mort Mohammed
Allah Yrahmek grand frère
Choc familial ,choc émotionnel
Depuis ce jour là je ne suis plus le même
Bref, j’arrive au collège
Avec les mecs de mon quartier on déboule comme un cortège
6eme B, qu’est ce qu’on n’a pas fait?
Avec Choupap Zbike on a tout redonné
On a grave gol-ri
Je donnerai tout ce que j’ai pour revivre ces moments, ces conneries
Au quartier y a encore le respect
On se mélange pas avec les grands non tout ce qu’on fait c’est secret
On se contente de peu, juste une bécane
Et tu pouvais voir des gosses super ferhan
J’arrive au lycée, en BEP
Le premier jour de cours je sais que je vais pas bosser
Que des Noirs et des Arabes (oh!), la prof est traumatisée
Apeurée, elle s’est barrée
Premier tatou, premier tam-tam
Premier regard avec les femmes-femmes
A ce niveau là, je suis timide, discret, réservé
Toutes les femmes je les ignorais
C’est le bordel au quartier, ça devient insupportable
La cause de cette guerre, un portable
Je comprends rien, le quartier se divise
Des clans se forment, et certains se déguisent
Bref, il faut que je taffe, le lycée m’a té-je
Et si je continue à rien faire mon père va me té-je
Alors j’ai commencé à chercher
Je me suis fait pistonner
Tu connais des boulots où t’es bon qu’à porter
A Rungis à moins 17 degrés
Je puait le poisson même après m’être lavé
Après tout ça, y a eu le pe-ra
Tu m’as entendu tout niquer sur ‘Ça sert à quoi’
Ensuite je rencontre une femme
Six ans de calvaire, son amour n’était pas sincère
Lundi on se fera la guerre, mardi on sera des frères
Peu importe la semaine, dimanche on dîne au cimetière

What makes men run and hide

Dead of the night

And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide

O Black Tower

O Black Tower
Why do you devour?
The souls they sleep in the night
Casting evil shadows signs of no tomorrows
Why must I fear for my life?

And the splendor of their torture
Burning flames reach for the sky
The gates of Hell are open wide

I feel the waves crash upon the shore
As the sea sprays on my glowing face
I wish I could embrace the sea
for evermore
As I lay my head to sleep at night
I dream the sea and me we flow as one
But I'm a prisoner of the sands and
no one understands these childish dreams

An old man approaches me
His feeble mind confusing to thee
He speaks in riddles and rhymes
Tales of an old witch that cast him
from the sea
But wait my eyes full of splendor
or could this be some crazy old tale
I look to his eyes for the answer

I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity
I will my soul to the sea
for Eternity

And so the journey begins
The pain and suffering
Are your dreams worth this torment?
You can deal Another hand
But the light in the distance
promises this the journeys end

Great god Poseidon
Accept this mortal never let
Him return, For He's willed

Eyes tell me what do you see?

Is there no gold at the end
Of this rainbow?
Is there no hope at the end
Of the road?
Will there be strength for
The dreams that I've lived for
Or will I just let go?

Many trials of life i've survived

Their fingers

This loss of life
It reminds me of myself not long ago
And the cries for life that
I'd seem to ignore
The cries for life are now

Lost behind or lost along
A victim of the pulse of our society

Of a lucid moon
I'm a creature of the night

The souls of dusk rising from the ashes
So the book of shadows tell 
The weak will always obey the master

Heading for the dragons lair 
Another time and a different sphere
I leave the nothingness behind
And when the sense of logic yields
I'll escape the outer shields
Into the universal mind

That they were life itself
The days passing by
We both had our share in the sacrifice

Once upon a time 
We had something beautiful
Once upon a time 
I thought ""you and I?

Take me wherever 
The answer lingers in the sand
Show me the way as the story unfolds
Love is remote 
In this wailing winter wonderland
Show me the way to the temples of gold

Bless me with a kiss

Are distant and vague
Down at the base
Of the mountain

Bound to this body
A world full of hate

Guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth
In the cross that you bear
Die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair

The call of the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black
A new day is dawning
Remember
No one can save you today

The questions are more
Than the answers I know
That doesn't mean you are lonely
Searching for more
Consecutive goal's
Making it worth to go on

No one can see it
But you know that it's there
Guiding the steps of your soul
Holding the truth
In the cross that you bear
Die with a heart that is bold

Fly on the wings of despair
No one is holding you back
The call of the wild is internal
Conquer the silence you fear
Tomorrow will not fade to black

No one can save you today

You, and you alone
Is forging the path
Leave your sorrows with the past

Within the month of June
Flowers in mahogany hair
And smell of earth in bloom
Only such a melody
Comes without a sound
More than faintly heard by those
Who know what they have found
Now it's just a memory

Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light

Silently we wander
In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here
Along the way
From morning to night

Meet me by the wishing well
In cover of the moon
Whisper to me tenderly
That I will see you soon
Sing that song from long ago
So I remember you
Flowers in mahogany hair
And mellow days in June
Only for the memory

Silently we wander
Into this void of consequence
My shade will always haunt her
But she will be my guiding light

In search of truth and confidence
So many hopes were lost here

These are the nights of Arabia
Sheherazade will never die

The sultan relents his feeble heart
His love for his queen is greater than he'll ever know
""it's easy to let you feed my nights
Someone to touch, someone to hold,
Someone to feel, someone to love""

""here I am to die alone
Voices from heaven above
Hear my call awaken my soul
Forgive me for what I have done""

Challenged to survival
A legacy of fear
Eternal mystic legends
One for every tear",Nights of Arabia [DVD],2006
Kamelot,"When they met she was fifteen
Like a black rose blooming wild
And she already knew she was gonna die

""What's tomorrow without you?
This is our last goodbye""

She got weaker every day
As the autumn leaves flew by
Until one day, she told him, ""This is when I die""

""What was summer like for you?""
She asked him with a smile
""What's tomorrow without you?""
He silently replied

She said,

""I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
Cause I love you, I love you to death""

But the sorrow went too deep
The mountain fell too steep
And the wounds would never heal
Cause the pain of the loss was more than he could feel

He said,

""I will always be with you
By the anchor of my sorrow
All I know, or ever knew,
Is I love you, I love you to death""

""What's tomorrow without you?
Is this our last goodbye?""


""I will always be with you
I'm the anchor of your sorrow
There's no end to what I'll do
Cause I love you""",Love You to Death,2007
Kamelot,"On a dank December morning
A glass of I forgot the name
I can't unwind to water
I won't come back again

And the minutes turn to hours
Keep spinning cards that look the same
And the slow way the moment
Talk to you

It's time again all light is spent
My soul is free
And blessed to see

Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

All the prison light is blinding
It's here to claim my sanity
I just can't stand the waiting
To revive ecstasy

It's time again
All light is spent
My soul is free
And blessed to see

Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

I won't sustain another day
My love, my darkness
Daylight reflects my starving soul
And open wounds for everyone to see

Sometimes when I'm out of reach
And sometimes when I'm there
That is when our souls agree and join in solitaire
Sometimes when my will to love has gone away
That is when I hear your name

Kamelot,"Once my life was plain and clear
I recall
Once my ignorance was bliss
Nightfall came
Like a serpent's kiss
To my troubled mind

Why oh why my God
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide

Binding promises were made
On my soul
Grand delusions lead astray
Ice cold wings swept my heart away
Bring me back to you

Why oh why my god
Have you abandoned me
In my sobriety
Behind the old facade
I'm your bewildered child
So take me cross the river wide

I remember a song
Like in a dream
Where September was long
And winter unreal

So take me cross the river wide",Abandoned [Live],2007
Kamelot,"I am scorned in this heavenly scheme
With the stench of destruction
I'm a reaver of beautiful dreams
And she knows I'm on the edge, sacrilege

Tell me once upon a time
I close my eyes and see myself reborn
Righting the wrong
I won't stay to stand in line
And wait for God to shine all over me
I wait for the storm

I am you and I know that you heard
You and I are the last at the end of the world
Then we talk, we run, and we hide
Then so what, the human race suffocates?

My entire world is crumbling

I watch the shadows growing tall

We are all born to leave a
Scar deep in the hearts of many

Kami Kaze Inc,"[ Intro ]
Sometimes I write about something, that like something I went through
Or something my people went through
And I felt like they needed some motivational shit
And it usually ends up going something like this...

( Chorus )
My first day, without you in my life
Things felt strange, a bit deranged
Even so, I hope you're doin okay
Take it slow, you just never know... ( just never know, oh!)
Yo, you just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)
You just never know... nooo (just never know, oh!)

( Verse 1 )
My systems caught in conniption, stomach in knots
Feedin for my medicine, overcoming addiction
The first step is quittin, nah the first steps admittin
I got a problem, I need help, this is something I can't beat myself
I almost felt like I can't be cured
Rehab won't take me 'cause I ain't insured
Layin in the bath tub, shakin like a new born
Searchin for the courage it'll take for me to move on
I've been livin life like this way too long
Beggin God please, bring me home
I stopped before, three or four days
Always end up back in the same place
People call me a junkie, dope fiend
How they gonna judge me, they don't even know me
Lights off, want to be left alone, I'm tryin to enjoy the methodone
Put a Jimi Hendrix record on, and excuse me while I kiss the sky
Dosed off, woke up, sick to my stomach, ran to the bathroom
Started to vomit, the methodone wore off and the withdrawal started
That first day was the hardest...

( Chorus )

( Verse 2 )
Stayed strong, endured the rough weather
I ain't fully recovered but I'm doin much better
I can keep my food down to shakes and calms
They lowerin the doses of methodone
I eat V's and blow lots of dro
It's like chewin gum when you're tryin not to smoke
Keep my mind occupied, calm my nerves
It's not the same high, deep inside I...
Just want one more but I can't turn back this week for it
But I done made it, almost a month
With just a couple of V's and I blew some blunts
But that weed and gonna make me OD
That other shit was gonna kill me
Six weeks, and everything seem so clear
Before I knew it, time flew and I was clean for a year
Can't believe something started off socially
Something I almost allowed to take over me
Days went by and it was sixteen months
And I swear to God I didn't fall off once
I, feel like a brand new guy and I'm definitely livin a brand new life
Some days I still resist the thirst but none's worst than the first (believe
that)

( Chorus )

( Verse 3 )
Two years and I ain't touched it
Got a lot done, I been so productive
Rebuilt, I was so constructive
Can't believe I was so self destructive
Got a good job and I make big bucks
Went to the lot and got a new pick up
Got a brand new crib and a brand new kid
I think anybody can quit if I did
If you want to quit, get up and go get the shit
Walk straight to the toilet, drop it, flush it, fuck it, fight it
Just resist it and if this helps then just keep listenin
When you start slippin I'll send you another one
Sonny, wasup?, we just saved another one
I know it's so hard like there's no God
But through him you're able to go so far
Hey, I don't want to sound corny
I'm just like you either hungry or horny
Seems as though we get hooked so easily
Quitting becomes an impossibility
I ain't sayin treat your body like a church
Just don't let dope put your body in a hearse
The streets inside you, you just gotta search
And know that no day be harder than the first

( Chorus )

[ Outro ]
Yo, all my people, goin through they thing
Whatever they thing may be
Just know, God got his hands on you
And he'll grant you the serenity
To change the things you can't
And you can change that, aight
Hold me down and I'ma hold you down... one",Sprang on 'Em,2005
Kami Lyle,"I know how the ocean feels 
When her moon is away, and why won't he call?
And there isn't a star that cares what time she rolls in 
If she comes home rolling at all

Blue Cinderella, let's go to the ball 
Blue Cinderella, I'm ready to fall 

And nobody cares if she pounds on the sand 
If she throws up or grows up or digs up a man 
But the one that she wants is the 
One that won't call and say 

Blue Cinderella, let's go to the ball 
Blue Cinderella, I'm ready to fall 

And she cries 
Moon, why you gotta have so many oceans
And isn't my blue water ocean enough?
But the stars fell down laughing 
When they heard her hoping 
That she would be the only ocean 
He'd shine above 

I know how the ocean feels 
When her moon is away, and why won't he call?
And there isn't a star that cares what time she rolls in

Kami Lyle,"Boys in this town got the same disguise 
They got soda shop smiles and rocking horse eyes 
They'd paint their mother as the Devil
Eat a sugared bowl of flies 
Just to sign their name on another set of thighs 
Just to sign their name on another set of thighs 
I put your picture in my pocket, and I put on some perfume 
Saw you smiling in my wallet as I walked the empty room 
Now gone is my jewelry 
My leather jacket, too 
I pawned them all for freedom and one slow dance with you 

[Chorus:]
Grab a piece of autumn 
Rub it in my hair 
Put some winter in my pocket 
Keep me safe till I get there 
Spring is just a jukebox 
I don't have time to play 
Got a lover made of summer 
And this dog needs one more day 

Moss covers the moon like an old headstone 
Got an arm out the window, singing to the radio 
Pull that night air in and let it guide me home 
'Cause it's hard to stay awake when you're driving all alone 
So hard to stay awake when you're driving all alone 

[Chorus]

Now I see the flames churning and my suitcase down below 
I'm rising up to Heaven, and I don't want to go 
I'm shouting out words to a song I don't know 
And shooting at the stars with somebody else's bow 
Shooting at the stars with somebody else's bow 

Grab a piece of autumn 
Rub it in my hair 
Put some winter in my pocket 
Keep me safe till I get there 
Spring is just a jukebox 
I don't have time to play 
Got a lover made of summer",Boys,1997
Kami Lyle,"My paper cuts have turned maroon 
The color of my bow 
I tied it like a noose today 
And I almost got sent home

'Cause I just sack the groceries here 
And I watch your world go by 
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And that southern sun is in my eyes 

And chickens keep on drifting down 
In plastic bags of red 
With turkey necks and smoked hog jowl 
And none of it looks very dead 

And I'm a vegetarian 
And I'm not from the South 
But if I were you, I'd bury them 
Not put them in my mouth 

But I just sack the groceries here 
And I watch your world go by 
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And there's something 
Something in my eye 

And Mister is a blind man 
With a smile pure as the Pope 
And as I help him find his way 
He whispers me all his dirty jokes 

He offered me a ruby locket 
One day behind the store 
But he couldn't make me want it 
'Cause I've heard that one before 

And did I come here to chase the truth 
Or to run away from lies?
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And I'm so tired I want to cry 

But I met Harlan Howard here 
And I smiled at Lee Sklar 
And now I'll sit and sneak a beer 
While I sing my songs for these dusty cars 

'Cause I just sack the groceries here 
And I watch your world go by 
The big black belt keeps turning 'round 
And maybe so should I",The Grocery Song,1997
Kami Lyle,"As a family of lawn chairs gathered 
Underneath a clean suburban sun 
There were seven pink flamingos 
Standing pigeon-toed, not hurting anyone 
Her mama called her ""Precious"" 
And her daddy called her once or twice a year 
When she was five, she practiced magic tricks 
In hopes that she could make him reappear

And she'd say, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And pray a little prayer 
Then she'd wave her hands 
Like butterflies 
And make a big red heart 
In the air 

Her best friend was Angie 
They played Barbies after school for three whole years 
And on weekends they'd have cider 
On the railroad tracks, pretending it was beer 
Just like family till Angie's front yard 
Grew a sign that said ""Just Sold"" 
And the tears that came on moving day 
Were more than hearts that small could ever hold 

So they said, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And prayed a little prayer 
Then they waved their hands 
Like butterflies 
And made a big red heart 
In the air 

And daddy never showed 
And Angie never wrote 
But there's always hope 

In a pile of broken daisies fell decisions 
At the turning of her life 
There was a boy she was in love with 
And he'd asked her if she'd want to be his wife 
But they were both from broken families 
And quaking at the thought of taking vows 
So they shared a secret wedding, just the two of them 
And they're still together now 

They said, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And prayed a little prayer 
Then they waved their hands 
Like butterflies 
And made a big red heart 
They said, ""Hocus Pocus"" 
And prayed a little prayer 
Then they waved their hands 
Like butterflies 
And made a big red heart

Kami Lyle,"Love me like I am a movie star 
Love me like I am a fool 
Tragic and hopeless 
Softly out of focus 
And you be a movie star, too 
Love me like I am a Saturday 
Lazy and warm by the old wishing pool 
Dusty old sunbeams 
And a handful of pennies 
You whisper your wishes all to 

Love me like I am a spirit 
Here in the dark I appear in your room 
You'll say you love me 
But I'll never hear it 
That ain't what they wrote on my tomb 

So, love me like I am the circus 
When all of the lights have gone down 
Spooky and faded 
With clowns drunk and jaded 
Who cuss when there's no one around 

You'll love me like I am a Christmas tree 
Sparkling and pretty, a real fantasy 
Then you'll see through me 
Won't know what to do with me 
Then you'll be glad when I
Won't be too sad when I
So glad the day I leave",Love Me,1997
Kami Lyle,"There's an empty nail on a plaster wall 
Somewhere inside my mind 
Neon blue sign used to hang out here 
Blinking cool under a July sky 
We used to dance to the faded blues 
Of the hand-me-down grooves 
Wearing nothing but the beat 
The summer was all that we had to lose 
In a room full of two fools 
Love came easy 
Love came sweet 
Hey baby I want to meet you down 
At the Midnight Club again 

There's a trumpet wailing the night away

Sometimes a song can change the way you live 
Give you strength to die alive

Of the hand-me-down grooves 
Wearing nothing but the beat

On the fake I.D. that you got 
Your flashlight on

In that little square 
So I talk about this weather 
While my sister smiles

""You don't have brown hair"" 
Well I was leaving anyway

Says he'd like to fly 
And could I help him toward that sign that says 
I am not allowed inside 

And it's one for Saturday

Hay días de suerte
Hay días que no terminan
En plaza Castilla
Hay días que se complican
Y se repiten

Y son dos días, que caigan en finde
El domingo en el Caribe
Quiero delicias mañaneras
Playas y palmeras
No es por lo que mueras
Es por lo que vives

Hermanos también acaban a tortazos
Y ni las montañas ni el sol se caen a pedazos
Si te vas no des portazo
Y paga, paga a plazos
Vigila quien te agarra del brazo
Una linea no es un trazo
Separar a dos borrachos es llevarse el botellazo
No hay mas nudos que hacer si ya hay lazo
Solo queda cumplir o liarse a puñetazos

Solo hay cabrones y cobardes

Piensa a lo grande
Yo estoy conmigo
Aquí con mi sangre
Cabinas se rompen
Cadenas se parten
Dame
¿quieres?
Toma
Dame
Tanto compartir
Y pa ti no queda parte
Cambian las tornas
Yo sigo delante
Ella ya no suelta el volante
Si yo no falto
A mi no me falten

Solo hay cabrones y cobardes

Hay que ponerse en lo peor

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Words: Gyle Waddy			Music: Kana Bukuru Lesouple

Don?t worry about the things you've been through
what ever happened was meant for you.
Sometimes it's hard to understand,
but if you only try you, you can.
Yes, one day you're up and wearing no frowns.
You think you know the plan. You're on sure grounds.
Then suddenly your days turn gray,
don't worry 'cause life's that way.
You've had your love. You thought it was true
the joy that it gave, now it's the blues.
Money you've made hundreds by the day.
Oh you played now it's gone away.
Now it's gone away. Now it's gone away.

Everything must change.
Nothing remains the same.
No one is to blame it's just that way
life is one big game.

Sometimes you find your energy is high
you run around you have stars in your eyes.
Without a warning all is through,
you think that you've been voodooed.
And even though rainy days do come,
and you find you have no song to hum
just look into yourself and say
that tomorrow's another day.
Now don't you worry. Don't pay it a mind
just keep your thoughts on the brighter side.
Don't worry about tomorrow
even though there'll be some sorrows. 
Some sorrows. Some sorrows.

Everything must change.
Nothing remains the same.
No one is to blame it's just that way
life is one big game.

No, don't you worry believe me it's true
there's no difference from me or from you.
So don't let life get to you.
No, don't let life out-do-you.
Don't let life out-do-you.

I've brought my dreams to reality;
made people recognize me.
Now after all that I've been through,
finally all that I want to do
is to let the sunshine in all its glory
and let the moon tell me her untold stories.
Let the mist come in from the sea
to wash me and cleanse me sweetly.

Lands of the East
where the sunsets? glow
color Bordeaux
shows on the plateau.
Male:
Where peace is bestowed on those
who seek the Cosmic Light.
Back to the beginning.
Female:
Lands of the East
where the waters flow
and the faithful go
to wash their sorrows.
Male:
The serene contemplation of the
White Lotus.
Light of the Lotus.
Back to the beginning.
Female:
Lands of the East
Male:
where the temples grow
Female:
where the conscious go
Male:

Female & Male:
there we find abode and drift into a dream.
Supreme State of Mind is what we seek
Infinite wisdom that radiant Light.
That passage to life.
Back to the beginning.

The lotus is said to be a mythological plant. It is said the lotus has magic proprieties and when the grains are eaten it is said that one becomes languid and then one is carried towards the Light. The Lotus is a sacred symbol in Hinduism.

Kana Bukuru Lesouple,"PEACE TO ALL MANKIND

Words: Gyle Waddy				Music: Kana Bukuru Lesouple

Everyone, everywhere
I've been thinkin' a lot about
mankind and I have doubts.
I'm afraid things aren't going that good.
Seems to me 
that this world is turning wrongly.
Thanks to man for his modern technology, 
to science advancements for everything 
that help us live easily;
help us live very com'tably,
but there's a question that that I ask myself, 
'Why so much ignorance, insolence  
turned against them who have less chance?'
When we see people bleeding, suffering, dying
why can't we help them without demanding 
that they give something in return? 
Why not give peace to all mankind?
I hear a mother's sigh, baby's cry, 
hungry eyes that are full of flies.
Child warriors taught by men:
Little girls that are sold they're innocent.
Such a crime. Now's the time! 
Stop these horrors let's clean those ignorant minds.
Stand against inhumanity!
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Let's have peace!
Come on!  For mankind!
Peace to all mankind
Peace to all mankind
Peace to all mankind
Kana:
It's our lives. Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Let's make peace the bottom line
There's no choice. Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
It's your life! Now's the time! 
Let's give peace to all of mankind.
Parlando: Gyle
We have to stop all these atrocities 
that are going on in the world. 
There's too much pain, too much hurt, 
come on let's put our hands together. 
Let's stop the war. Let's help those kids 
who need help. All those people out there 
want the same thing as you do, as I do. 
We have to keep on going. 
We have to keep our faith strong. 
You see without humanity there's nothing. 
We are the chosen people. We have to do it. 
If we don't do it what's going to happen? 
Let's give peace to mankind. 
Let's put our hands together. Let's hold each. 
I think it's time to do that right now. 
Come on put your hands together. Hold each other. 
Come on it's now, I would say it's now or never. 
Peace, peace to mankind. Come on! 
Have peace! Peace to mankind.

Words: Gyle Waddy			Music: Kana Bukuru Lesouple

Since then everything has changed.
Since then I'm reborn again
I see everything differently.
No, you don't know what you've done for me.

When I was lost and stumbled in the dark
no matter the cost you brought me across.
You lead the way with my hand in your hand
you showed me the light of day
and the right way to loveland.
When others turned their backs on me.
When they wouldn't bother you came and freed me.
When I was bleeding with three little words
I was in safekeeping like a fragile bird.
	
Since then everything has changed.
Since then I'm reborn again
I see everything differently.
No, you don't know what you've done for me.
Since then everything has changed.
Since then I'm reborn again 
and God knows I feel I can win
life's taken another direction.

Now there's nothing, nothing I can?t do
no matter how, how hard the task.
Now there's nothing, nothing I can't do
since I have your love at last.

We are born
and from that time
we are
on the way towards death.

We grow
from tiny tots.
We are 
put through a lot, yes through a lot.

We ramble
along life's highways
turning into many dead ends.
We turn around
then start again, we start again.

We must, however,
we must
at some point
come to that final end, final end.

We have 
to take the last,
that very last,
that final exit, final exit.

But we still will
we'll still live in spirit.
Your spirit.

In the end

I thought it was just some hear-say
But then she showed me a picture or two
Of her with some dude
In positions that weren't cool
And then I looked again
And I saw that this dude was you

My first reaction was to snap on her
But what good would that do?
You know that I had better things 
Than fightin' over you
So many times, it seems that I refuse to see the truth
But this time, you know that I am through

So you can't come back, you can't come back

You're in and out of my life
This time was your last try
You made your bed, so there you lie
So you can't come back

The last time you deceived me
You said give you one more chance
You blamed it on your weaknesses
Of just being a man
I was a fool to believe in you
Put my heart in your hands
I shoulda known when you did me wrong
You'd just do it again

Please just leave, no convincing me
You will ever be the man for me
I'm so sick and tired
Of hearing lies from you
Just pack your bags
'Cause I am through

So just walk right out the door
'Cause you can't come back here no more
You know we've been through this before
So you can't come back, you can't come back

But still, there wasn't enough
Gave you my heart and soul, total control

And see, now time after time
I kept takin' you back

Kandi,"I just grow weaker as the days go by
I cry so much there's no reason to wipe my eyes
Way down deep inside my mind
I still deny that I must say goodbye
To the one I thought would always be mine

Now I believe that what we give comes back to us in time
And I believe that if you search for long enough you'll find
What you always knew to be the truth was right before your eyes
And so if I, if I have to let you go

[Chorus]
Darling, just as long as you know
Wherever you go
If there's a road that leads you back my way
I'll be at the end of that road
Just so you know
I, I'm gonna be there

There's just no easy way to prepare for something like this
Cause you never know just what you'll do
Until the moment exists
See, I tried to tell my heart to just behave
My lips want to beg you to stay, but it'll be okay

If I can convince my arms to let you go
Now, I don't know how I'll ever get over this
Cause there's this chance
That you might find somebody else

I'm hoping the odds are all against it
But if you do and it's not what you want in your heart
If it's tearing you apart, you need to come on back here

[Chorus]

Just a few years ago
I was told the best way to keep
Something precious, set it free
Cause love will span the distance

And if you ever find yourself
At the lonesome road
You just turn around
I will be around

I will be right there
I'll  be waiting for you
My love is gonna be there

Sometimes it seems that she's the only one that understands me
No need to creep, she knows what I like
And on top keeps me laced from my neck to my Nikes
When I'm broke, holds me close on cold nights
Accepts my collects I'm lookin' to spoil right
I been searchin' my whole life for Ms. Right
Home cooked meals and good sex
Just a little bit of spice
Wit my luck, I know I'll only get one in this world
And that's West Side Riders love

I never fall off my game never rusty, J make the girls stop and stare
The way the chains swing back and forth like a rockin' chair

Let's pop in here, from 80 to Club Centuries, to the good bar
Everybody know Lil' J the hottest star

These half-ass rappers your used to
So who the fuck want to battle me?
I spit slugs out my mouth bout the size of a see battery
Like, ""chik chik chik"", put it down, man
Half of why y'all cats lying on your sound scan
And you sold what? That was the amount?
Come on nigga, you know sample tapes don't count
Real quick out the stash, been flippin' at dash
Bruise me with two feet when I'm kicking yo' ass
And you never catch me in the club leaving a skirt
If I don't get brains then the meter get jerk
why'all them fools in the club with a Smedian shirt
Rent a car in your hometown just to see if it work
For 18 years, your momma been feedin a jerk
I spit something hot, have you getting wheezy like Turk, nigga

Hey yo, say blast I'ma blast, while why y'all play dummies
Hunh, thinking I ain't goin' get this money
Watch me come through spit sick and get fly
Beat you on your best day on your best try, and
(Y'all don't really wanna)
Dig out the stash cause I probably.. on yo' ass
And my words make the track get up
While I move on it, groove on it
And keep you flows on the cut like
Rockin mic's, why'all know how we get down
Catch me on tour when I slide through your town
I'm hit bound, why'all lay down flat

Uh, uh, and you don't stop (here go another one)
Uh, uh, and you don't stop (here go another one)
(Feel me baby, it's on)

Uh, I was launched off the block, straight to the top
To yachts with helicopters, I'm so hot
Paparazzi, blinded by the rocks
My limousine roll up, the whole world shocked cause
You steppin out with an entrepeneur
I copped you more than what you bargained for
Roll the red carpet, enjoy the profits
First, let's make love in the walk-in closet
Daddy just made a nine digit deposit
Believe me sweetie, it's not luck it's logic
I'm the captain of my destiny
Used to dream of the things I was blessed to see
The jewels and the papers, sports cars and such
There's nothing in the world LL can't touch
You stood by my side and pushed me so much
That's why you got them 10 karats, you know what?

It's so amazing, amazing, amazing
Life's given my baby, my baby, my baby
Maybe some day you'll feel, how I feel, it's crazy
To see my baby is so amazing

Sing it baby

I've got riches wall to wall
Up the stairs and, down the hall of
All the things that we have done
You got more ideas for us to
Live our lives and explore 
There is no topping you, you're untoppable

So what you sayin'? Uh-huh
Hehehe, I appreciate it

It's so amazing, your love, to me
It's so amazing, amazing, to me
It's so amazing, your love, to me
It's so amazing, amazing, to me

It's alright

(I miss you too)
Just as long, as you don't defy my love
Then it's on (I promise you baby)

Uh, uh, slide out to Venice, my game's in order
Would chip in to vent, but the city's on water
Searchlights and fireworks bling the sky
A vowel on the end of everything we buy
Yellow ice in both ears, I loosen up the tie
I'm lovin' this life style, baby I can't lie
It feels so good it make a grown man cry
Cause I made it out the hood and a lot of my crew died
I guess I had determination
And baby girl kept me in the congregation
Now it's private jets and deep conversation
Hundred G's a month to show appreciation
All eyes on us, the cameras flash
In God We Trust, I don't love this cash
But you was definitely, by my side when my world collapsed
Now I'm, rich for life and I'm payin you back

This is like this for life baby
This gon' always be like this
God is my witness
Hold you tight for the rest of my life

She said ""I suppose you've heard
About Alice.""
So, I rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
And I could hardly believe my eyes,
This big limousine pulled slowly into Alice's drive. 
I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go,
I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,
'Cause for 24 years I've been living next door to Alice.
24 years, just waitin' for a chance,
To tell her how I'm feeling, maybe get a second glance,
Now I've gotta get used to not living next door to Alice. 

Grew up together, two kids in the park,
Carved our initials deep in the bark
Me and Alice.
Now she walks to the door, with her head held high,
Just for a moment, I caught her eye,
As the big limousine pulled slowly out of Alice's drive.

I guess she's got her reasons but I just don't want to know,

She said ""I know how to help
You get over Alice.""
She said ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here
You know I've been waiting 24 years.""

Ain't nobody gonna catch me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah and numerous other sounds
We made love that very night
Under a burnt auburn Cancun sky
And I guess now I'm a Mexican cause in Texas I'm a wanted man
She got up in a long white gown
For the man that shot her daddy down
Somewhere around in the heat of the night there was a shot
And I'm running down this Indian highway
With a bottle of red
I've got a loaded gun and things are going my way for a change yeah
Well you might think that I'm gonna be swinging from a tree

There's no ending now you're here,
Take me far away from me.
Fill my head with silence,
Till I'm over you and gone.

So what if my heart won't wait,
What if tonight I stayed?

Oh, what if I stayed here?
What if your arms would hold me for life?
What if you didn't need me?
Oh, what if I stayed here?

Hold my head up, spin me round.
Hold me up until I'm found.
And fill my head with silence,
Till I'm over you again.

So what if tonight I sailed away,
What if I gave my life away,
And what if I stumbled home.

What if my life came tumbling down,
And what if you didn't see me?
So what if I stayed here...",What If,

Kane,"Uh uh
So So Def
Yeah, yeah

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Come on, y'all wanna floss wit us
Cause all across the ball we burn it up
Drop a little paper, baby toss it up
Ya slackin on your pimpin, turn it up
See the money ain't a thang

I flex the Rol', sign a check for yo' hoe
Jigga's style is love, X and O
Save all your accolades, just the dough
My game is wide, all lames aside
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky
Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas
Me and J.D. got it locked crazy
Where you at haters?

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang

She rules the tides in me.
She crushes the waves with her sigh,

How can you just walk away from me?

Every cold night,
Every whisper,
Every silent scream,
And you never listen.
And you say what? It's alright,
Well it's not alright, no, no.

Every shiver,
Every dirty game.

It just isn't right.

And let it all just rain on me,
Let it all just rain on me,
Let it all just rain on me....
Rain down on me.

If only for a day,
Oh if only for one night,
I could tell you this is everything that i have ever lived for,

How can you just walk away from me?

There was nothing out there for the lost and lonely
But a voice in my head kept banging on my heart
Says you're not the only one

In disguise, understood,

The time I will find
Was the heart of everything (It's just the way that I want it)

3 2 Murder 1 lyric at your door
6 million ways to die so I chose
3 2 murder 1 lyric at your door

Verse 1 (Kane)

Lyrical buckshots to gangsta hip-hop got to stop
Fuck crooked cops got this glock so try to stop
Explicit I'm on some ill shit God is my witness
Watch a nigga get killed with the quickness
Kane & Abel will leave your ass hurting with this pump
Wrap you up in a shower curtain and dump you in the trunk
?? want to cuff me like ??
The bank robber crew come through drunker than a motherfucker
Caine run through in your brain watch your body drain
Cut your legs off for half-stepping in the game
I'll snatch you, hurt you with this tech and this mac
Pumping on your chest won't let you take another breath
Bloody murder is the issue
Watch these hot missles kiss you
Splatchering your brain tissue
Its Kane with fire I pour gas on you and lit you
I'm getting paid off the services of AK's
I'm out here bad I know niggas who got grenades
That's how it is in New Orleans
Niggas don't go to school in the morning
You get popped without warning
Everybody and they mama in this fucking game
Little g's get fronted QB's from Ben Thomas
??  workers keep on coming up short get shot up
In the knees
my gradmama watching the news waiting to see my face
And if I catch case can cola
Cause she don't understand slanging quarters 
cause I gots to be a baller
I smoke that cess smoke 
the fire getting higher cut your fingers off
And biting bitches like a vampire
Living fantasies like Mariah

(Chorus)

Verse 2 (Abel) 

You was the victim of a deadly plot you got shot
You fucking blood clot your face popped
Pick up the pieces
On Kane & Abel get blow deceases
The murder rate increases
Talking all that shit couldn't let that shit pass
Sewed up your lips put the hot curling iron up your ass
Bitch show some sense here respect
Fear of penatentiary ?? will put your clic in check
What's this, bucking hoes in my clothes
By my Cutlass, want to be thugs is trying to buck this
You miss, you bests to be in before your curfew
I murder you sipping brew just like my St. Ides commercial
My gangsta ass weed make your nose bleed
Smoke these damage your eyes you be standing like Chinese
MC's take off running as I
Grab the mic sweating like Rambo machine gun
And I'm macking on your hoe macking on your little sister
When I get stressed 
send both them bitches to the ?? switchers
The SKS hit ya make ya bloody crime lab pictures
Breaking niggas apart like Kevin 
on the ground when I come to town
Niggas better get the fuck from around

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Kane)

At funeral shows dead niggas got the best hoes
They shows fearing us got they face froze
I smoke a Newport sniffing embalming fluid
?? myself up to do it
And when I did it you gone get it
Sitting, gripping on my tech and it don't sweat
I can feel the devil's hot breath on my neck
Buck buck to your ass get you numb like Teddy Pendegrass
Fiening for quick cash, how long this shit gone last
Bucking to your chest like David Koresh
Make you stank like doo doo
And got hoes who know that voodoo
Kane & Abel is the name and now you know the pain
2 to the brain for being greedy to the fucking game

I sold my soul at an early age 

And now my hearts releasing daemons in a rage 

My eyes in a daze 

Evertime I close my eyes to go to sleep I see the visions coming 

Is juices running when ya done in 

Fear only make me curious, I'll never be afraid 

But if you slip you pay your life here come the light now nigga they 

dead 

Crack scarfs for my fucking glory 

Talking shit up in my territory 

Another day another world's sad story 



Verse 2 (Steph) 



Smoking blunt, smoke a nigga selling dope on the block 

Pop pop goes the glock I bring more nightmare than Hitchcock 

Get ?? when them bodies fall hitting them prisoners hard 

Its your final call bitch I'll smoke you like menthol 

Fuck all you bitches I'm putting you in them bodybags 

Tagging toes, nigga drive slow 

Creeping up out they indo scheming for they cheese 

Slanging oz's and quarter keys niggas dressed in army fatigues 

Freeze your whole coalition 

Strapped with ammunition 

Infrareds digging ditches for chicken heads 

This figure from head to toe 

Labeled as a Jane Doe, leaving bullets in your Lexus door 

But fuck it I'm through with the fairytales 

Cause when some shit jump off, all you murder on tape bitches gone bail 

Who gone prevail when I exhale on you small scale 

Lyrical laggers, want to be chrome packers 

Spit the facts I'm bout the Lex and the Ac 

My verbal combat will eliminate your whole habitat 

You hoes ain't fucking with that 

Or this, cause I piss on competition 

And have all you hoes in submission 

Trying to recondition your stilo 

Lyrical nino

Verse 3 (Mia X) 



Cause she up to schemes 

Tired of chasing apple pie dreams 

Mint greens is all I fien for straight shit is all this bitch know 

50's this nine millimeter berreta leaving you wetter than April showers 

Followe by your second line of flowers 

I devour competition, causing complete submissions 

Cooks more dope in my kitchen 

Tricking ass niggas be my victims when night falls 

Ya'll wants to floss but get set-up tied down and tossed 

Boss chick you don't want to see her 

Your bitch can either run for the heater or meet the dumb hoe beaters

To wire your mouth, knock your grill out

Or get your whole click engulfed in gangsta shit 

Too much to deal with

And taking flights, torsoe taped full of contrabands

But I sees nothing but dollars 

Feminist power 

My lyrics knocking like a KL beat

 Like 2Pac said  only God can judge me 

 But I think only black Jesus can help me 



Verse 1 (Kane) 



Six in the morning and I see the sunrise 

Wish I died in my sleep didn't want to open my eyes 

To see this world so fucked up for me 

And my family  worked so hard but can earn a decent salary  

these bills keep whooping a nigga ass 

Spent my whole check trying to dress with class 

I found myself having to smoke weed just to chill 

Both my parents got killed and I ain't cried still 

All my niggas getting shot, peoples mama's smoking rock 

And who the hell can stop these fucked up cops 

They like to overseaers and we like the slave bitches 

Offer pussy to a nigga even though they got AIDS 

You jumping in that pussy thatn you diving in the grave 

White man build the prison and the niggas come through 

Like the motherfuckers giving out free barbeque 

Lock a nigga up for life and say fuck you 

Most of ya'll ain't make it pass the 12th grade 

That's why you making minimum wage or slanging rocks for chump change 

a lot of people died for the right to vote 

We don't use white devils taking nigga land and missuse it 

On top of that I think my uncle on crack 

My boy Quay Shaun took a slug in his back 

>From another black now he in the coma trying to make it back 

Come on come on 

My old lady think she pregnant I ain't got no cash for her 

She probably fucking another nigga I wouldn't put it past her 

My mind got me murderous like John Doe 

Bitch ass niggas trying to play me like a hoe 

And now I'm rolling round sucking on a steel dick 

Bout to pull the trigger end it cause I'm tired of this bullshit 

Know what I'm saying grown men don't cry 

But the ghetto got me wheeping like a bitch I'm gone die on my knees 



(Chorus) 



Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up 

Allah, tell me why this world so fucked up 

Black Jesus tell me why this world so fucked up for me 

For me a nigga 



Verse 2 (Abel) 



They say that I was dealt some bad cards in this game of life 

But before I take my trip I'm gone leave with them stripes 

Sending dime bags of weed, toting nines til nose bleeds 

My nerve so bad I had to pop one of those be	's 

I had to strap my jimmy hat or catch this double mint disease 

See the devil in a crack pipe pointing at me 

I seen a nigga shaking just lke he caught the holy ghost 

But he really scored a gram of heroin for 80 bones 

I got them stones, if you take a hit you can't resist 

Now I'm crying, I think one of my brothers on that shit 

Do you care if you live or die, really I don't know 

But if there's hell below I think we all gonna go 



(Chorus) 



Verse 3 (Master P) 



Tell me is this heaven, is this hell 

I ain't LL, but all I hear is funeral bells 

The ghetto's trying to kill me, a born loser 

A born hustler my uncle's a drug user 

I'm from the projects or should I say the 3rd Ward 

Where fools into killing and fiends walk like androids 

Hooked up with the twins or should I say Kane & Abel 

Trying to keep some change in my pockets, some food on my table 



Verse 4 (Silkk) 



You know what P your right 

Cause Silkk was on the block like last night 

Niggaz doing anything from selling drugs 

to sell mugs smoking that glass pipe 

I'm from a messed up city where niggas don't live long 

they parents out-live they kids 

Rest in peace to my homie they like split his wig 

Now who won't walk that last mile to they death 

Imaging taking a deep (inhales) that was your last breath 

Just imaging your mom was prostituting your mom was smoking 

Imagine your eyes don't close imagine your eyes don't open 

I be like trying to keep the world and stay TRU 

There's too much drama in my hood, gotta stay cool 



Verse 5 (Master P) 



As I lay me down to sleep 

Black Jesus if you real, take me out this ghetto g 

Cause its crazy its wicked 

I got niggaz on every block trying to get a meal, ticket 

They killing they murder 

Little kids in 3 inch girdles 

And life is just like Pac Man 

Niggaz gumping up niggas but who gone be the next man 

To lose his shoes, I mean lose his life 

Who gone think twice, dying in this ghetto life 

Cause in the White House, politicians run the country 

But where I'm from in the ghetto's its bout drug money 

Ice cream slanging 

Niggas banging red and blue everybody's hanging 

Niggas bout it, little kids get rowdy 

But will I make it out this ghetto, I doubt it

By the hands of that 4-4 (Clack Clack)
Pull the hammer back (That the last)
Live fast and watch them die slow

Falling asleep behind the whell in the Range Rover
Can't remember the last time I was sober

Gotta watch those,

Took my money and my herb
Every player that on my team got a laser beam
Knock your head off, steal your dream
Not first you sure, ain't nutting nice serving fiends ain't what it seems
What the south about, big money, big guns and those big booties

Punching your code if you want these nickles, quarters and dimes
I got the ghetto soed up like mack diamonds and windy
And I got more sealers than JC Pennies
Throw it up if you a soldier
But if you a punk motherfucker talkin shit and working with the rollers
You better duck down quick when the tank pops
Cause we be slanging automatic fucking slangshots
I went from halves, to hoes with weed to working water
From selling grams, to motherfuckin quarters
From quarter keys, to really tapes and cd's
Not every nigga in the hood knows me
Uhhhhhh, but getting rowdy
Stayin TRU to the game, and still bout it bout it

Crushing niggas like sevens in dice games
Nickel plated meters knocking down doors
With hoes and gators, jaboes and polo's

For selling crack and, jack and gun clapping and rapping
Watch me smoke my little weed, got my drink and bud
What's up to all the slangers, the bangers, bloods and 'cause
I was a soldier, I still remain a soldier

Down a fifty of hennesee and blow a bag of doshia

[Kane]
Now I got me a 100 pounds of weed
5-50 a piece, now that's 55g's
Soldiers, servin' fiends down in New Orleans
Comin' out the projects sittin' on Gold D's
Young G, snort coca leaves and ki's
No Limit ready for war like we Vietnamese
Talkin' 'bout, if it's a drought tax niggas like it's a 211
Sellin' bricks for 27
More pounds of weed, breaking it down to ki's
Down to dimes and nickels
Hit a lick, got you niggas sick
How the fuck you gonna tell me about this game
From the streets to the pen niggas know my name

[Chorus]

[Abel]
100 grams of heroin, ??? 911 cut
Got to sell it while it's potent or it ain't worth fuck
Take a spoon and mash on the shit in baggies
Got some cash on it, cops find it, gots to dash on it
25 to life no questions asked
80 dollars a gram, now that's a lot of fuckin' cash
My niggas that hustle, be quick to blast
Cause Choppers and street sweepers think murder peoples ass
You phony rappers talk about the game
Been there, done that
Buss caps, sold crack, jack while fake jacks
Turn you into fortune like Pat Sajak
Get down and dirty while you busters cleaner than Ajax
No Limit, everything we say, we did it
Went to jail and shitted, eatin' steak and spinach
To big and you motherfuckers don't forget it
y'all niggas want to start some beef and I'ma finish it

See this here, this is somethin' serious right chea
I want all y'all ignorant niggas to listen to this
Not preachin' or teachin', but somethin' that y'all need to know

[Chorus]
Only God knows the truth
Only God knows
Only God knows the truth
Only God knows
Whisper in my ear when my casket close
When it's my time to go, take my soul out the ghetto

[Kane]
Nowadays niggas kill, at the drop of a dime
There be wars and Pulitzer Awards in the last time
Killuminati comin', I read it in Revelations
A one world government, United Nations
Penetentaries like concentration camps
Visa Cards and food stamps turn the microchips in ya hand
I don't understand in this land I'm from
It's like the rich get richer, the poor fightin' for crumbs
We some killas of our own kind wit nines
The white man pimp us everyday and we don't mind
Crack kills the mind, but life kills the soul
And your time to go, is somthin' you can't control
The government designed a system, keep 'em mentally inslaved
Control the population, outbreak, and AIDS
The media keep niggas divided and confused
Poison us with the food, and give us drugs ta use
Keep you in the county, used niggas actin' like fools
Runnin' 'round like y'all ain't got nuthin' ta lose

[Chorus] x2

I know what you sayin' Kane

[Kane]
What?

[Abel]
Feel my pain
Test of time, put stress on the brain
I learnt ta do my hussle at the age of fourteen
How ta stack that triple beam, servin' stones ta fiends
And it was only for tha style, all I got ta slangin' dope
I was broke, ask my boy for weed
He said he only had coke
Ever since they been husslin', always went ta find a car
When I die put my name up on the wall
On my casket write, ""fuck all of y'all""
Remember Kane, those ladies used ta beat us, at tha foster home
Since the age of sixteen, we been livin' on our own
My momma pregnant wit us, shootin' up tha heroin
Nigga from ya zone, grab that dirty Chrome, it's on
Got two rocks left, prayin' that I make it home
Cause only God knows tha truth, only God knows

My nigga Snoop brought the weed, Slim brought the liquor
C brought the cash and I brought the stripper
Freak ho shake that ass while niggas tip her
Got a pocket full of rubbers so we all goin' hit her

Bitch cleaner than Mr. Clean, a nigga decked out
Eyes hella red, Kane and Abel sessed out
Respect the tank, nigga stick my chest out
And this how we do it in the dirty south

Woah, please somebody tell me where the party at?
I'm tired of holding back, I wanna shine in my Cadillac
I'm here representing a soldier named Slim
See the tank on this neck, see the ice on this wrist

Picture this, I'm riding with Snoop Doggy Dogg
And so y'all don't worry 'bout the corners, we smokin' till the morning
Y'all just keep the bitches, now we on the way
Hold on man, I think Snoop got somethin' to say

Think fast when you dunk, 'cause I won't front
And when it's time to dunk I won't be no punk
I'll just pick the heater up and bust a shot
I'm the last nigga up to rock the spot

I'm represent a nigga to the fullest cause
And if y'all wanna trip, we tear this club up
(Tear it up)
Huh bro, nigga, nigga what, I'm tryin' to bust again
I'm likin' likin', I want some real pimp shit

Mo B.D. feel me niggas out the sess
Drink for drink and think to put in the fitty
Will he be that same nigga blowin' doshia?
(Say what?)
Check this out, get the fuck out, party over

I guess I'm a born pimp cause I never eat it, still I complete it
My name mac so motherfuckers know where my game at
I fuck em and duck, give em wrong numbers and what
Camouflage love all night making you moan
Yeah I get mine and I'm gone but I gotta go finish my song
Look you ain't gotta go home but you gotta leave
Now straighten up your weave
And call me soon as you make it to your crib please
And I'm gone give you a beep next time I want to creep
Wouldn't give a fuck if you sleep, wake up and greet it's me
I like them thug girls y'all can have them pretty hoes
Them giddy hoes ain't good for nothing but videos

Chorus 4x

No disrespecting my sisters, I'm disrespecting you bitches
Scandalous hoes sucking and fucking for a nigga's riches
Keep your hands out my pockets ho cause I'm a pimp
You can't play this fucking player that's why I treat you like a gimp
You ain't nothing but a fuck or two
So if you ain't got no cash then I really don't want your ass
I'm bout bigger and fucking better
If you really want me then bring the cheddar
And I promise you that you'll never need another fellow
Treat ya like daddy but be sure to call me magic
And if I ever catch you stashing, girl I'm gone let you have
When a nigga call you, call me and I decide (hmmm...)
Whether this nigga deserves the pussy...trust me
Sign your name on the dotted line and if you ever need this nigga
Just call me I ain't hard to find

Chorus 4x

What you don't get it or something...
No limit carry nothing but pimps and motherfucking players.

Suck a dick bitch.

This be fiend coming at like this here here
I brought a couple of my people with me
Fiend, mac, soulja slim, kane and abel
A couple of no limit soldiers to help me out with this here

Chorus
What cha mean, mean, heard about
Soldiers got some daily clout
Slangin in the dirty south
What we really worried about x2

[soulja slim]
(peep this shit) I know you heard about this nigga from the 3rd
Raw, then a uncut bird with bad tempers and bad nerves
Serve, dope to a dope fiend gotta get more cream
Than the rest of the dealers
Every nigga that I fuck with gotta be from killas
Fill up in this shit, that was ever smokin, you can catch me smokin
On some shit that will have me broken, (cough cough),
I'm so high, I can ride, barely need to slug some dealing
No optimos, no keep moving, fuck it, pass the feeling
Real niggas feel me, cause I'm bout as real as it get
Son or stranger, no love for that studio shit
All my little partners gone, I'll be damned if I g-o
But if I do I'll grab my gun shoot like and pull let em know

Chorus x2

[kane & abel]
You know I'm from the ghetto, hit the glock
And pop my shots clean up your block
Red beam, maintain my aim, bullet holes in your brain
When I stop that motherfucking clock, kane
Usual suspect, down south niggas bout respect
Choppin off slugs like a mailman in a corvette
Like the weed when I lower my tek
Niggas is seeking, pump down like bricks, in the trunk of the 626
Is something you hate cause your boy
Just got flipped, ak with a strong clip
In the hood I bust you with the tank,
In the pen I trust you with the shank
My mind go blank, I'm a soldier smokin dank
All the way to the motherfucking bank

Chorus x2

[mac]
Now what y'all mean, niggas on my team
They all about the cream
And my enemies, we take it to the street
To get the green, knowa mean
Came here with slim, mac and fiend
I still scream woah!
In the drop where my nigga walk
Runnin from the cop who was trying to meet his quota
I'm young and I'm black, I'm a soldier
So he thinking I'm slanging that baking soda
You ain't heard about, nigga from that dirty south
Where the po-po's scout
Everybody, everybody that knows what your bout
Won't leave your house
Cause at night, nigga freaks come out
Grab your gat with that extra clip cause if you catch us slippin
You might connect the grip
Shots there cut up strip bout a couple of ship
Like the peoples in summertime agent trip
Lets take a trip to the land where the niggas
Do the murderman dance on their enemies
And fake niggas pretend to be a, they be them friends of me
Woah, slow your roll and daddy I'm camoflauged
I'm psycho warden I stay on my guard and bitch I never die

Chorus x2

[fiend]
What the world don't know is I'm a hurt
A soldier without a pause
I'm prayin about cause, break jaws and all laws
My bullet scars didn't heal, my tatoos reveal
Bout to ride explain a million of hostile
The burn feels like almost a step from death
Fuck spending lives, I barely leave a minute of breath
I'm set, families with teks, release my stress in their chest
Wouldn't know where I'd be without my God and my vest
Killers, we the best fuck all the rest, here hit the cess
Snort, c'mon the test
With the charge the best, cause I open your chest
God bless, I made my way back so I can say that
Me too whatever, should have known that fiend believe in payback
Do it for haystacks, me, slim, twins, and mac
Gotta attack, with the jest to ask, deftly in the act
I doubt that, I'm strange cause I'm with the right change
After soldier consediration, I'm the live range

Do this for the soldiers with the bourbons and lacs

Watch your back New Orleans is a fool like that
Out the blue you crooked punishments choose to jack
You might see me on a cell fussing with my girl cussing
If you see me in the club it's only right we got to smoke something
Don't want to see me on the street busting like a mad russian
Banging niggas up like percussion need to turn it or crush em
Not for nothing ladies love it when twins be rapping
Taking titties out their bra they drop their g-string
Got our own company so come to us for the D
But that depend on how royal you want the hustle to be
It depend on how ployal you want the hummer to be
Don't trick give you the first hit for free
I know you missed us now we returned to the game
Still gangstafied bitch we invented that name
Ain't about to let no snake lay me out my chains
Cause i raised the stakes and put a stain on your grave
Underestimate here's the murder advice
A straight coward be the first one to take your life
Stop hating decide to get your own game tight
Cause i ride in the morning rather ride at night
Slide my flow get dough like Leo Dicaprio
Play your watch out gangster the rap Vito

Knew I was sinnin and I knew you will forgive me

So got love for my hook but you're my loves bigger
Stuck in the county jail pacin my cell
Facin 25 with a L million dollars bail
Thinkin 'what do I believe in, heaven or hell?'
Sometimes the street's stressed do my best but still fail
I grew up poor put in work and got rich

You took my mom and my dad when I was 6 years old

Preacher say you had a purpose for me -I stay
My grandmother told me that I ain't livin right
And my name gon be missin in heaven's book of life
The lady down the street say I'm goin to hell

When my money was low and my hopes was high
I looked to the sky and you got me 'PA

But you put me through trails and my life
I know it's worth
Fell on my knees in the [?church?] prayin to you 
Don't got no gun in my waist I got respect for you

So got love for my hook but you're my loves bigger
Stuck in the county jail pacin my cell
Facin 25 with a L million dollars bail
Thinkin 'what do I believe in, heaven or hell?'
Sometimes the street's stressed do my best but still fail
I grew up poor put in work and got rich
With you in my heart by my side I got some happiness
[?] your life get my life right
Because you're comin like a thief in the night
Dedicated to you for being there for me
Even though my life I do is so much tragedy

(Chorus) 2x

(Verse 2)
Did so much dirt in a world so cold
You took my mom and my dad when I was 6 years old
And everything I do I did it to get paid
In time I'm payin for those mistakes that I made
You called Clarence my boy we was in 11th grade
Preacher say you had a purpose for me -I stay
My grandmother told me that I ain't livin right
And my name gon be missin in heaven's book of life
The lady down the street say I'm goin to hell
With every day you let me live it's a story to tell
When my money was low and my hopes was high
I looked to the sky and you got me 'PA

(Chorus) 2x

(Verse 3)
Love you more than money in the bank much more than dank
Live without you I can't
I give you prayers and thanks
Ain't no killer in the ghetto better than you
Forever with you cause you're the most powerful
I ain't perfect never said I was perfect
But you put me through trails and my life
I know it's worth
Fell on my knees in the [?church?] prayin to you 
Don't got no gun in my waist I got respect for you
I got no fear cause the Lord you got my back
And we're livin in the final days of the last days
I believe that ain't no lookin back keep the contact
It's dedicated to you for being there for me

 (You don't want this life
  So live your life right ba-by) 5x

Life your life right
Trust me you don't want this life
Trust me you don't want this life

Like something umbilical
When it defies
And the opiate is spiteful

Threatening your ovum
And your ravaged torso
Bring us the still born and the midwife
And complete the stunning response to the spite

Shimmy down the birth canal

When the cervix smiles

And then you spill your guys

It's like a kiss, kiss on the forehead
And it's how you kiss them
That just cracks my skin through
It's time to steal another kiss from your broad shoulders

It's time you lick my heart
And burn my eyes with your hip acid filled caress
You keep the endings coming
And I'll keep the vomit flowing

Your mating calls are showing
That the best thing in life aren't worth loving
What if I lined my lips with your poison then you'd better kiss me
You'd better make me give in, make me your everything

Come and get your kiss on the forehead
We'll blame it on the housing projects
What an index that could make for
What your body is scarred from, the bombs on the first floor

We'll blame it on the housing projects

It's a chain reaction, it's a medication
And I want to live forever

Shake your thorax to the footsteps
They'd love to taste the free air
They'd love to dream of blackmail
They'd love to bathe you in your former glory

Next stop, faith in the fact that
You'll have the answer to everything
Faster, faster, won't you make it
Faster one more time?

To breathe your breath in time
Your breath is out of time, make it faster
Now shake your hips with culture
Now point your fingers to the sky

Living in your kisses, living like a fascist lover
Save your ritual tragedy, it's time to celebrate our new
Noble complacent so lucid serenity
Take it from here and I'll save our eyes
With your forked tongue, living like a fascist lover

Kane Welch Kaplin,"When I was a child my family would travel
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn


And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
Just five miles away from wherever I am",Paradise,2010
Kane's River,"After all the years we spent together, after all the laughter we have shared
Why did you leave and seek another's arms, when all you ever needed was right here
I never should've told you that I loved you, I never should've told you that I cared
Now that you're gone, I'll sing this sad song, for all that's left for me is loneliness
I gave you all the love that I had, dear, I stayed with you through the heartache and the pain
Now I'll have to face my future all alone, instead of having you to call my own

I never should've told you that I loved you, I never should've told you that I cared
Now that you're gone, I'll sing this sad song, for all that's left for me is loneliness
Every night I dream of days gone by love, I dream of nights we held each other tight
Those days are gone now forever, because your foolish heart let our love slip away
I never should've told you that I loved you, I never should've told you that I cared
Now that you're gone, I'll sing this sad song, for all that's left for me is loneliness",All That's Left for Me,2000
Kane's River,"Back in 1860 when the buffalo still ran
Annie met a man who talked of 
Living off the land
She can't believe that years ago 
At wild-eyed 16
They hit the rutted wagon trail 
West with just a dream

After months of travel 
With the other pioneers
Miles from the Rockies they just stopped 
And dropped their gear
Looking back the summer grass was 
Green as green can get
They settled in a good year, 
It'll be a dozen 'til the next

Now she knows there's 
A love off in the distance
Like the storm clouds 
Building to the West
But the rain won't come 
When the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm

Summer killed the crops 
Beneath the brutal August sun
Cattle starved to nothing 
Found the mercy of a gun
Love had warmed the cabin when 
The nights were 10 below
Bitter words and hatred now 
Are all that they can grow

Now she knows there's a love 
Off in the distance
Like the storm clouds 
Building to the West
But the rain won't come w
Wen the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm

Desperate times and drought years 
Can destroy the best of men
She can't help but wonder 
If he'll ever love again
Her dreams have turned to nightmares 
And they're all about the rain
Now she thinks of as just 
A thousand acre pain

Now she knows there's a love 
Off in the distance
Like the storm clouds 
Building to the West
But the rain won't come 
When the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm

But the rain won't come 
When the day is done, 
It's quiet like before
She can't take the tension 
In the calm before the storm",Calm Before the Storm,2000
Kane's River,"It's the 13th of November 
And I cross another day off the calendar 
That hangs there by the door
A silent witness to the lonely life 
That I have made 
Where every passing hour 
Is just like the one before
When love is new it shines 
Like sparkling diamonds 
In the sun, like morning dew 
Upon the leaves of gold
But if it is neglected it will slowly fade away 
And leave you there with nothing but a heart 
That's sad and cold

I know that you are gone 
Because of things I didn't do
You left because of things I didn't say
The nights are getting longer 
And there's no one else to blame 
For sending all my bridges up in flames
There's nothing left to do but pray for rain

At first I didn't realize just how far 
We'd grown apart, our sunny skies 
Reduced to shades of gray
I thought that I was falling 
Out of love with you 
And so, I heard but didn't listen to 
The things you had to say
But no man is an island, 
Or so the saying goes, 
And a house that has no love is not a home
Life without you has got to be 
The hardest thing I've done, 
And if you can forgive me 
We won't have to be alone

I know that you are gone 
Because of things I didn't do
You left because of things I didn't say
The nights are getting longer 
And there's no one else to blame 
For sending all my bridges up in flames
There's nothing left to do but pray for rain

The nights are getting longer 
And there's no one else to blame
Nothing left to do but pray for rain",Pray for Rain,2000
Kane's River,"I remember the face of an angel, 
A love that was faithful and true
I left that dear girl in the mountains, 
For a ramblin' life empty and blue

Sweet roses bloom where they're planted, 
Wild flowers seed on the wind
That valley was closer to heaven, 
Than any place this poor fool's been

It's a far cry from here to Virginia
But I've crawled every inch of that ground
My teardrops fall like rain on the roof
Of that blueridge home where I'm bound

This old highway is a ribbon of lonesome, 
I don't care where I lay my head down
Virginia has died broken-hearted, 
My poor mountain darlin' is gone

It's a far cry from here to Virginia
But I've crawled every inch of that ground

It's you that he'll need
It's you that he'll sacrifice and it's you that'll bleed

And recognize in life there's only two guarantees

Check it out
The way you feelin on the outside
Reflects how you feelin' on the inside
Tell me now have you really ever stopped tryin
So many people killin
Kids still dyin or multiplyin'
I ain't lyin here's my testimony
The shit I kick is real never ever phony
You spittin cheesy lyrics like macaroni
Call me if you only want to sit down and write a jam
That stands for Somethin'

Because my passion and rage are highly concentrated
This underground music movement is way too underrated
Pop music done came
Had its five seconds of fame
Now it's time to throw a wrench all up in they game

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters expect no knives
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

We trek this battlefield life
with words to sleigh the doubters quitters, cowards
It's only common sense the heart is more revealing
but a stab to someone's back is much more appealing

I know you feel the pain I conceal
Hip hop flip flopped to gain pop appeal
Upon the backs of MC's with integrity
Rap music made wack a celebrity
I ain't worried why be in a hurry
Giant steps are made in inches and snakes tend to scurry
When my steps are taken no room for move fakin'
Your titles exect your visions blurry so hurry hurry
Catch the force of all my fury
I'm growin leaps and bounds from the mound which you been buried
Feed off yo energy
Two times infinity
MCs are meant to be controllers of mics

Now the slick text in this here context
is just far too complex too far out to be fetched
So as I sketch check my patterns, my shades and tones
Freak in the microphone is yours truly saucer
The dope rhyme flosser
I got something for all you wankers and tossers..
With dollar budget pushing low grade quality
That's like ghost face sportin some no name walabees

Now I be damned if I sit on my ass
While these MCs tresspass cross my grass
Time to landscape
Reshape the garden for growth
Spread the message overseas, via remote

We got different types of flavas but they taste the same
All biters no writers in this hip-hop game
I blame myself plus you for things we do
It's not wonder why we stay under and don't bust through because..

I'm from the 13, uptown
You know how them uptown niggas get down
Them bricks high, but they still pay the price now
Drinks, pills and purp, I'm feeling right now

A nigga feeling right, right now
I got the kush rolled up and the drink in the cup right now
Yeah, I'm feeling right, right now
I got the kush rolled up and the drink in the cup right now

A nigga feeling right, right now
I got the weed rolled up, bad bitch in the car right now
And I'm chasing that money
Gotta get it right now, right now

Yo, this P-N-see,
Comin' at you, with my girl Ms. Tee,
One Time,
There's a lot of brothers out there that try to duplicate,
Knowin' we the ones that originate,
Tee, show'em how we do

[Chorus (Ms. Tee & Kangol Slim):]

Tell me why you actin' funny?
With all your money?

Ms. Tee)
Tell me why you actin' funny?
With all your money?

(Kangol Slim)
Tell me why you actin' bad?
With your kitty kat?

First Verse (Kangol Slim):
Tell me Baby girl why you actin' funny?
Everytime you come around you gotta ask me for money,
Not really trickin' off, ain't my style,
But I might give you somethin' if it's worth my while,
I don't know, the games that you play,
But we don't play that, around my way,
The only money that I really plan to spend,
Is on me and you scorin' on La Quinta inn
Now Baby girl I can see on you face,
You really want to hop up in the Z-28,
You know one thing, you ain't bout to get no money,
Round here stuntin' for your friends, tell me why you actin' funny?
You actin' bad with your kitty-kitty kat,
Knowin' that a brotha done already hit that,
You'z a want to-be hot girl,
But you'z a cold girl,
In a Hot Girl's World

[Chorus]

Second Verse (Ms. Tee):
Ooh, say boy why you actin' funny?
You never want to give me no lovin' or money,
You want some ass, don't want to give up the cash,
You want to sex me, then tell your boys and laugh,
Thought I would forgot about the things that we do?
Keep runnin' your mouth and ain't no love for you,
You want to sex me, but don't want to pay my bills,
And in the 9-8, you gonna have to hustle and heal,
Now you upsettin' me,
want to cry when they give you ten years in the pen,
But it wasn't like that, when you was home,
Now you keep on callin' my cellular phone,
And now I see,
You ain't no man,
You supposed to support me every way that you can,
Boy you want it, about my body,
And now I see, you ain't got no love for me

This is the girl that I want

Uncomfortable, it's been way more than a month or two
It's deeper than that I roll with you
So no other chick can't come close to you
And deep down I know the truth
Notice you don't like if I come with you
And chicks wanna hug me in front of you
But I don't mean to be rude
I won't find me another one quite like you
I know that we become so close
And I know I'm mostly on tour with girls backstage after the encore
But I'm down for you, look out for you (down for you, look out for you)
Try my best to be around for you (try my best to be around for you, ohh)
And if you still down then I want you to know
You're the one I want when I'm gone

This is the girl that I want
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love (and I ain't even wanna fall in love)

Been a player two girls at a time
Been a very bad boy like Shyne (too blind to see what you were doing)
I was involved in close, hiding with a silent ring tone
Like Jude Law in Closer
Relationship rollercoaster (ohhh)
My life, my real life co-star (ohhh)
With no dialouge we couldn't go far (ohhh)
But I'll try and stop
'Cause so far well that won't last (too blind to see what you were doing)
I move so fast spin round the track like go-karts
Over and over and over
To a slow stop, I'm so lost
'Cause what I couldn't be you wanted me to be (ohhh)
When I could'ntbreathe I wanted you to leave (ohhh)
What you couldn't see (ohhh)
Was me in the club with she
Looking like my wife to be
But finally, I've grown up since then
And your eyes opened up since then
And I've changed so let's keep it movin' (too blind to see what you were doing)

This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love ('cause I really wanna fall in love)

Give up my life for you
Baby 'cause girl I've changed
And this is the girl that I want

This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
Forget 'bout all them other girls before (forget 'bout all them other girls before)
Wanna get involved with you
All them other girls ain't the same
With them played the game
And this is the girl that I want

On the canopy
My stamina be enough for Angelina Jolie
Actually I had to be-come a man to be the man you see
And I know your fantasy
A baby and a family with me
I know how it sounds but believe me
That if I don't know how to be teach me

Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just one of those days 
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
And now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep 
It's just typical me 
I must have one of them faces
Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

Innit
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just typical me 

I must just be unruly
So no-one call over Rudy 
But look at all the drinks he brought me
I drink too much when I was forty
Stand up to see a nuisance
A pest, a pain, a rage
The same shit happens almost every other day 
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

It's always Kano getting in the madness
Me I'm in the corner sippin' on Champers 
But for some reason, I gotta face the 'all' on a rampage
It's so typical 
I'm no little fool 
And no I don't wanna sit and talk 
I take a Mo and sip it all 
Everyday it is so predictable 
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to 
I have mixed feelings but I dunno what I'm gonna do 
So here's what is and what isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

'cause you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in 
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss

I'll try my best to not be aggressive
But it's one of those days",Typical Me,2010

Come tomorrow
We gonna see better days
No more sorrow

This is for the ones in the slums
I'll be saying what's up
You ain't gotta be afraid no more
What the fuck?
Why you walking with your head down low
Pick it up
Pick it up
You only live once

And you can be anything you wanna be
There ain't nothing stopping you
Just like there weren't no stopping me
I'm from the east end where peeps used to speak cockney
Now it's so multicultural no one speaks properly
Rhyming slang was invented on the docks to put a block on police
Now the docks ain't there and no one cares 'cause they shotting B
But still talking code like Morse, it ain't no mock-ney
But educated people still see it as a mockery

That's why they use our slang against us to be derogatory
We just fuel the fire with our thugged-out philosophies
Like crime's the only way we're gonna feed off this economy
Revert to type, like these self fulfilling prophecies
But we ain't no different from them, honestly
Lucks the only reason they weren't born into poverty
So never be afraid to say what's in your heart, follow your dreams,
Or wanna be, something that they say you can't because I promise G

Everything will be okay
Yes it will
Come tomorrow
We gonna see better days
No more sorrow

Don't make me get Illmatic on them
Talking about them cats and robbers
Hustlin' them 16s I guess I'm still trapping on them
Rolex watch and I still ain't got no bachelor honors
Man was from the Ends on influenced from it's fragments and shelters
Still we didn't throw no hats in the air
My man was in the studio with hats and them snares
Who thought we would have made it to the BAFTAs this year?
When man was just a pickney with daks and I'm here
Anyway, I'm on a shine, moved from the crime
The only thing that's good about the hood is that we're color blind
Common goal, common enemy, economize
And still personify a nigga trying not to live a common life
Don't let them make you hate yourself
I'm like low batties, everywhere I go is like a hatred on my belt
Her amaze, her rage, at her age she shouldn't be having
No more babies put that lady in her place
You think shes scamming for a bigger place to stay?
Maybe you should try staying in her place
Plus a plasma on the wall can't change the personality of a ill mannered mentality
Damaged goods

Everything will be okay
Yes it will
Come tomorrow
We gonna see better days
No more sorrow

I'll be saying what's up
You ain't gotta be afraid no more
What the fuck?
Why you walking with your head down low
Pick it up
Pick it up
You only live once

Life is like a game of monopoly
The ones that get a head start buy up all the properties
Start acting like their aristocracy
And make the late comers pay the price for not rolling the dice properly
They might be winning now but success is a false economy
Playing a game of chance whether recklessly or responsibly
Lady Luck's no brass, can't buy her love it comes for free
She's a slut, no class, picks up random dudes she wants to treat

Yeah she could be warm with you on Oxford or on Regent Street
She'll be gone once you pass go along with your winning streak
Land on Old Kent Road, the end you deemed was way too cheap
To invest in, and you left them and wish you hadn't
Now you deep in debt with peeps from White Chapel east
Who got plastic red Ibis hotels on every street
Sucking all your fake P's until you can't receive
Even though it's only make believe
That's a metaphor for life
The only one you'll ever need, believe

Everything will be okay
Yes it will

We gonna see better days

What do you mean routine check?
I didn't take this route to be checked
Sound like you routinely check
Any youths in jeans and creps

Oi oi I don't get many routine checks these days
But these bros are not the same
Apart from the day off that train from that Tottenham game
I do tend to end days in the police station
On occasion lately
Once a week
Maybe
I get a crime reference number for my most recent phone
The police code that's the code for a free phone
Take one camera phone
Tell em I got jacked of the phone
When in fact actually though
The previous evening back at home
I played baby foot
No-one jacked my phone
I madly gambled my phone and got smacked
By my bro

[Chorus]
What do you mean routine check?
I didn't take this route to be checked
Sound like you routinely check
Any youths in jeans and creps
What do you mean routine check?
I didn't take this route to be checked
Sound like you routinely check

Kano,"Seriously man,
Like, you know when you got a good girl,
Or you know when she means something to you, & you got like, a name. 

Here we go again
Here we go

Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her ""ladybird"",
Cos she always played red, in connect four. 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

Look, 
I call her nite nite
But we getting on fine right,
I don't wanna spoil it,
I don't why I can't commit to girls,
And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way,
Cos she got my favourite smile, her favourite style,
The first hotel, my favourite time, 
And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
Favourite child,
""I'm way too tired"", my favourite lie,
I wasnt too sure of her favourite rhyme
The windows are steaming up like it's naked time,
Wait, we're way too bait,
I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be,
And she's even my favourite size,
And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
Bait inside,
So I guess she's my favorite, right? 

Right,
Cos nothing comes close to you. 

So numbers? No boys are taking yours,
And no girls are taking mine,
Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time,
We speak from like 8 till late at night,
When we gets on top, drop my favourite line:

Girl, I ain't going nowhere. 

I plain ain't going nowhere,
But, I like you, and it might take some time,
But really I'm like

Here we go again,

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times,
Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds,
Cos she's ideal, like a nice meal,
And a night in, with a nice feel,
Maybe some wine,
Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine,
Sometimes,
Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week,
Or in a studio, away for a week, 
One we could book a vacation and leave,
But please: ""no drama"", I don't need beef like (? )
I'm just focused on making the peas, breaking the team, chasing a 
Dream,
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
But you can't say I don't make enough time,
We speak everyday and meet everyweek,
So I dunno. Maybe it's me. 
You? you got it planned out,
I don't make plans,
You know me, I wait and I see,
But if we were together, or even now,
If we weren't ""sort-of"", but were together,
Would you be faithfull to me? 
Treat me massage me and make me a tea? 
Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
Degrees? 

And you know I never say that sort of thing

See? that's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me? 

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realise, I realise why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow,
Baby we could do this again sometime,
I even have a special name for you,
It's ""long baby"", cos you always on my mind, yeah. 
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah,
I won't tell my mates,
No, no, I know, no, I know, oh
Yeah I like you,

Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just one of those days 
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
And now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep 
It's just typical me 
I must have one of them faces
Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

Innit
Typical me
Typical club scene 
Typical grief
One of those raves 
Typical beef
Now there's fucking headlocks 
Putting me to sleep
It's just typical me 

I must just be unruly
So no-one call over Rudy 
But look at all the drinks he brought me
I drink too much when I was forty
Stand up to see a nuisance
A pest, a pain, a rage
The same shit happens almost every other day 
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me
I'd rather kick that real finer chick
Smiling with me
I try my best to not be aggressive but 
It's one of those days

It's always Kano getting in the madness
Me I'm in the corner sippin' on Champers 
But for some reason, I gotta face the 'all' on a rampage
It's so typical 
I'm no little fool 
And no I don't wanna sit and talk 
I take a Mo and sip it all 
Everyday it is so predictable 
When I don't mean the tunes we listen to 
I have mixed feelings but I dunno what I'm gonna do 
So here's what is and what isn't true
It's just one of them days
One of them raves
Where some of us ain't in the mood for bouncers
You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

'cause you're on the door, and turn me away
I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in 
I'm on the list, so don't take the piss
That's what you're doing
I'll try my best to not be aggressive

How we Livin?

Sinning, coz dats the onli way we fink we're winnning.
Killing, coz dats the onli language people listen to.
Slingin, coz that's all you can manage wen you've been into Prison
Forbidden to listen, good riddens to bad rubbish we dnt know how 2 forgive we hold grudges,and we dnt how 2
Receive we throw punches and we dnt kno how to belive..

That there's too much drama,I feel like walking road with two straps and armour,all we care about is
Funds and garms,guns and arms.
The best chik on you're arm,the best watch on you're wrist,you best watch you're wrist coz them boys are,best cop you're
Blist coz dem boys are,best tint you're whip like them boys cars.
But I dnt wanna be cocking it bak and everywhere I go watching my bak,I jus wanna hop on a track do my
Thing not put on an act,I dnt eevn wanna put on bling,fuck up go to jail get put on a wing,got my own mind
Neva been put on a string,coz I jus wanna be the best,I dnt wanna do shows and be in a vest..

Live life to the fullest coz life can be taken away.
Be careful with bullets coz bullets can easily spray.
If he's ready to pull it you better be ready to react
If its duck,buck or say FUCK and get back.

Coz there's too much war,some need a strap jus to go to the corner store,but is it worth the stress
Baking in a vest,wen head shots can take in him the vest,take the bigger steps then you soon can take the
Bigger cheque,coz wen a gun goes off in you're head you will be heading for a closed coffin,I'm dreading that my
Times up soon might die with the 9's up soon,or do suttin dumb and get picked out of the line up soon,coz I'm
In two minds and I kno wots wrong and I know wots right,and I kno I'm strong and I dnt jus say this shit wen I write!..

Shut champagne and the low fade,

Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
And next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

True, you can move food on the street
Did a bitta that, got bored of that
Didn't move the brown or the crack
Use to pick up for the fact
I could make more back by breaking down to scores n that
Stack to buy out the stores n that
Didn't give a shit about loads of that
But I did give a shit about getting locked up
Or get boxed up, sentenced you'll get about 4 for that
Crap, you ain't so rich now
I bet you feel like a prick now
Coz where's all your fancy shit now
Where's your whips, chicks and your bits now
Shit, you should have fixed up
Fuck drugs, the mic you should have picked up
And it was all for the big bucks
Now you're sitting in a cell doing sit ups
Look I told you this shit's fucked
The ghetto lifestyle's too much
If I bust, be proud of me
You can't take it out of me
So I'm a bit stuck
But, I got too much to lose now
Love my life, and I don't wanna lose out
I'm still about, I'm home sweet home
In the ends, like I don't wanna move out

So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

Look, you can do moves on the street
Id rather spit bars on the beat
Id rather that than nick cars every week
But jack is when I split scars with the heat
So I'm solo like the guitars and the beat
But this rhyming shit is for me
I live this, drink this, eat this, shit this
And I've even writ bars in my sleep
But I ain't on hype, I've had enough phase
Ghetto's probably inside, hope he bust K's
That undergrounds like roll this, a tough race
You can be living this minute, then gone again like mum you was right
And I was wrong again
But I'm strong again
Still moved on again
Ten more minutes and I writ another song again
If I can do it, you can I'm a true fan
Up and coming MC's big up you man
The doors open but I ain't through man
I'm'a ball through like a cue dan
Watch me, ain't gonna let no-one stop me
UK I'm gonna break you properly
And If you ain't gonna watch me do that, move back
Who's that? K-A â?¦ I knew that
And I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling
Just believe me

You could be living this minute
And next minute you're gone away

I fear my safety, I fear I'm bait, but I can't put my skills to waste
Because if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed
I still gon' blaze, refuse to smoke my life away
Refuse to die before I try then put the mic away
This life of K, is just one big hype for praise
Right, night, record then start to write okay
But I'm just saying, back on hype of Kane
But only I'm to blame
Today I saw the signs that came, and it's got a good look
But that's life they say, crime pays
And Ill stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay
But grime ain't making me mill's
So I'm picking up a 9 today
And spittin' ain't getting me deals
But this shits just getting real

There are lots of signs in life
Some that you may not like
You could be livin this minute â?¦
The next minute you're gone away
So hold up your hands my brothers
And be conscious my sisters
And by your worst, you will get paid

When I see the fans go mad I think why do they like me?
There's about a thousand other boys just like me
Spittin' lyrics on the mic dressed in Nike
What makes me so special?
When they say I'm the next one to blow 
I say why do they think me?
All I do is stay in mostly and sleep 
And all I do is watch channel you and drink tea, why me?
All I do is listen to myself and get my lyrics in order
Play my own songs and give a mirror performance
Now I'm about to sign I'm sort of in there with warmers
I'm movin' on now, wish me good luck
My manager said this the quickest deal ever
I said 18 years ain't the quickest deal ever
I'm tryin' 2 sell and make the quickest meal ever
Support my family so I can feel better
But its not for the cheddar,
Its not for the fame
Its not for the rolex 
Its not for the chain
Its just for the respect, I've been doin' this for years remember
Free of charge I ain't rich yet

Sometimes I think is it all worth it
I ain't a popstar I can't be perfect
I've know I've got far, but is it to far to turn back?
Sometimes I have to kick myself
Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Finkin' could be underground goin' mainstream
Sometimes I have to kick myself
Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream
Finkin' could be underground goin' mainstream

Its so real now, I've had dreams of this album
So reality is the theme of this album
Boy I dunno if ill make cream off this album
I just wanna see fans screamin' and shoutin'
I ain't doubting my ability but sometimes I think why me particularly
What different have I got to offer lyrically?
But maybe there is something about me that the worlds dying to see
And without me, who can replace me a few can amaze me
And literally do what I do to the rave scene 
And go from spittin' in the booth to the mainstream
But am I gifted? Maybe I am
18 I'm only a baby I am they say
But was I born to do this ? yes
I don't have to sign no forms to do this but
I just take it one step at a time
One word at a time
One stage at a time
One breath at a time
Until I run out of time.

Sometimes I think is it all worth it
I ain't a popstar I can't be perfect
I've know I've got far, but is it to far to turn back?
Sometimes I have to kick myself
Cause sometimes I can't believe this shit myself
So sometimes you'll see me in a daydream

Kano,"Excuse me, girl
I know it's a bit embarrassing
But I just noticed some tan lines on your shirt

See, I reckon you're about an eight or a nine
Maybe even nine and a half in four beers' time
That blue Topshop top you've got on is nice
Bit too much fake tan, though, but yeah, you score high
But there's just one little thing that's really, really
Really, really annoying me about you, you see
Yeah, yeah, like I said, you are really fit
But my gosh, don't you just know it?

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

So when I looked at you standing there with your horde
I was waiting in the queue, looking at the board
Wondering whether to have a burger or chips
Or what the shrapnel in my back pocket could afford
When I noticed out the corner of my eye
Looking toward my direction, your eyes locked onto my course
I couldn't concentrate on what I wanted to order
Which lost me my place in the queue I waited for, yeah

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

(Whoa! Leave it out)
Are you smoking crack or something?
Mike, just leave it, just leave it
We cannot have that behaviour in this establishment
It's not worth it, Mike, just leave it
Don't touch me
It's not worth it
Don't touch me, look, I'm alright, don't touch me

For a while there I was thinking, yeah, but, what if?
Picturing myself pulling with bare white hot wit
Snaring you as you were standing there opposite
Whether or not you knew it, I swear you didn't tick
And when that bloke in the white behind us lot queuing
Was clocking onto you, too, yeah, I had to admit
That yeah, yeah, you are fit and yeah, I do want it
But I stop sharking a minute to get chips and drinks

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Now, I bashed my head hard earlier due to the brew
But I am digressing slightly, so I'll continue
I didn't want to bowl over all geezer and rude
Not rude like good but just rude like uncouth
You girls think you can just flirt and it comes to you
Well let me tell you, see, yes, yes, you are really rude
And rude as in good, I knew this as you stood and queued
But I just did not want to give the satisfaction to you

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

And just as you started to make your big advance
With the milkshake and that little doughnut in hand
I was like, nah, I can't even though you look grand
But you look sharp there smiling hard suggesting and
Gleaming away with your hearty, hearty-looking tan
But I admit the next bit was spanner to my plan
You walked towards my path but just brushed right past
And into the arms of that fucking white shirted man

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

Oh, what do I give a fuck? I've got a girlfriend anyway
We're all a bit drunk, we've had a few, fair play
I got this Stella I bummed from that last cafe
This night's not even begun, yes, yes, oh yay
I did fancy you a bit, though, yeah, I must say
I would rather I hadn't mugged myself on display
But this is just another case of female stopping play
In an otherwise total result of a holiday

I'm not trying to pull you
Even though I would like to
I think you are really fit
You're fit, but my gosh, don't you know it?

'Cause these girls are too bitchy and their mind set is long

Yea I learnt how to move and stay wise on the street
'Cause my older boy's showed me how a girl should roll deep
I saw moves get moved, watch man move what they move

Now it's stuck with me, I can't change it
I ain't troublesome, I'm the safest
But they won't let my clique in 'Faces' 
'cause I must be one of them artists
That gets kicked out the club the fastest 
'cause bouncers think they're the hardest 
I'll bang them and blame it on Marcus 
Yeah I got reason to get up
But I skank out and shuffle like Ke'l 
'Cause more times I'm just mellow
I'll bring up a pint before I say 'Hello' 
But yeah ravin's excitin'
So I put it all in my writin' 
And we ain't just always fightin' 
Just with the bouncers that think they're Tyson, 

'Cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique
Try it with me
I'm kinda pissed, so mind the 'on' switch, 
Don't try it with me

I drink too much when I was forty
Stand up to see a nuisance
A pest, a pain, a rage
The same shit happens almost every other day 
Almost every other rave
There's some sorta drama
But sometimes I'm cool I'm calmer
Frightened I can't afford to wear 'Prada' 
But I don't box just to prove I'm harder 
But don't piss me off today, I'm pissed already so
I guess it's gonna be one of those days

Typical me
It's typical
You can take me out the hood I'll still act like a criminal
So don't try and get physical
But let me weigh up my options
How big? They're menacing bouncers 
I'll bet twenty kgs, I bet they probably lift houses
So I guess a one on one just ain't the best way about this 
But this is my situation, every week, life's a bitch 
I'll probably get nominated and kicked out the Brits

'cause you're with your clique 
I'm with my clique

You might see me move some bouncers
Here's what I do to bouncers

I'm moving to you
I'm known to spoon, and knock with my fists
I'll tuck your crew in

Like I had a name for this girl, I used to call her ""Ladybird"",
Cos she always played red, in Connect Four.

Link em & leave then em high,
I've been tellin all my man's for time,
Link em and then leave em high,
They never take my advice,
But now I realize, I realize why,
They have not been listening all this time,
Cos since I linked you, last night,
I wont be taking my advice

Look, 
I call her ""Nite nite""
[?]
But we getting on fine right,
I don't wanna spoil it,
I don't why I can't commit to girls,
And I tell white lies, I'll find out the hard way,
Cos she got my favourite smile, her favourite style,
The first hotel, My favourite time, 
And maybe later we could have a baby, maybe a baby boy, my 
Favourite child,
""I'm way too tired"", My favourite lie,
I wasnt too sure of her favourite rhyme
The windows are steaming up like it's naked time,
Wait, we're way too bait,
I bought her favourite shoes, or they better be,
And she's even my favourite size,
And she knows I hate holding hands, and I'm hooded up when it's 
Bait inside,
So I guess she's my favorite, right?

[Leo the Lion]
Right,
Cos nothing comes close to you.

[Kano]
So numbers? No boys are taking yours,
And no girls are taking mine,
Groupies? **** that, I'm taking time,

Girl, I ain't going nowhere.

But, I like you, and it might take some time,
But really I'm like:

[Leo the Lion & Kano]
Here we go again,

[Leo the Lion](Chorus)

[Kano]
I call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times,
Touch my phone, and her number my thumb finds,
Cos she's ideal, like a nice meal,
And a night in, with a nice feel,
Maybe some wine,
Maybe sometime we could hold hands in the park, in the sunshine,
Sometimes,
Be patient with me if I got 3 raves in 1 week,
Or in a studio, away for a week, 
One we could book a vacation and leave,
But please: ""No drama"", I don't need beef like (?)
I'm just focused on making the peas, Breaking the team, Chasing a 
Dream,
I ain't on the street, maybe sometimes, 
But you can't say I don't make enough time,
We speak everyday and meet everyweek,
So I dunno. Maybe it's me.
You? You got it planned out,
I don't make plans,
You know me, I wait and I see,
But if we were together, or even now,
If we weren't ""sort-of"", but were together,
Would you be faithfull to me?
Treat me massage me and make me a tea?
Come link me, lay and wake up from sleep, and look hot like 80 
Degrees?

[Leo the Lion]
And you know I never say that sort of thing

See? That's an angel to me
I wouldn't have said that before, you get me?

[Leo the Lion]
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my, my, ow,
Baby we could do this again sometime,
I even have a special name for you,
It's ""Long Baby"", cos you always on my mind, yeah.
I'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah,
I won't tell my mates,

I love to make love
I love it when you wear them things that I like and they slide down your thighs everything seems alright
I love it when you put your back on my front and my tings come alive
I got a thing for them eyes, them pretty brown eyes and them city guys look back when they see us walk by
When I see you smile I lock that 'cause me and you are tight and its been a while since we reacted and acted
Wild but
I love the fact that you trust me too, no other girls done it so it must be you
Boys will be boys and yeah I get Blusky too but I try my best to think of you
I love the fact that you tell me anything and everything that I need to know
If your girlfriends, boyfriends, boys have got dough, when your best friends telling you fuck that Kano
I'm telling you she's bad minded, jealous, ill tell her for you
I won't get violent but I know her type
I love when you go silent when you know I'm right
See the position I'm in people talk don't listen they see you and wanna be in your position
And every boys wish is that it could be them and you, so I de-pend on you to keep them wishing
Listen to me I lo.. I like you...wait...nobody above just me beside you see...

But I don't wanna fall in love...

[Chorus (repeat x2)]
Na...i don't wanna fall in love, I don't wanna fall in love but your brown eyes have got me hypnotized
Maybe we could give it a try but I don't wanna fall in love

[Verse 2]
Its not official but your mine and you know it
So when boys move to you they move away in no time
I love that you understand sometimes I got no time and you don't make me choose between you and studio time
I couldn't cope with you gone, I love your phone call's it's only cool for you to call me when eastenders is on
I don't tend to be wrong but are you right for me
Would you link me after the show and stay up all night for me
You want me to be faithful and I want you to be, lets meet in the middle Truthfully, I think how
Beautiful our youts can be
It used to be about your face n your body now
I love to be with you 'cause chillin' with you's like my hobby
I can see me livin' with you, no time soon, but imagine me and you shopping with a baby in tha trolley
But maybe if we fall in love too young we'll get bored remember life begins at 40 and by 30 we'll be
Acting naughty
But if we don't it might come back to haunt me
But if you hurt me then ill hav to hurt you, then if I hurt you will you desert me...
But it should be you and me sittin in a tree k-I-s-s-I-n-g...

But I don't wanna fall in love...

[Chorus (repeat x5)]

Oh, ohh
This is the girl that I want

Uncomfortable, it's been way more than a month or two
It's deeper than that I roll with you
So no other chick can't come close to you
And deep down I know the truth
Notice you don't like if I come with you
And chicks wanna hug me in front of you
But I don't mean to be rude
I won't find me another one quite like you
I know that we become so close
And I know I'm mostly on tour with girls backstage after the encore
But I'm down for you, look out for you (down for you, look out for you)
Try my best to be around for you (try my best to be around for you, ohh)
And if you still down then I want you to know
You're the one I want when I'm gone

[Chorus]
This is the girl that I want
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love (and I ain't even wanna fall in love)
Girl I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby 'cause girl I've changed (baby I've changed)
And this is the girl that I want

Oh, ohh (well let me tell you somethin')
Ohhhh oh

Look I've been in a club many a times
Been a player two girls at a time
Been a very bad boy like Shyne (too blind to see what you were doing)
I was involved in close, hiding with a silent ring tone
Like Jude Law in Closer
Relationship rollercoaster (ohhh)
My life, my real life co-star (ohhh)
With no dialouge we couldn't go far (ohhh)
But I'll try and stop
'Cause so far well that won't last (too blind to see what you were doing)
I move so fast spin round the track like go-karts
Over and over and over
To a slow stop, I'm so lost
'Cause what I couldn't be you wanted me to be (ohhh)
When I could'ntbreathe I wanted you to leave (ohhh)
What you couldn't see (ohhh)
Was me in the club with she
Looking like my wife to be
But finally, I've grown up since then
And your eyes opened up since then
And I've changed so let's keep it movin' (too blind to see what you were doing)

[Chorus]
This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love ('cause I really wanna fall in love)
Girl I will ride with you
Give up my life for you
Baby 'cause girl I've changed
And this is the girl that I want

This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
Forget 'bout all them other girls before (forget 'bout all them other girls before)
Wanna get involved with you
All them other girls ain't the same
With them played the game
And this is the girl that I want

Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (ohh) (too blind to see what I was doing)
Ohhhh oh
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (ohh)
Oh, ohh (uh uh)
Ohhhh oh

Check
On the canopy
My stamina be enough for Angelina Jolie
Actually I had to be-come a man to be the man you see
And I know your fantasy
A baby and a family with me
I know how it sounds but believe me
That if I don't know how to be teach me

[Chorus: Craig David]
This is the girl that I want (and I really wanna let you know)
This is the girl that's gon make me fall in love ('cause I really wanna fall in love)

And now I'm a hill, Geppetto was able to make boy
I can definitely make a real hard boy as steel!

I gave them my demo, now it's time to deal again!

Yes it will
Come tomorrow
We gonna see better days
No more sorrow

This is for the ones in the slums
I'll be saying what's up
You ain't gotta be afraid no more
What the fuck?
Why you walking with your head down low
Pick it up
Pick it up
You only live once

And you can be anything you wanna be
There ain't nothing stopping you
Just like there weren't no stopping me
I'm from the east end where peeps used to speak cockney
Now it's so multicultural no one speaks properly
Rhyming slang was invented on the docks to put a block on police
Now the docks ain't there and no one cares 'cause they shotting B
But still talking code like Morse, it ain't no mock-ney
But educated people still see it as a mockery

That's why they use our slang against us to be derogatory
We just fuel the fire with our thugged-out philosophies
Like crime's the only way we're gonna feed off this economy
Revert to type, like these self fulfilling prophecies
But we ain't no different from them, honestly
Lucks the only reason they weren't born into poverty
So never be afraid to say what's in your heart, follow your dreams,
Or wanna be, something that they say you can't because I promise G

Everything will be okay
Yes it will
Come tomorrow
We gonna see better days
No more sorrow

Don't make me get Illmatic on them
Talking about them cats and robbers
Hustlin' them 16s I guess I'm still trapping on them
Rolex watch and I still ain't got no bachelor honors
Man was from the Ends on influenced from it's fragments and shelters
Still we didn't throw no hats in the air
My man was in the studio with hats and them snares
Who thought we would have made it to the BAFTAs this year?
When man was just a pickney with daks and I'm here
Anyway, I'm on a shine, moved from the crime
The only thing that's good about the hood is that we're color blind
Common goal, common enemy, economize
And still personify a nigga trying not to live a common life
Don't let them make you hate yourself
I'm like low batties, everywhere I go is like a hatred on my belt
Her amaze, her rage, at her age she shouldn't be having
No more babies put that lady in her place
You think shes scamming for a bigger place to stay?
Maybe you should try staying in her place
Plus a plasma on the wall can't change the personality of a ill mannered mentality
Damaged goods

Everything will be okay
Yes it will
Come tomorrow
We gonna see better days

What the fuck?
Why you walking with your head down low

Life is like a game of monopoly
The ones that get a head start buy up all the properties
Start acting like their aristocracy
And make the late comers pay the price for not rolling the dice properly
They might be winning now but success is a false economy
Playing a game of chance whether recklessly or responsibly
Lady Luck's no brass, can't buy her love it comes for free
She's a slut, no class, picks up random dudes she wants to treat

Yeah she could be warm with you on Oxford or on Regent Street
She'll be gone once you pass go along with your winning streak
Land on Old Kent Road, the end you deemed was way too cheap
To invest in, and you left them and wish you hadn't
Now you deep in debt with peeps from White Chapel east
Who got plastic red Ibis hotels on every street
Sucking all your fake P's until you can't receive
Even though it's only make believe
That's a metaphor for life

Hands in the cookie jar, ripping off riffs
I guess that's taking the flipping biscuit
Stealing a living with your sticky fingers
Crossing that pond and fishing for hits
We both gain from a little influence
But how comes nobody credits us Brits?
This ain't no RP cup of tea music
It's real east end theme music
No, I don't know the Queen
But that bitch stays in my jean pocket
No dub stepping on my toes
Don't fuck with my drum and bass
Shuffling to some council house

If being fatherless
Means no gift under trees, fuck it and plant the shit
Still got a tick on my feet, mothers are hustlers
But pushing little sis on the swing's a box I'd rather tick
Ramping with my niece
Makes me think about the sis that I never see
'Member the day you was introduced to me and Lee
You won't remember it, you was only two or three
You had your hair in twists, pretty little sunshine
Dropped you off just one time
Then we didn't ever see you again, was it the Choc Ice?
But maybe Dad's no longer with Mum, Jamaican bloodline
But I feel responsible 'cause I could've reached out just one time
Now I wonder if you know who I am
I wonder if you tell your friends that we're fam
I wonder if you're listening to this

No, not that speech, the De Niro speech
You know where the groom goes in a headlock in the hotel suite?
You're in the circle of trust, best treat she like queen
Family trees and olive branches
Or maybe we'll next meet when Daddy passes
See you there
I'll be in my funeral suit and Jeffery West
But maybe you've been thinking for years to send a text
But I get if you don't wanna come across like you're begging friend

East Ham, Plaistow, with Maxwell Leyton dreams
You were one of the first to make me believe in my first 16s
But did the heights I reached jeopardise the dial and speak
But we go back since manor and ride-on-the-play scheme
District coach, one Walkman, one ear each
Napier Road, Black Pitch
One-day travel cards and Fat Chaps chips
We toured the country, took it overseas
Took it from the streets to The Streets
And if someone was in your ear
Just know my intentions was clear
I was helping us all, we
I made sure we was all there
It's kind of hard when you're the face of it
Was you jealous of my fame a bit?
Funny thing is, I don't even want these questions answered
I just wanna have a brandy and a laugh regardless
Instead of acting like we're strangers, yeah

Seven years ago was Shane's little one's christening
AB was there tryna put to bed all the bickering
He made a phone call to you in the toilets
Said ""someone wants to speak"", gave me the phone to my annoyance
I said ""hello?"", you must've heard my voice and hung up
I just heard the phone cut out and picked my rum up
And hit the dancefloor to some Mavado, finger gun up
Water off a duck's back, but truth be told, that hurt, my brother
What dem a do? What dem a try?
To make our friendship fly into the sky
I said in ""Celebrate"" that I ain't even met your kids
A falling out has made us look a fool for this
I can't pinpoint where the problem started at
Who's to blame or who should even claim half of that
If it's stubborn competition, we both win
So who would just pick up the phone?
Could even if we grew apart, we're still a partnership
So why we acting like we're strangers?
Why we acting like we're strangers?
Oh boy, we ain't strangers

I wrote those first two verses last year, last year
Then the other day, was raving in west end and I see you there
I see you there, bredrin, I see you there, yeah
And we didn't have that brandy but we laughed
Plus we drank some vodka and a half
Oi, if you're hugging mate but wearing all-black, is that still gangster?
Gangster or not, that's my damn darg
And things were back to normal for one night, that's enough
Just to let us know there's no grudge, it's all love
But we all carry scars, we're all cut, we're grown ups
Teenage no more, we're older, we've grown up
But the next day got me thinking what if I was the reason?
Or if the tables turned, whether I would be seated
Or if your battery died that night at that christening
And I thought you disrespected, what if it was just reception?
So the straw that broke the camel's back of this friendship
Maybe it wasn't the intention, but would symbolise the ending
Now, what if you thought I hung up
And for seven years, you've been hung up on the same shit that I was
I guess we'll never know, it's pointless digging deeper holes
Cause if we go down that road, these burnt bridges charge tolls
So I'd rather bromanticise about these things
And write a song about what-ifs, cause I could never write no diss
Cause that's my brother
That's my brother
So bruv, why we acting like we're strangers?
Why we acting like we're strangers?
Fumbling, we ain't strangers

The vision that I seek
Those who died have all borne witness
If only they would speak

Now and then we've all been given
A glimpse of bygone days
I'd give all to see it clearly
Not shrouded in the haze
Yet I saw it all inside me, for a moment
Were you with me?
Have we done it all before, 
Is there really so much more?

Each man has a memory
Much more than the eye can see
Yet still others linger deep inside you
Haunting thoughts of pain and joy divide you
Look beyond your eyes
At the dark and moody skies
For they're standing in your way
And I feel the light of day

Now the earth gives forth its secrets
Held in mountain, sea and plain

Well I can't make it, I just can't figure it out
This dream is drivin' me crazy
I gotta know what it's all about
The mark is upon me, and the mark of Cain brings fear

A cold wind's blowin' right down my back
I'm runnin, I'm runnin' from a figure that's dressed in black
I think my legs are made out of lead
Cause I'm runnin' but I'm going nowhere
The bad dream is coming closer and closer
I got a feelin' he'll always be there
Forever is a long time to spend in agony
And the demons of confusion have got a place for me
The mark is upon me, and the mark of Cain brings fear

I was tired, so tired of runnin'
I had to turn and look around
I saw eyes that looked right through me
And a voice that made no sound
My body froze and I stood and stared, unearthly face before me
From the depths of a hooded nightmare, I saw what could not be
Mysteries and mayhem from the pinnacle I see
There's no answer when there's no question
The mark of Cain bears hard on me
",Mysteries and Mayhem,1975
Kansas,"I've so much to say, and yet I cannot speak
Come and do my bidding now for I have grown too weak
My weary eyes have seen all that life can give
Come to me, O young one, for you I can forgive

I stood where no man goes, and conquered demon foes
With glory and passion no longer in fashion
The hero breaks his blade

Cast this shadow long that I may hide my face
And in this cloak of darkness the world I will embrace
In all that I endure, of one thing I am sure
Knowledge and reason change like the season
A jester's promenade

Lying at my feet I see the offering you bring
The mark of Cain is on our faces, borne of suffering
O, I long to see you say it's not been wrong
I stand before you now, a riddle in my song
The answer is that sweet refrain
Unheard it always will remain
Beyond our reach, beyond our gain

Trapped in life's parade, a king without a crown
In this joy of madness, my smile might seem a frown
With talons wrought of steel, I tore the heart of doom
And in one gleaming moment I saw beyond the tomb
I stood where no man goes, above the din I rose
Life is amusing though we are losing
Drowned in tears of awe.
",The Pinnacle,1975
Kansas,"Well I been drinkin' again
And I know it's a sin
But I just can't refuse an old friend

And I been two times around

I'm not made for the time
I'm born in the wrong century
There's too much craziness here
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyes

Now this old world is a fright
You know my future ain't bright
And I'd just crawl in a hole if I could
Or maybe live out in space
Or some other far away place
And not come back to this earth till it's good
Oh but I'm dreaming again
I know that I'm here till the end
There's too much craziness here
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyes

Well you might think that I'm all wrong
The things I say in this song
I really wish I could see it your way
Cause there's a storm rollin' in
And it just might be the end
So I'm praying we'll all get away
Now my cup is running dry
The weight of the world gets me down
There's too much craziness here
In twenty-five years I have used all the tears in my eyes

There's nowhere to turn
So I'll just have to learn not to cry, no more

I will comfort you, take your hand and see you through 
I will take you through the door 

Who do you think you are

Though you're weary and afraid 
Still you try to flee my blade 
Come and walk in my new land 
If you'll only take my hand

Kansas,"On a winter's night, stars are cold and bright in the sky,
The slumber of the earth is pure and deep
From a distant wood, drifts the echo of a beast
The old man stirs and wakens in the night
He stands before his window gazing at the grave
Forgotten dreams are flashing through his weary mind
And though his life is empty, he pretends that she's still there

With hunger in his soul, he yearns for life and love gone by,
With memories his one and only joy
All he has to give, he would give to bring back the life,
And raise the one who lies beneath the snow
He lights a lamp and looks at pictures of the past
The faces of their youth still glow with new-found love,
But the picture's faded, and time has stolen youth away

With a spoken word that he thought he heard from her lips,
He felt another presence in the room,
He was filled with fear but filled with joy he arose
And turned to face the image that he knew
She stood before him and her hand reached out for his
A peaceful light shone in her eyes
She said she'd come to soothe him, and someday they'd be as one

She began to fade and her image disappeared,
So he was left alone to face the night,
Never in his life, had he been so held in awe,
As he faced the apparition of his wife
He stood before the window gazing at the grave,
And with a lightened heart he saw the first of dawn,
He knew that she was waiting, that someday they'd be as one",Lamplight Symphony,1975
Kansas,"From the mountains to the sun, life has only just begun
We wed this land and pledge our souls to meet its end
Life has only just begun

Where the dust of all our horses hides the sun
We are mighty on the earth, on the earth

You have come to move me, take me from my ancient home
Land of my fathers I can't leave you now
We will share it with you, no man owns this earth we're on
Now the wheels are rolling, hear the howling winds of war
It's my destiny to fight and die
Is there no solution, can we find no other way, Lord let me stay
Under the endless sky and the earth below
Here I was born to live and I will never go, oh no

But we cannot endure like the earth and the mountains
Life is not ours to keep, for a new sun is rising

Tell me some crazy stories, let me know who runs this show
Glassy-eyed and laughing, he turns and walks away
Tell me what made you that way

Here I am just waiting for a sign
Asking questions, learning all the time

It's just love, and miracles out of nowhere

",What's on My Mind,1976
Kansas,"Once carried through the current, and being swept away
The king is in his closet, he's hiding from today
And though he owns all fortunes, this room is where he'll stay
And his world is filled with darkness, turning grey

Gazing out the window of the forty-second floor
He is separate from all others, no one knocks upon his door
And it might as well be raining, 'cause the sunlight hurts his eyes
And his ears will never hear the children's cries

Once proud and full of passion, he fought the cause of man
Many people loved his courage, many followed his command
He changed the old into the new, and the course of things to come
And then one day they noticed he was gone

At first it didn't matter, nobody seemed to care
They all became too busy to find him anywhere
But no one knew not even him, the problems he would find
On the day he journeyed deep into his mind

I close my eyes, I go far away
Away from this battlefield
In my dreams, well
Here I will enjoy it
Where innocence plays with all
The laughing children
The kind who are crying right now

A taste of freedom from the pain
Of everything here I see
Life is sweet but I took it all for granted
And now I don't know if I could even tell you
Just what we permit, we allow

Allow me to forget the life I've made my own
I've held this nation in my hand, and yet it's not my home
Oh, allow me just one answer, and one reason why
Why this refugee of the family of man must die
Tell me why

Daydreams filled his nighttimes, and night-dreams filled his days
Confusion and uncertainty, a puzzled mind of haze
You thought he was so powerful, and set upon his ways
Well he left us all to follow through this maze

I heard the king was dying, I heard the king was dead
And with him died the chronicles that no one ever read

Kansas,"It's a strange aberration, this brainstorm of youth
Though it's lost in translation from fancy to truth
It's hopelessly human, both inside and out
A joyous occasion, there's no reason to doubt
It's easy somehow, what once was elusive
Is calling me now

I am waiting, I am patiently
Doing nothing, in a reverie
Climbing higher, seeing everything
Interacting, slowly spiralling
I am giving, while I'm watching the
Life I'm living, precious energy
Escalating, what was once just a game
It's never the same, no one's to blame

It's a strange situation, there's no cause for alarm
All these hot licks and rhetoric, surely do you no harm
They're hopelessly human, both inside and out
A joyous occasion, there's no reason to doubt
When each word is read, would you know the difference
If nothing was said?

All is rythm, all is unity
I am laughing, as it's meant to be
Just amusing, I am using the
Word was given, making harmony
Moving slowly, dancing aimlessly
Endless circle, turning fearlessly
Resurrected, falling down again

Is it for real this time?
",Hopelessly Human,1977
Kansas,"Can you see me, know my position
How quick is your eye?
I have no home, no reason to roam 
Yet I travel the length of the sky
I stretch my fingers jagged icy white
'Til my energy's all around
My clutch is swift, my force is fearful
I convey it without a sound
I live to free the skies from everyone
Watch me run - watch me

The north wind rises, old man's eyes wondering
Deeply as he locks his door
He knows the fear when I'm too near him, he's seen me angry before
The black intruding clouds approach as I release a desructive blow
All the crashing, all the flashing light brings terror upon my foe
I fight with force and power for my land
I command the lightning's hand!

Run for cover - oh your life is in vain if you try to escape me
Don't look back - oh your wealthy world cannot save you
'Cause I'm gonna break you

I came for nothing, they have gone
And nobody's home

I came to learn, perhaps to teach
But I can tell somehow
The world that I was sent to reach
Has got no future now

Across the galaxy to spread the word
And no one heard
I came for nothing, I'm alone
And nobody's home

Strange desire, seems there's nothing else for me to find

Seems like I've been everywhere before
I've seen it all a hundred times
Still I think there surely must be more

I've been livin', I had to take my time and change my style
Now I wonder is something gonna make it all worthwhile
I know there's more than meets the eye
I'd like to see it 'fore I die for sure
Something tells me it's all right, 
Only one step closer to the door

There ain't no feelin', feels the same as findin' out the key
Now I'm reelin', thinking of the things that I might see

All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away, and all your money won't another minute buy

How my soul cries out for you
To many places we once knew
To many faces, still no clue
How my soul cries out for you
I didn't think I needed you when I got out on my own
Dead set on having my way I was convinced that
I was right and you were wrong
Then I started thinkin' to myself
Well maybe what they say is true
How could we get so turned around when you needed me
As much as I needed you...
I tried to get you on the phone
No one answered, no one answered at home
I heard that you thought we were through
Somethin' I had, somethin' I had to do and
How my soul cries for you
How my soul cries out for you
It cries for love that we once knew
How my soul cries out for you",How My Soul Cries Out for You,1979
Kansas,"So long, someone is waiting
I got places to go, I got things to see
No more procrastinating
For this is the moment that was meant for me
And I'm moving like a wave on the ocean
Drifting to the opposite ride
Traveling with no destination
Just riding the tide

People they say that I'm foolish
They say that I'm living in a fantasy
I say, everything's easy
It's better than living in futility
So, I'm standing here in back of the curtain
Waiting for the start of the show
Acting like an actor is easy
If you can let go

Someday something will find you
A magical feeling you could not foresee
A feeling so devastating
From that moment on your life's a comedy
And suddenly you're light as a feather
You're falling like a leaf from a tree
The things you thought you needed are fading
Your reason to be
",Reason to Be,1979
Kansas,"Used to think about what I would grow up to be
Good or bad, right or wrong, it was no harm to me
Was a time in my life when I wish I'd have known
You can't gamble with fate, you might end up alone

[Chorus]
Meet me where the feeling is high, let the sound surround you
Meet me at the top of the sky, where the colors fly around you
Well, I'm lost in a world of dismay
But nothin' can take me away from you

Left you back while I worked very hard to succeed
All the distance I've gone makes it hard to believe
You and I were so close, now we're so far apart
And I remember the feeling we shared in our heart

[Chorus]

Again and again you return to haunt me in my dreams
See your eyes, how they glisten, your hair how it gleams
And I know I will miss you when you have to go
I return to my place until nights lets me know

[Chorus]",Stay Out of Trouble,1979
Kansas,"I still believe in what you say
I still believe that it could work ok
But love is just another game you play
You'll never change your mind
You exist so free and clear
Let no one touch you let no one near
I think you're just someone afraid of fear
Or what you just might find
I can see them all lining up outside your front door
Filthy minds and terrible habits are interesting

[Chorus]
Sure
O but look at me now if I've changed tell me how
O I'd do anything for you

I'm sick of fighting but I need you so
You tell me lies but I can't let go
I want to take you out but you say no
Think you're ashamed of me
You give me headaches o you got your gall
If it weren't for me you wouldn't have nuttin' at all
I fell for you 'caus you were nice and tall
I liked what I could see
I could be the keeper of fortunes if I was inclined
Let me know that you're standing beside me I'll give them a sign
O but

Kansas,"As I look out in the night
And count the stars all shining bright
I wonder where I am and where I'm going
Sometimes I think I've lived before
I seem to see beyond a door
But it's just a crazy notion I leave showing
I live my life as sensitive as possible then one day
Maybe I'll wake up young again
With feelings of a new day
But what we feel I know we'll, miss
And someday I'll look back at this
And know by then the life that we were meant for, but are you leaving
Leaving my back door

You want the world to give you some
You fight a war that's never won and you
Come back scarred 'cause you've seen who's really dying
You reach a point where nothing lasts
You play a part that someone casts you into
Now their machines keep right on lying
I want the world to be a place where no one comes to suffer
Just give the pain an empty place
Away from one another

'cause someday we'll look back at this
We'll know by then the life that we were meant for, but are you leaving

Kansas,"The streets of the city are barren
All the windows and doors have been closed
As the night draws near
You can feel their fear
Their freedom is just an illusion
And they tell us that love is a lie
Can it all be true
What can one man do

[Chorus]
See the pages as they turn
Never will the children learn
Born as a prisoner in a curtain of iron
Never will the pages turn

The City of Gold's in the distance
And they've already forgotten their dream
Visions slowly fade
In this land of shade

[Chorus]

As the power grows, darkness spreading
Hope is still alive, though we're dreading
What the future holds, no more need to
Fear what all men face
Only good can win the race

Rumors speak of war, all the nations
Turmoil in the streets, tribulations
Now it's plain to see
All the prophecies are taking place
Only good can win the race

There are fragments of truth still remaining
And they bring them the light of the world
To this hope we cling
Till the bells will ring

See the pages as they turn
In their wisdom we will learn
Our bloody history soon will resolve
See the pages as they turn
In their wisdom we will learn

Kansas,"Who sees you when you're sleeping?
Who knows the thoughts you're keeping?

You're reaching out your hand 'cause someone's calling.
Don't open your eyes too soon, 'cause it might be me.

The darkened sidestreets that you've taken.
Faces all around say you're forsaken.
You see yourself and someone else behind you.
Don't open your eyes too soon, it might not be me.

Haunted by my broken dreams.
Haunted by my empty screams.

Once in a while it makes it all worthwhile if I can sing this song

Got to rock on I can't be this way
I'm hanging around but wait till music's in season
That's when I'm high that is how I play
And I do it the best that's all I need for a reason

Can't think straight can't think at all staring out the window

Kansas,"Centuries of backward ways, have many left behind us
Who can count the good men gone away
The fruits of all our labors have left us as we started
We've come too far to end it in a day
It seems that everything we do is wrong
A one way trip to nowhere all along
Just look around and tell me what you see
Another stupid page of history

No one together, No one is touching ground
Look at each other, Chaos is all around
Same situation, Nothing is really new
No one together, No one is me and you

Lo the horn of plenty is bursting at the seam
The harvest of the world will be our prize
We claim to know the secrets, the answers have been found
But how can one fool make another wise
'Cause nothing's better than it used to be
To live and die is still a mystery
We take away and we give nothing back
We just consume it all and still we lack

No one together, No one is touching ground
Look at each other, Chaos is all around
Same situation, Nothing is really new
No one together, No one is me and you

Each day passed by so quickly now
You can feel it drawing much closer now
The signs are in the faces of the people in the street
The signs are in the sound I hear
The voices filled with hate and fear
You can feel it drawing near you now

The multitudes are searching, and wandering in vain
For what they seek cannot be found in men
The truth that lies before us now is plain for all to see
To grow without is not to grow within
For in the promise is a victory
To see the way that everything should be
To feel the joy that we were meant to know
We should have realized so long ago

We're all together, Harmony will abound'

I lived for her night and day
But all of her friends said since I wasn't wealthy
There'd be no room for a stranger today

I played the game and I spent all my money
I went out and tore up this town
If I had any guts and a little more whiskey
I would burn that woman down

With memories his one and only joy

And raise the one who lies beneath the snow
He lights a lamp and looks at pictures of the past
The faces of their youth still glow with new-found love,
But the picture's faded, and time has stolen youth away

With a spoken word that he thought he heard from her lips,
He felt another presence in the room,
He was filled with fear but filled with joy he arose
And turned to face the image that he knew
She stood before him and her hand reached out for his
A peaceful light shone in her eyes
She said she'd come to soothe him, and someday they'd be as one

She began to fade and her image disappeared,
So he was left alone to face the night,
Never in his life, had he been so held in awe,
As he faced the apparition of his wife

And with a lightened heart he saw the first of dawn,
He knew that she was waiting, that someday they'd be as one",Lonely Street [*],1992

To back up the things you say

Seal no fate and hold no key
When all goes well spend some time remembering
Know by now that times have changed
But we feel each day can be deeper deeper

It might be raining now
But don't be scared you won't drown
I'll hold you in my arms when the rivers rise
Lay my heart besides your soul
Don't let the tears blur the vision in your eyes

Once my eyes get used to the dark
I look around it's almost like I'm dreaming
Shooting stars how they seem so close
I feel your body it's moving breathing

The Sky Is Falling

The lottery winner thinks forever
Is something she can buy
All the pictures on the wall
Are hanging high so they won't fall
Until her tear stained floor is dry

The pool shark's life is stranger than fiction
But today's his lucky day
He bets it all on a final game
But then he chokes ain't that a shame
The 8 ball had one last thing to say

Just stop the sky from falling
Falling down on me
Stray cats are creepy calling
Hound dog harmony
Just stop the sky from falling
Dodge the buck shot rain
This tree house free for all
The sky is falling
Who's got a crane

Jazz singer padlocks all his memories
Long nights have left their mark
His lava lamp condition
His black light intuition
How come tomorrow seams so dark?

Sunlit valley, mountain fields, unseen in the rain, here all life abounds

Painted desert, sequined sky, stars that fill the night, here all life abounds
Rivers flowing to the sea, sunshine pure and bright, here all life abounds
No man rules this land, no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in earth's delights

So the maiden lies in waiting for the sails to reach the shore
Land of beauty and abundance, innocent, you opened wide your door
Wanderers found the waiting treasure, full of gifts beyond their measure
Milk and honey for our pleasure

Across the sea there came a multitude, sailing ships upon the wave
Filled with visions of Utopia and the freedom that they crave
Ravage, plunder, see no wonder, rape and kill and tear asunder
Chop the forest, plow it under

Borne on wings of steel, I have so much to feel
And I won't come down no more

Sail on, sail on
I will rise each day to meet the dawn
So high, so high

I've climbed the mountains of the sky
Without my wings, you know, I'd surely die

I sing this song a hundred, maybe a thousand years ago
No one ever listens, I just play and then I go
Off into the sunset like the western heroes do

Tell me what you're gonna do?

Here I am, I'm sure to see a sign
All my life I knew that it was mine
It's always here, it's always there
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
It's just love and miracles out of nowhere
Out of nowhere, out of nowhere

Kansas,"I close my eyes, only for a moment, and the moment's gone
All my dreams pass before my eyes, a curiosity
Dust in the wind
All they are is dust in the wind

Same old song, just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do crumbles to the ground though we refuse to see
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Oh, ho, ho

Now, don't hang on, nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
And all your money won't another minute buy
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind
Everything is dust in the wind

They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in

I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue

Going in a big way for sweet little you

She must be someone who's all alone now.
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah.

I want a little girl, but she may not look
Just like a picture in a story book.
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T.

And she don't have to wave her hair
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care.
She don't wear nylon hose, oh.

Oh, what I'd give for that wonderful phrase
To hear those three little words
That's all I'd live for the rest of my days

No other words can tell it half so clearly

Which simply mean I love you",Three Little Words [Take 2],1997

But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!

And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""

And the water gonna come in, have no place to stay

Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan (2x)

If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break (2x)
And all these people have no place to stay

Now look here mama what am I to do (2x)
I ain't got nobody to tell my troubles to

I works on the levee mama both night and day (2x)
I ain't got nobody, keep the water away

Oh cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do no good (2x)
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to lose

I works on the levee, mama both night and day (2x)
I works so hard, to keep the water away

I had a woman, she wouldn't do for me (2x)

Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

Whenever the dark comes, I feel hazy
Blurry eye with the perfect vision
I hear the bells are ringing
Calling me out cause they need someone who's ready

I hear the nightcall, I hear the nightcall
I hear the nightcall, I hear the nightcall

I'm drawn like a moth to a flame
Can't hide in the light of the day
I know I hear the beep from you call my name
How about you and me go and make some mistakes?

Tomorrow's on the horizon
But you caught my eyes
And now time's flying
The moon lights up the sky
And we are just aside, the dawn is night

I hear the nightcall, I hear the nightcall
I hear the nightcall, I hear the nightcall

The streets are empty and I'm restless
How come nobody else can see this?
Oh the way I feel it
Only for you the way I'm feeling

Kante,"In the wee hours of the morning
When everything is still
I lay staring at the darkness
Trying to find the will
Only to be plagues 
By roaches, scorpions and mice
Not to mention politics
That's a big cockatrice

The light became morning
The morning became day
Speaking for myself
I wish the darkness had stayed

The morning become evening
The sun is going down 
But equality and justice 
Is nowhere to be found
Of all this place
I've had my fill
Even in the wee hours of the morning
When everything is still",Best of Both Worlds,2001
Kante,"Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Meistens keine ganzen Sätze
Einzelne Worte oder Fetzen
Die ich kaum verstehen kann
Manchmal verdrehst du deine Augen
Unter den verschlossenen Lidern
Machst eine Geste dann und wann
Die ich nicht erwidern kann
Was sich aus deinen Träumen
In unserer beide Tage trägt
Hat keinen Ort in der Erinnerung
Nur ein stiller Schmerz
Bleibt zurück in deinem Herz
Im ersten Licht des Morgens

Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Von noch nie betretenen Orten
Mit noch unverwandten Worten
In mir unbekannten Sprachen
Wenn wir bei Tageslicht aufwachen
Und bevor wir ganz aufsteh'n
Redest du manchmal von Sachen
Von denen ich nicht viel versteh'
Nur ein stiller Schmerz bleibt
Zurück in meinem Herz

Wir reden manchmal wie im Schlaf
Von noch nie betret'nen Orten
Von einer Zeit in ferner Zukunft
In einer Sprache deren Worte
Wir noch lange kaum beherrschen
Der wir uns blindlings anvertrauen
Gegen die Regeln der Vernunft
Reden wir manchmal wie im Traum
Was sich aus unseren Träumen
In jeden unserer Tage trägt
Hat keinen Ort in der Erinnerung
Nur ein stiller Schmerz
Bleibt zurück in unser'm Herz
Im ersten Licht des Morgens

Manchmal redest du im Schlaf
Von noch nie betret'nen Orten
Mit noch unverwandten Worten
In mir unbekannten Sprachen
Wenn wir bei Tageslicht aufwachen
Und du vor mir ganz aufstehst
Redest du manchmal von Sachen
Von denen ich nicht viel versteh'",Im Ersten Licht,2001
