Nile Rodgers,"Você mandou bem, cuidou de mim, foi forte sim
Me fez entender, o lado bom, o bom do amor
O que aconteceu, ficou no ar, eu vou juntar
Meu nome com o teu hã hã

Você chegou que nem água pra sede
Me desejou e foi tudo de vez
É novidade que tal passar bem
E no final é só eu e você

Eu tô pensando agora, a gente no futuro
Chamando toda hora, e caminhando juntos
Eu tô pensando agora, a gente no futuro
Chamando toda hora, e caminhando juntos

Você mandou bem, cuidou de mim, foi forte sim
Me fez entender, o lado bom, o bom do amor
O que aconteceu, ficou no ar, eu vou juntar

One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so borin', filled with out-of-towners tourin'
I knew that it wasn't my thing

I really wasn't carin' but I felt my eyes starin'
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen

Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit as a man he is complete
My creme de la creme, please take me home

He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Ooo, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seemed
Her happiness she lost
A broken tight-knit bond
Abandoning her trust
And now daddy's not around

Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when you think love's gone
You still carry on

When she turns sweet sixteen
Her boyfriend called her his queen
A stimulating kiss, that felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another caress
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness

Oh, girl, you're a queen

And when you think love's gone
You still carry on (keep on comin')

And when you think love's gone

Whose husband called her queen
And she believed her life
Was perfect as can be
And when a surprise divorce came down
She rebounded and achieved
The mirror now reveals
What she can finally see

Nils Landgren,"Half past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the phone
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with that fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight

Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me

First I say yes, then I tell her why.

Early in the morning I feel the sun
True love is sad if it's the only one
She looks good and it hurts my head
Sometimes I think I'd feel better dead
Cryin' moon tears,
I'm cryin' moon tears,
Cryin' moon tears,
I'm cryin' moon tears, yeah.

Come on

Listen

Everyone is tryin' to love the one I love
I don't think they really understand love
It's easy to fall and harder to part
No matter where it is it comes from the heart.

All the love and hate that's floatin' around
All the times I felt so lost and helpless
You stood by me, you never let me down
Still I keep throwin' up these walls
Most of them I've built with stones
You tear 'em down and bridge the distance
Knowin' we ain't here to be alone
So let your blue heart open wide
Let's never leave our dreams behind
It would comfort and restore my pride
If you let me be your valentine

When I say love's unreal
Even though incomplete

So I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so

They know not if it's dark outside or light

It's got a lot of songs to sing

Nils Lofgren,"You used to leave your scent
On his whiskey soaked collar 
You both would paint the town
Drink up his very last dollar 
And then you loved him for fun 
And rode away when it was done 
Now he's confused and I know why
Ain't that mud in your eye

Ain't like rain  
Remember lively little Richard.  
But his men were painting town  
You were in need of attention  
So he thought he'd take you on down 
And there you first saw me  
And realized you were no longer free  
'Cause true love good girls can't deny 
It comes and goes like mud in you're eye.  

Sometimes a victim can run
But not when both have been 'von
And I ain't no stranger
I built you up to shoot you down

Once you could thrill me
Now I'm the jury
And you'll be a cinch to convict
Your boy's gonna make the great escape

While your laid bare on the ground
This vengeance had to and in crime
I built you up and shoot you down

Dreams die hard
When they don't come true
Dreams die hard
And there's nothing you can do

Dreams die hard
When they take your pride

You don't even cross my mind
I think maybe it's finally true
Gonna leave the past behind

Then I see someone who looks like you
From a window on the street
I know it's not really you

Nils Lofgren,"A bowie knife, a woolen coat, a grip bag on my arm
It's all somebody needs to make it through the land
Walk the night, travel light, cross the Rio Grandee
Someone strums a mandolin, soft gulf breezes blow
My new life is waiting in old Mexico

I was once a married man livin' peacefully
Hard to say exactly when the devil blinded me
But there was some confusion when my sweet wife left this world
Darker times, drunken crimes, a dead young working girl
Left a jailer there in Caroline, watching me from down below
My new life is waiting in old Mexico

Livin' in the shadows
Runnin' from my fame
Blowin' where the wind blows
Where no one knows my name

In the El Vaquero Bar in the town of Eagle Pass
Moments from my freedom warm whiskey in my glass
Some Borracho took me for the man who stole his wife
He went for his forty-four as I reached for my knife
He never fired a second shot, he was just too slow
My new life is waiting in old Mexico

I hear of hidden harbors south of Mazatlan
Where cool spring mountain waters meet the warm Pacific sun
I pray the miles I've traveled and all the sins I bear
Burn away like mornin' fog and vanish in the air
Miles beyond the border now, but many miles to go
My new life is waiting in old Mexico

A bowie knife, a woolen coat, a grip bag on my arm
It's all somebody needs to make it through the land",New Holes in Old Shoes,1997

Du sitzst heulend daheim, suchst Stress auf Flex per SMS, doch bereust es dann gleich
Denn auch zur heutigen Zeit werden Fäuste verteilt
Dann gibt es kein „Tut mir Leid"" und „Ich hab's anders gemeint""
Nein, zeig mir deine Freunde und ich sag dir wer du bist
Aber zeigst du mir dein Arsch, dann is' mir klar du bist 'ne Bitch

Nina,"Wenn sich das Niveau hebt, und es endlich los geht
Guckt ihr, als wenn ihr alle hinterm Mond lebt
Spürt ihr den Flow, die Show geht jetzt los
Rapps kommen gross, es ist allen Recht so
Fette Beats kommen in dein Ohr wie Q-Tips
Klingt gut nech komm näher damit du Schub kriegst
Meine Crew frisst Mics zum Mittag wie Schnittlauch
Sogar wenn ich nüchtern bin kling ich, als wenn ich shit rauch
Wenn ihr Hits braucht, müsst ihr nicht ABBA hören
Denn hier kommen krasse Gören, die Mics wie Tabak burnen
Dieser Beat schlägt das Trommelfell windelweich
Denn wir lieben den Scheiß wie kleine Kinder Klingelstreich

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Wenn ihr das spielt, werden meine Beine weich
Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib uns mehr von dem heißen Scheiß
Denn wir kriegen nicht genug von diesen Deichkind-Style

Check mal den aus, die Gören sind am Start, ja
Ohne Fahrplan, weil wir sowieso schon da waren
Spitzt jetzt die Ohren, die Kids kommen groß raus
Weil wir bei Showdown sind sag ich dir Prost drauf
Wenn ich los lauf, sieht es für dich doof aus (Wort drauf)
Beats machen uns Höher als auf'm Hochhaus
Ich bin so drauf, weil in diesen Kreis pass ich rein
Also nick bitte, Digger, falls du weißt, was ich mein

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß

Jungs mit woop Style, schüttelt die Köpfe
Mädels mit Hot-Tops schüttelt die Zöpfe
Vier Nordlichter geben sich hier heute die Ehre
Also werft eure Hände in die Atmosphäre.
Denn das hier mutiert garantiert zum Dauerbrenner
Drei Deichkind Sänger, mit Nina auf einem Nenner
Brennen wir länger, 1 für Liebhaber, 2 für Kenner
Einmal drin, kriegst du nich genug wie Cliffhanger
Heut zerhack ich mein Blatt, als wär ich Wasser blass
Dies Deichkind, dies ist der Anlass
Also was Junge, was Mädel, gebt Gas
Es ist zu krass, denk du, schwing was du hast zum Bass

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch
Wenn das Deichkind am Mic ist bon Voyage
Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß

Seht euch vor, denn hier kommt der Frechdachs
Die Beats treiben, wie Cowboys Rinder in Texas
(Check das) Ich klecker mit Worten, so wie ein Dreckspatz
Und sage (Piep, Piep) Guten Appetit, wie schmeckt das?
Wenn ich traditionsbewusst, das Mikrofon benutz
Kommt ihr nicht mehr runter, wie Junkies bei Drogensucht
Weil der Scheiß nach oben muss, wie Piloten in Jumbojets
Machen wir im Punkto Raps die Tracks rund und fett
Ihr kennt das, also warum guckt ihr so verdutzt
Und tanzt so heftig, dass ihr mit euren Füßen den Boden schrubbt
Macht den Walkman an, wir füttern die Stöpsel
Also nickt jetzt mit dem Beat und schüttelt die Köpfe

Nicke mit dem Beat und beweg dein Arsch

Bitte gib mir mehr von dem heißen Scheiß

Nina,"Man, take another hit breathe out
In a zone blowing smoke out a glass teapot
I?m chillin at home on some solo shit
I love piece and when its quiet, I don?t want no bitch
I don?t want to look at lifetime, I?m fine with fuse
Fuck entertainment weekly bitch, find some news
I like Keyshia but I need some blues
Steady hollering about some time
Bitch I need some Room
Don?t get me wrong ya?ll I love females
That come around but after while, I need some self
I know I?m selfish at times but bottom line, move around if that ain?t how you get down
Plus my album coming out real soon, I?m in the studio daily tryna write these tunes
And for you to stress a nigga like I?m running these hoes is outta line
Goodbye to your life, pack up your clothes and go

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go

I?m about to hit some spots with my guys from outta town
And there you go making those mean old eyes
Feel like I?m in prison sometimes
Like my freedom is gone like I?ve committed a crime and that?s some bullshit
You watch a nigga like I?m 6 years old, how the fuck you think this shit gon? grow
I?ma tell you how this shit gon? go
I?ma hop off in this clean ass triple silver Porsche Turbo and hit the road and Go
You run a nigga blood pressure up from that spite shit 
And normally I don?t fuck with that type bitch
But she got a nigga feeling her though
Text messaging my phone I feel like killing this ho
But before I let her get on my row
I?ma hand the bitch her walking papers letting her go and hit the door
But yo, I ain?t never seen a UFO 
And I ain?t never seen a ho that?s more important that dough 
So Go

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave
Now where do I Go

I?m rolling late night with my buzz on
Leaving out a strip club and wanting my fuck on
I?m strolling through a list of my missed calls
And right up out the blue man this bitch calls
You coming over here (woman?s voice)
I?m like shit naw
So to question that decision she eats up a dick raw
But man, I?d rather go to bed with a hard dick 
Than to have to spend the whole night fucking and arguing
This bitch a lunatic, fuck a nigga high off
I wish it was I way I could hit and just drive off
But that?s not happening
So I?ma lay my ass down, watching girl?s gone wild penis in my hand
Hardest times and I don?t wanna sell out
Still I?m putting on my flip-flops to bail out
I grab my keys off the table and coat
It?s an open invitation for a nigga to score, so I go!

[Hook sung by Nina]
All I ever wanted was for him to see
Was that I was all the woman he would ever need
I?ve given all of me so unselfishly
And now he?s at the door telling me to leave

Never could find no one that I dreamed of
I must've been too blind to see
That you were always there waiting for me

But then the spell was broken, my eyes opened
Starting believing in love again
Just when I gave up on miracles
You rescued me and showed me the way

You must be an angel
Feels like I've gone to heaven
And it keeps on getting better baby
Caught up in your love spell
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

Never thought I'd see the day
A special guy like you would come my way
I wish I knew the reasons why
You gave me the strength for one more try

How could love at first sight work out so right
I can't believe this is paradise
Just when I thought love would never come
You came to me swept me away

You must be an angel
Feels like I've gone to heaven
And it keeps on getting better baby
Caught up in your love spell
Feels like I'm in heaven, heaven

Suddenly my whole world changes
I found the kind of love that I've been thinking of
I know that dreams come true
'Coz my heaven is waiting to take me
Take me when I'm with you

Tears won't wash away the hurt 
Runnin from it doesn't work 
Cause love changes everything, 
Everything, everything' Everything

I may never get to hold you 
Goodnight

Nina,"You know the things I said to you
Not for a minute did I ever mean it
I could see it in your eyes
The hurt and the surprise oh boy
Somehow the words just got away
Don't think I never tried to stop them no
I had to watch you turn around 
Walk away without a sound
Tell me baby

[Chorus:]
What if I took it back
What if you would forgive me
I would do anything
To undo what I did last night
What if I could turn back time
Back when you would believe me
Would you help me instead 
To unsay what I said last night
What if wrong could turn ro right
We're not meant to be this way
We're not supposed to share 
Our destiny like this
All the plans that we have made
Can't let them fade away, fade away

There's nothing I wouldn't do
To get you back in my life

When you're near it wraps me up
Now I find the space to feel thrill
Like the water it fills me with peace

When you near me again I still breathe within
And now that you're at my side
Your soul in mine
But I long for your touch
It's hurting so much

You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste,ah-ah
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay

My head on your shoulder and pray
What else can I do?
Cause all I want is more and more
Colored kisses from you

Yellow is the sun that shines on me
Like your smile it sets me free
Seasons change to blacken my mood
When I falter my heart goes astray
I remember the nights when you'd take me away
Because when I'm at your side
I'm safe and warm but I'm never alone
My heart is your home

You give me, give me colored kisses
Colored kisses for my lips to taste,ah-ah
You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay
My head on your shoulder and pray
And that no one can take me from you
And no one can break us in two
So lift it up in the clouds set me free
And let your rainbow all out shine on me

Come back... come back... come back

You lead me, lead me to an oasis
An oasis where I can lay

And man will live forevermore,
Because of Christmas day. 
Trumpets sound and angels sing,
Listen to what they say,
That man will live forevermore,
Because of Christmas day.
Hark, now hear the angels sing,
A newborn King today,
And man will live forevermore,

They saw a bright new shining star,
They heard a choir sing a song,
The music seemed to come from afar,
Now, Joseph and his wife, Mary,
Come to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to bear her child,
Not a single room was in sight.

In a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark,

So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

And mail it right away

And suddenly you're out of here

Gone from mystery into mystery
Gone from daylight into light
Another step deeper
Into darkness
Closer to the light

Walked outside
Summer moon was nearly down
Mist on the fields
Holy stillness all around
Death's no stranger
No stranger than the life I've seen
Still I cried
Still I begged to get you back again

Gone from mystery into mystery
Gone from daylight into light
Another step deeper
Into darkness

Nina Gerber,"Though Adam was a friend of mine, 
I did not know him well 
He was alone into his distance 
He was deep into his well 
I could guess what he was laughing at, 
But I couldn't really tell 
Now the story's told that Adam jumped, 
But I've been thinking that he fell 

Together we went traveling, 
As we received the call 
His destination India, 
And I had none at all 
Well, I still remember laughing 
With our backs against the wall 
So free of fear, we never thought 
That one of us might fall 

I sit before my only candle, 
But it's so little light to find my way 
Now this story unfolds before my candle 
Which is shorter every hour 
As it reaches for the day 
But I feel just like a candle in the way 
I guess I'll get there, but 
I wouldn't say for sure 

When we parted we were laughing still, 
As our goodbyes were said 
And I never heard from him again 
As each our lives we led 
Except for once in someone else's 
Letter that I read 
Until I heard the sudden word 
That a friend of mine was dead 

I sit before my only candle, 
Like a pilgrim sits beside the way 
Now this journey appears before my candle 
As a song that's growing fainter 
The harder that I play 
But I fear before I end I'll fade away 
But I guess I'll get there, 
Though I wouldn't say for sure 

Though Adam was a friend of mine, 
I did not know him long 
And when I stood myself beside him, 
I never though I was as strong 
Still it seems he stopped his singing 
In the middle of his song 
Well I'm not the one to say I know, 
But I'm hoping he was wrong 

I'm holding out my only candle, 
Though it's so little light to find my way 
Now this story's been laid beneath my candle 
And it's shorter every hour 
As it reaches for the day 
Yes, I feel just like a candle in the way 
I hope I'll get there, 
But I never pray",Song for Adam,2007
Nina Gerber,"Well I've been out walking 
I don't do that much talking these days 
These days,
These days I seem to think a lot 
About the things that I forgot to do 
For you 
And all the times I had the chance to 

And I had a lover 
It's so hard to risk another these days 
These days,
Now if I seem to be afraid 
To live the life I have made in song 
Well it's just that I've been losing so long 

I'll keep on moving 
Things are bound to be improving these days

These days I sit on corner stones 
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend 
Don't confront me with my failures 
I had not forgotten them",These Days,2007

I always wanted to ask you this:
Do you really know what love is?
Love is to help one another
To give and to share like a good mother
Now if you are Italian, English or German
Doesn't make a difference even if your name's Herman
You will find your counterpart

And across deserts of death
I've travelled from time to time
To find at last your velvet soft cushion of revelation
And with the softest touch of tenderness
I'm wearing your costume of graceful bliss
My wings of rainbows strive to paradise
Of ecstatic peace and holy love

There's more than enough at the fountain of joy
Where tears of love I cry
I'm getting bolder and bolder
I'm already leaning on your shoulder
Hey, it's no crap
But I want to sit on your lap

And I will keep on jumpin' gaily
From one pleasure blade to another
Until I rest on the save ground of your divine lingam

It's never gonna heal
I can be so good
Like a Goddess
Plus I'm modest - I
I have no fear
I will go all the way
I can show you how to pray
Because the world is:
So bad, so bad, so bad, so bad
So bad
Deadly chemo-therapy
So bad
The lies about H.I.V.
So bad
We've lost our last chance
So bad
And we're all dancing Shiva's dance
So bad
Genetic obsession
So bad
Misused atomic energy
So bad
Surprise, surprise, the culture industry
So bad
Helmut Kohl
(Bundeskanzler Kohl befürwortet diese Mission)
You can do no wrong
If you fight on my side
If you make that decision
Because the world is:
So bad
I.R.A. & R.A.F.
So bad
Are we really blind and deaf
So bad
The yugoslavian rape
So bad
And no-one can escape
So bad
The Nazi Lunacy
So bad
Artificial Extasy
So bad
I hate my T.V.

Nina Hagen,"Speak loudly of the holy Lord of Haidakhan.
Tell of God, the personification of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss.
Proclaim holy Lord Shiva with the Goddess Mother,
The Sustainer, Inspirer, and World Master.

Hail, hail to Lord Haidakhan,
Who incarnated for the liberation of the world.

Thou alone art my true divine Master,
Shiva invisible, unperceivable, highest God.

Your heart is very full of mercy,
One who surrenders to you is immediately liberated.

What pain in the world cannot be removed,
Instantly by your grace, O king of sages?

You always speak words which remove our fear.
Baba fulfills all desires.

Oh Lord, you are the source of auspiciousness, the remover of evil.
I sacrifice everything at your lotus feet.

Great Sage, you speak very sweetly, extremely benevolently,
Your sentences are the essence of knowledge.

The true eternal religion, full of generosity,
Tells of knowledge combined with holy work.

Each one's own duty is good for him,
Jealousy and hatred are not.
Truth, simplicity and love, brother,
This duty alone brings man happiness.

Meditate on the Lord's name, brother, to purify the heart.
Find the Lord sitting in your heart.

Holy Shiva is residing in your heart.
Find him there, leave ignorance and disappointment behind.
The great saint, an ocean of all qualities,
Whose beginning and end nobody knows.

Haidakhan is a wonderful place
Very holy giving joy and solace.
The roar of the Gautama Ganga is heard day and night,
Siddhas, gods and demons worship there every day.

Holy mount Kailash, so beautiful,
Looking at it, the mind yearns for it.
Under that mountain is a beautiful cave,
That great cave is described in the Vedas.

The wild animals wandering in the dense forest,
They forget all enmity among themselves.
Since the Lord started living here,
The ""Garden of the Heaven's"" beauty faded in comparison.

All glory to this holy place is ours,
Which Shiva enjoys as his living place.
Thy merciful look gives love of Thy holy feet.

By no other method can one get a pure mind.
Now Lord, show me grace in this way,
Let me renounce all and do meditation day and night.

Praise to Amba, mother of the universe.
All forms are one, Thou, mother goddess Amba",Omhaidakhandi,1994
Nina Hagen,"Junkies, whores and pimps
Devils around my bed
There is no choice and no difference
And no one seems to notice

Sometimes I feel like screaming
Sometimes I feel like I just can't win
Sometimes I feel like I was born
To die in your arm in Berlin

Intoxicated by the orchids
Abandoned in the garden
Demanding morphine for communion
Because my soul was burning

Sometimes I feel like screaming
Sometimes I feel like I just can't win
Sometimes I feel like I was born
To die in your arm in Berlin

Stranded in the sweet windings
Breathing the pale moon silver
Tasting the last drops of life
From a sweet transvestite's lips

Sometimes I feel like I was born

Nina Hagen,"Sunday morning, praise the dawning
It's just the restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you
Come, it's nothing at all

Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want you to know

Come, it's nothing at all

Nina Hagen,"Jetzt bist do weg, neben mir ein leerer Fleck
Auch ich bin leer und suchen hat keinen Zweck mehr
Denn da, wo früher Glück stand, hat der Schmerz sich breitgemacht
Ich war ... überrascht, fast schon böse über Nacht
Wie ein Feuer, daß entfacht hast do es über mich gebracht
Wir hatten beide diese Nacht, doch nun hör' ich dich sagen
Es ist aus und mein Herz zerbricht, ich steh' neben mir, ich glaub' es einfach nicht
Doch es ist war, do weichst meinen Blicken aus und will ich mit dir reden redest do dich raus
Und ich weiß, wenn ich dich anseh' kann ich nicht in dich reinsehen und ich muß einsehen
Do willst den Weg jetzt allein gehen und ich weiß kein Flehen hält dich davon ab
Und ich weiß nicht, ob ich dich je um was gebeten hab' doch hätt' ich einen Wunsch freijetzt und hier, würd' ich mir wünschen Baby do wärst bei mir.
Refrain
Do hast mein Herz geklaut,
Ich weiß nicht ob do's gewußt hast,
Do Schuft hast es getan,
Hab' Dich geliebt, als ob es kein Morgen gibt,
Bis der Morgen kam;
Ich seh' die Straße in der do wohnst, fahre durch die Stadtzu dem Laden, in dem wir uns getroffen haben und der Fadender Erinnerung schmerzt mit jedem Stich,die Wunden heilen nicht,große Mädchen weinen nicht,die andern scheinen nicht zu verstehen,daß wir jetzt eigne Wege gehensie Fragen mich nach dir, wenn sie mich sehen
Ich hatte dich schon vermißt, bevor ich wußte, daß Schluß ist
Für all die andern war das Ende fern wir warn ein Paardu warst mein Stern, ich war dein Star
Ich hatte dich mehr als gern, mir wurde nur zu spät klar,
Daß do anders geworden bist und dein Erfolg für uns zum Mißerfolg geworden ist
Den Himmel, den do mir versprachst hast do mir nie gegeben
Und deine wundervolle Welt blieb an dir kleben
Jetzt wart ich auf die Zeit die meine Wunden heilt,
Während mein Kopf und mein Herz bei die verweilt.
Refrain
Ich hab' es dir erlaubt, hab dir vertraut hab an uns geglaubt,es war nicht schwer, hast mir gesagt, daß deine Liebe ewig wär,
Hast mir mein Herz ausgeraubt, jetzt ist es leer
Es zerbrach und das größere Stück ist bei dir, doch do bist nicht hier
Ich hab' mich leergeliebt, es tut mir sehr weh,doch mich ohne dich zu spüren tut noch mehr weh
Ich mach' dir keinen Vorwurf daraus, daß Gefühle vergehen,ich weiß, wir konnten den Test der Zeit nicht bestehen
Doch es macht keinen Sinn, daß do daß Feld räumst,wenn do dich Nacht für Nacht in meine Welt träumst
Ich fühle mich tot, tief in mir drinund nur der Schmerz läßt mich wissen, daß ich am Leben bin
Und jetzt liege ich da verletzt und alles tut mir weh,
Dafür hass' ich dich jetzt, weil ich dich liebe

",Dear Rose,2000
Nina Nastasia,"I had a dream about a dog
I was walking in an amusement park
With people all around me

We rode the roller coaster rides
And he was laughing as we
Jumped to the sky
And I saw that I looked just like him

It's a dog's life
I want to lead a dog's life
Run to the woods, dig a hole
Just him and me

He showed me all the various scented treasures on the ground
There was a little girl, and she was scared of me, and I was scared of her
He let out a bark then she screamed
Dropped her chocolate ice cream
Suddenly this old man chased us 'til we jumped the fence

It's a dog's life
I want to lead a dog's life
Under the couch, chew a bone
Just him and me

He ran across the street and barely missed a speeding car
Suddenly this old man grabbed him from around the corner
I hid behind a big trash can, wondered â??What's become of him?â??
I tried to stay, but curiosity kills me",A Dog's Life,2000
Nina Nastasia,"Jimmy Rose owns a tattoo parlor
Three times a day
Cooks a spoon of powder
I wash the dishes piled in his tub
If I wait too long he may never stand up
Up

He lies awake on an empty canvas
And tilts his brush
Watching brilliance drip circles on the floor
And I lay his shirt on the bed
I fall inside picture frames
Breathing in his oil paints
He doesn't see me
He wanders in
His mouth looks thin
Like a child who stands there shaking
I can feel his anger choke me

Jimmy Rose works from twelve to five
To pay off the doctor that he prescribes
There's kerosene in the wishing well
And I throw a penny still holding on to his hand
And I watch him drift, close his eyes
I fall inside picture frames
Breathing in his oil paints
He doesn't see me
He wanders in
His mouth looks thin
Like a child who stands there shaking
I can feel his anger choke me

Under my clothes

With gravel in her shoes
She's playing in the spotlight
No sugar with that pose

And everywhere that Judy is
Her lamb is sure to go
He watches how she lifts her dress
And spins into a spell

Ha-a-hoo, he takes a breath and pulls her in
And shuts her out, the ways to hold her hand

Across his frozen cheek, too close to touch

The harder you try to keep up with us
You lose another breath

So let them alone
They're almost done with their mushing

He looks happier than any other day
He won't go out with me
I don't care if I never see his face

Sometimes I want to get out of here.

Everyone's talking about you behind the gym.
They're sharing cigarettes,
Drinking beer out of coke cans,
They're saying what a waste,
You must have been loaded
Tearing down Pacific Coast Highway.

Bradley,
I think you got away.

[Chorus]
Someone found a blue Ford
Twisted up and glass all around.
There was a girl with you.
Nobody knew her.

Your step dad was called in
To say he recognized you.
Everyone knew you
And said it was a waste.

While you scream past my head
Fly away, fly away
I wonder what you said

And I'm watching you
Bare your teeth in a growl
Throwing your way
Back and forth 'til now

And I'm here in oblivion
I don't feel anything
Well, it's time to begin again
I won't remember anything at all

Could it be something that I said
It's making you good, boys and hens in my bed
And I would feel sorry if I could

And watch the hell lights coming down on me

Let yourself go
I hear them say

Is running in circles over me
But I don't think I'll stick around

And there's people falling over their own shoes

Un acertijo muy fácil

Es un churrete de luna
Con encajitos chocantes
Unas cosquillas de cuna

Un pellizquito de amante
Es un capricho de azúcar
Es un flequito del aire

Niño recién nació
Que columpia despertares
Ojala que hubieras visto
La sonrisa de tu mare

Celos es lo que tengo
No es que tenga dudas
Y es que tengo miedo
Todavía yo no me creo que te tengo

Vivimos con la dignidad
Del que es capaz con solo una mirada
De distinguir una verdad

Entre miles de mentiras disfrazadas
Todavía
No me creo que te tengo

Quererse no es tener secretos
Y sin embargo seguir siendo
Y el uno para el otro

Y el mayor de los misterios
Todavía
Yo no me creo que te tengo

Qué pena

Cuando yo quise tu no querías
Y cuando por fin quisiste
Yo quise querer pero no podía

Los paisajes más bellos
Viven en la mente de los ciegos
Y la esperanza mas fuerte surge

De los que no tienen remedio
Todavía
Yo no me creo que te tengo

Qué pena

En su mirada tan profunda y sin igual

Asi sentirme cuando estoy con el
Como si fuera perla en el fondo del mar
Mi amado es señalado entre diez mil
Y me confieso suya hasta el fin
Me vestire de blanco y le dare
Mi vida por conpleto a el

Oh I'm lonely and left with tears and sorrow
I can't face tomorrow since my love has gone
He's left me left me for another and my heart went with him
How can I go on

Was our love a game played for a day
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray
Am I to blame for this unhappy ending

Nothing else is left me but a memory
Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone

Building castles in the shifting sands

Another day to swing on clothe's lines
May I be yawning

Barry Gibb wrote this song in 1966, when he was twenty.
The first recording of this song was by Ronnie Burns in Australia. It was a top 20 hit for him in Australia in July 1967. The Abi and Esther Ofarim version was also out in mid 1967 on a single. They worked mainly in Europe, not the US, including Germany where the Bee Gees were very, very popular, but I just don't know whether it was a hit single. 



The Bee Gees version was first out on the movie soundtrack album Melody at the start of 1971, by the way. Best of vol.2, 1973 is the first actual Bee Gees album that had it. This is their second recording of it; that first one, was recorded as a demo by Bee Gees in late 1966 and first released in 1970 on the Inception / Nostalgia 2-LP set.",In the Morning,1968

I used to smile and say hello. Guess I was just a happy guy. 
Then you happened,girl, this feeling that posessses me. 
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.

[Chorus]
I can't see nobody... no, I can't see nobody.
Mine eyes can only look at you...you.

I used to have a brain; I used to think of many things. 
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing. 
Don't ask me why, little girl. I love you and that's all I can say.
You're ev'ry ,ev'ry breath I take.You are my nights; my night and day.

[Chorus]

Every single word you hear...is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before...a love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you...it doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago...but in my eyes you'll always be.
Every single word you hear...is coming from this heart of mine.
I loved you such a long time ago...don't know why...
And I don't know why...baby...

Nina Simone,"They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see the light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
So, I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere inside these walls

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Yonder standing me in this lonely crowd
A man who says he's not to blame
All day long I hear him hollering so loud
Just crying out that he's not to blame

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released",I Shall Be Released,1969
Nina Simone,"When you're lost in Juarez
And it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through

Don't put on any airs
When you're down on rue morgue avenue
They got some hungry women there
And man, they really make a mess out of you

If you see Saint Annie
Tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
And my fingers are all in a knot

And I haven't got the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend the doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room

And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And then she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

Up on project hill
It's either fortune or fame
You can take one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim

And If you're looking to get silly
You'd better go back from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man, they expect the same

All the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post

And picking up my brother Carl
who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking like a ghost

Well, that's it folks, that's it

Well I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough

Ah, but the joke was on me
There was no-one there even to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough",Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,1969
Nina Simone,"Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 
But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 

And just when you mean to tell her 
That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 

That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 

And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 

And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 

But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 

And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 

And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 

There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 

While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.",Suzanne,1969
Nina Simone,"Come gather 'round people

And accept it that soon
You'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you

Then you better start swimmin'
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changin', changin'

Come writers and critics
Who prophesy with your pen
And keep your eyes wide

And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who

Will be he who has stalled

It's ragin'
I will soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin', they're changin'

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
For your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
The old road is
Rapidly fadin'
Please get out of the way
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin', they're changin'

And the curse it is cast

Will later be fast

Will later be past

Will later be last

A time to laugh, a time to weep

Nina Simone,"And now, the end is near and so I got to face 
The final curtain, girl
Friends I say clear and state her case of which I'm uncertain
I've lived a life that's full of travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yeah, regrets, I've had a few
But then again, who feel to me uncertain.
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each other course, each careful footstep along the byway,
Yeah, and more, much more than this,
I did my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I did all much more than I could do
But threw it all, when there was doubt, on everyday
And it's not enough, I faced it all 
And as big as all did my way.

Oh, I've laughed and cried, had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, counted also music
To think like the old lad
And may I say not in a sky away,
Oh, no no no, You're not me, I did it my way.

What is a man, what have he got
If not himself, and he had not to may the things 
He truly feels not words of one for use
With that shows, I took the blows and did it my way!

It to be found
In the sound
Of a sigh.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of a child.
When the whole world discovers
That love's the only thing worthwhile.
Then there'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.

In the willow tree
Made for you and me
There's a silver symphony of birds.
When the poets rhyme
In the summer time
You'll hear melodies
In the words.

There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the stream
Running wild.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams

But oh, so glad

Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore

Always danced with worn out shoes
The silver hair, a ragged shirt

I met him in a New Orleans cafè
He was down and out

I knew a man, Bojangles, and he danced for you

He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, clicked heels instead

He spoke with tears of fifteen years 
How his dog and he traveled about
His dog up and died, dog up and died
After twenty years he still grieved

He said, I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
He said, I drink a bit
He shook his head and as he shook his head 
I heard someone ask, please

like a light bulb in a dark room

Nina Simone,"I remember this afternoon
When my sister came into the room
She refused to say how my father was
But I knew he'd be dying soon.

And I was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad
That I realized that I despised this man I once called father.
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching
His body now just eighty-eight pounds
Blinded eyes still searching
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.
Dying alone, naturally.

I was his favourite child, I had him a little while
Just as long as I could play the piano and smile a little smile
Just when I needed him most, he was already a ghost
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken

Leaving me alone with all my troubles
Not ever once touching me and saying
""Daugther, I'll help you get over.""
Now he's fadig away and I'm glad to say,
He's dying at last. Naturally.

It's a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart
Believes the words that the Bible said ""Til death do us two part"".
For her that was forever and ay, he decided her night and day
How could some English words so small affect someone so strangely?

Taking her away from us, her soul included
She might es well be gone with him, all the children are excluded.
Loneliness is hell, I know so well,
For I'm alone. Naturally.

I waited three weeks for him to die
I waited three weeks for him to die
Every night he was calling on me
I wouldn't go to him.
I waited three weeks for him to die
Three weeks for him to die.

And after he died, after he died
Every night I went out, every night I had a flight.
It didn't matter who it was with
'Cos I knew what it was about.
And if you could read between lines, my Dad and I close as flies.
I loved him then and I loved him still, that's why my heart's so broken.

Leaving me to doubt God in His Mercy
And if He really does exist then why does He desert me?
When he passed away I smoked and drank all day,
Alone. Again. Naturally.",Alone Again Naturally,1982

Nina Simone,"I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go 'way
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice.

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Put some music on while I pour.

The neighbors might think
But baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell.

I oughta say no no no sir
Mind if I move a bit closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is No
Ooh baby it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
My your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half-a-drink more
Never such a blizzard before.

I've got to get home
But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
Your eyes are like starlight now*
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt,
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

It's cold out side.
It's cold out side.

Nina Simone,"I was never one for singing what I really feel 
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real 

Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share 
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story 

People lust for fame like athletes in a game, 
we break our collarbones and come up swinging, 
some of us are downed 
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found 
But most have seen it all, 
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always come up singing 

Some make it when they're young, 
before the world has done its dirty job 
and later on someone will say 
""You've had your day, now you must make way"" 
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned 
or the many years forgetting what you know too well 
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down 
You try to make amends without defending 
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five 
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs 
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you 
Some make it when they're old 
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare 
or perhaps there's nothing there) 

Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But most have seen it all, 
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always have a story 

Some women have a body men will want to see 
and so they put it on display 
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day 
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance 
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance 

But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar 
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord 
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display 
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say 
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say 
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day 

Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But most have seen it all, 
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
And we always have a story 

So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around 
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down",Stars,1987

All her lovely companions are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.

Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
'thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.

That they don't know how to smile

Is there anyone who cares?

That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin' now
Your legs can't seem to stand

That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's poundin' roar

There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a south Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
Seven new people are born

Nina Simone,"The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cos when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone",The Other Woman [Live],1990

For I'm still wearin' last year's love.

And parting is pain.

How did they know it would go astray?
It began, and it ended on one September day.
We met by chance,
As people often do,
But it blossomed, yes, it blossomed
Into something I never knew.
Now... It is in the past.
They said it would never last.
I'll not forget the moment back,
Nor hot May or December,
Nor June or November,
But one September day.",One September Day,1991

Although you're full of misery
You mustn't show a trace of sadness

Sometimes face humiliation
While you were burning up inside
Facing reality is often hard to do
When it seems happiness is gone

And tell your heart life must go on

You've got to learn to leave the table
When love's no longer being served
To show everybody that you're able
To leave without saying a word

And go on living as before
What good is thinking of tomorrow
Who knows what it may have in store

A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,

I have been a rover, I have walked alone,
Hiked a-hundred highways, never found a home.
Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,
Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me.

There was a girl, in denver, before the Summer storm.
Oh her eyes were tender, oh her arms were warm.
And she could smile away thunder, kiss away the rain,
And even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.

Chorus

There was a girl, in Portland, before the Winter chill.
We used to go a-courting, along October hill,
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow,
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.

The more I want you.

Which ones are yours?
Where are you now
That yesterday has waved goodbye
And closed it's doors
The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world is so much bigger
Now that I am alone.

Papa, please forgive me
I know you understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no choice?
Oh, can you hear me prayin'?
Anything I'm sayin'?

Even though the night is filled with voices
I remember everything you ever taught me
Evey book I've ever read.

Can all the words,
All the music help me face what's ahead?
The trees are so much taller
I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely 
And the stars are half as bright.

Mornings after when he's had a little too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him 'cause I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me
Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Oh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

So you see that I don't want him you can have him

Well, it was what I wanted now

That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind
Oh I could say I need you but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other girls

In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'. 
No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night

Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship

Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them NOW, or LATER?""
Askin' ME!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""Right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair
Staring at the fireplace?
Oh so near to you, always near to you
Even now it seems we're face to face
But it is just if though I was standing before you
Telling you how much I adore you
If I'm really dear to you, near to you
We may be far apart and yet
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart
How near to you can I get

But it is just if though I was standing before you
Telling you how much I adore you

How near to you can I get?
How near to you, can I get?

Nina Simone,"I have almost ev'ry thing a human could desire,
Cars and houses, bear-skin rugs to lie before my fire
But there's something missing,
Something isn't there,
It seems I'm never kissing the one whom I care for.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for 
Someone who'd take my life 
And make it seem gay as they say it ought to be.
Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds 
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my 
Something To Live For.
I want Something To Live For
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouln't I give for

No place bif enough for holding all the tears you're gonna cry

Handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun

For those memories of you that are no longer sweet

Dealing out the cards from left to right,
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me 
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire.",Solitaire,1996

They could give you the whole round world for a toy
All I have are my arms to enfold you

Cause I see the face of things to come 
Yeah, your Constitution
Well, my friend, its gonna have to bend 
I'm here to tell you about destruction
Of all the evil that will have to end.
Some folks are gonna get the notion
I know they'll say I'm preachin' hate
But if I have to swim the ocean 
Well I would just to communicate
Its not as simple as talkin' jive
The daily struggle just to stay alive
Singin' about a revolution 
Because were talkin' about a change 
Its more than just evolution
Well you know you got to clean your brain
The only way that we can stand in fact
Is when you get your foot off our back",Revolution,2003

Nina Simone,"You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. you couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, ""what's she got to grin?""
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The black freighter
With a skull on its masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, ""hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! what's wrong with you! earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cause there's nobody gonna sleep here, honey
Nobody
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, ""who's that kicking up a row?""
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, ""what's she got to stare at now?""
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The black freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, ""why do they spare that one?""
Yes.
That's what you say.
""Why do they spare that one?""

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The black freighter
Runs a flag up its masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
""Kill them now, or later?""
Askin' me!
""Kill them now, or later?""

Noon by the clock
And so still by the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, ""right now.
Right now!""

Then they'll pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
""That'll learn ya!""

And the ship
The black freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It

Nina Simone,"I'm going back home where I was born
First I planned to stay but I can't live this way
I'm going back home where I was born

Try to understand I think this city's grand
But with all its charme give me the little country farm
I'm going back home where I was born

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now oh yeah
I tell you all about it I think you ought to know
Tell you all about it why I wanna go

I miss the country preacher and the house of prayer
I miss the bootlegger smelling in the air
Miss friendly faces and the country smiles
The crickets singing you can hear it for miles

Miss the rooster crowing at the break of dawn
Yes it all happens where I was born
Miss the fried chicken colored greens
Miss the hot biscuits and the lima beans
Miss the prayer meeting where the people pray
With the drum beating till the break of day

You can have it you can have it
You can have it you can have it
You can have thy town I won't be around
This here life's too fast but 'll never never last

I'm going back home where I was born
I got to go home got to go home
Where the people are real people can feel
Got to go down got to go down
Leave here today on my way so long so long
Going back home going back home
Got to go home got to go home
Got to go home got to go home

Where the highbrows get together, it's just too tight

Ol' Hannah Brown, from way cross town
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down
Just at the break of day
You could hear old Hannah say

I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me daddy, 'cause I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Give the piano player a drink
'Cause he brought me down

He's got rhythm when he stomps his feet
He just send me right off to sleep
Check all your razors and check your guns
I'm gonna be arrested when the wagon comes

I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer

Nina Simone,"The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is
The good book says, ""Go seek and ye shall find""
Well, I have sought and my, what a climb it is!

My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers

An emotion like the ocean
It's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man
Like I love him

Never treats me sweet and gentle, the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I started out just cryin' my lil' heart out
He don't love me like I love him
No, nobody could, I got it bad and that ain't good

So bad, so bad

I got on it so bad, so bad though folks with good intentions
Tell me to save my tears
I'm glad, I'm mad about you, I can't live without you
Lord above me make him love me the way he should

Like a lonely weeping willow lost in the wood
The things I tell my pillow
No woman should
I got it bad, bad so bad and that ain't good

Nina Simone,"Southern trees bearing strange fruit
Blood on the leaves and blood at the roots
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

Pastoral scene of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia, clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck
For the sun to rot, for the leaves to drop
Here is a strange and bitter crop",Strange Fruit [Stereo],2007

A smile to put them in
With other lives to listen to
And some work I've got to do

Until I remember you're gone

Nina Simone,"I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi.
My girlfriend blows a boozy good-bye kiss.
I see flying squirrels and nightmares of stigmata.
Then awakening to find my Trans-Am gone.
Still, I'm feeling pretty good about the future.
Yeah, everything is peaches but the cream.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
I see the guitar that my cousin played in prison,
Floating with the tv in the swimming pool.
I'm calling for the owner of the motel,
Then noticing the bloodstain on the door.
I'm reaching for the shoes under the bushes,
Just in time to hear the sirens sing.
I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things is always better than they seem.
You know freedom's just a stupid superstition,
'cause life's a highway that you travel blind.
It's true that having fun's a terminal addiction.
What good is happiness, when it's just a state of mind?
For in the prison of perpetual emotion,
We're all shackled to the millstone of our dreams.
Me, I'm handcuffed to a fence in Mississippi,
Where things is always better than they seem.
Things are always better than they seem.

You can spend the night beside her

But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 
And just when you mean to tell her 

That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength

That you've always been her lover 

And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 

And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 

And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said ""All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them"" 

But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 

And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 

And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 

There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 

While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.","Suzanne [Live, Philharmonic Hall New York 1969]",2007

Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most

Nina Simone,"Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face is like roses so fair
He's the prettiest face
And the neatest of hands
I love the ground on where he stands

Oh I love my love
And this he knows
I love the ground on whereon he goes
If you no more on earth I see,
I can't serve you as you have me

The winters passed and the leaves are green
The time is passed that we have seen
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I will be as one

I go to the Clyde to mourn and weep,
But satisfied I never could sleep
I write you a letter
Just a few short lines
I'll suffer death ten thousand times.

So fare you well my ain't true love
The time has passed but I wish you well
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I will be as one.

Nina Simone,"Across the morning sky, all the birds are leaving
How can they know that it's time to go
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I do not count the time

Who knows where time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
[Incomprehensible]

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Oh, but then you know that it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

Who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

But I am not alone as long as my love is near me
And I know it will be so until it's time to go

And I do not fear time

It was where everyone could see
He belonged to someone, but not me

Plain gold ring has a story to tell
It was one that I knew too well
In my heart it will never be spring
Long as he wears a plain gold ring
Oh, oh

When nighttime comes a' callin' on me
I know why I will never be free
I can't stop these teardrops of mine
I'm gonna love him till the end of time
Plain gold ring has but one thing to say
I'll remember till my dying day
In my heart it will never be spring

He's not worth fighting for
Besides there's plenty more where he came from
I don't want him you can have him
I'm giving him the sack
And he can go right back where he came from
I'm afraid I never loved him
Sweetie he'd be better off with you
I could never make him happy

All I ever wanted to do was
Run my fingers through his curly locks
Mend his underwear and darn his socks
Fetch his slippers and remove his shoes
Wipe his glasses when he's read the news
Rub his forehead with a gentle touch
Mornings after when he's had a little too much
Kiss him gently when he cuddles near
And give him babies one for every year

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him 'cause I don't want him
Because he's not the man for me
Then I'd close the window while he soundly slept
Then I'd raid the icebox where the food is kept
I'd fix the breakfast that would please him most
Eggs and coffee some apricot juice and some buttered toast
Oh oh then I'd go out and buy the papers
And when they've been read spend the balance of the day in bed

So you see that I don't want him you can have him
You can have him 'cause I don't want him because he's not my man

You may cry now; she may cry, oh, she may cry now

To relieve my mind and put aside all of this shit attacking me inside
All of this drama surrounding me, drives me crazy constantly
I just need some time to breathe and take my mind off of everything

Try to keep it behind me, but I'm always reminded
Of everything that bothers me, like you can't take breaks from reality
Just keep on moving and keep on doing what will keep my life running smoothly

Guess only God knew your fate

To live on your legacy
I miss you and know you're watching me

The way you lick your lips slow
Makes me want you even more

[Intro: Nina Sky]
Oh-ho, oh-ho, ohhh... Nina Sky-why-ighhhh...

[Red Cafe:]
DJ Envy, Red Cafe, The Co-op!

[Chorus sung in the style of Gina Thompson's ""The Things That You Do"": Nina Sky]
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 1: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
Uh, you remind me of hard liquor
Feel like I overdosed on hard liquor
Now you got a G leanin (Jodeci)
You got a G Feenin woe is me
Is are Dot, the fresh and the flyest (Yeah)
The thighs in that dress could start a riot
{UH OHH!} It's the lovin like that
Like a round-trip flight, I be comin right back (Right back)
Shakedown got me thuggin like that (Like that)
All night, I'm out chasin that trap
It's like every thug's dream
To have a down chick or a thug a** queen
Face in the pillow, a** in the arch
Legs done had a divorce, they split apart (Split apart)
I do it slow, til you scream (Do it faster)
Red Cafe, I'm back the Trackmaster

[Chorus: Nina Sky (Red Cafe)]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you (Yeah, It's The Co-op, OK OK!)
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you (ok ok

[Verse 2: Red Cafe (Nina Sky) {Red Cafe in parenthesis}]
It might be wrong but it feel so right, yes yes this is life
Love is so hood you could bottle that stuff
If it wasn't Cafe I would gobble it up
Yep! No longer thinkin 'bout them R&B girls
Like, Ciara (Uh Uh) Nivea (Who that?) Teairra (Nah) Olivia (Whatever!)
All them names seem trivia
You look mean in them painted paints, do that dance, do that dance
I ain't no backyard n****
But my workout plan will make your backyard bigger
{I like} To see you in my favorite jeans
{And I like} The way you don't hold your screams
{I like} The way you make your body rock
And you ain't scared to lick the lollipop

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
OK! OK! I know you like the finer things
Designer names like Vera Wang
Necklesses and diamond rings
Bling blaow shirts with the shiney things
You could get all that plus a rover
Put my chain on the arm give you the cold shoulder
And the hood respect it man
I bring the pain that's the Method Man
What's 'gon top that? Who 'gon knock that?
We a tag team girl they can't stop that
The world feelin your fella, on the road to the riches let's get it together

[Verse 4: Nina Sky]
I see you sippin slowly (Slowly) I can tell you want me (You want me)
Like that drink so tasty, there's no need for chasin, no no no

[Chorus: Nina Sky]
The things you do... makes me, keep runnin, to you
The things you do, keeps me, in love with you

I’ll shoot my cousin for nothing, dominant man
Go visit fam with no problems, on some normal shit
Straight from Skopje, Macedonia, the floral lit
Licorice liquor, one cube, a touch of water
Watch it mix, turn white like the Duchess' daughter
I’m in the corner puffing Ganja with the musky odor
Destination back of your throat, cup of soda
Uh, this is Bam Bam Bigelow, Queens to Asbury Park connect, Figaro
My uniform Carhartt sweats and Gore-tex athletic horses on my chest and on my short sets
The Leslie Nielsen of the weed and the words
This is Action Bronsolinni, 33 and the 3rd, kid
Naked gun, the serial is scratched off
Armed like Rocket in his prime, blast off

On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we're there
On and on, push it through, we won
Never stop till the day we're there

Push your seat back, the Rickey Henderson of rap
Jets hat, underneath a little blubber lie the 6 pack
Summer time I cop the musket with the kick back
Then sit back, stand up, eyes low, hit that
This happens continuously throughout the night
Now my eyes are like diamonds, that’s looking blue-ish in the light
Like a prism, shooting out hope, honor, and optimism
Never stop it till we're coastal on the aqua mission
Reach my hand in the water and grab a tuna
Silhouette you see reflection of light, right off the Mezzaluna
That’s a half moon, wavy like my man’s fade
The European carry-all, color, tan, suede
Handmade, hand blades, carve up your features, I’m a creature
Section 39, I’m in the bleachers
Fiends get washed up like turtles on the beaches
It’s mating season make the verbal for your speakers

On and on, push it 'til, we won
Never stop till the day we're there
On and on, push it 'til, we won
Never stop till the day we're there

I'll prosciutto, legend, Phil Rizzuto
Marijuana like the pussy, I keep it crudo
That’s raw, now I declare war
You in the women’s league
I show you how a man score
Look at my beard and my body like a grizzly
I’m shoulder pressing 3 plates
Obama, EBT. I'm a G, supermarket sweepstakes
Still drinking vintage out the bottle with the cheese plate
The Derek Harper with the low Caesar, flow fever
More than likely digging in your ho's beaver
Drug smoke to my neck just like a turkey
Dough dirty, make your brother do a curtsy. no mercy, Van Buren cop Hershey
Square Tyson and I’m in the mountains eating rare bison
Clam chowder, you ain't fucking with this man-power
Straight from Queens, where we're known to make your plans sour

On and on, push it 'til, we won
Never stop till the day we're there
On and on, push it 'til, we won
Never stop till the day we're there

Nobody knows, they're lining up to go insane
I'm all alone, I smoke my friends down to the filter
But I feel much cleaner after it rains

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

Did the Devil make the world while God was sleeping
You'll never get a wish from a bone
Another wrong goodbye and a hundred sailors
That deep blue sky is my home

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall

A rat always knows when he's in with weasels
Here you lose a little every day
Well, I remember when a million was a million
They all have ways to make you pay

Nina Zilli,"""Ti giuro che sono sincero
È l'ultima volta""
La frase dell'anno, tesoro
È questa, l'hai vinta
Lascia stare, non ti sfinire
Perdi tempo qui
Io non chiedo cortesie

Hai girato più volte la ruota della fortuna
Ma, peccato, la sorte stavolta
Non è quella buona
Lascia stare, non ti sfinire
Puoi fumare un pò
Ti rallegra l'animo
E noi rimaniamo qui
A pretendere che ci sia sole
Continuiamo a vivere
Senza accorgersi che fuori piove
Bellissimo, era bellissimo
Ma niente mai, come vorrei
Cieli neri su di noi
È tutto sbagliato

Non cedo nessun compromesso
È questa la svolta
Credimi quando ti dico
Che non hai piu scelta
Lascia stare, non mi sfinire no
Sei di troppo qui
Porta via la tua poesia
E noi rimaniamo qui

A pretendere che ci sia sole
Continuiamo a vivere
Senza accorgersi che fuori piove
Bellissimo, era bellissimo
Ma niente mai come vorrei

È tutto sbagliato

So sometimes I will and sometimes I won't
Puff mad stick crack a forty down the back
Sit fat and relax and plan my attack
Not the one to test I posess mad finesse
My buddha was blessed one bird in the nest
Chills with my peeps steady bouncing in jeeps
On the New York streets hittin urban concrete
I'm the man untestable, with the extraterrestrial flow
Fo'-fifty-fix celo, pop the top off the forty ounce bottle
I'm not the one to follow, I'm not the role model
Hollow tips in my clips money grip and my Glock
Only spits when I react to the bullshit
So give me room to breathe and get up off DEEZ
And save the confessions for JEESuz
Plus I don't need to hear no sorrow
Eff it, the sun will still come out tomorrow
Long as I'm breathing, needing, even like Steven
Achieving, gettin' some cheese and
Representin' lovely, Boogie Down Bronx major

I pack steel it's like a jungle makes me wonder where my eel is
Hits the bricks skips the dog shit complete in my cipher
Temper like Rowdy Roddy Piper, hyper like a viper
I'ma strike if I got it goin for the jugular
Stretch you like a copper
Stoppah, stoppah, but you can't stop me
Just clock me, just watch me blow up the spot G
Came a long way from, back in the day
We did it for no pay, just rhymin hit the hay and
Sleep, wake up, write another rhyme
Hit the park after dark drop the beat one time
That's when shit was real, no phonies no bologna
Just the homemade mics and wheels of steel
Backup from the roof, amp plugged in the street light
Everything right, jam over a street fight
Back to the lab I grab my pen and pad
Raw lyrics make a fleuredoscad
Had no dinero, enough get fo' chicken wings and rice
A forty ounce a nickel bag to get nice
And now I might make a million, and still son
It makes the heart pump, you know what I want

Brand new Glock non-stop hip-hop
Remote control boombox lampin' on my dresser
The God ain't no lesser as the pressure comes to test ya
Hundred pound weight around the neck, daily
Nuff treasons nuff reasons like Philip Bailey
Can't get enough of that funky stuff
Rhymin astronomical, original, shit is phenomenal
Heat up the ghetto put the pedal to the metal
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Right off the pape I roll a big fat spliff
Four-fifth on the hip, Heineken in the grip shit I'm ready
Get the keys for the jeep, let's bounce
Cruise avenues, get some brews and sing the blues with the
Funkmaster Flex cassette in the deck
I'm in effect I move my neck while Son gets wreck
Oh what a feeling, I'm on the wheels of steel and
I snatch up some skins for some sexual healing
Erything's kosher copasctetic, groovy hip-hop moves me
Soothes me, I'm letting off like an uzi
But first steps a doozy and bruise me
Now I'm choosy before I start to freak it like a floozy
I wanna get big get paid true stunt

There's two to ways do everything 
The right way and the wrong way  
Then there's the short way and the long way

But I'm goin' do my thing the dark mask way
I'm either goin' make it or I'm goin' take it

I got to make something or I got to take something 
Even if it comes down to hustling in public 
I'm goin' do whatever to avoid the stormy weather 
Got my act together either make or take 

In the land of the free and the home of the brave 
I still feel like a slave, my heart is dark like the bat cave 
Don't cry, dry you're eye, we all goin' die but I'm goin' die fly
In the race the great paper chase 

Money's the only thing I'm goin' let you throw in my face
Corrupt political officials 
Speak the issues, and dis you, like used toliet tissue
I'm goin' miss you when you fall into the flames it's the same games

With new names, and new gains, same pains, and blood stains
Propaganda, I want to smoke trees in a havanna, wearing a bandanna 
At the coppa cabanna, swear to god I split a nigga like a banana
Over currencies or property ain't no stopping me, I'm building a 

Monopoly now copy me, each one teach one lessons of making and taking 
Erasing, faking, and snaking, serious like a jamacian, and I bring home 
The bacon daily, really, I never fake it, I got to make it, like it's 
Secret, fuck around and I'm goin' take it

I got to make something or I got to take something

I'm goin' do whatever to avoid the stormy weather 
Got my act together either make or take 

My hand raps around dollar bills sends chills down my spine 
Like cheap wine, so I gotta get mine
All the time I rewind back to the day when I realized sometimes crime 
Pays, there's a million ways to die but only one to live

I need enough money to spend enough, money to give cause I love my 
Peeps and my peeps love me and I refuse to see them living in proverty 
I gotta be on point, I am not myself savior with new flavor 
Like craig with my third eye I cried 

Shed tears in the mind for being blind only thing left for me now 
Is crime or rhyme 

I got to make something or I got to take something 
Even if it comes down to hustling in public 
I'm goin' do whatever to avoid the stormy weather 
Got my act together either make or take 

I got to make something or I got to take something 
Even if it comes down to hustling in public 
I'm goin' do whatever to avoid the stormy weather 
Got my act together either make or take 

I refuse to lose similar to chuck 
Never bite the hand that feed you never bite the hand that buck (pow) 
Now what! stuck in a maze with only one way out figure it out that's 
What life's about, trail after trail, tribulation after tribulation

I want a black nation cause I'm sick of the plantation 
No more picking cotton have you forgotten we the kings and queens of 
The earth, now rome in the rotten apple, drinking snapple
Trying to get a little capital, spend it like I'm crazy, that's what 

Rap will do, you got to maintain make sense out of what's insane
And stay on top of you're game, don't blame nobody but yourself for you're 
Lack of wealth, times get hard get sneaky like a stealth
Make or take is the thesis, I want pieces of the pie gotta do or die

I got to make something or I got to take something 
Even if it comes down to hustling in public 
I'm goin' do whatever to avoid the stormy weather

I'm too hot to handle - grab ya mitten
So let it be written, let it be done
We got a whole ton of choke to smoke before I go broke
So toke, I hope you understand
You're lyrically handicapped
I'm strapped, ready for combat, and all that
Whatcha sayin mean faces resemble wrecked cars
So unwrinkle your mug and relax God
My heart pumps no juices, intimidation is useless
Excuses excuses you ain't really ruthless

It ain't hardly that easy to spark me, don't start me

Baby with the runs, and you with no Pamper money
Protect ya body, Wu already got ya neck

I'm out of the question like a crackhead, workin' for daycare
I remix you then pause
Pussies like you end up on all fours with no drawers
I came through the doors in 1994 like never before
In ninety-five I went on tour, while you slept on the floor
Reality my style is legit
And if you can't hit you need to sit or quit and don't say shit
Amateur night, I'm a all-year pro, you sleepin'
Get off the NoDoz and buy some new effin' clothes - you don't want it

Say somethin' knew it!
Not enough of the main fluid, sound good when you say it
and look stupid when you try to do it - I'm nuttin' to fool wit
Who you went to school with, ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air?""
Wouldn't waste a bullet on you, I can dead you with a mean stare
You too easy to scare, and I don't care
Whatcha say just mess around and try it
Get hit up with a hundred silencers cause I bring the Quiet Riot
Put your money where your mouth is and I'll buy it
Twist your tongue up so fuckin' bad, you won't be able to untie it
Stay out of my circumference when I'm mic checkin'
I ain't sayin' you lose nigga - I'm sayin you comin' in second

Save the theatrics for the mattress.
Nine bring it raw dog style with no practice.
I mack this microphone like a hoe on the stroll.
In total control of the soul.
Any asshole can pull a gun the streets are full of fools
I met smarter younger brothers in jails than in schools.
Runnin his story about his glory, it bore me.
And his territory, it don't do nothin for me.
So fuck him and the horse that he's ridin
I'm barely survivin, losin my breath
Cause I'm drownin in sorrow.
I seen a lot of pain with these two eyes of mine.
That's why I write the rhymes that borderline on crime.
I gotta make somethin or I gotta take somethin.
Can't beat that...
Fuck Versace and Rolex, I can't eat that.
I need that green it seems to reign supreme.
By any means, pens and papers on triple beams.
Get rich schemes blow up in your face
None taste worse that a plan gone sour
Your power slippin through your fingers like dimes and nickels.
We go pistols
you know where to shoot at, wherever the loot at.
I don't break the law the law breaks me.
I ain't sittin around waitin for the devil to come and take me.
Don't shoot until you see the whites of they eyes
Anything less would be uncivilized

Chorus (x2)

You know... in a world full of lies and alibies
Some men die for a piece of the pie
It's Uncivilized
So I strive to survive and keep my eyes on the prize
(So I try to stay hi stayin high of the lie (2))
Anything else is uncivilized
(It's keepin me from actin uncivilized (2))

I break the rules on my quest for the 12 jewels
Believe in Delf' bring stacks and green packs
Need hats for Jacks, camoflauge
At least 2 gatts for when skies are grey
Any day above ground is a good day, I'd say
The way kids play nowadays, no hands
They spray round my way
I'm feelin like Ja Day and I'm runnin outta sad songs
You fake, one mistake could leave you dead wrong
Roll with the king, whoever that is
See him in the corner of my eye
But he disappears like cigarette smoke
In a cloud, then the rain comes, then the pain comes
X marks the spot, graffitti marks the slums
The chosen ones communicate with mathematics
The new tactics set me free from all the dramatics.
Keep it in my attic, that's where my brains at
Keep it in the closet, yeah but keep it black
Back up from the ropes if you can't float between notes
Ane memorize them quotes that I toke from Buddha smoke
Hope ya brought your dictionary with ya
Cause if you get the words, then you get the picture
I hit ya because I love ya
You're my people and I put no one above ya
But if you're foul I bust ya
It's time to be totally disrespectful to Saint Ives
Part of the reason we're all uncivilized.

Saw her running barefoot but the ground there never touched her feet!

A nickel buys you what you need

Standing on my tip toes while you brushed the dirt from off your knees! 
Should have come as no surprise no one else here did have your drive! 
You've got a big white stretch parked right outside but nobody there to share your ride!

Why do we always have to find our way back home?

Why do we all end up dead drunk or stoned?

I catch myself and try to speak with grace

And you got just enough honesty to make you want a little more

I wish for nothing but the rain 
To fall and wash away
Everything that I've done wrong
Find a way to make you strong
If only for another day

When I'm all alone, just me and my ghosts
Standing three deep, just like sentries at their post
And they make sure I remember just a little more than most
They make sure that I understand the consequence of past

You needed just enough anger to get you through the door
And you got just enough honesty to make you want a little more

To fall and wash away
Everything that I've done wrong
Find a way to make you strong

I'm not the one who sits across from you, who, returns your stare
And I watch as you grow quiet like you always did
And I wait to get what I deserve
It's the part that doesn't die that makes it hurt...

At just the right moment to save her face

We can be just who we wanna be
Or as far as any eye can see
There's a great divide

Maybe we can find a way
To fall into each other's arms
And finally we can say nothing

And might have been

Then the malice set in
And reduced all the colours to winter

And this love that stutters and splinters

With no forwarding address to trace them
