The Damnwells,"Why do you kiss goodbye every night?
Giving me every reason to lie
Can I be in your way for a while?
Can I get in the back seat and hide?

Take it down to the street anytime
Lock me out of the sheets for a while
Give us a kiss with sharp little knives
You are the last thing on my mind
I'll be the first you leave behind, everyone knows why

So give it up, give it back to me
Will you be mine while the winners sleep?
Give it up, give it back to me
Open wide kiss catastrophe

Circling over you and in between
Your shiver and my blue restless teen
More lovely than a reason to leave
'Cause you are the last thing on my mind
And I'll be the first you leave behind, everyone knows why

So give it up, give it back to me
Will you be mine while the winners sleep?
So give it up, give it back to me
Open wide kiss catastrophe

Give it up, give it back to me
Give it up, give it back to me

",Kiss Catastrophe,2003
The Damnwells,"Go out under white street lights
And find the real black and white
The blueprints just might say you were right

I won't go home till I've found my way there
I wont leave here with old faded fears
Of what's gone and what was never here

Don't call me tonight
I can't make it right

Just say anything you want to
You don't need all the things they promised to you
Sell the lie and give away the truth
Give away the truth

I have seen, among the oldest of things
The beginning, the start of the seam
That holds together
And keeps it from losing me

Don't call me tonight
I can't make it right

Just say anything you want to
You don't need all the things they promised to you
Sell the lie and give away the truth

Just say anything you want to
You don't need all the things they promised to you
Sell the lie and give away the truth
Give away the truth

Just say anything you want to
You don't need all the things they promised to you
Sell the lie and give away the truth

Just say anything you want to
You don't need all the things they promised to you
Sell the lie and give away the truth
Give away the truth

The Damnwells,"Do you want it, comes in threes
Do you need it, it's not free
What if when you find out what you want
You don't find me?

I hope it all goes well

The Dan Band,"I know this pain
Why do lock yourself up in these chains?
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind

Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry

Turnaround, every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears

The Dan Karlsberg Group,"I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me.
Funny, but when you're near me
I'm in the mood for love.

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under
Oh! Is it any wonder
I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?
We've put our hearts together
Now we are one, I'm not afraid!

If there's a cloud above
If it should rain we'll let it
But for tonight, forget it!

Right now you're free to say it all
There is no one here to judge you I only love you
You're free to close your eyes and fall

Tell me all your dreams
What you think love means

The Dancehall Doctors,"Wake me my lady don't let me sleep
Open my eyes to the wonders you keep
Let me look at you see how you shine
I'll fall in love like I've done every time

Lay me in soft green grass
Down where the river runs
Under the mountain caps 
Gold with the setting sun

Walk me along the bay
Beyond the verdant trees
Carry me with your grace
Forever comfort me

You walk on water searching the east
The souls of the masses pass at your feet
Looking up at you with tears in their eyes
Fathers of fathers of fathers gone by

[Chorus]
Walk me down old main streets
Ride me down rusty rails
Fields full of summer wheat
Peppered with rounded bales
Steeples where church bells ring
Lighthouses by the sea
Reach out through gathered storms
Faithfully comfort me

I am your tired I am your poor in spirit
Yearning to breathe, breathe free
Breathe free

Down where the river runs
Under the mountain caps 
Gold with the setting sun

In the kitchen
Cookin' up my favorite dish whatever
She is fixin'
Daddy's in a picture in a frame that's
Always sittin' by the phone

Underneath that tree I planted when I was just a boy of nine
Man, I never can believe just how much it's grown
When I go

Home, back home
To the gentle place that held me close as 
I became a man
Where the streets are all familiar and an
Old friend shakes my hand
And I feel fine, so fine
Yeah knowin' that this road I'm walkin' on
From time to time always leads me home

Brother he'll be waitin' with the latest 
From the grapevine
Sayin' man you won't believe them
Stories 'bout
Those crazy friends of mine
And all them little scandals that a small
Town just can't seem to leave alone

Later on we'll sit around, bellies tight
From supper
Tellin' all them stories that we just can't get enough of
And somewhere in an honest laugh it'll 
Finally hit me that I'm

Home, back home
Where the memories all have gathered up and
Slowly turned to gold
And I carry them along with me wherever 
I may go
And I feel fine, so fine
In knowin' that this road I'm wanderin' on
From time to time always leads me home
Back home

And when I go put some flowers down at
Daddy's stone
I see that empty space beside him
It always makes me glad that I came home

[Chorus]

Home, back home
Where the Bible is the Bible and the angels
Get their wings
And the circle is unbroken when I hear those 
Church bells ring
And I feel fine, you know I feel so fine

From time to time unwinds across the rivers 
Through the pines
And leads me home, back home

The Dancehall Doctors,"It's been a long time
Since we walked down that aisle together
And you became my wife
And who would've thought You would fall for someone just like me
For the best days of my life

I may not be a poet
'Cause I ain't so good on words
I may not stand before you like a knight
In shining armor
I may not be the best of singers
There's better guys I've heard
But I know how to love, I know how to
Love you well

You got your faults
And I don't need to tell you I've got mine
But I guess they all even out
Wherever I ride

And somehow I lose a crowd

I may not drive a fancy car
I don't know what it's for
I may not be the one who gets to 
Shower you with diamonds
I may not be a rich man but you can't
Call me poor
'Cause I know how to love, I know how
To love you well

And as we skip the light fandango
From that ole jukebox by the bar
Now honey don't it make you wonder
How we ever got this far

I may not be a poet
'Cause I ain't got much to say
I may not stand before you like that

The Dancehall Doctors,"Girl, you've never known no one like me
Up there in your high society
They might tell you I'm no good
Girl they need to understand
Just who I am

I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

I may drink too much and play too loud
Hang out with a rough and rowdy crowd
That don't mean I don't respect
My mama and my Uncle Sam

I may be a real bad boy
But baby I'm a real good man

Might have a reckless streak
At least a country mile wide
If you're gonna run with me
It's gonna be a wild ride
When it comes to lovin' you
I've got velvet hands
I'll show you how a real bad boy
Can be a real good man

I'll take all the good times I can get
I'm too young for growing up just yet
Ain't much I can promise you
Except to do the best I can
I'll be damned

The Dancehall Doctors,"I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about as wild as we were green
In the ways of the world
She'd pick me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops
On a summer night
Running all the red lights
We'd park way out in a clearing in a grove
And the night was as hot as a coal-burning stove
We were cooking with gas
Knew it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

Well the very first time her mother met me
Her green-eyed girl had been a mother-to-be
For two weeks
I was out of job and she was in school
And life was fast and the world was cruel
We were young and wild
We decided not to have the child
So we did what we did and we tried to forget
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

In the back of that red rag top
She said please don't stop

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end
And no I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing as what might have been
That's a waste of time
Drive you out of your mind
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet
And her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped loving me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped loving me",Red Ragtop,2002
The Dancehall Doctors,"She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling down all night

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

She's the sunset's shadow
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreamin' tree
Together in this brief eternity

Summer days
Winter snow
She's all things to behold

She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling down all night
She's my kind of rain

So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

And that's why God made Mexico
A place where we can lay low
Where the Cuervo goes down nice and slow
And the warm winds blow

'Cause that's when he'd roll through that door
Sixteen years and not a thank you from his lips
She don't fix him dinner no more

Life is sweet in a border town
You learn to let your hair down
And you don't make trouble
You learn to dance the fandango

You change your name and you change your face
Get used to beans and chile paste
And learn to live and love life in the slow lane

And that's why God made Mexico

Maybe Monterey or Acapulco
Anywhere the warm winds blow

The Dangerous Summer,"I felt unable, I was lying on my side
In the same clothes from the very last night
I wanna pray that I am doing everything right

I saw my mom die for the very first time
She was an angel, God took her from the sky
And there's a million other people
That I found who cared more than I ever will

I held that note out
I grabbed my bag and I left through the door
I let my hair grow
Put these words on my skin I cannot relate

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, God believe I'm lost again

I stayed in bed and you took so much that I couldn't even sleep
I waited so long though that wasn't even that bad
I never had to be a part of the world and I've been making that a goal
For reasons that I cannot explain

Well, I'm an optimist but only in a perfect world
I think I'm too stained with all the negativity
From all the people in my way

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

I took a trip down south, I felt the sun on my face
And it made things okay for a second
I drew a picture of my problems
When I was going insane and I focused on the currents

It's the funny thing about it, I never seem to worry
That every single current's not the same
It's all about position and where I choose to lay
And God I am going away

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you
And I am lost again, oh God believe I'm lost again

Would you believe in my songs if I gave them all to you?
I can't find the strength in my voice to call you back
And say that everything is bad without you

You closed your eyes to know that we did it. 
We did it.
We worked so hard just to feel alright, 
And I'm not scared to die for all the promises I made.
We did it.

With all that we've been through.
It won't take too long to feel the bright light.
No matter where we go,
Just leave yourself entwined and let the feeling grow.

About the bodies you've left in unmade beds

Heartless, trained to hit movin targets
Profit, .357 cocked it
Killed you, leave you wit your money in your pocket

Rotten fruit, black je-sus, I got juice

Dumb mc's caught the gum disease, ask them

I write wit invisible ink, y'all use eye liners

So stop your sighing be happy again,
Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,
The whole world smiles with you.

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,
Learned wrong from right,
And you'll never hear me complain;

The whole world smiles with you,

There is someone I'm longing to see
Someone I simply can't help but adore
Someone who'll thrill me forever

Some day I'll find my love
And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own
And I'll know her the moment we meet

What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you

And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What is This Thing Called Love,1992

After it brought my lover near

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

The Dave Brubeck Quartet,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,
You're Mickey Mouse.
You're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa.
I'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

Your words poetic are not pathetic
On the other hand, boy, you shine
And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.
Now gifted humans like Vincent Youmans
Might think that your song is bad,
But for a person who's just rehearsin'
Well I gotta say this my lad:

You're the top! You're Mahatma Ghandi.
You're the top! You're Napolean brandy.
You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,
I'm a broken doll, a fol-de-rol, a blop,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.
I'm a lazy lout that's just about to stop,
But if Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're a dance in Bali.
You're the top! You're a hot tamale.
You're an angel, you simply too, too, too divine,
You're a Botticelli, You're Keats, You're Shelley,
You're Ovaltine.
You're a boon, You're the dam at Boulder,
You're the moon over Mae West's shoulder.
I'm a nominee of the G.O.P. or GOP,
But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top!

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,
You're a dress from Saks's, You're next year's taxes,'
You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,
You're the foist in the Irish svipstick,
I'm a frightened frog that can find no log to hop,

You're the top!",You're the Top [From Anything Goes],2012
The Dave Brubeck Quartet,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here

I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Motherfuck the education and drug rehabilitation

Dead feds in my closet 'cause they tried to chase me
November the 29th, I bust open my mommas car
Pussy hole was addicted to drinking, now I'm addicted to crack rock
So motherfuck you bitches and you snitches tryin' to do me in
Police in disguises and he tries to buy Peruvian
Knockin at my fuckin' door, duckin' and dodgin' on that floor
That thinkin' got you noid, got me reachin for my .44
Creepin' up out my window pane, I smell cops
A honkey's on the block, drop to my knee, I took a shot
I seen him drop, one time this ain't the place for that
Since he's a fed, I took off his face for that
That shit that he tried to pull
And you know he couldn't get away with this
Bitch I'm a time bomb time, so don't you play with this
Fuck being indicted, don't you try it that's the fuckin' story
Cops roll to the cemetery, all snitches in my laboratory
I'm fittin' to stir it, rock it up, so where's my silver spoon
I put my yea out on the block, and all you hear is boom
This is my set, so you can jet, or get that sweater wet
A fed is bloody, he's been wounded by a fucking tech
Rat tat to the tat tat, I'mma take him out of his memory
For ridin' my nuts and tryin' to stick me with delivery
Loose lips sink ships, so this is do or die
This is a letter from Shoestring to the F.B.I.
Backstabbers gone, so I guess you dirty cops are clean
You took a father from their family, motherfuck their dreams
Is what you said, so motherfucking bitch ass fed
I want you dead, I'mma to pump your ass full of lead
Let's make a deal, this shit is real, ill
I pack my steel, you let him go then we can let you live
You made that switch and now it's time to kill you bitch
Give you an overdose of bullets, and put you in a ditch

Distribution of cocaine, is that all y'all can come with dude
Bitches betta think fast, find yourself a better snitch
'Cause that bitch you got smoke rocks and so that mean her word ain't shit
If I get some prison time, give me mine, 'cause I ain't fake
Since my click don't snitch When I get out all my connections straight
The journal keeps my name in lights, entrapment to the third degree
'Fore my trial can come, the newspaper want to sentence me

Came up bustin' caps so we could deal this dime out where I stay
Out to make my pay and sellin' yea's the only way I know
Fiends around the block soon as I open up my rock house door
Gotta make some more, I'm droppin eighthies on that digital scale
More popular than Taco Bell, taco shells, we're making sells

The Dayton Family,"They say I'm a ghetto man, they call me a ghetto bastard
They say I'm a dope dealer, they say I'm a money snatcher
They call me a ghetto thug, I'm livin the ghetto life
I'm stuck with my ghetto kids, so I married a ghetto wife
I got no education, I'm workin the ghetto job
I live on the ghetto streets, so I run with the ghetto mob
They give me a ghetto check, three dollars that's no respect
Not enough to survive, so I break me a ghetto neck
I pop me a ghetto shot, down on the ghetto block
Front page of the newspaper, fiend dies over ghetto rock
I'm tired of the ghetto noise, ghetto girls ghetto boys
Hand me a shotgun, cause them are my ghetto toys
This ghetto mentality, I live in a ghetto town
Bang to the boogie boom, lets fight to our ghetto sound
They taught me the tricks and trades, I'm stuck in my ghetto ways
That's why hypocrites are all sayin these are the ghetto days
I ?? to a ghetto rock, I'm stopped by a ghetto cop
A young girl get pregnant, cause she was brought ghetto hot
I roll with the ghetto game, I'm kickin the ghetto slang
They gave me a ghetto name, cause its a ghetto thang

Chorus:     (Repeat 4X)

And the ghetto is no joke
They got me thinkin, how can a brother get away

They say I'm a ghetto crook, I'm kickin the ghetto game
Ghetto babies die, damn that's a ghetto shame
Back to the ghetto days, and backed to the ghetto nights
Back to the ghetto lives, and back to the ghetto fights
Back to the ghetto ladies, and back to the ghetto men
Back to the ghetto churches , and back to the ghetto sins
Yes that's a ghetto thing, hit with a ghetto swing
If you don't know why I say it, than ask Mr. Rodney King
Cause down in Los Angeles, the ghetto is scandalous
than Uncle Toms, even they can't handle this
I go to a ghetto school, i'm keepin it ghetto cool
I pack me a ghetto tool, gonna kill me a ghetto fool
I walk on a ghetto floor, I shop at a ghetto store
How can I pay more, I can't afford it, I'm ghetto poor
I snort me some ghetto caine, it messed up my ghetto veins
But I don't even know why, (Why?) Cause its a ghetto thang

Chorus

I walk in the ghetto rain, my ghetto ??? gone insane
I need the ghetto bang, so I cop me some Nightrain
I'm down with my ghetto crime, I'm doin my ghetto time
It got me goin crazy, I'm out of my ghetto mind
I heard me a ghetto blast, straight to his ghetto head
Look in the newspaper, Backstabber is ghetto dead
This is the ghetto scene, but still I don't understand
That's the way it is, when you dealin with a ghetto man

Before you open your eyes and realize you've been shot nigga
Leavin niggas bloody is the nuttiest that you read about
Talk your shit and cross the click and get yo bitch ass knocked out
Cause we don't give a fuck about where you from
So motherfuck yo rep
You can get yo shit blown off
If you just take another step

Stands the tower with the chrome piece

Represent Dayton Avenue but bitches its a Dayton thang
The Rap Capone was gone now he's home and free and makin change
Rollin through yo city
See that's the way it shoul've been
Not to say it wasn't
But you boys ain't no could've beens

Bang to the boogie of the motherfuckin punches
Been ridin on these and them hoes come in bunches
All up on my snakeskin the game I shoot is drastic

So hoarse that shit you talkin bout and we can squash the drama

Bootleg:

Gang related you hated, AK blastin assassin
Tried to run but got caught, caught with yo Nike's unfastened
Playa hated and waited, you searched for death and you found it
Tried to run and get help, found out yo spot was surrounded
Adversaries a victim, of gunplay where I stay
I refused to be murdered, the rules of death I obey
Twist a ??? smoke em all, lets have a ball when we kill them
Scream out Dayton for life, right at that moment you drill them
Never gave a fuck about nothin, but smokin weed gettin drunk
Snortin cocaine in the club, paranoid and shot me a punk
I'm just a victim of livin, givin the best that I got
Disrespectin my clan, can get you killed on the spot
I'm just a soldier that's huntin, wearin my army fatigues
Betta watch yo mouth when you see me
Cause I can make that bitch bleed
Johnny Cochrane can help, in a trial I inflict
On any bitch that's a victim, caught in a Dayton conflict
Murder them all is the message, that's what i yellin and screamin
Tears of pain starts to fall, from all the drama i'm bringing
Stop the Al Capone, deadliest overall
Smokin sherm got me trippin, I'll smash yo face through a wall
Hand grenades and artillery, got me ready to kill
Apology is accepted, but bitch I'm killin you still
Got some beef bring it on, the Rap Capone here to cook it
I'm a villain that's killin, livin a lifestyle that's crooked
Before I starve, I'm a steal
Before I die, I'm a kill
Puncture yo lungs with a
I bust yo head with blue steel

The Dayton Family,"Hey, do you remember when Matt Hinkle started it all
Dayton family 1990, invested the first g's to ever let us hit the studio,
Fo'get it, let me just ask you these questions, check it

Do you remember the clique was breaking you off back in December
Surrender, you rappers ain't got no skills, you just pretenders
We heartless, we takin' you out the game and that's regardless
Them partners, they fuckin' it up again and plus they fault us
Remember, the niggas that reppin' the ave they drop them bolo's
Or fold those, we spendin' them dates instead of them mo mos
We tiptoes, do you remember the way that we ripped those, like 4-4's
We breakin' it down so fuck you hoes
Do you remember Shoestring, but fuckin' it up cold as the winter
Remember you rappers be runnin' your mouths, but you all beginners
Quit actin, you bitches been suckin' my dick but now you packin and jackin'
Fuckin' around with us, you hoes subtractin'
Remember when dope was whoopin' yo ass from start to ending
Stop bending, we bustin' you up again yo head we sending
Keep walkin', we done check yo nuts before but you still talkin' and stalkin'
Quit suckin' up on my dick bitch, you ain't barkin'
I said it, I'm chasin' you up and out and down you headed, get leaded
Fuckin' around with Dayton bitch I'll go get it
Remember the honkies that finish you off just like a fender
You tender, stickin' you in yo neck 'cause our agenda, you leakin'
Robbin' you for yo shit, you know we creepin', you peekin'
Checkin' us up and down 'cause we some heathens
Bootzilla, blastin' on these bitches, we some killas
From the Dorseys to the Millers

Do you remember when the days were short and the nights were long
Do you remember holdin' on even though your daddy was gone
Do you remember when mama was mama and daddy in one
(Do you remember) Time moves on, but it's too late for some

Now it begun in 1991, Dayton Family tape out
E-40 dropped that cap and saved a home for fools with no clout
I remember rappin' under these streetlights when shit was cool
Or battle rappin' in the hallways of a fellow middle school
It wasn't polite to do cocaine in public if you was cute and pretty
Once when my mind dropped and that shit stopped, fucked up the whole city
Do you remember the days and nights when you were broke and lonely
No money, everyone inside your household was hungry, and bumy
I remember my neighbor was telling me to watch my mouth
Our lights was out, we runnin' extension cords from house to house
And fuck some cable, we had barely drug in a dining room table
Hella hot main-meals, chicken pot pies
Remember runnin' with gang bangers and fuckin' up tramp-ass-hoes
Mama I ain't goin' to school today wearin these same old clothes
Do you remember the look in her eye when she made you a meal
And you didn't eat it, and all them tears she shed
Beside your bed over things that you needed
I still remember the way that I felt when I picked up a gun
I still remember the tears that I shed when my cousin was blasted with one
Do you remember the way that you felt when you walked out of prison
Or do you remember the pain that you felt
From them sendin you back for no reason
I still remember the way that the ball bounce
Insufficient bank accounts
Guns and triggas is all that counts
I'm robbin' you bitches for different amounts
I'm losin' myself and I can't be found
The niggas out now are still firing rounds
Stuck on the ground, my son's outta town
September eleventh has swallowed me now

Do you remember when the days were short and the nights were long
Do you remember holdin' on even though your daddy was gone
Do you remember when mama was mama and daddy in one
(Do you remember) Time moves on, but it's too late for some

Do you remember when the days were short and the nights were long
Do you remember holdin' on even though your daddy was gone
Do you remember when mama was mama and daddy in one
(Do you remember) Time moves on, but it's too late for some

Do you remember when niggas was sellin' rocks on yo block
Do you remember weed and dopers whether you like us or not
Do you remember when back was breakin' you off with the goods
Do you remember rollin' the caravan with all of that wood

The Dayton Family,"[Shoestring - talking]
I'm ready to tell you my secret now
I see dead people, but they don't know that they're dead
And sometimes, when it get real cold, that means they're mad

[Shoestring - singing]
Can't go to sleep I hear a beat, it sounded just like feet
Jump off my seat, see they hit my window, cause I gots the beat
I've seen a shadow pulling cattle from an early battle
I've seen this snake up in my shoe and all I heard was rattle (rattle sound)

Picked up the phone and it exploded like a fucking bomb
I'm seeing shadows biting me like they was Jeffrey Dahm
So many clicks, so many crews trying to blow my fuse
So many shadows in my yard that I feel abused (gong sound)

I'm hearing voices in my head and I can see a tread
I'm seeing scores, a pitbull and he's smelling dead
Slipped on my slippers, the ones with the chromed zippers
Knocked out a shadow in my room, all these Jack the Rippers

I fight with tigers, the shadows say they're Michael Myers
Just like Jack Nickleson played ""The Wolf"" I hear my neighbors driers
All this pain in my brain makes me go insane
I'm hearing chains and tracks and running trains (train running, gong sound)

A lot of these soldiers in my kitchen with their bloody blades
No hands, no knives, just bodies and their hand grenades
I started ducking, them soldiers started busting at me
Flashbacks when I was two father hollered at me

Hearing whistles the click from pistols got me live annoyed
Past beef won't let me rest, I live like Sleepy Froyd
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow (echos, gong sound)

[Bootleg - talking]
We're all walking in the valley of the shadow of death
So concentrate on your family, friends and loved ones
Because you never know when there's a shadow

[Chorus: Kalonda, Ryan]
Shadow, every time I turn around there's a shadooooow
Though I walk through the valley of a shadooooow (gong sound)
Life's too short to take for granted fearing shadooooow
I can't take this pain I'm feeling from these

[Bootleg]
Woke up, hopped out the bed this morning, felt somebody watching
Opened my door no one was there I swear I hear'em knocking
Cocking my pistol cause I'm paranoid and in a zone
Somebody said whip me, but I know I'm home alone (gong sound)

Jumped in the shower, trying to wash away this eary feeling
Walked out my bathroom seeing shadows dancing on the ceiling
Put on my clothes and smoked a cigarette and brushed my grill
My pitbull Puppy barking at so what I know ain't real (dogs barking)

Turned on my T.V. watching CNN, I heard a boom (explosion)
Two shadows having sex, I hear'em fucking in my room
Exit my residence the only face's a gust of wind (wind whistling)
Too hard for wind, a shadow's what it must have been

Ain't no such things as ghosts, I'm tripping dawg and I know it
Walked towards my car, the horn went off, a shadow had to blow it (car honks)
I need a drink to think and sort out all these weird events
I killed a man, my life's been haunted ever since

I can't believe the shit I'm seeing turning up my bottle
I keep my eyes and I'll rip you, I swear I'm being followed
Can't goto sleep at night unless I take a sleeping pill
Reflections in the mirror fucking with my head for real (gong sound)

I never thought that there was nothing wrong with how I think
Until my momma told me: 'Leg, go see a shrink!
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow

[Chorus]

[Bootleg - talking]
I thank God every morning when I wake up
'Cause you never know when you're gonna walk out your front door
And get murdered in your driveway
So I'll be telling you this: Keep your mind on your family, friends, and foes

'Cause most niggas is hoes (gong sound)
And they shoot you cause you bawling more than they is
So stay out them whole in the Warclubs
Nigga show love to your family and friends
And get your ass, fuck'em

There were houses on the hill
And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm

Didn't know what I was I looking for

Leaves off steam that colors our white sheets

From Beelzebubba
(c) 1988
I've got some buddies and we all drink bleach
You know we practice what we preach
We're not a drunken bunch of frat boys drunk on beer
Or a stoned bunch of hippies with no careers
I wanna drink bleach with a Georgia Peach
My pals and I all drink Clorox
Or eat Snowy right out of the box
Teenage suicide rate shot high and we
Understand the reason why
Bleach does more than whiten socks
Don't you wanna hang out with the bleach boys baby
In a land where ministers murder golf pros?
Don't you wanna drink some bleach tonight?
Maybe there'll be a party at the beach
We'll bitch about life and chug-a-lug bleach
No ones getting high and no one's getting drunk
We got a case off bleach stashed in the trunk.
I wanna die with clorox within reach.
I'm very proud of the respect I've earned
And my voice is very deep 'cause my throat got burned.
Bleach keeps you young so I've been told
'cause no one who drinks it lives to be old
Drink it with a chaser is the first thing I learned.
Don't you wanna hang out with the bleach boys baby
In a land where midgets run for mayor?
Don't you wanna drink some bleach tonight?
I had 26 friends in the beginning
But now it seems our numbers are thinning
Some people drive fast others love to bet
Still others snort coke in a private jet.
But drinking bleach is my way of winning.

Sell our offspring to some dirty old men
Let's play Big Black at 3 AM
And tell the neighbors they can all get fucked

I'm sure that I am gonna die

Down the street there's an accident
I hear that the bodies can still be seen
Let's call the sheriff a cock-sucker
See if he's read ""The Killer Inside Me""

Maybe pollute their blood line

At the daycare center run by ex-cons

The Dead Milkmen,"You know what, Stuart, I LIKE YOU. You're not like the other
People, here, in the trailer park.

Oh, don't go get me wrong. They're fine people, they're
Good Americans. But they're content to sit back, maybe
Watch a little Mork and Mindy on channel 57, maybe kick
Back a cool, Coors 16-ouncer. They're good, fine people,
Stuart. But they don't know ... what the queers are doing
To the soil!

You know that Jonny Wurster kid, the kid that delivers papers
In the neighborhood. He's a foreign kid. Some of the neighbors
Say he smokes crack, but I don't believe it.

Anyway, for his tenth birthday, all he wanted was a Burrow Owl.
Kept bugging his old man. ""Dad, get me a burrow owl. I'll never
Ask for anything else as long as I live."" So the guy
Breaks down and buys him a burrow owl.

Anyway, 10:30, the other night, I go out in my yard, and there's
The Wurster kid, looking up in the tree. I say, ""What are
You looking for?"" He says ""I'm looking for my burrow owl.""
I say, ""Jumping Jesus on a Pogo Stick. Everybody knows
The burrow owl lives. In a hole. In the ground. Why the hell do you
Think they call it a burrow owl, anyway?"" Now Stuart, do you
Think a kid like that is going to know what the queers are
Doing to the soil?

I first became aware of this about ten years ago, the summer
My oldest boy, Bill Jr. died. You know that carnival comes into
Town every year? Well this year they came through with a ride
Called The Mixer. The man said, ""Keep your head, and arms, inside
The Mixer at all times."" But Bill Jr, he was a DAAAREDEVIL, just
Like his old man. He was leaning out saying ""Hey everybody,
Look at me! Look at me!"" Pow! He was decapitated! They found
His head over by the snow cone concession.

A few days after that, I open up the mail. And there's a pamphlet
In there. From Pueblo, Colorado, and it's addressed to Bill, Jr.
And it's entitled, ""Do you know what the queers are doing to our
Soil?""

Now, Stuart, if you look at the soil around any large US city,
There's a big undeground homosexual population. Des Moines, Iowa,
For an example. Look at the soil around Des Moines, Stuart.
You can't build on it; you can't grow anything in it. The government
Says it's due to poor farming. But I know what's really going on,
Stuart. I know it's the queers. They're in it with the aliens.
They're building landing strips for gay Martians, I swear to
God.

People, here in this trailer park.",Stuart,1988

She dropped her laundry off at school
And hung her children on the clothesline to dry
She's throwing trash in her simming pool
She's pouring chlorine on her lawn
You might think she needs a pair of glasses
But, no, my friend you're wrong

Or in the life that it supplies
This should not strike you as a mystery
For she has dollar signs in her eyes
She's crashing her car in an intersection

She's walking round and round in a shopping mall
As if she had no sight
Dreams are only clouds
That form and dissipate

And plunged into his soles
Filling his dirty socks with tiny bloody holes.
There's an old man who says that he came
>From the same town as my dad
He told me of his house and why it smelled so bad
Small furry creatures had crawled in the spaces
In between the walls
They died and they decayed
And I guess that's really all
Dead little creatures mean the end of the world
There was a man who told me a story about a conspiracy
He told me how it started
And what it meant to me

Controlled by UFO's

And you lose track of time
In this big scary place
Always a lot to do
But of course it's easier in your mind
In this big scary place
Big scary place

There's too much space
There's not enough space
In this big scary place
You can go outside
If you really want
In this big scary place
In this big scary place

But when you see
The eye in the sky
Make sure you hide
In this big scary place
The days inch along
And you lose track of time
In this big scary place
Always a lot to do
But it's easier in your mind
In this big scary place

Everywhere you go
Everything you do
Everything you know
Everything you knew
Is swallowed alive
Devoured by time
Right from your mind
In this big scary place

Move down the street
Only shadows form
In this big scary place
Lock the door tight
From the outside light
In this big scary place



",Big Scary Place,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"Please let me tell you
They own our homes, they own our banks
We take out loans to buy them tanks
They own our children, they own our pets
The owned Elvis and Bernhard Goetz
They own our rugs and our flower pots
There ain't nothin' they haven't got
They own the papers and the TV's
The water works, record companies

Let me remind you
They own the talk shows
They make the rules
They own Geraldo and Donahue
They own the state, they own the church
They pick the winners on Star Search
They own the Christians, they own the Jews
They own the Moslems, Mormons, too
They put the holes in our socks
They put that snake in my mail box

From the halls of Montezuma, to the shores of Tripoli
We are all tools of the conspiracy
From the littlest baby to the biggest V.I.P.
We are all tools of the conspiracy

Run to the window, they're coming to get you
Hide in the basement, they're coming to get you
Flee to the rooftop, they're coming to get you
Don't go outside, no don't let them get you

Someone should tell you,
They own the CIA and the IRS
They tell us where to shop and how to dress
They own the workers, they own the boss
They know what's in the secret sauce
They own the drugs, they own the narcs
We all know they own Dick Clark
They own it all, they own everything
They write the songs that make the whole world sing



",The Conspiracy Song,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"Are we not the living proof of the idiot God who placed us here
Are we not His dirty children, His unwashed sons who He holds dear

Are we not the proof that there may've been another creator
If this is the ultimate truth, it had to come out sooner or later

I've looked for the reason why we're here
I've kept on searching until it was clear
I've looked for excuses - can't find no other
We must be the product of God's kid brother

Their ivy halls are closed to us
We scrape to survive and we taste the dust
The things that we weren't meant to know
Are spoke of in places where we can't go
So don't tell me you still find it hard to believe
That we were made by a different God

Are we not the proof that there may've been another creator
Let's run to the volcano and toss a virgin in the crater

I've looked for the reason why we're here
I've kept on searching until it was clear
I've looked for excuses - can't find no other
We must be the product of God's kid brother

Their ivy halls are closed to us
We scrape to survive and do what we must
The things that we weren't meant to know
Are spoke of in places where we can't go
So don't tell me you still find it hard to believe
That we were made by a different God

Maybe there are two Gods
A perfect God who made all those perfect people
And another God who made the rest of us
And maybe, just maybe, somewhere there's a Heavenly choir
That sings off key

Are we not the proof that there may've been another creator
We'll dodge our way through life and hope for something greater

I've looked for the reason why we're here
I've kept on searching until it was clear
I've looked for excuses - can't find no other
We must be the product of God's kid brother



",God's Kid Brother,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"Here he comes, he's coming down the street
With his drunken wife and his kids that he beats
He's gonna tell you that life is hard
Then he'll dump his trash in your backyard

You'll here lots of talk about the racially pure
When Mr. X moves in next door
Just take a walk on the ignorant side
And you'll get to see what goes on in his mind
Just take a walk on the ignorant side
And you'll get to see through his eyes

There he goes, now he's on the lawn
With his Sans-a-belt pants and Hush Puppies on
The sky is blue and the bees are buzzin'
He must be the product of two first cousins
He's got a rifle and a low I.Q.
He doesn't close his mouth when he chews his food

Oh please, dear God, strike him dead
Aim a lightning bolt at his head
Oh please, Reverend Sun Yung Moon
Send someone to kill him soon

Oh Mohammed, prophet of Allah
Run him over with his own Impala
Oh please, kill him, Shirley MacLaine
Take a pipe and bash in his brain

Here he comes, driving around the block
Sticking pamphlets in your mailbox
Inviting your kids to aryan youth camp
Moving his ammo when his basement gets damp
Training his dog to attack your cat
Hitting your mower with a baseball bat

Here he comes into your life
With about as much charm as a Bowie knife
He'll swim in your pool when you're not home
And steal your tools and your garden gnome
Here he comes, coming down the street
With his drunken wife and his kids that be beats
",Here Comes Mr. X,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"Start off in the womb, yeah, where it's nice and warm
Things are lookin' good, then it's time to be born
Doctor pulls you out and slaps you on the butt
And before you know it your umbilical cord is cut
Drag you from your mama, wheel you down the hall
Room full of babies, who just lie there and bawl
Lyin' in a diaper, feelin' like a fool
Things'll get much worse when it's time to go to school

You're crammed into a classroom with 30 other kids
Good you get nothing - bad you get hit
Nobody likes you and the classroom is cold
Stuck with a textbook that's 35 years old
Bullies beat you up, teacher puts you down
Sittin' in the corner don't dare make a sound
If you learn one thing, better learn to curse
'cause from now on, life gets even worse

Now that you are 30, better get a job
You will buy a house, you will buy a Saab
Get up in the morning, you will feel like dyin'
As the years go rollin' by, you will lose your mind
You were once a young man, now you're turnin' grey
Listening to people talkin' 'bout the Judgment Day

Now you've retired, goodbye to the job
And you've lost your teeth, goodbye corn-on-the-cob
Look back on your life and all the things you did
Standin' in the yard, yellin' at the kids
Now you're kickin' back, you don't have a care
Time to see the world from your Craft-matic chair

You'll move to Arizona where all the old folks go
You will vote Republican, you'll see UFO's

Then one day you die, find yourself in Hell
With the lake-o'-fire and that awful brimstone smell
You were really good, but you weren't good enough
Living ain't so easy, dying's really tough
Now look around, see how it's gonna be
Yes, my friend, you're screwed for all eternity



",How It's Gonna Be,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"Would I be amused
Would you be impressed
That I had the power
To put a hole into your chest?
When the kids are crying
And the welfare check's been spent
Would I rob a liquor store
To get some money for the rent?

If I had a gun

Would I start smoking Marlboros?
Would I stop smoking Kents?
Would I gain some new respect?
Would I gain some confidence?
Would I suddenly go crazy
And shoot my family?
And see myself years later
On some crime show on TV

If I had a gun

Would I wear it in a holster?
Would I keep it concealed?
Would I put it on the table
Every time that I'm misdealed?
When I hear a nearby gunshot
When I'm up at night alone
Would I feel a little safer
Here in my urban home?

If I had a gun



",If I Had a Gun,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"I saw a cigar shaped flying ship
It landed outside on my lawn
You poked your head out of a door
And said, ""Hurry up get on.""
I've never seen the sight before
The world became a shrinking ball
I asked where you were taking me
You said, ""Shut up and you will see.""

CHORUS
Waves of time they rock us back and forth
There's no telling if we'll stay on course

We raced across the galaxy
Away from all our ugliness
I felt beautiful and free
Out where the devil can't exist
I felt a burst of energy
Hot white light poured from your eyes
We sped into infinity
I felt beautiful and free

CHORUS

Now I'm no longer in my life
I've left all my friends behind
Now letters don't get past my door
I can't really read them anymore
You took me to another world
Where time ceases to hold sway
And computers contain the missing key
To life's most sacred mystery

The secret of life is no secret at all
For secrets hold death and
Lies only build walls



",The Secret of Life,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"The world's full of danger
You do what you can
You feel like a stranger
Like Shaft in Greenland

Travel around and meet all the people
Don't be afraid to touch them lightly
Travel around and meet all the people
Speak to them so politely
Travel around and meet all the people
Work up the nerve to shake their hands
Travel around and meet all the people
See how it feels to be Shaft in Greenland

The world is your oyster
So rake in the clams
And have an adventure
Like Shaft in Greenland

Travel around and see the tundra
Don't be afraid to get out of your car
Travel around and see the tundra
A little bit of Shaft goes real far
Travel around and see the tundra
Dig for dinner in the cold, damp sand
Travel around and see the tundra
See how it feels to be Shaft in Greenland

He was big and bad, so he traveled to Greenland
He was big and bad, so he traveled to the land of the midnight sun
He was big and bad, so he traveled to Greenland

And nobody got a tan

The world is a ghetto
A rusted tin can
So pack a stiletto
Like Shaft in Greenland



",Shaft in Greenland,1992
The Dead Milkmen,"I had a dream you came back to my house
You changed your mind
I had a dream you came back to my house
To spend some time

You said you'd only stay a week
You brought two cats for me to keep
And told me not to feed them tuna or they'd throw up

I fed them tuna and they threw up
For hours and hours and hours and hours
I was amazed at all the stuff
That came from those little bodies of theirs

It was puffy like a sponge
The color of the sidewalk
And it smelled like the dirty rags beneath the sink

I had a dream you came back to my house
And robbed me blind
You took my stereo, CD's, and tapes and books
You left nothing behind

I woke up and you were next to me
But I knew it was just a dream
I woke up again, you were a thousand miles away

They are separate people, with different personalities
They might not like the things I like
They might not eat the same food
Or they might not want to go to the places where I want to go

There are others, and then there is myself

There are men, and there are women
Often they don't get along
I must try to get along with everyone
No matter how stupid they might be
Or how asinine their opinions are

I must learn to love everybody

That they make my flesh crawl

And I will cook them a ravioli dinner
From a can I found, in Mexico City

I believe that the government is in control
I believe there's a Heaven up in the sky
I believe that my neighbors are human spies

This is the start of a 6 part plan
Which will take me into the next century
In the coming years, I will stop eating with my hands

I will let the dog out of the closet for some fresh air
I will put away the rubber mask
The cub-scout uniform
And yes, finally, even the cauliflower

I believe that the government is reading my mind
I believe there's a god who loves us all

Waits in the garden
And everybody knows that he's praying for Stan

All the total strangers on the mountain tops
Quarrel, babble, sometimes they dance
Clouds on the horizon tell of impending doom
You know they seem to be saying that we don't stand a chance

Large chunks of evidence were chucked into my shirt
As the navy doctor fell asleep a tense fog? surrounded us
Brilliant lights ignite in the sky
Everyone is beautiful if not somewhat unrecognisable

Sometimes it's as simple as the stakes on a wall
Sometimes it's as hard as a renaissance lute
Stuffed animals into baby ?
You know they'll even laugh at the people we shoot

The tender young boy with the life affirming needs
Still waits in the garden
And everybody's sure that he's praying for Stan

Even long lost poets like to regenerate
With new arms and legs they sort the mail
Cast iron officers wander around
The president hopes that he'll grow a tail

Is it just a waste of water, when your widow cries?

Oh don't tell me you've never heard of the Shaggs?

If the atheists are right then I have no need to worry
For there is no great being whose favour I must curry
And I'll be going nowhere once they lay me in the earth
So why waste a Sunday by going to church?

If you really wanted to
You could run out right now and buy a Shaggs record

If the atheists are wrong then I've got a bill that's due
So should I be a Christian or a Moslem or a Jew
Should I spend all day just praying on my knees
And searching through the world for a deity to please

A Shaggs record would be a sound investment

If the atheists are right then I have no need to worry
For there is no great being whose favour I must curry

The fat peoples want what the skinny peoples got
The skinny peoples want what the fat peoples got
But all I've ever wanted is what the Shaggs got
Dat Ding(?) and my pal, Foot Foot



",When I Get to Heaven,1995
The Dead Milkmen,"Life sucks, then you die
And your soul gets sucked into the sky
Birds sing, I wonder why
You eat a bowl of cereal and sigh

You're late for your class
You're walkin' the halls without a pass

Big deal
Big deal

Time flies, time crawls
You're a prisoner trapped between its claws
Life sucks, sometimes
You gotta learn to live between the lines

Your feet are on the ground
But the world keeps spinning you around

Big deal
Big deal

Don't be worried, don't be down
I'll be your stupid happy clown
Keep your chin up in the air
Shake your body like you just don't care

Birds sing, babies cry
Life sucks and then you die

Big deal
Big deal
Big deal

The Dead Milkmen,"We can stand naked on the corner of Main Street, baby, and
Let everybody slow down and take a look
You can drive your Cadillac to the library, baby, and maybe read the
Last ten pages of an Agatha Christie book
You can feed my cat to my dog
And turn around and feed my dog to my horse
You can screw the whole damn royal family, baby, until they
All get a divorce

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, you can do anything you want to do, baby
I swear it will not bother me
Cause, baby, you know
Baby, you know you've got to
You've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

You can burn down the orphanage, baby, over there on the
Poor side of town
You can go to the circus, baby, frighten the elephants
See if you can get them to maybe,
Trample a clown
You can steal the prize out of my box of cereal, baby, and
Replace it with a rat
You can walk up to someone who might be a little overweight
And be kinda sensitive about it and say
""Oh my god, you're really fat!""

Live and let live, baby
That's the cornerstone
The very essence of my philosophy
And baby
Baby, you know
You know you've got to
You've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

I'm gonna play my harmonica
Since i charge $35 a note I'm not gonna play much of my harmonica
You see the blues
The blues isn't an art form
It's not a type of music
The blues is a product
Not unlike computer chips or tampons
The blues is a way for white kids to feel
That they understand the feelings of black people
Without ever having to meet any of them
The blues is all these things and more
Available for $19.95

Oh, baby
Baby, you can do whatever you want to do, baby
Baby, you know it's not going to bother me
Cause baby you know
You know you've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

Here comes the solo!
Ooh, and what a solo it is
You know
That might not be the blues but it sure makes me sad

Listen, in the distance
The sound of Leadbelly rolling in his grave

I've said it before, baby
I'll say it again
Live and let live
The very essence, the cornerstone
The summit of my philosophy
Baby, baby, you know
Baby, you know you've got to
You've got to be what you're going to be

A blues man needs a nickname
And everybody calls me Two Shoes
Cause i always wear two shoes
I know it's not much of a nickname
But by the time i got around to getting my nickname
All the good ones were taken
Take for example Blind Lemon Lipschitz
Blind Lemon Lipschitz gouged out his own eyes with his thumbnails
So he could be called blind lemon
It's true, don't laugh
He felt the very essence of the blues, calling him from within
And he felt that contract too

Oh, baby
Baby, you know
Baby, you know you can do whatever you do
I don't care
I don't give a damn, baby
It's not gonna bother me
Cause baby, baby, be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be	-be

The Dead Milkmen,"The girl with the strong arm has saved world cinema
Saved it from itself I like to think
The girl with the strong arm restores old paintings
Including one she found under the sink

The girl with the strong arm killed an innocent bystander
That leaves you with a mental picture
The girl with the strong arm drank straight whiskey
But I understand that she will still quotes scriptures

All poor gardeners pooled their resources
During the week long festival
Kneeling down to think about the future
Racing you would be quite dull

After many years of exodus
The hatchery fish run in rich rivers
I'm afraid the memories regarding Nixon
Are a little scary

The girl with the strong arm threatens the Quakers
They all say she's mad you know
The girl with the strong arm has an abrasive accent
She uses words like Eskimo

The girl with the strong arm stands beside a woman
Whose many parts add up to one
The girl with the strong arm makes political commentary
And yet I feel that it's all in fun

In your nightmares rub around
Those gay white males line up at church
Drink their coffee pretend to be a cowboy
Set aside an hour to search

Pulling up leaves like little Russian problems
Is now the tasty thing to do
The unattractive [Incomprehensible] cloying sweetness is you

The most popular sidearm with Canadian woodsmen
Is the blue steel woodchuck gun
Manufactured in Atlanta, Georgia
By the firm of Youse and Son

I find no fault with the two young lovers
Who dine all night on the candied eels
Then dance till dawn to a big band music
And the sound of baboon squeals

All last night I stared at jelly
Till I knew love was all around
Traveling through O'Hare airport
Dressed like a circus clown

The girl with the strong arm has started licking batteries
And that's kinda strange even for her
The girl with the strong arm would like to be a banker
But I don't think she's really sure

Using strings just to pull things over
Really keeps the party going
I'm not sure but the history of Denmark
Maybe the only thing worth knowing

Has it ever dawned on you
That car accidents just might be art
And all those kids in the foster care
Just don't think you're very smart

Down by the gunner on mother's day
In a state of perpetual bliss
Stands the man with the lisp

The Dead Milkmen,"Tuesday, yes, it was Tuesday
When I saw my congressman coming out of the titty bar
He didn't look like my congressman but that's okay
Nobody really looks like themselves anymore

I think it's got something to do with that crap
They've been pouring into the water
I decided it might be wise to follow the congressman
Just to see what he was up to

After all, my tax dollars do pay his salary
The congressman got into a taxi, so I hailed a taxi
Despite the obvious dangers involved
And the colored voices in my head began to sing

All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can hear it all, yes, I can hear it all
All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can even hear the little insects crawl

The congressman was in taxi number 23
And I was in cab 17
But numbers are meaningless
In this kind of cat and squid game

My driver was an Aries
And he laughed when I said, ""Follow that cab""
And he kept laughing
Until he saw the cold blue steel of Little Elvis

""Keep your god-damn hands off that radio"", I warned him
""I work for the government""
This is actually a half truth
I'm really a bike courier

But I make a lot of deliveries
To government offices
That's where I heard about the cheese
And the colored voices in my head kept singing

All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can hear it all, yes, I can hear it all
All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can even hear the little insects crawl

There's this super secret government program called
""Operation the cheese stands alone""
It's the congressmen's pet project
They claim that they're giving surplus cheese to the needy

I, of course, have my suspicions
After 15 very quiet minutes
The congressman's cab pulled up outside a warehouse
I had the Aries circle around the building and drop me off

He seemed to be grasping the importance of my mission
Since he said I didn't have to pay him
As long as I promised to stay very far away from him and his taxi
I swear, some people just don't want to get involved

All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can hear it all, yes, I can hear it all
All I gotta do is put my ear to the wall
And I can even hear the little insects crawl

So I walked into that cold dark place
Little Elvis drawn and ready for action
I too was ready, ready for the moment
When I would be a real American

All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can have it all, yes, I can have it all
All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can even make the little insects crawl

All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can have it all, yes, I can have it all
All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can even make the little insects crawl

All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can have it all, yes, I can have it all
All I gotta do is bang my head on the wall
And I can even make the little insects crawl

Get it fuckin' drunk when it's learning how to walk.

Tell it that the boogie man will clobber it to death.
Don't let it take a shower so its friends will not come near,

Can Venom really blow the spot? Come on, now, stop
Ask yourself what chicks is keepin' it hot
Fitted bomb shit through your boom box, ridin' through your block

The Deal,"Story 'bout a friend of mine
Sick of trying all the time
The batlle rages in his mind

Silenced by the demon as the young man begins to weep
Losin' his life to bottled lies and begins to admit defeat
Thinkin' where did he go wrong as the demon tears out his soul
His flesh is lyin' to his heart it's saying he's got no place to go

He tried his own way again and again
Just can't win
Fighting a battle he was sure he couldn't win
Pondering his past and questioning his life
Just can't win
Losing a war he knows he just can't win

Thought about the friends he's lost along the way
Went crazy shot down dead ends and desolate streets
Givin' up was easy when there is nothin' but distrust and deceit
Always having to watch his back in fear as he's dragging his feet",The Attack,2002

Reasons leading you through here
Perished matriarchal bonds
Failing innocence of love

In the hands of ghosts we're never responsible
Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

Pray'd I would leave this place someday
Joined to alarm from long ago now unconcerned
Euphorically floating upon wax wings where is the sun?
I still see her face; her beauty, her grace
Transfixed like a light in front of me
It follows my soul
And swallows me whole

Wait to see what you're meant to see
The veil lifts when you expose your soul

Fatal fascination breeds a bloom of misery
Helpless hiding tongues, bathed in revulsion
Here lies possibility wilting premature

But the right hand hates the left and the sea's upset with the sky
So we press on in spite of the spite
Happiness is a knife when the worlds on its side and your minds on fire

And I can remedy all who've wronged before me

There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the trombone""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the clarinet""
And he told everybody ""when you hear the music of the horn
You must fall down and worship the idol""
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the children of Israel would not bow down
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
I said, you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it ought to be
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego

Well, they couldn't burn a hair on the head of
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego
Laughin' and talkin' while the fire jumpin' 'round

And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon

The Decca Mixed Chorus,"Jonah was a man who got a word from the Lord
""Go and preach the Gospel to the sinful land""
But he got on a ship and he tried to get away
And he ran into a storm in the middle of the sea

Now the Lord, He made the waves just roll so high
The ship begin to sink and they all begin to cry
So they pulled old Jonah out of the hold
And they dumped him in the water just to lighten up the load

Now the Lord made a whale, long and wide
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
And he swallowed up Jonah, hair and hide
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Now Jonah started to pray in the belly of the whale
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
He repented of his sins like a man in jail
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Now Jonah must've been a bad man; he must of been a sinner
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
'Cause when the whale got him down, he didn't like his dinner
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
Mmm, Lord, mmm, Lord

Well, he swum around the ocean, sick as he could be
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
And after three days, whoops, he had to set him free
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish, mmm?

So the whale spit Jonah out onto dry land
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?
And he went on to preaching like a righteous man
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?

Then the people quit their sins when they heard him in the town
Lord, Lord, wasn't that a fish?

On her petticoats

In the jolly boat
See how they approach?

They grapple 'til she's safe within their keeping
A gag is placed between her lips
To keep her sorry tongue from any speaking
Or screamin'

Where the sailor's sorry racket
Calls for maidenhead
And she's scarce above the gunwales

The Decemberists,"There is a road that meets the road 
That goes to my house
And how it green grows there
And we've got special boots
To beat the path to my house
And it's careful and it's careful when I'm there

And I say your uncle was a crooked french Canadian
And he was gut-shot runnin' gin
And how his guts were all suspended in his fingers
And how he held 'em 
How he held 'em held, 'em in

And the water rolls down the drain, the water rolls down the drain, 
Oh what a lonely thing! in a lonely drain!

July, July, July! never seemed so strange

This is the story of the road that goes to my house
And what ghosts there do remain
And all the troughs that run the length and breadth of my house
And the chickens how they rattle chicken chains

And we'll remember this when we are old and ancient
Though the specifics might be vague
And I'll say your camisole was sprightly light magenta
When in fact it was a nappy blueish grey

And the water rolls down the drain
The blood rolls down the drain
Oh what a lonely thing
In a blood red drain

I was watching it for you 'til you came back in the fall. 
I guess I didn't do such a good job after all. 
I was feeling really sorry, Steven, and I spent all morning grieving. 

And everybody's saying that you'll take the news gracefully. 
Somehow, I don't think I'll be getting off that easily. 
     
I meant her no harm when I left her unlocked outside the Orange Street Food Farm. 
I was just running in, didn't think I'd be that long. 
I came back, she was gone and all that was there was some bored old dog, 
Leashed up to the place where your bicycle had been. 
I guess we'll never see poor Madelline again.
     
Let this be consolation, Steven, that all the while you were in England, 
I treated her with care and respect and gave her lots of love, 
And I was usually pretty good 'bout locking her up. Where has she gone? 
Well, I bet she's on the bottom of the French Town Pond, rudely abused on some heshner's joy ride. 
So I wrote you this song in the hopes that you'd forgive me even though it was wrong, 
Being so careless with a thing so great and taking your poor Madeline away.",Apology Song,2003
The Decemberists,"My mother was a Chinese trapeze artist
In pre-war Paris
Smuggling bombs for the underground.
And she met my father
At a fete in Aix-en-Provence.
He was disguised as a Russian cadet
in the employ of the Axis.
And there in the half-light
Of the provincial midnight
To a lone concertina
They drank in cantinas
And toasted to Edith Piaf
And the fall of the Reich.

My sister was born in a hovel in Burgundy 
And left for the cattle
But later was found by a communist
Who'd deserted his ranks
To follow his dream
To start up a punk rock band in South Carolina.
I get letters sometimes.
They bought a plantation
She weeds the tobacco
He offends the nation
And they write, ""Don't be a stranger, why'hear.""
""Sincerely, your sister.""

So my parents had me
To the disgust of the prostitutes
On a bed in a brothel.
Surprisingly raised with tender care
'Til the money got tight
And they bet me away
To a blind brigadier in a game
Of high stakes canasta.
But he made me a sailor
On his brigadier ship fleet.

From main mast to jib sheet.

I heard a strangled cry on the end of the line
Purloined in Petrograd
They were suspicious of where your loyalties lay
So I paid off a bureaucrat
To convince your captors they're to secret you away

And at the gate of the embassy
Our hands met through the bars
As your whisper stilled my heart
No, they'll never catch me now
No, they'll never catch me
No, they cannot catch me now
We will escape somehow
Somehow

Ah ah

And I dreamt one night
You were there in fours
Head held high
In uniform

When you resurfaced in a motorcar
And with the wave of an arm, you were there and gone",The Bagman's Gambit,2005

Corn cobs and candle wax for the buying
All down the day

And I must push my barrow all the day

Dressed all in corduroy

With his push cart
He calls down the day

Our ship's sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
It's ribs are ceiling beams
It's guts are carpeting
I guess we have some time to kill

You may not remember me
I was a child of three
And you, a lad of eighteen
But, I remember you
And I will relate to you
How our histories interweave
At the time you were
A rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money
On the whores and hounds
(Oh, oh)

You had a charming air
All cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
And so she took you in
Her sheets still warm with him
Now filled with filth and foul disease
As time wore on you proved
A debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother
A poor consumptive wretch
(Oh, oh)

And then you disappeared
Your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And then the magistrate
Reclaimed our small estate
And my poor mother lost her mind
Then, one day in spring
My dear sweet mother died
But, before she did
I took her hand as she, dying, cried:
(Oh, oh)

""Find him, find him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave""

It took me fifteen years
To swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
Until a priory
Took pity and hired me
To keep their vestry nice and neat
But, never once in the employ
Of these holy men
Did I ever, once turn my mind
From the thought of revenge
(Oh, oh)

One night I overheard
The prior exchanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
The captain of his ship
Who matched you toe to tip
Was known for wanton cruelty
The following day
I shipped to sea
With a privateer
And in the whistle
Of the wind
I could almost hear
(Oh, oh)

""Find him, find him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters
Drag him to a hole until he
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling
Of his grave

There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea
Always, your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed""

And then, that fateful night
We had you in our sight
After twenty months, it seemed
Your starboard flank abeam
I was getting my muskets clean
When came this rumbling from beneath
The ocean shook
The sky went black
And the captain quailed
And before us grew
The angry jaws
Of a giant whale

(Oh)

Don't know how I survived
The crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
But, oh, what providence
What divine intelligence
That you should survive
As well as me
It gives my eye great joy
To see your eyes fill with fear
To lean in close
And I will whisper
The last words you'll hear

Then tempest never, or weather dire
Could ever make our blissful living cease
No, but abiding in a steady, blessed peace
Together in harmony

And Lady Vanna and Lagia then
She who looms the thirty best
Would join us at the enchanter's behest

And there we'd talk of love without an end
To make those ladies happy in the sky
With Lapo enchanted too, and you and I",Sonnet,2011
The Decemberists,"Baby wants a new spin
Baby wants a broken heart
Hear you found a linchpin to keep it all from falling apart
But you keep on rollin'
You keep on rollin'

Better find a way
Better kick it from your big, brown eyes
Hear it tightens up when you fall after fifty tries
Like a ship at ocean
Like a ship at ocean
Like a ship at ocean
Like a ship at sea

You spit thick and you cross your heart
But the culvert's all run dry
From keeping shotgun shy, all arise
Just be mine tonight

So the dollar shot shoppers broke the law and they knocked you down
Better call the coppers if you need someone to push you around
But you keep on stealin'
You keep on stealin'
Yes, you keep on stealin'
Well, there's nothing left to steal

Witness to the arc towards the sun

Becomes a burden borne of all in one
And nobody, nobody knows

We are all our hands in holders
But meet this bold and brilliant sun
But this I swear to all

Upon a cliff that towers towards the trees
But every vessel pitching hard to starboard
Lay it's head on summer's freckled knees

Let the yoke fall from our shoulders
Don't carry it all don't carry it all

Laid upon the body of the boy

Before you left
When I could see your breath lead
Where you were going to

Maybe I should just let it be
And maybe it will all come back to me
Seeing, oh, January, oh

How I lived a childhood in the snow
And all my teens in tow
Stuffed in strata of clothes

Hail the winter days after dark
Wandering the gray memorial park
A fleeting beating of hearts

Heralding a summer's early sway
And all the bulbs all comin' in
To begin
The thrushes' bleeding battle with the wrens
Disrupts my reverie again

Pegging clothing on the line
Training jasmine how to vine
Up the arbor to your door
And more
Standing on the landing with the war
You shouldered all the night before

But once upon it
The yellow bonnets
Garland all the lawn
You were waking
Day was breaking
A panoply of song
And summer comes to Springville Hill

A barony of ivy in the trees
Expanding out its empire by degrees
And all the branches burst abloom
In the boom
Heaven sent this cardinal maroon
To decorate our living room

But once upon it
The yellow bonnets
Garland all the lawn
You were waking
Day was breaking
A panoply of song
And summer comes to Springville Hill

And years from now when this old light
Isn't ambling anymore
Will I bring myself to write
""I give my best to Springville Hill""

In the summer of my twenty-first year
And the bells rang for our wedding
Only now do I remember it clear
Alright, alright, alright

I was wedded and it whetted my thirst
Until her womb start spilling out babies
Only then did I reckon my curse
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

First came Isaiah with his crinkled little fingers
Then came Charlotte and that wretched girl Dawn
Ugly Myfanwy died on delivery
Mercifully taking her mother along
Alright, alright, alright

What can one do when one is widower
Shamefully saddled with three little pests
All that I wanted was the freedom of a new life
So my burden I began to divest
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright

Charlotte I buried after feeding her foxglove
Dawn was easy, she was drowned in the bath
Isaiah fought but was easily bested
Burned his body for incurring my wrath

Pale in a liminal moon

And dared breach your rippling pool

And drifted down the deepening cool
And all that I want is to fall in your shallows

And bank to bank a property lake
And you are my wild-eyed rusalka, my river bride

And here we will lie, you and I, 'neath the cold, dark sky

That grow on the bank side along the salt sea
But I being young, I heeded her none
So to the wild rushes the wind carried me

And to the wild rushes I came by and by
And there took my seat and dipped in my feet
When through the wild rushes, a voice sweetly cried

Come down, my little darling, come closer to me
The water is warm; it is salty and free
I long for your touch but I won't ask too much
And I, being foolish, walked in to my knees

Come down, little darling, and lay at my breast
Oh come a little closer and I'll do the rest

And I, being foolish, walked in to my chest

Come down, my little darling, oh farther come in
For deeper the water, the sweeter the sin
My lily lies here, if you'd only draw near
And I, being foolish, went in to my chin

Do you feel my arms around you so warm and so wet?

Broke off his horse's head 
Wept for his toy then cried with joy 
As his young playmate said 


Did you think I would leave you crying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Jack and don't be crying 
I can go just as fast with two 
When we grow up we'll both be soldiers 
And our horses will not be toys 
And I wonder if we'll remember 
When we were two little boys 


Long years had passed, war came so fast 
Bravely they marched away 
Cannon roared loud, and in the mad crowd 
Wounded and dying lay 
Up goes a shout, a horse dashes out 
Out from the ranks so blue 
Gallops away to where Joe lay 
Then came a voice he knew 


Did you think I would leave you dying 
When there's room on my horse for two 
Climb up here Joe, we'll soon be flying

We tracked him for a week or more
Through the swamp and through the hills
Till a rifle roared I cried ""My God
My partner has been killed""
I propped him by an ol' jack pine
And swore a solemn vow
""Lookout Henry Walker
It's you and me right now""
 
So then I started thinking
He could not be found
Then one day by a frozen lake
Like a fox he went to ground
And he tried to run
But the ice was thin
And he fell on through
I watched him as he sank and swore
""I'll put a curse on you""
 
I dragged my frozen partner
Through the ice and through the snow
I lost three fingers and a toe
To the frostbite don't you know
Though the years have come, the years have gone
I think about those times
When Northern lights are dancing
It makes me feel like crying

Chorus:
As the wolves were howling on the timberline
As the wolves were howling on the timberline",Henry Walker,1996
The Del McCoury Band,"He's up at morning at the crack of dawn

His high top shoes and his Levis on

He eats ham and egg and biscuit bread

He's in the woods time the sun gets red

 

He's a chain saw log skiddin' tree climbing, limb dodging truck driving ?rough old loggin' man

 

His skin is leather, has a steel backbone, 

He's stubborn as a mule and twice as strong 

He'll cut a hundred trees in an hour if he can

He won't back down he's a heck of a man

 

He's a chain saw log skiddin tree climbing, limb dodging truck driving rough ol' loggin man

 

He works in the sun and the rain and snow

He works in the winter when the cold wind blows

The reason why he works hard all week long

Is his little wife is waiting for his pay back home.

 

He's a chain saw log skiddin tree climbing, limb dodging truck driving rough ol' loggin man

He's a chain saw log skiddin tree climbing, limb dodging truck driving rough ol' loggin man
",Loggin' Man,1996
