Lil' Bow Wow,"They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

They're playing basketball
We love that basketball

Yeah, now basketball is my favorite sport
I love the way they dribble up and down the court
I keep it so fresh on the microphone
I like no interruption when the game is on
I like slam dunk, to take me to the hoop
My favorite play is the alley-oop
I like the pick-and-roll
I like the give-and-go
In this basketball, Bow Wow, let's go

I got the rock in my hands
ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Don't too many players get offers like me
Back and forth, I'll likely
Shake the checks off your Nikes
They almost had me in a suit at the draft
And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go blast too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They don't know if I'ma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look
See my game consist of a whole lotta
Moves you would think I learned from the Harlem Globetrotters
J.D. gon lead us to a ring
Fab and Bow Wow the only players that make cheerleaders want to sing

I got the rock in my hands
ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Now tell me were you in the joint
The night MJ scored sixty three points
When the Lakers won titles back to back
didn't give nobody, no kind of slack
When Vince Carter gave and stuck his arm in the rim
Everybody went crazy in the whole damn gym
Dikembe Mutombo standing tall
Playing D with desire, it's basketball

I got the rock in my hands
ain't no telling what I'm gonna do with it
When I come position I'ma act a fool with it
I might cross you up fake one way
Turn around and hit you with you with the MJ fadeaway
I'm throwing dime passes like J. Kidd
Taking cats to the rack
And I'm dunking on them like T. Mac
When I'm in the paint I play with that Alonzo style
I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles",Basketball [Album Version],2006
Lil' Bow Wow,"Hmm
Whoah

They can say, 
Anything they want to say
Try to bring me down, but I will not 
Allow anyone to succeed hanging clouds over me,
And they can try 
How to make me feel that I
Don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe or loose faith in my dreams

'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me

Oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no
Ay

Oh they
They can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to you pride, and just push them aside,
See I, 
I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they can not possess
Oh I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade

'Cause there's
There's light in me me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try
But they can't take that away from me

No, oh
They can't take this 
Precious love I'll always have inside me,
Certainly the Lord will guide me where I need to go

Woah, woah
They can say 
Anything they want to say
Try to bring me down 
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Although they do try
How to make me feel that I,
Don't matter at all,
But I refuse to fall,
Tell me what I believe or loose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly yes

They can try but they can't take that away from 
Me
From me
No, no, no, no, no, no",Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme),2011

These niggas hood-hoppers, don't give a bitch no options
I do this shit for my squadron, ain't got no time for no conference
I call up some real niggas, but they ain't 'bout that talkin'
I walk in wit' my bitch, fattest ass in the party

Aye French we in the club way too much, ya know what I'm sayin'?
You know we playin' with new bands, homeboy...

Started with a stack, then I got 5 mo' (do it right)
Could have bought a ball team, with all this money I blow
Walk in stalls, cause these hoes know I'm finna go retarded
Ballin hard no James Harden, Bentley truck to big to park it (skrrt)
Comma get for that work, gettin head blowin purp
One hand on this blunt, other hand up her skirt
Pussy sweet like apple juice, fuck her til her pussy loose
And when I'm done, pass her to my man, so Ben can see what that pussy do
And she touching herself, what you gone off a molly?
And she thick, and she finer than a mothafucka, lookin like tatted-up Holly
Fuck all night no strings attached, say no on love shit, girl this some fun shit

Yeah! Mike Jones! Who?  Mike Jones!
Where will I be at, five years from now
Five years from now
Five years from now

[Chorus: Lil' Bran]
Where would I go, who would I see in, five years from now
Tell me how will I live, will I raise some kids yeah, five years from now
Will I be locked down or will I be underground yeah, five years from now
Tell me what my future hold, it scares me not to know
what I'ma be doin', five years from now

[Mike Jones]
I live life daily, scared to make babies
It's hard to plan your future when the world goin' crazy
Kids with no food, who can they turn to
beside they own people, I swear this world evil
They see us on TV, they thinkin' we should be
The main ones providin' for our community
But the government is paid, dishin' out minimum wage
They don't care about the streets, as long as they get paid
My advice is please vote, don't take it as a joke
Cause five years from now the world could be gone in smoke
Now everybody's gone, cause they ain't stand strong
And vote for a leader that can lead our country home
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song
We got people in Iraq, tell me why they cain't come home
If you care about your future please listen to the song

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
I think about my homies, I think about my momma
I think about what's goin' on I think about the drama
I think about the world, I think about my life
Five years from now, will I have me a wife?
Will I have me some kids, tell me how will I live
Will I be doin' wrong or will I live positive
Will I live to get a Grammy or will I be with my granny
Five years from now, I don't think you understand me
I'm tryin' to hold on, tryin' to stay strong
It's hard not knowin' what's really goin on
But I try to maintain, keep my head in the game
When shit ain't lookin' too good, I pray for better things
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try
I keep the Lord on my side, 'til the day I die
Will I blow up big?  I don't know but I'll try

[Chorus]

[Mike Jones]
How could you think about the future when the world goin' crazy
Kids havin' kids, they too young to make babies
I'm livin' in the world so sheisty and shady, Mike Jones, Jones
Five years from now will I be dead, boxed up
Or in the pen for ten like a con, locked up
Tell me how would I live, will I have me some kids?
Will I blow up big in showbiz, five years from now

Where would I go, where would I stay,

Shyeah
Keep ya eyes open
For them jackers, baby
It's goin' down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

They see me doin' my shiit, that's why they in my miix
Jackers plottin' along watchin' like I'm movin' bricks
But I ain't move nothin', I'm on my grind hustlin'
Come at me wrong and my chrome gon' give you a concussion

I love to ride fresh, but hate to ride with Tecs
But the way that these jackers roll up, knowin' for the best
With diamonds on my neck, bulletproof vest on chest
I got my own laws, I'm here to serve and protect
Myself, because they ain't finna get me
I'm in the club sober as fuck and you won't catch me tipsy

Nigga! Yeah! I'm Mike Jones
Who? Mike Jones

So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

The way that I pull up, I got the jackers lookin' at me
24's and swingers, sold the candy and got me caffie
And I don't give a damn if they rollin'
'cause my top gets folden, the AK I'm holdin'
'cause I ain't about to go down

Presidential when we ride with the trunk open heat
Clothes tryin' to jack playboy
You get three slugs to ya throat and I'm fo' sho' 'cause they don't know
I'm on a mission to get paid
Tryin to plot or set me up you get ya whole block sprayed

And I ain't knockin' ya hustle but a hollow head will hurt
In the heat of the moment, let's see if that heat gon buck first
And I'm a aim for the worst to make a jacker fall flat
And if I do get jacked, you better believe
I'm comin' back in all black, CJ

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

I'm down the boulevard flippin', jammin' ""Still Tippin""
See them jackers watchin' like I ain't payin' attention
But really, I'm lookin' at them boys like they silly
'cause I know their handguns ain't gon' fuck wit this Milly

'cause I'm a pistol packer for them jackers that try to attack us
No need to call the po po, 'cause my fo fo gon' be my back up
Act up, if you wanna and I swear you'll be a goner
I put it all on my mama, you niggaz don't want no drama

It's Mellow, king of the hill, don't think I ain't holdin' that steel
When I pull up in that Deville, you crumb niggaz better chill
I'm from the streets I'm real, I grind hard for the scrill
I major without a deal, gotta keep it hot wheels

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it
'cause I ain't about to go down

Even though the laws patrollin'
Them jackers get rollin'
So they can't out hold it

[Mike Jones]
Yeah!  I watch my back when I'm walking, I watch my mouth when I'm talking
My glock cocked when I'm crawling cause you never know
Who hate the fact you got plenty of paper stacked so they envy
The way you move in that Bentley now you got more than one enemy
Trying to take you out nope, that's why you ride with ya scope
Or aim the infrared beamer straight to they throat
So if you ever in fear of your life, you put steel HERE in they life
Cause you ain't going down, especially not tonight
I never ever trusted hoes because they got a plan
They don't want me for me they want me because I got some Grants
It's sad when you down nobody lends a helping hand
But when you blow up and don't help them you ? man
My grandma told me watch these hoes because they got a plan
To get your paper that's why I keep my shit in my pants
You're on your own 'til your gone that's what I was told
So I'ma help who helped me 'til my casket closed

They want to ride on your ride, they want to be by your side
Until the day that you die, that's what they telling you right?
They saying they want to commit, because your paper legit
The minute you go bankrupt the second they gon' split
Now yo' ass ain't got shit
Listening to that bitch got you flat broke quick
If you was straight from the streets you'll know that that bitch
Was from the jump a hoe, playing you for your dough
But I guess you thought I was hating when I was keeping it real
I'll bet you goin' listen now cause she got you for your scrill
So let this lesson be told to those who got caught
You tried to pay for some pussy that already been bought
You told the hoe where you lived, cause you thought that the bitch was real
Same time she was one of them niggas inside your crib
I can't let it happen to me, so I watch 'em from 50 feet
I'd rather have money comin than be with these scandalous freaks
I can't let it happen to me, so I watch 'em from 50 feet
I'd rather have money comin than be with these scandalous freaks

And it feels so good to know,
You're the one that I adore.
Every day, (everyday and night), you love me right.
I don't want to trade it for nothing in this world.

[Chorus x 2]
 
Imagine this, me Caes.
E-3's, chesties, palm trees.
I know you like the way it sounds, so take your pic hon,
And watch this tongue go dead between your lips, uh.
While my niggaz be stazzin' out, I blowin' mad spazzles out.
Your leather, my house.
What's even better, my cheddar, your couch.
It's now or never, my tongue, in your mouth.
I makes it happen, dumber than a Hummer with my man Trife jigga.
Only boney girls with nice figures, ridin' dat digga.
Whole figure, platinum with gold diggers.
So what's it gonna be girl, tell me who you roll with?
Who you want to be with, who you creep with?
I giving you the green light, so if you the right ho,
Ask Joe, square the double, be a playa no more.

I never, 
Never thought I'd find love,
'Til the day I found you, sugar. (I never felt this way.)
Never had no one to hold me like this, (like this, like this.)
No, no, no.

I never, 
Never thought I'd find love,

If she got with you when she already had a man 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you 
If she got with you when she already had a man 
Why wouldn't she cheat on you

Mase come on 
If I'm in the streets or I'm in my jeep 
And I wit my peep, ex know not to speak 
See it's all good, and it's all sweet 
All women flirt, all women cheat 
So I might spend a week down in Virginia Beach 
Out of inner sheets blaze plenty freaks 
Be the bad boy everybody want to meet 
Practice what I preach, never caught when I cheat 
If I didn't work late, I say I was wit my peeps 
And quick to tell a hoe, yo I didn't get the beep 
And all these girls is quite the same 
So it ain't your pencil, it's how you write your name 

[Chorus] 

Ain't nobody hotter than the jam, don dada 
Been around the world with girls at Ramada 
Never been the wanted chick, lotta scotta, protta 
And yo when Cease got a girl he gotta 
Though I love to get a girl that keep her doobie fly 
39 in my Benz them niggaz and super size them 
Girl talk slick but I see through the lies 
You don't got TV, whatcha mean who am I 
If I knew what you knew, you wouldn't be givin the pearls 
If you know that she cheat why you live with the girl 
Have your cats come live in my world 
Cause you couldn't picture another nigga hittin your girl

Is it because my game is stronger, name last longer
On the brain like a whole eighth became 
Chicks out mesmerize rub up on they tetas 
Like push up bras, who you dealin with ma, it's jigga 
You know the rawest, ice is flawless baby 
Nice is lawless, recite for ballest 
And I fools y'all fake players every time 
Cause you only hit chicks that you think is mine 
You know I paid his due, but I'm unfatable 
Mommi screamin pappi can I skate wit you 
They want to ride wit me, stay fly wit me 
Want to help me get rid of my rivalries 
Want to be the ebony to my ivory 
But I'm straight though, thanks ma, I only chase doe 
We can lay for tonight but in the mornin 
I get Shirley Murrdock, I hope your door slam lock, I'm gone

Nigga, picture me hot, then picture me not
In this spot with this glock and these rocks to cops
I know every basehead from here to the wasteland
With keys, and connects me and Cease ???
Sell water from the cookpot, ain't that raw?
My razors? 20 dollars, here's a case of four
You supply that, shit I put a hole where your mind at
Push your hairline back, fucking with this sly cat
You know exactly what I'm talking about (Clue!)
You know the game and this life, what this thug about
One of the last real niggas trying to get in the game
But the verse on the first on the strip getting paid
You feel me? Niggas spending ??? for the jewelry
Then run around frontin like they money is filthy
I'm in the game to clean minds, fuck you want?
I had coke for too long, I supply that boat

I've been in the spot, pop the buscuit, the coke out the drawer
Here niggas grimy, we take ends out your pockets
I want the kid's pictures and the cars and the wallets
He wants them big things like them ?Tits? and ?Dolly Partons?
Got mad bodies, ?Roy is hotter than Cochran?
Besides niggas albums, a lot about dropping
Fuck break dancing, our guns do the popping
We don't stop, we drop, shut it down
Rock the undergrounds, cock then gun 'em down
Now, you want war? Fuck guns, bring grenades
Fuck all you sons that's dockin that shade

I catch a nigga slipping I'm popping two in his hood

Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse2]
Ey yo, when my nut drop it's gon be sweet as candy
I'm so for real, that's why them bitches can't stand me
Cease a Lee, nuttin sweet, real nasty, and classy
My Iceberg pants, they stay saggy
Black Navy, I fuck hoez 'cause they nag me
That was back when I didn't have a pot to piss in
Now my nigga Blake gettin head in the Kitchen
I'll bust off and get to missin, listen
If you ain't a freak, I don't need ya
I want a real bitch, that suck a dime out a parkin meter
Read the scripture
When I stroke, It's like I'm in a picture, Kodak
I love a bitch wit a pussy clean like, Flo-jack
I'm stuck in 86, still call my dick, my Balzak
Too young, stick it in these hoez know that
You want to stay or roll?
Here's a .9 here hold that
Bust up on yo face, lips, tits and all that...


[Chorus]
I said Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face (all on yo face)
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse 3]
Yo, when the smoke is gone who they focus on?
When you hear the Mafia, a nigga know it's on
Call me Cease A Leo or Cease a LeLO
Long as me and Rock fuck bitches by the trio
Put that on my nigga B.I.G, Never will I be no
Cat ridin around in a nast ass Geo
Not even a year in the game, getin the range
And hoez give me head just for hearin my name

Why should I have a bitch when I could see yours?
Before you start some shit, be sure
'cause I still got Murda Mamiz down in be	-More

And I got a easy livin, fuck easy women
We aced out, take anotha G from the linen
A nigga day dream about the V's he be spinnin
Bitch

[Chorus] x 4
Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight

What up B.I.G. what's the deal? 

I hope you aight 

I'm just  doin' my thing living day to day life 

Yo you taught me the game  now we play alike 

You taught me how to aim  when we bust gunz we spray alike 

A lot of shit going on  Mafia holding on 

My heart is from the start so I keep your name strong 

Sittin here sippin' Hen  don't know where to begin 

My album done now we're finishing Kim's 

I'm tryin to get it right 

Get my life back, on the right track 

Walkin in street dressed in black, matchin my gat 

I see my death coming, it's no turning back 

Long as I see you again, that'll be that 

Yo momz told me ?Slow down Cease, chill and relax? 

?Get On your knees and Pray to you, you'll soon talk back? 

There, speakin of yo momz, through her frustrations 

And dedication, we helped her formed up the Foundation 

Thank B.I.G.

Day dreaming, wishing you were here with me 

(Wishing you were here with me) 

Said it, I'm day dreaming (ohhh) 

Just to have you here with me 

We're missing you, (B.I.G) 

B.I.G 



[Lil' Cease] 

Yo I remember far back as the game goes 

>From the first bank rollz to the Cool Jeanz and Kango's 

Breezing on the yacht, Dp's on the rock 

Think of all the fly V's we used to swap 

We took it up a notch 

And everything that was hot, for $5,000 we copped 

Little Cease, I'd a cop, rock, all types of a satch 

50 G's on the watch, me and you up in the Spot 

MtV was in shock, and I don't see why not 

Man, we used to rock all the BET spots 

Turned clubs into stadiums 

And I remember when you and Rock got knocked in the Paladium 

And when we rock we do it all for you 

And uh, don't gotta worry bout the names they was calling you 

And I'ma tell you what we gonna do 

Make hits and couldn't quit if we wanted to (yes I, won't stop) 

Even though you're outta sight, you're never outta mind 

I try to tell myself, when it's yo time, it's yo time 

Ever since that weekend, everybody been beefin' and greifing 

Losin they appetites, nobody eatin (miss you, yeah) 

And it's due to all the weavin, I walked yo kidz to your coffin 

And tell em ?daddy's sleeping? (daddy's sleeping) 

But Killa he don't understand 

He don't know that ignorance killed a wonderful man 

You're not just another Rapper, wit money in yo hand 

I think, what's the money, when I ain't got my man 

That's why day's I walk the surface, feeling earthless (Oh Biggie) 

Thinking was this rap shit really worth it (is it really worth it?) 

And I know you didn't deserve it, It went so smooth 

You thought they rehearsed it, Worst shit I ever 

Seen at a young age, it's fucked up when I see my man on front page 

I reminisce on the old days, Love, Forever and Always 

B.I.G. Nigga... 





[112] {Chorus}X 2 

Day dreaming, Said I'm wishing you were here 

(Wishing you were here with me) 

Said we're missing you 

Said it, I'm day dreaming (Wishing you..) 

Just to have you here with me B.I.G. 

We're missing you, (B.I.G)

Day dreaming, wishing you were here (You were more than a friend) 

(Wishing you were here with me) (you were like a brother to 112) 

Said we're missing you 

Said it, I'm day dreaming (We need you here for today...) 

Just to have you here with me B.I.G.

Yeah, I like that
When I beeped her, she called me right back
I layed my game down quite flat

Threw on my white hat with no hesitation

To jeeps with paper plates
So a chick can, come before my paperchase
Wanna hit the cell
Roc make em wait
If I ain't make a mill
I can't take a break
I like to vacate down in Bermuda
Sip my coleurs while I'm headed down to Hooters
Everytime we scoop her
The chickens wanna tutor
Girls wanna fight and
Throwing ice from the cooler
This chick is a loser

Where you're allowed to smoke weed
And the waiters is tight with the crew
See I used to dig this bitch from Botswana
Half-African but she looked like Madonna
And yo check, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the restaurant where we met
And the girl from Lisett, that bitch is a freak
I used to fuck her in the ass while my girl was asleep
And she the one that told me where these cats is at

The nigga Puff ready to hollar at these bitches
I'm like, ""Yo dog, them bitches down with them niggas""
And never would a drug make a bitch slack up
I've got Hitmen spread through the restaurant for back up
And we communicate through headsets and walkie-talkie's
Them niggas is just bitches like my Yorkie
Pigs like the Porky
We on point like snipers
Syrus and his doomies is Clueless like the movies
All I could think about is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, masacre style
Yeah, Syrus did it
Syrus the virus they call him
When I finish with 'em, please, his name is Swiss cheese
My main focus is his right-hand man Mousey
Sheisty and two-sided, confession, dick ridin'
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin' me sick
And when Sysrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin' niggas up like the vacuum
Bullets flyin' non-stoppin', bodies droppin'
Puff yell (Bloody!), that's the cops then
My trigger finger startin' itchin'
That's when Syrus came spittin' from the kitchen
The next second, he missed me
Listen, it's soundin' like the 4th of July
Like a solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes in his body the size of cup-holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff I'm empty
(Kim, I've only got one shot left)
But I'ma hold my breath 'til he falls to his death
But he was helpess, his little kid beat off in his pelvis

Through four make the hollows travel

Who wanna wine and dine with Bris get in line
I fight like I rhyme niggas thirsty to shine
Can't jack mine
I'm one of a kind

Die slow y'all niggas is dust like pyro

Might as well be blind fold
See how much my nine hold blast my one
Dos tres to the cuatro cinco

How you want it
Head or gut
You soft like baby butt (I like that)

Their jewels they tuck

Intimidated how we hop out the truck
Or the S type Jag

I ain't gotta tell y'all niggas where I'm from
I ain't never tell no bitch when I cum
I'm far from a lame you will never see me run
You know how we do it beef jump into it
M.A.F.I.A.'s the gang max out the squadron
Nine millimeter team
Mack 11 mobs men
Who said we ain't rich
Kim's bling cost a fortune
Queen Bee niggas shootin anything crawlin
From now on it's on when I catch you niggas snorin
Any fresh event you can bet niggas sportin
Betta leave town catch a flight in the mornin
Get the cold out ya eyes somebody bout to die
Three niggas got beef three niggas got to go
Hit em all in the row like tic tac toe
Where you start is where you finish at
Show y'all the meanin of fam
Remember dat

Lil' Cease,"I would change a thing, if I have to live my life all over
Oh, baby, oh girl, I do it all again
If I have to live my life, live my life I would

I would do it all again, all again, yeah
If I have to live my life all over, nope, oh, baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Yo everyday)
If I have to live my life all over
(Every hour you know, yeah)

Yo, yo, same hustle man, same struggle man
Yeah, I do it again, if I have to
Still the same way, still the game paid
Still the young nigga, still slang, yeah

I wouldn't change a thing and my mama did it all by herself
She sayin' the same pray, listen
You hear when she whisper
I get the chance I fix her, days that I slipped her

And my man the past, I tell him I love him
And I hug him before he pass
Raised his daughter as if she was mine
Still meet the same girl, still have mine, uh

I thank God the Melik meet Shawn
I throw the diamond up higher in every song
And only drama could do it again
Da hood don't love me, still I walk through it again hear me

I wouldn't change one fact if I have to come back
And I couldn't live black, got me
But mama love me, I'm from da ghetto
And only God could judge me

I would do it all again, I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again
(Aha, uh, yeah, what)
I do it all again, if I have to live my life all over
(I do it over, for real, same way)

Oh, I wouldn't change a thang, same shit the basic
Same house, same spouse, same pop's I came with
Same gun, same case, same niggaz I bang with
I be big right now before I change shit

Just roll me up an L and live life and just do what I do
It's all lovely when it's right
But when it's wrong, I just play along
Get hit bounce back like it's really nothin' wrong

And I still struggle, still bubble
No matter if I'm broke or rich I still hustle
Still get niggaz to test you is my life
And I do it all again,I do it twice

And I won't change a thang, maybe two
I bring Big and Pop back put them in the same room
Then I apolotic and make peace in da same room
Once a game dead then you know we all dead too, true

And then we back on the block
With the crack in da sack
I take it how it come from the bottom to the top
I signed wit Bleek and I'm ridin' wit The Roc and I

Would do it all again, do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh baby, yeah
I do it all again, for the love as it gain
If I have to live my life all over
(And I do it again, yeah, holla)
Oh, I would

Yo, I talk to my fam I lost and let them know
How I feel from my heart without them here no mo'
And is no lies, I do it all again from the start of my life
Till the night my mama die

I would it told her, I love and it all kept looses and close
Let her know I always be here for you
Apologize to grandma that for da stress I put her through
And to my dad I ain't mad at you

Even thought you wasn't there without you
I won't be here so I gotta be fair
Still don't love lost over here I swear
To my restin' road dawgz, yeah
(I do it all again)

Why changin' my resurrection
I be back and the style same strip
Back with the same click
Hustle in the game chips, explain this
If I have to live all over I do it
Let Barbara have his kidz all over watch me

Get it quick, servin' the pump liquor
Spend a little mo' time with my big brother Leek
Still be fam with Cease, Proof, Cali and Bleek
Holla and get low, probably when my life repeat, nigga

I would do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh, baby, yeah
I do it all again
If I have to live my life all over, oh I would

Lil' Dap,"I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your jaw
You probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers
Troop on like a trooper no tears for fears
I'm a get mines 'cause the crew'll get theirs
Cut you up like Edward Scissorhands
You know the program I'm the mutha fuckin' man",I'm the Man,1999
Lil' Dap,"Last year record companies were chumpin me
But now like chicks they all be up on me
and me so horny, I hit em like a groupie
Snatch off my hat wash my dick and keep it movin
Showing and proving on a day to day basis
I rip New York and a million different places
State to state country to country
My skills are legend in the style of poetry
I've paid my dues to this game word to mother
Peace New York hops it gets no rougher
Baby brother been puffing buddha and blunts since eighty-five
Before the fake motherfuckers started perpetrating live, I've
achieved mad props though niggaz roll around in jeeps
I ride the A-Train and get mad beeps
So when we bang bang boogie out jumps my boot knocks
Chicks comes in flocks when D.R.S. rocks glocks
And I mean it it's all done with the mind
I neutralize suckers because I'm alkaline
I could go on for days speaking bout my clout
So Lil Dap snatch the mic and show the motherfucker out

Yo you can't hide from jail and you can't hide from the street
Flavors do get deep when you're walking the east
A unit down from the underground made the brothers unite
I'm slappin pounds and pounds with real niggaz aight
Ain't nothing changed but the weather, rain storms or whatever
You poured a forty on the ground for the brothers who ain't around
Break it down with the flow as I walk through the ghetto
A nigga said he couldn't do it til the shit hits the fan
Last year I was The Man ripping up every jam
So what's your hobby nothing serious when things get rough
I'm stepping rugged and tough, and bitches won't get enough
A Lil Dap what's that?  Fuck around you get slapped
Schizophrenic with rhyme plus we're well organized
Make the chicks say 'aow' and the brothers say 'ho'
You can't tell a motherfucker what to do with his life
Niggaz tend to live trife, so I react with the mic
It's the end of the time so I got to gets mine
Aiyyo 'ru, what's your function meet me at Broadway junction
Before I start to get in it, better yet i just kick it
Aiyyo son, if you're ready Guru starts to flip it

Earl, with my three-eight-five shot I bust a bumba claat
He talks dumb a lot so him shall drop
I got the clout, all you pussy rappers be out
From the ghetto I let go, shit to make you petrol
Watching fly niggaz show you how to rhyme asshole
You know the motherfucking situation
So get down get down with the Gangstarr Foundation
Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
and all the honies be loving me
My style be kicking crazy butt
Wannabes on their knees licking crazy butt
Your girl pays me but ain't no need to try and stop her
I'm Big Poppa fuck your girl and I'll drop her
cause she be working on my nerves
and yo I got more gang than the bitch got curves
I'm like gambino, the slick head honcho
Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
and I know, I break your back with my rap like smack
because I'm all that
And so the next time when you're wishing for my downfall
I'm a come back to drown y'all
With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath
And stay the fuck out my path",Speak Ya Clout,1999

Get this money, get with it
If its dirty you can't spend it
Leave mama the whole business
Just in case I get sent to prison
I done made some bad decisions
But I put my last on these fuckin' lyrics
To make the world feel it
And run over all competition
Takin the pain, on the mission
Say it in vain, contradict
Felony, and jealousy raw enemies
You ain't never, had a friend like me
Will I live to see twenty three
Or will them guerillas come for me
They gone' remember evil L-I-L-E

This is what's left and this shit done got scary
Don't come near me, is it deadly, very

Tell me will this one bring evil things

Tellin me, it's old fella Duke
And if they kill me
They gon' have to kill you
Now gimme death

Took the hood off the track
Put gangsta on the rap
Kept my strap, cause the game gettin' cold
Even if my laws collapse
Bitch I'm dying like a soldier
The killa still ain't know, mama told us
The law will show ya
Twenty five feets on the streets, fuck peace
I'm tryna make a mealticket before I rest in peace
You and me, me and you, in this bitch together
Nigga what, we gone' represent this bitch forever

Nigga I'm from the M.I.
Where there ain't no such thing as dying
Get mine, I need it all I'm tryna get by
From 6-1 to 6-5, 6-5 to 6-9
Cheatin' on a dime, I ain't hard to find
I done crossed the line, half the world mine
Let me get meat, I know it brings enemies
But momma gotta eat
Kid need shoes on they feet
Shit ain't lookin' sweet
I'm a man now
Young, black, and thugged out
But when it comes to the money
Fuck the playa now
Don't mess up the couch
Put it all in the right of my
Fifty goin 50, what that be bout
The dirty south wit me, I'ma riv a brick
Cause I know they comin to get me

once was friends, now that shit's dead
that stupid muthafucka shoulda shot me in the head

and told Dread, I want the pussy clot shot dead
that nigga started a war fuckin with me yo
hit me with a four-four and jetted with a kilo
he hit me in the chest
lucky I was wearing a vest, but the impact hurt my fuckin flesh
right after he left, I noticed I was bleeding by my neck
and I was type-scared to death
yo, I blacked out
I woke up, my man had the mac out
said we gonna get the nigga back no doubt
he told me to rest
I seen my nigga standing at the door with a tec 
in case a muthafucker flex
I told him how the muthafuckin kid co-flipped
and he said parlay son, payback's a bitch
yo, shit is real, I feel better
word out on the street is that a four-four can't stop Mega
the nigga musta heard I didn't die, son he hidin'
I snatched up his man inside a van and started drivin'
his man started dymin'
said the nigga drivin' in 735 and he knows where to find him
cool, tell my man to drop the kid off
soon as we hit the next darn block, blew his fuckin wig off
now that's one down, one nigga to go
just drive slow so we don't have to worry 'bout five-o
now it's time to get even, 
we in, five jeeps deep with the mad heat and steamin
oh shit, I see him, he gettin out the seven
my man started wetting at the nigga with a mac-11
I specialize in war
now it's time to blow him, I'ma show him how to use a fuckin four-four
I said ""yo son, ya games over""
I let off, and yo my shit was spittin fire like a flamethrower
he started wettin back

Yeah, but you don't hear me though
Come on, here we go
We put it down everywhere we go
So motherfucker come on cause its

Here's a toast to the fact
That I'm a man and I can stand alone
And all my suits are made by hand in Rome
Ricotta stuff that Cannellon'
I'm in the garden smoking roses
Don't live like Malone, I'm talkin' Moses
Part the ocean, spark the potion
Diamonds in the rough, we shine 'em up
Make a necklace, dive up in the muff
Then wash my dick, straight to breakfast
Hop up in the truck
Got more flavor than some Dr. Pepper
Hottest stepping struts
And the streets paved with concrete
I'm known to smoke the same shit that makes the lawn green
Gaze at the moon right off the shore, dream
But me no worry got a strong team
Just like my Knick's '94 team, we winnin' though
Go 80 layers on the Baklava, that's hand made by my nana
Peace to Antigona
The whole Shkup, Bill Clinton Boulevard
Since a youth Bronsolini known to put it on

Already mentioned with the people I respect up in the rap shit
Couple of months you probably see me with an actress
Getting my ass licked, while she driving never crashed it
Smoking on that shit fantastic
A little breezy off the coast as the sun sets
Gallop on beach on the horse cause we young vets
Limited edition, signature inscription
Certificate of authenticity, I'm on a mission
Queens representative, dismember your genitals
Now you got a pussy, fucking with the general
Bas Rutten, I'm ass bootin', I'm past shootin'
Display fast movements, know that cash rules
Drug clothes and I ain't talking 'bout a bento box
Penetrate your mind, spice it with the mental lox
Fundamental Soundgarden verbal Black Hole Sun
At the flicks getting sucked in the back row

Lungs filled, smokey like the pork shoulder
Lash out, one second in the fourth quarter
Triple penetrate, pussy meat I renovate
Fuck 'em like a dog and leave 'em twisted like my mental state
Off the deep end, snorkel in a river
I take it back to Walkman's and tape decks
In great neck, having great sex
I didn't even have a hair on my face yet
My feet were always classic though
Pinky up, classy flow
If you know me, you know never to pass me blow
Straight shitting on these songs so the grass can grow
'Til we sitting in the garden, smoking
Listening to Marvin go
I treat the shit just like a title fight, you sparring
Soon a damn Ferrari, sex and models straight from Holland
Lamb encrusted fennel pollen
When I rhyme it's like the metal hollow
These other motherfuckers smell the flowers

Add a chapter to this pussy popping legacy
Trying ta be that bitch, can't no bitch come fuck wit me
When I pop that Cris I'm only business and bubbly
When I'm in the 6 wit 20's spinning I'm luxury
'Cause I got that head game
Fuckin' up that bed frame
But don't get me wrong, shawty gon' let that lead aim
Better learn that game shawty
Better get your man shawty
'Fore he end up tamed and be gone all in the brain shawty
This here be futuristic
This business so explicit
The way I break it down for you bitches, it's so explicit
Let it go now front, back, watch me drop it like that
Show me where the money at
Boy come wit them hunnid stacks
Breakin' wit that pussy popping
That pussy dropping to the flo'
And got these niggas slobbin'
He wantin' mo', without that dope, papi can't nothin' happen
'Cause that's fo' sho, I'm from the GOAT, you gettin' that pussy poppin'
Stopping that pussy dropping gone

Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand

Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand

Every time we hit the club
We at least 50 deep
Smokin' purple, potent, green shit got everybody geeked
In the club 7 days a week, find DTP up in this beesh
That ho popping, dropping, Goddamn shawty who is this?
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair, stunting, waving money
And shawty star, zig zagging her derriere for me
A bowlegged thoroughbred and said her name was ""Strawberry""
Up her pussy, shawty pushed in a whole bottle of Moe'
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the flo'
""Here, you deserve this doe. Now jump on stage and work a pole""
Face down, ass up hoe, hands on poles
Now pop that coochie, you know the procedure
If you want this cash, gotta make that ass shake like a seizure
Either magic or please us
Find me spending cheese up
Maxing out my visa
Tricking on strip teasers

Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand

Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy pussy popping
Head down, pussy popping on a handstand

Ready to handcuff the right guy
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie.
Schemin on the way to money yo, well ya tried
Guess its a game now, gotta watch who you trust
Like her because, its only out for your books

Four twenty four inch rims so heavy they hold the block down
Twenty four carrot necklace so heavy it hurt my neck
Three things you can't take away from me, money, power and respect
I got it and hold on to it you knew that I never let it go
You prostitute it but money I never let it ho
Speakin' of hoe's oh yes we meet em and we G' 'em dude
And we may see 'em but we wouldn't want to be 'em dude
I put my fist up, I got the power girl

Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

Gripping on grain, while the fifteen's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
'Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass

Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the hardest pit of the litter
Down south, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Tryin' to stack my paper up real tall and long
Talking down on my name like Jenny Jones
Blowing up my phone 
'Cause I'm riding on chrome
Better leave me alone 
And get lil' daddy to pay your bills
'Cause you don't know no playa wit' my skills
So you better chill and keep it real

Ain't nothing but a g thang baby
Turnel sets dried yellow bones crazy
Can't fade me, died lately
Pulling out the escallade or a mercedes
Trunk popper, show stopper, drank sipper
Rule number one is to never tip a stripper
And I know a lot of why'all want to wish me trouble
Went from swanging hoo-doos to a bentley bubble
Image is everything, diamonds in every ring
Piece and chains that hang down low to my dang-a-lang
Stop that, cop that, I'm a baller baby
Got the rims that poke out on the prowler baby
I'm the same young cat that dropped the jewels on them
Next year I'm about to drop 22's on them
From the Mo to the Fo, back to airport landing
Diamonds speak for theyself, Flex so outstanding

And ya know ya know we represent the south 
Still standing, we in the door and these haters can't keep us out

Believe me, outstanding with my family
From me and Z-Ro and Lil' Flex at the grammy
Boss player from Texas, you could tell by the necklace
We gone break these hoes on four's now we frozen the Lexus
My protected, move around, get around
Come through show some round when we hit your town
It go down, whoa now, school slow down
Watch these fours roll down crawl down your block
Top drop, trunk knock, glock cocked
And these shops gone bop, it don't stop
Won't stop, how it go down

Screwed up representer these fellas don't want none
From the land of the trunk poppers where ballers blow tons
We stacking funds, and living our life out on the run
In search of a platinum plack trying to get stacks it just begun
If you talking down move around we ain't having that
East and West took it before but see we came to grab it back
Can't see us like cataracts, off in our natural habitat
That's the studio and bro you know ain't no more selling crack
Ain't nothing but rocking trash talking on down to the ain't that
Cause I'm a veteran to this here ever since the days of the Wave Band
When I was knee high to a grass hopper but now we roll on chppers
Me and Gene hovering over the ground in candy helicopters
Now we platinum status without driving a dodge stratus
Keeping it gangsta energy instinct with a heater to protect us
Man it's third coast, to me our music mean the most

and I'm all about my mail like a man in jail
I wonder if I put my tape out, can it sell?
only time will tell how many copies get sold
and I pray to god that I live to get old
'cause half of my homeboys already dead
and the other half doin time with the feds
I'm like the CincinnatI Reds  I'm playin ball for the pennant
and if I fall while I'm tryin I start from the beginning
they say practice make perfect and it really paid off
I'm my own boss now so I can't get laid off
and I'm gonna stay the same flip no matter what it takes
and I won't stop rappin no matter how much I make
Whether I'm rich or broke i'ma still crack jokes

man it costs a lot of money livin on this earth
everybody got to shine but it's my turn
the early bird gets the worm that's what I learned
ever since I was a kid I had to ball
I don't smoke cigarettes and I hate alcohol
I went from being a janitor to a manager
when you become a star with me, want to dance with yah
I'm gonna keep my platinum teeth and my pants saggin
now everybody want to jump on the band waggon
I ain't braggin, because I got a little change, 
I ain't gonna let my head blow up 'cause I got a little fame
now when my cousin died things got a little strange
I know the block is hot just ask lil wayne
everybody dream about goin to hollywood
but look how fast I turned clover land into ???

[chorus]

(Lil' Flip)
everyday I'm on the paper chase
I gotta win first place in this paper race

Lil' Flip,"Got to do something for the playas if you ain't a real playa
You'll have to go to the back of the club, this for the playas
And the ballas and the pimps, for everybody, south side
Who rocking lots of ice, teeth shine, piece shine
Pull up looking clean on two twenty's nigga

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

I just put some new rugs in my two story club
Hoes getting dug in my king size tub
Boys getting drugged, trying to act like a thug
No fucking love while I sip purple mud
I fly like a dove, smoke like a champ

Never run from no one 'cause I might catch a cramp
Smoking damp, fucking on a old school tramp
Ten dollar rock for a twenty food stamp
My name is Carlos holla fuck these hoes
Life is like ballet stay on your toes

My dream is to keep the world up all night
'Cause I got enough 'caine to have a snowball fight
I floss gators, got cribs with elevators
So much cash I bought a pool for my neighbors
Dope house and sucka free, run your ass up a tree
Fuck with me and you'll be keeping dad company

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

When I walk into the club people say, ?Where he go??
But when I open up my mouth they be like, ?There he go?
When Redd sliding through the club I'm throwing my elbows
Any girl I snag, she sticking like velcrow
And when I take my watch off, they say, ?Who cut the lights off??

And I can freestyle all night until they cut the mics off
As soon as I touch the stage, broads ain't paging they man
Instead they spilling liquor, waving they hands
Well I'm a valet parker and a endo sparker
So many waves in my hair I got to wear swimming goggles

Now we ready to buy the bar tossing shit the counter
People notice my name and run over the [unverified]
Now when you see me in the club, I'm dressed top of the line
I'm mixing up codeine and popping bottles of wine
I met a chicken head from Michigan showing her tattoo
Hit it off at the bar too, let's scram so we could car pool

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

Hey, this for my Blacks, Asians, Chinese and Caucasians
Muslims, Irish and even Jamaicans, Hispanics, Indians
Throw your sets up and all the fine women, raise your dress up
Hold up your piece if you got ice in it
And put your white cups up if you got pink sprite in it

You might see me at the bar but I don't drink that much
I just bought an Escallade and I'm gone paint that truck
I got three million in the bank, but it ain't that much
Now when I look at magazines I say ain't that us
I'm in the VIP section, wearing a black dob

I got the women screaming whoa but my name ain't Black Rob
Man, they screaming Lil' Flip at the front of the club
A nigga buzzed off this remmy with a blunt and a hug
When sucka free in the club women lose they brains
If I need ice in my cup, then I use my chain, bling bling

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

Gripping on wood grain
Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

Gripping on grain, while the fifteen's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
'Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to seventy one, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the hardest pit of the litter
Down south, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

When I perform me a hoe, niggaz get jumped in the club
But I'm used to that shit, so it ain't no need to run
And just because you gotta gun don't mean that's the only one
So if you came here to chill nigga, just chill and shit
'cause you ain't gotta act like that I know you feelin' this shit
I bet, I bet I could hit with Juicy, Paul and Banner
I gotta holla at peaches, when I hit Atlanta
'cause I'm fresh and I'm clean, with baugettes in my ring
I got my name on my jersey like I play with that team

But I got cash ride around in drop Jags
With my top back interior all black
With leather seats rimmed up 4 times
I'm in the V-12 watch me blow down
You know me I gotta put my stunt down
And when the laws pass by I put my blunt down
Cause I stay high like a telophone pole
And I roll on vogues and pimp yellow bone hoes
Swangas and blades is what we sit on

Watch us be the star traction and a harder night

Ice cubes in my watch and the piece is just froze

Escorting a bad bitch, doja lit, I ain't worried about the laws
Hoes whisper to each other girl I think he played ball
No bitch, I'm just a rapper out the hood
And I'm wrestling with the wood, powered up feeling good
Little engine that could, beat the block for it's stock
Turn around and swap game for a political job

I got a box of doughnuts from Crispy Creme
Everybody looking at me like Flip you the shit
Hell yeah I'm the shit, look at my wrists
I roll up a Philly, roll up a Philly
Head to the town and watch 3rd Ward Billy
Knock a nigga out while pouring up a drank
Got my mind on the bank, in the jail I use a shank
I sip that, flip that, wood grain grip that
Go to the Papa Do's yeah I'm gone tip that
It's Lil' Flip I'm a million dollar star
Blue, black or red don't touch my car, uh

[Chorus]

[Noke D]
I'm shook up, I'm looking throwed
Gucci wardrobe to match the Gucci soles
Gucci hoes and hop out the SL
I'm popped up and sliding on Sprewell
We sell, everything you need
Riding through with Pardon Davis and some falling t.v.s
Moe and me, we have been a lot
Looking for some head in a little bitty shop
On top, on wrist rock it's going down
H-Town southside 3rd Ward bound
Pulled up acting and class so they'll know
The south on shine cause we ain't broke no more

[Chorus]",It's About to Go Down,2002
Lil' Flip,"It's the 8 rulez on the streets
You live by this, you won't get holed up

1, never let a nigga know yo business
2, always start what you finish
3, stay on yo note, don't slip
4, be careful 'cause these streets are a trip

5, always keep a glock in yo whip
6, real niggaz stick to the script
7, don't slang crack where you stay
8, just don't do it, okay?

In my hood all you see is dope fiends an' dope dealers
Rats an' roaches, police an' 4 wheelers
[Incomprehensible], pawn shops, liquor stores
30 year old men, chillin', drinkin [Incomprehensible]

Stop signs, but don't nobody ever stop
It's ten groups in my hood, but don't nobody drop
Plus the block is hot an' this dope game cold
Through rain, sleet or snow, birds gotta get sold

Birds get sold, I stand an' watch the game unfold
Thing gets low, I told my connect right in the snow
They exchanged the dough, leave the scene wit no clue
4 words you gotta remember, 'Don't break the rules'

Use your tools, it's kinda like you move, you loose
If you don't fuck wit me, I ain't fuckin' wit you
Check the game 'til you see my weapon aim
Nigga, I ain't a rookie I'm a veteran, mayne

1, never let a nigga know yo business
2, always start what you finish
3, stay on yo note, don't slip
4, be careful 'cause these streets are a trip

5, always keep a glock in yo whip
6, real niggaz stick to the script
7, don't slang crack where you stay
8, just don't do it, okay?

Hustle for yo whip, stack Benjamins
Buy a cookie cutter, whip it, ship it, then I'm in the wind
Back to home base, I'm on a paper chase
I'm not a case catcher, so I can't catch a case

Money on my mind an' how am I gonna get it
I dress like I'm broke, but I'm really runnin' the city
Bricks turn into crumbs, gallons turn into ones
Drugs, violence, distributin' narcotics usin' guns

Money, cash, hoes, swangin' glass folds
Get the dough, pay the bills, man, that's all I know
Hustlers never sleep an' sleepers never hustle
Down on the interstate with a brick in my muffler

Keep it on a low 'cause niggas be snitchin'
They'll do anythin', so they won't see prison
Man, you never know, yo brother could be a snitch
A month later, now you got Undercovers shakin' yo piss

I'm off the block, somebody better call the cops
I'm haulin' rocks, somebody better call the doc
I'm shippin' an' handlin', when I'm not chicken dismantlin'
The family don't feed me, I feed the family

1, never let a nigga know yo business
2, always start what you finish
3, stay on yo note, don't slip
4, be careful 'cause these streets are a trip

5, always keep a glock in yo whip
6, real niggaz stick to the script
7, don't slang crack where you stay
8, just don't do it, okay?

Lil' Flip
Represent
7-1-3

Now when you see me in the Lamborghini speeding, bumpin Screw
I know you see my license plate, ""Lil' Flip number two""
I use to skip summer school, hit the block and move work
That was enough to buy some shoes, pants, and a new shirt
Now I'm shinin like Puff, wearin diamonds like Puff
We got everybody else music sounding like US
So hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been bumpin Screw down here for a while!
And when you see me at the mall, Just me and my dawg
I'm shoppin with them, Cause I ain't trickin for a broad
I do shows and rock crowds, And then I get paid
Summer time, I'm on dubs, Winter time, I'm on blades
My whole click livin laid, man we all got Vets
My crib so big, I ain't even see my room yet
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been buyin six-figure homes for a while!
Now when you see me in the Vibe, Murder Dog and The Source
And the XXL, standing next to a Porsche
I get paid with my voice, so I pimp these beats
I hate commercial rap, so I pimp these streets
You don't work you don't eat, that's a known fact
I just don't rap, nigga I know how to act
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been fuckin with magazines for a while!

[Chourus x1]
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
The type of Rappers y'all never goin be!
We makin money y'all never goin see!
Because we represent the 7-1-3!
Houston, Texas nigga!

Now when you see me with Tigga, On BET
Or 106 and Park, with AJ and Free
Or MTV, come take a look at my house
And after that, come take a look at my mouth
Yea I represent the South, like Pastor Troy
And I'm still Fresh and Clean, like Andre and Big Boi
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been talkin shit on TV for a while!
Now when you see me with a sweet, blowing smoke out my nose
9 times outta 10, I'm probably blowin Hydro
So don't blow my high, just leave me alone!
Cause I get high like Cheech and Chong
Call me 'Afroman' when my hair ain't braided
I got 20 tatoo's but I'm still educated
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been smokin high-time weed for a while!
And when you see my at the club, I gotta get my floss on
Techno, my ring shinnin, and I got my cross on
I gotta brand new phone, Cause I'ma rich nigga
And when people call, you can see they picture
I'm still Lil'Flipper, but my money got taller
And my Benz got wider, and your hundred got smaller
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been acting bad, drivin cars for a while!
When you see me Big Pimpin, like UGK
I'm choppin on blades, candy-paint, Jog Grey
I'm sittin on Twenty's, but I'm twenty-one
I'm ridin with an AK, you still got a be	-be	 Gun
So you need to Back, Back, and gimme 50 feet
Cause you ain't sellin records like Sucka-Free
But hold up! You better get your own style
Cause we been ridin around with straps for a while!

Lil' Flip,"I come in the club everybody standin' on the corner
But me some weed, speed, or some marijuana
You can get it right here or get it right there
But when the laws pull up get away from 'round there
Niggas thinkin' that the nigga changin
Just 'cause a nigga platinum be hanging
I still got the same niggas that I'm with
If a nigga owe me money we gon'shoot up his shit
I use to sell work I use to sell pints
But now I'm doing shit I gotta million in the bank
I done made a lot of moves and payed a lot of dues
Nigga if you fuck with me, you might make the news
Now niggas get on T.V then forget they partnas
The ones that keep it real come sharp with the choppas
The one who drank and lean in they house
Them lil niggas be the one who represent the south uh

[Chorus:]
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
No matter how rich I get Lil' Flip will never change
I want the money
I don't give a fuck about the fame
I do this shit so I can have some pocket change

Now every time I come back somebody went to jail
But they taught us don't go to school and fail
I didn't go to college but its money in my wallet
And I just bought a Jag '0 mileage
And I keep a clip ya know I'm strapped
And you was hatin' on me nigga you might get slapped
Ya telephone tap'ed got the (?)matter of fact
It don't look good for you to be standing on blocks
Nigga what about the cops rollin through looking
And everybody know that you sellin and cookin
So get yo mind right nigga stay out the streets
You seen what I did, now I play with these beats

[Chorus:]

I'm like a hundred-dollar bill I'm hard change
And now its funny everybody ain't acting the same
Rule number one never tell these rats learn ya business
Rule two never ever burn by bridges
I had niggas that was hatin' now they in my face
Way before ""buy the car, by the house"", ""diamondsNyaface""
Now they see me in the streets I want to do a song
Nigga yous a hoe go back to yo home!
'Cause you ain't selling records don't get mad
'Cause you see me ballin' hard in a dropped Jag
When you see me at the source chunk up the duece
'Cause I represent the Cloverland jumpin' out my Coupe
I still be the same nigga on the scene
I'm still gone be the only freestyle king

[Chorus:]",Forget the Fame,2002

[Lil' Flip]
They call me Thunder Cat, cause I got so many hoes
They call me cookie man, cause I sold so many o's
Did a lot of shows, made a lot of cash
Slid out the Benz, jumped in a jag
Jumped out the Jag, then I hopped in a Hummer
Guess what I drop, underground this summer
But get ready, for the shit about to hit the air
And bitch you ain't smoking endo, so I don't care

[Chorus]

[Lil Ron]
Say Flip, look at all these hoes
Some are girls, but its niggas also
I'm tired of getting attention, when walking in places
Niggas is hating, I'm fin to hurt they faces
Change the paces, winning the races
Money I'm making, cookies a nigga baking
Feeling my status, above average
Lil Ron be ready for all that static

[Lil' Flip]
We got automatics, nigga we still thuggin'
Nigga we still hustlin', all the hoes still loving
The way that we flowing, the cars that we driving
The way that we hustle, that's the way we surviving
Going to shows, going to clubs
Riding on Blaze, riding on Dubs
We from the south, we country as hell
why'all smoking that brown weed, we got that funky smell
The dro and the do-do, the blueberry endo
Riding on low-lows (Flip there go the po-pos)

If he fucked up your car, he a hoe

If she tear up your Bentley she a hoe

[Redd]
I ain't never been the type, to be in love with a hoe
Instead I'm trying to leave, out the club with a hoe
A basket case, I spit in a bastard's face
Walk in, crash the party, and trash the place
Fuck it I tried to tell em, some niggas wouldn't like it
Too bad, you should of seen it coming like a psychic
Then its, back to the Benz that's sitting on chrome men
Waving at the hoes, yelling aiight then

[Chorus]

[David Banner]
Ki's from over seas, for me that's just some cain

Listen to my pimp game, listen to my pimp game
Yeah fuck em, my nuts let em suck em and let em go
Mississippi, p-p-p-pimping, mayne fa sho
Coming down, gripping grain up on the do'
On the flo man you slow, and not knowing that she's a hoe

'Cause Screwed Up Click acting bad

You might see me in the benzo
Sitting on Lorenzos, blowing on some endo
It's five o'clock so I'ma drop my top, and let down my window
I'm candy paint with DVD's and PlayStation 2
I got a mic with a crown on top that say R.I.P. DJ Screw
But I'ma hold it down like it's no cigo'
Make this screw shit coast to coast
I can't be stopped like a locomotive, M P see H P eighty rolling
My paper folding like laundromats, S P S black Cadillacs
E S 1's 'cause cataracts, Gucci suit with the hat to match

Like Fat Pat I'm on chrome, my Prime Co. on roam
Sold out shows at the Astro Dome, y'all ain't know my money long
Y'all money gone 'cause we changed the game
And came with tighter flows
I wear expensive clothes got plenty hoes, 'cause nigga that's all I know
Like shopping sprees and credit cards, two ways and cellulars
Smoking blunts and pulling broads, everyday I'm switching cars
But I'm a superstar like Denzel, but I ain't gone win a Grammy
I sold a hundred thousand now I see why niggas can't stand me

All this wood I got to grip some, Texas boys off the hook, huh
Chain and charm with two my chain
Project corner with too much weight
Sleep day time and work at night, making cash is my life
Sipping Sprite and breaking mics, winning money, shaking dice
Hitting licks and shaking vikes, you want three chickens pay the price
Bubble light on foreign wheels, iced out grill'll make me chill
Peanut butter in my Seville, buy a pint and pop a sill

Buy a pint and I'll pop a sill, and my blaze chop like a south-mill
Y'all hatas mad 'cause we in a Jag
And that Iceberg got us dressed to kill
How you feel 'cause I'm fired up, pour me up another cup
It's S you see and Swisha House, and them big faces we fold up
Lil' Ron make you hold up while I take a trip with Lil' Flip
Blow'd get you wide up and it'll make your ass run off a cliff

huh huh
I had to do somethin like dis
ya know
huh I shoulda listened
I shoulda listened

[Lil' Flip - Verse 1]
I shoulda listened, when ya said boy go and get a job
I shoulda listened, cause you gotta sell dope or rob
I shoulda listened, when you told me I need to go to college
but right now I'm tryin to money in my wallet
I shoulda listened, when you said boy make good grades
but instead I was worryin about dem new j's
I shoulda listened, when you said boy don't get no tattoos
now it's 2 years later and now I got 22
I shoulda listened, when you said keep playin basketball
but I was makin mo money standin in the hall
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to be in the church
but that's hard ""why"" cause everyday I gotta concert
I shoulda listened, when you said I need to watch my friends
cause yesterday my partner got jacked fo' his Benz
I shoulda listened, when you said don't stand on the corner
cause all black folks do is smoke marijuana

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I shoulda listened, when yo told me don't do that I did it any way
I shoulda listened, when yo told me don't hustle but I gotta get paid

[Lil' Flip - Verse 2]
I shoulda listened, when you said quit standin on the block
cause all that do is make it easy fo the cops
I shoulda listened, when you said it don't matta what car you drive
long as you pay yo bills long as you survive
I shoulda listened, when you said don't be hangin at the club
cause people get drunk and want to shoot the club up 
I shoulda listened, when you said you can't please everybody
right now I'm findin out I don't need everybody
I shoulda listened, when you said don't brind dem niggaz to ya house
cause when you ain't there they'll try to break in ya house
I shoulda listened, when you told me you read what ya so
so everybody I meet I can't treat'em like a hoe
I shoulda listened, when ya told me do somethin wit my time
so I picked up the pen and paper and now I'm writtin ryhmes
I shoulda listened, when you said forget the money put God first
so that's the way I gotta end my verse

[Chorus] - repeat to fade",I Shoulda Listened,2002
Lil' Flip," 

[Lil' Flip]
Uh, take a look in my eyes, tell me what you see
A nigga who was young, grew up to be a G
I started off playin basketball for my coach
He started hatin so I took a differint approach
I'ma rap, fuck sweatin, and I'ma do somthin
(like what) that a nigga won't be regrettin
Could I ride? (no)
Could I steal? (no)
Could I jack? (no)
Should I kill? (no)
Nah, I gotta get my shit together
Cause a nigga need a house and big furniture with the leather
I pick up the pen, I pick up the pace
And I used to be broke I couldn't even pick up my face
And now, listen to the shit a nigga be doin
While you nigga's thinkin that a nigga's career be ruined
From smokin, and drinkin
Drinkin, and smokin
And I'ma try and go platinum while you thinkin and hopin
Wishin and lookin, trying to do what I do
And if ya fuck with me, ill shoot or ill sue
And how you want to' handle business, I can get it like that
And sellin work on the block, I used to get it like that
But I had to back back, and open up my eyes
When you runnin in these streets, you might get a surprise
Your friend could be a foe, your girl could be a hoe
And everybody you think got your back, you don't know
Doop been here before a nigga got rich
So Doop right here when I ridin in my 6
My nigga Cease make beats for me everyday
And guess what he don't never ask to get payed
My nigga Red keep it real, Hump got my back
When I didn't have a car, Hump bought a Lac
Now Hump bought a Jag, and I'm in it
Runnin through these hoes but my name ain't Emitt
Uh

[Chorus: Lil' Flip]
It's a fact - everybody smiling ain't your friend
Everybody with a grin contemplating on you man
It's a fact - you reap what you sow, better watch what you do
Cause you'll do it to somebody that'll do it to  you
It's a fact - your best friend will turn his back on ya
Pull a gat on ya, even rat on ya
It's a fact - that most niggaz act like hoes
It's a fact - that most niggaz act like hoes

[Lil' Flip]
Now who can you trust, who can you depend on?
When you all broke need money to lend on
When you tryin'a ball and your money been gone
When you tryn'a put the down payment on 10 homes
Will your nigga ride for you? Will your nigga bust?
Will a nigga come and get your ass out them cuffs?
Will your nigga take you to the mall and buy some clothes?
Will your nigga ever put you first before them hoes?
Will your nigga buy you drank and smoke up the weed?
Ride for your ass when niggaz shootin down your street
Come to your funeral and tell a fuckin story
Think about them nuts that we took with no glory
That category, the list
The rappin the hoes, the hoes and the shows
It comes and it goes
De Da De Da De Da

[Flip talking]
Straight up nigga, that's how I feel
Know what I'm sayin'?
Everybody needs to be ballin nigga
If you got chain nigga, your nigga need to have a chain
If you gotta' cut nigga, your nigga need a cut
If you gotta' hundred in your pocket nigga
your nigga need at least have fifty, know what I'm sayin?
niggaz that get in the rap
forget about them niggaz who helped 'em nigga
Keep it real nigga
So that's why I don't want to fuck with you new niggaz man
I ain't shootin marbles with you niggaz
But y'all cool

[Lil' Flip]
If it ain't Suckafree don't fuck wit me
Cause I know you got your eyes on my luxury
If you ain't Suckafree don't fuck with me
Cause I know you got your eyes on my luxury

Even though I made straight A's I still broke the rules
I came along way I went from no shows, to mo'shows

Lil' Flip,"In elementary I used crayons, even chalk
I learned to count money before I could read and talk
And my mama told me son, you need to shine
I couldn't stand at the back, I had to lead the line
I use to make good grades, but I talked in class
In middle school I was late when I walked in class
I the teacher ran a aron, I taught the class
And what I didn't know, I was about to ask
And just because I played ball, I got easy grades
And when I turned 13, I got even fades
Everybody wearing Air Macs, Ree's and J's
But all my parents cared about, was be	's and A's
In high school, I picked up my pen and pad
I had dreams, of pulling up in a Benz or Jag
I had to get it on my own, I couldn't depend on dad
I had to grow up too fast, but then I'm glad
Because the stuff I know now, I wouldn't believe it
The main goals that I set, I wouldn't achieve it
I'd probably be locked up, or running the streets
I'd probably wouldn't have platinum, in front of my teeth
I'd probably still be mocking, trying to earn a dollar
I'd probably be in the hood selling sherm or powder
But instead, I'm making bread legal dough
Going to church and staying away from these evil hoes

You only got one life,  you better do what you can
'Cause when you turn thirteen, you are a man
And I can't be broke so I'ma rock the crowd
It's up to me, I gotta make my mama proud

You only got one life,  you better do what you can
'Cause when you turn thirteen, you are a man
And I can't be broke so I'ma rock the crowd
It's up to me, I gotta make my mama proud

There's a place called heaven and a place called hell
There's a place called freedom and a place called jail
And if you go to jail, they gone treat you bad
Take your commissary, and beat you bad
So I'm staying out of trouble, I'm chasing my dream
I know you see your little boy on t.v. screens
I'm blowing up, your little boy making it happen
I'm not selling dope mama, I'm making it rapping
So when you go to sleep at night, you know I'm safe
Cause in Houston everyday somebody catching a case
Like yesterday, my partner went to jail
And he ain't coming home until he fifty seven
He nineteen, so you do the math
I got smart, man, I choose to rap
So when I grow up, my kids can have a good life
That's all I wrote, y'all have good night

You only got one life,  you better do what you can
'Cause when you turn thirteen, you are a man
And I can't be broke so I'ma rock the crowd

(Chorus: Repeat 2X)
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died

You still my nigga, my nigga, my niggas
I met Screw in 9-4 at a Fat Pat show
Back when Club Unique, use to be stadium bowl
I walked up to his car with a cassette in my hand
Then I freestyled for him 'cause this could be my only chance
Me and my partner Jason, we started doing mix tapes
We both smiled cause we knew this could be our big break
Then Screw wrote his number down and said hit him next week
Get your list together, and pick all your beats
Well time went by and my best friend died
Rest in peace Jason dog I wish your ass was alive
A couple months later, my second cousin passed
So that made me sit down and realize what I had
I dropped ""Diamonds In Yo Face"" and ""Buy The Car, Buy The House""
And Screw saw me at a show and said boy you went off
Two hours later, I was making tapes at his house
And didn't nobody go to sleep until the mics went off

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

I'm still on earth, and everything ter-rific
Pour me a spot, so we can reunite and kick it
People don't understand life, but one day you'll get it
But for now you better enjoy your one way ticket
And Screw, I want to thank you for the help you gave me
We had a relationship like Lil Wayne and Baby
The day you gave me the plack saying Screwed Up Click
The Freestyle King forever is Lit-tle Flip
You let me rip, the mic while you was scratching and mixing
I wasn't trying to run shit I just played my position
We stood in the kitchen smoking, laughing and sipping
Getting high, me and you eating a basket of chicken
Before we shot fool you said Flip come get a ass whipping
I ain't gone lie, Screw could shoot with one hand without missing
I'm on a mission, I'm trying to Screw up the world
Lil' Flip gone hold it down baby that's my word

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

Now the last verse, I ain't even got to curse
I'm use to seeing your Impala not you riding in a hearse
You set a trend, that'll never be forgotten
Just imagine Batman if he didn't have Robin
But I learned a lot, and I'm glad I'm in a click
And please believe, I still drop underground hits
I got your name tatted on me with a crown on top
You probably DJ'ing up there for Biggie Smalls and Pac

And even though you gone, your memory lives on
And on yeah, and even though you died
You still my nigga, my nigga, my nigga",R.I.P. Screw,2002

On Cloud 9 tryna reach they sky
We call it dro', ya'll call it lye
All I need is a sweet to get me by

I'm super fly like Missy
Drink Moette until I'm pissy
I pulled up in a Bentley
Hoes asking, ""Who is it?"", It's F L I P

Blowing that light green
No sticks, no seeds 300 dollars for an O-Z
And you know me stay blowed puffing and passing
You split it, dump it, lick it then stuff it wit hashing

Da roof, da roof, da roof is on fire
We don't need matches real smokers use lighters
Da roof, da roof, da roof is on fire
We don't need matches real smokers use lighters

Smoke all day that's what I do
When I think about my nigga Screw
I break bread with my crew
I smoke green, purple, even blue

I don't know about you but I love to smoke
Play Grand Theft and crack a joke
Or go to the club and snatch a hoe
That's the way it go when ya ballin' hoe

We smoke dro' to get higher
I got 20's on my tires, I got tensions in my wires
'Cause Haddy's got that fire
And when I retire, I'm a still be smoking hay
Like or mail man and Drey
([Unverified])

So if you wanna smoke something just holla at ya boy
'Cause I got cotton candy, tarantula and fat boy
We can roll a sack boy and get so high

You want to F-L-I-P with S-E
L-I-F-E, Flip with Seville tonight - [2x]

[Lil' Flip]
You ain't got to stereotype me because I'm a rapper
Cause after every show I be on another chapter
Not running to them hoes, but I'm running to my do'
Cause when I make money I don't shine, I just glow
If I don't work, then I don't eat
So I'm not tricking cause I'm looking for the treats
And if you play it right girl we could take it far
How bout walking in the park, rolling in my Jaguar

[Chorus: Seville]
You know you got me hypnotized up, sliding them thighs up 
Get ready to slide up, open you wide up tonight
You know you got me hypnotized up, sliding them thighs up 
Get ready to slide up, open you wide up tonight

[Lil' Flip]
I wonder if I broke both arms would you right a flow for me
If a girl scratched my car would, you fight a hoe for me
Go out of town and go get the dough for me
If I can't buy weed, would you grow for me
If I go to jail will you come and get me out
If a nigga got tickets, would you go and set it off
I don't know but I'ma find out, that's what I want to know
Cause I'm looking for a girl, I'm not looking for a hoe
Everyday I got a show, but I don't fuck around
And a nigga making money as soon as I touch the town
I'm a million dollar star, with a million dollar car
We could get in the jacuzzi and blow a cigar
With some hash in it, six car garage with some Jags in it
Nigga got a trunk, and I got ten bags in it
Went to buy some Gucci and some Prada
And niggas know I'm a leader Lil' Flip will never follow, holla

[Chorus]

[Lil' Flip]
I was lying, about taking a walk in the park
But girl I got some weed, where's the lighter let's spark
I'll tell you bout me, you tell me about you
And if you play it right I might start calling you boo
Got to cook for a nigga, write a hook for a nigga
If you say the law's coming, then look for a nigga
Cause a nigga need a gal, who's a ride or die chick
Excuse my french, I need a ride or die bitch

I'm Lil' Flip, I'm back on the scene, freestyle king
Brand new piece, same byzentine
I'm still sippin lean, I'm still watchin ""Scream""
I love wearin platinum, but my favorite color's green
I'm hoppin out Ferraris, my house is three stories
I'm still independent cause Jive couldn't afford me
The meetings were boring, for real I was snoring
The VP was fine, yeah she made me kinda horny
But that's another story, let's get back to the topic
Right now me and Hump negotiatin to buy the Rockets
We might buy the Comets - name it, I done it
If you see it, and want it, buy it, own it
This is for my homies, Pat and DJ Screw (Screw)
R.I.P. dawg cause I really miss you
Boy I'ma stay true, until the day I fall
East coast and West coast, this is how we ball

[Verse Two]
I'm thinkin - designer clothes and fashion shows
I'm thinkin - all my albums goin platinum and gold
I'm thinkin - Jaguars and a Bentley Rolls
I'm thinkin - bein rich before I'm 24
I'm feelin - wood grain all in my tinted truck
I'm fillin - all my teeth up with princess cuts
I'm fillin - jugs up, no mo empty cups
I'm feelin - like I'm worth 10 million bucks
And I know - I wear a watch, yo it was made from a game
And I know - my rims chop like the blades on a plane
And I know - yo baby mama still givin me brain
And I know - that ain't platinum, that's a silvery chain
And I make - nothin but hits when I step in the booth
And I make - rainbows from the sun reflect on my tooth
And I make - DVD's light up in my coupe
I think I feel I know I make money, how bout you?

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
I'm swangin, about to rip the kizzerp, sippin on my syzzerp
If you buy first from me then you just bought a dizzert
Swangas on my whizzeel, platinum in my grizzeel
Me and Doby D stay blowin on some kizzeel
I'm higher than a hizzeel, mind on a mizzell
Southside of H-town show me how you fizzeel
Now you see we ball, now you see we rich
I represent the legendary Screwed Up Click
I wreck I-45, I wreck 2 Screw tapes
I'm 3 wheelin, poppin trunk, goin down Fuqua
So move out of my way cause I'm ridin double are

And when it's cold outside, I bring my heat nigga
Don't beef with me nigga, cause I get down and dirty
I make a call at one o'clock, you gone by one-thirty

My enemies like batteries, half of em dead
You heard what I said, I'm down with trigga play
Cause all you see in convicts and killas, where I stay
I know Hump, got my front and Redd, got my back

And if you got beef let me know I'm ready for war

Lil' Flip,"Hi, this is the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Today we're interviewing Lil' Flip (what's up man)
So Lil' Flip tell me, how long have you been rapping
(man I've been rapping ever since)...

[Lil' Flip]
1995, I was in junior high
I saw a lot of shit, so I was glad to be alive
A lot of people died, but a lot of people here
And when I turned 15, my vision got clear

It's time to be a man, time to make a plan
It's cool to make a hundred, but it's best to make a grand
My Granny got sick, and then they found cancer
We got to pay the doctors, but God got the answer

The surgery went good, my Granny doing well
My baby on the way so I can't go to jail
And to my niggas on the block, stop selling rocks
'Cause I'm a tell the truth you can't outsmart the cops

You see what I did, I only drop hits
Chopping up game, why'all chopping up bricks
And some niggas snitch, cause they can't take the heat
How we gone go buy a system when the system got his beat

[Young Redd]
Hey, I'm from the home of the Astros, home of the Rockets
Born to rap yo, with a microphone in my pocket
Always thought I was grown, you couldn't tell me nothing
I would talk shit if you tried to tell me something

But I regret that, I had some minor setbacks
Old people thought my future would be jet black
All my years growing up, I thought life was a game
You can't make it real far, thinking life is a game

Yeah we lost a couple of friends, I almost lost my brother
I don't know what would of happened if we lost eachother
Everyday is something new, I just take it in stride
You only got one life, so enjoy the ride

Sometimes I was paid, sometimes I was broke
Me and Gray started hustling but my mama didn't know
But it's cool, cause now I'm into this music
The man gave us a gift and we loving to use it

And if you look real close you'll see
That you can only be you, and I can be me
'Cause can't nobody ever live my life but me
But you will never see what I see like me huh me

[Chorus: x 2]
And you don't know what I've been through
So you shouldn't judge me
And you don't know what I will and I won't do
So you shouldn't judge me

[Lil Ron]
It's getting harder now I just don't understand
Why the people in the world disgrace the black man
All that I could say, is pray and let it be
Little right and try your best not to end up like me

See I was the nigga that slang dope and steal cars
Glad I stopped before it led behind bars
Heart aches and scars, help me feel my way
Understand today I got a decision to make

Now do I want to live right or continue going wrong
I'm never at home this music keep a nigga gone
But this is what gets me, who are you to judge
'Cause I'm young and black, people still hold a grudge

Just a nudge right now'd push me over the end
When I was 14 I lost a very close friend
And ever since then my life ain't been the same
That's the biggest reason why I had to make a change

[Lil' Flip]
Never judge a book by it's cover, a man by his wealth
And if you already on your feet why don't you help somebody else
This what I was taught, so that's what I live by
'Cause you can't take none of this shit with you when you die

So everyday I try, to keep my head high
But these bird ass niggas always jump fly
Should I take em out the game, naw I'ma use my brain
I'm a kill em with kindness, and blow up my name

I came from nothing, and now I got a little change
A nigga happy now but I went through some pain
And everyday it rain, there's gone be some sunshine
I never thought I could put my whole life in one rhyme

If you play with my change, I put some change on your brain
You feel me mayn, you feel my pain, I need mine
Before I sign a contract, I gotta read mine
I'm just a young nigga, can't be a dumb nigga
I'm so thoed I got game nigga, I can fuck a nun nigga
I'm Lil' Flip, and the game is perfected
I'm the referee, your ass just got ejected
I'm the President, you know my residence
I graduated '99, so I'm intelligent
I got a Navigator, I got a calculator
I know these niggas know, I got that crib with elevators
Spiral chairs, and big ole maze
I got a big Excursion, on big ole Blaze
We chop chop hoes bop bop, back in the days
Niggas use to break dance, and pop lock
Now we play hop scotch, but if you play with my money
My nigga, I come and spray or pop blocks
Break niggas take niggas, look for the fake niggas
Step on it so fast, he a cake nigga
A weak nigga, a freak nigga
I got them books, you can call me a geek nigga 
Cause I'm a hustla, balla, gangsta, dope dealer
20 inch Sprewells, riding on my 4 wheeler
Just went to Mobilia, just to get mo' scrilla
I got my money, I don't depend on no nigga
Cause if I don't work, then I don't eat
Yeah I graduate, sometimes a nigga had to cheat
I cheated on my hoes, cheated on my tests
But I'm the pimp nigga, I must confess
So pay attention, when I spit my rhymes
Cause Lil' Flip, I'm always shining
Always grinding, time I was telling
Nigga my pockets swelling

They want to see something new, well nigga stay tuned
I cruise through, in a all blue H-2
Them rims big, so I'm sitting on them shag shoes
The white kids, say the black dude is that cool
I'm such a fool, I should open up a school
And teach some of these dudes, how to ride 22's
Try to figure me out, but you don't have a clue
Just follow my lead, y'all do as I do
Yeah I'm still in your hood, like run down houses
From the burbs to the projects, we got em bouncing
Pass the swisha, I'm with my nigga Flippa
My truck sit higher than heels, on a stripper
You got a heater, better keep it with you
It's fucked up, blind niggas can't peep the picture
Plus the fo' fever, guaranteed to leave you
Flat on the pavement, taking your last breather

Yeah, I had to do that for my niggas
Know I'm saying, everybody
Off the dome, off the brain
I'm all known like a pen to the pad nigga, yeah",We Ain't Scared [Remix],2003

Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours

[Slim Thug]
Now look who creeping look who crawling still balling in the mix
It's that six six long dick slim nigga sticking your chick
Pulling tricks looking slick at all times when I'm flipping
Bar sipping car dipping grand wood grain gripping
Still tippin' on four fours wrapped in four fours
Pimping four hoes and I'm packing four fours
Blowing on the endo Game Cube Nintendo
Five percent tint so you can't see up in my window
These niggas don't understand cause I'm Boss Hogg on candy
Top down at Maxi's wit a big glock nine handy
Pieced up creased up staying dressed to impress
Big boss belt buckle under my Mitchell and Ness
Oh, Gucci shades up on my braids when I Escalade
When I'm riding Sprewells sliding like a escapade
I got it made the big boss of the north
Ain't shit changed I still represent Swisha House (Ha!)

Four Fours I'm tippin'
Wood grain I'm gripping
Catch me lane switching with the paint dripping
Turn your neck and your dame missing
Me and Slim we ain't tripping I'm finger flipping and syrup sipping
Like do or die I'm pour pimping Car stop rims keep spinning
I'm flipping drop with invisible tops
Hoes bop when my drop step out
I'm shaking the block with four eighteens'
Candy green with eleven screens
My gasoline always supreme
Got do-do the brown with a pint of lean
It takes grinding to be a king
It takes grinding to be a king
First Round Draft Picks coming
Who is Mike Jones coming
Slab shining with the grill and woman
Slab shining with the grill and woman
I'm Mike Jones (Who) Mike Jones the one and only you can't clone me
Got a lot a haters and a lot of homies some friends and some phony
Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me
Back then hoes didn't want me Now I'm hot hoes all on me

What it do it's Paul Wall I'm the people's champ
My chain light up like a lamp cause now I'm back with the camp
I'm crawling similar to a ant cause I'm low to the earth
People's feelings get hurt when they figure out what I'm worth
I got eighty fours poking out at the club I'm showing out
I'm a player ain't no doubt hoes want to know what I'm bout
Biggest diamonds off in my mouth princess cuts all in my chain
Wood grain all in my range dripping stains when I switch lanes
Switched the name It's still the same Swisha House or Swisha Blast
Mike Jones he running the game and Magnificent bout his cash
Michael Watts he made me hot hard work took me to the top
G. Dash took me to the lot he wrote a check and bought a drop
I got the internet going nuts
But T. Farris got my back so now I'm holding my nuts
It's Paul Wall baby what you know bout me

Real girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!

By the time I hit the door
I saw hoes on the floor
Niggas dressed in suits
Tricking all they dough
Me? I'm a pimp
I ain't paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car
Or a new Rolex
Cause I got street fame
So hoes flock like birds
I got one ho in the range
And one ho in the burbs
When I hit the club
I'mma be with David Banner
A thug ass nigga
With bad table manners
We act bad; my nigga what is y'all saying?
Like when we walk inside clubs
Niggas hold they gal's hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night
How could your gal leave me
And be with you all night?
But it's all right
Cause you know we don't kiss
Like Too Short said:
""Bitches ain't shit""
I tried to told ya
That most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to
Make their money every week

Real thugs get down on the floor
Real girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!

Step into club looking just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screaming out ""shake something bitch!""
This is the song, tell the DJ put it on
Micheal Tyler made you shake
Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong!
The playa from the crib
So get out on the floor
And girl, get it how you live
And since you so hot
Fuck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen
But bitches keep me to the game
So if you gotta ho, shake em up and let em go
And let them girls get down on the floor

Real thugs get down on the floor
Real girls get down on the floor

Now don't you hate them old
Lying ass hoes?
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux
Eating steak and shrimp

Or you can catch us at E&J's pouring it up
Flip whipping Cali trucks
Girls licking my nuts
We some Southside pimps
And we ain't giving a fuck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

We make em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck: Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks, and
All of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fucking toes

Go on, touch your toes, and
Make me a roll and go on - hit the mall
And buy me some clothes, mane
And if your boy trip, I'mma bust a clip

What up Lil' Flip, how life treating you boy

[Hook]
Living the life of ice is nice, and fancy cars and all that shit
Going to bars menage tois, and nice ass broads that we just flipped
Up in the mall they call us dogs, but we gon ball until we fall
If you ain't living like us, well bitch you ain't living at all my life yeah

[Lil' Flip]
My life-my life-my life, it ain't great
Cause some days, I barely had food on my plate
So when I get some, a nigga real grateful
Cause when you in the ghetto, rich people hateful
With the he say and she say, from Keisha to Nay-Nay
From Nay-Nay to Shante, Shante and Andre
Sha'll I go on, about the shit I see everyday
Like a whole bunch of black folks, with no place to stay
Nowhere to lay, nowhere to pray
Just imagine, if you wore the same clothes thirty days
With scuffed up dirty J's, and plenty holes in your shirt
And won't nobody help you, they treat you like dirt
It's my life, I married the streets and made the hood my home
And I'ma represent this shit, till I'm gone
And even when I'm gone, you can listen to my songs
Cause I'ma let you know, what's right and what's wrong
It's wrong to borrow money, and never give it back
But if your family poor, it ain't wrong to sell crack
It's right to make cash, and make sure your click eat
And it's right to do a feature, with a nigga like me
Cause I'ma tell the truth, about everything I say
I've been through some shit, nigga I came a long way
From boy to man, from zero to grands
From no shows to mo' shows, and now I'm a man

[Hook]
[Laboo]
See I be trying to spit some knowledge, to these kids
But should I tell 'em go to college, or quit and find a gig
Cause the world don't really give you jack, and if you black
Fucking round with that crack, get you some time on your back
That's why I always, try to keep it clean
The FED time got my brother, doing fifteen
At bed time, send my prayers up
And I stay prepared for the money in the air, I'm trying to have stuff
That's why, I'm all off in the rap game
And worldwide, trying to spread it 'cross the map mayn
But black pride, got me thinking there's no limitation
Gotta survive regardless, any situation well

[Lil' Flip]
I'm grinding (where you at), on the block
(what's that) hand full of rocks, looking for the cops
(HPD) pull up, I wouldn't want to be em
(what you do) hop the first gate, see em
Thank God I'm still breathing, cause I'm a little heathen
I'm the type of cat, that start shit for no reason
Use to have meetings, with the church deacon
Cause I was doing other shit, while he was preaching
And every single thing, he was saying came true
And when we got our shit together, in 9-2
And boy I was a fool, at making that cash
Hit licks flipping bricks, right after every class

[Hook]
(*talking*)
That's right my life, my life of shining
Laboo, Lil' Flip all about grinding, living that life
You know that life that high life, the life of ice
And fancy clothes, and all that shit
I'm talking bout living it up nigga, down here in Texas

Put your hands up, put your hands up.

I'm a baller (baller), high roller, baby.
Where the ballers at?
Shotcaller (caller), driving chickens crazy.
Where the shotcaller's at?
You a hater (hater), why you trying to play me?
Where the ballers at?
Fake player, afraid I'll take your lady.
Where the shotcallers at?

I got the pots up in the kitchen,
I'm just a baller pitching-in my division.
Yes, me coming, some people be like dissing
My 26 rims like full moons, they be glistening.
So yes I got my eye for these chicks when I'm dishing.
The critics be talking, I walk past and start hissing.
Looking at my wrists, and shooting them balls in Detroit like I play for the pistons.
Baby if you listening, I'm a' tour so much,
Folks say I'm missing, gettin'.
This baller s-k-in', I be running around with it, spitting it.
The hood in here, a lotta ballers drop down in here,
I wish you would in here, We smoke good in here.

Look mellow, always be grinding, rhyming-

It ain't nothing to a boss,
That's why I spent three hundred on a cross!
Pink and yellow, that's the combination.
I know a skinny rapper out here player hating.
Cause I got thirty blocks on my resume,
I got my own liquor, why he drinking Alize?
Me and Chingy got the pop charts on lock,
But I still get respect on my own block.
Niggas try to take my money, but I bounce back,
Three cribs, one viper, and a Maybach.
I'm like, baby, you can call me the birdman.
But I'm the boss, I don't hustle on the curb, man.
Now everybody in my crib got a clover chain,
So even when I'm not around, they promote the name.
I'm Lil' Flip, rapping H-town 'till I'm gone.
I took a trip to Amsterdam smoking out a bomb,
A baller, baby!

[Chorus]

That's me, that's right, I've got a Bentley for sure,
A hundred million in the bank, plus I'm getting some more.
I'm the type of dude, moving more product than stores.
I'm a cook it in the kitchen for the price of the room.
I've got black diamonds, quarter million biller on shore.
On a white sandy beach with kickers and whores.
Said I'm on another level that you can't afford:
Princess cuts, round diamonds, and getting more.
That's why I shoot my dice four thousand or more,
Cause my price at work sure be on soar.
That's why we need a hundred grand for at stores,
Cause I won't settle for nothing less than more.

We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in y'all face

[Slim Thug]
I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue that
22 that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Hook - 2x]
Too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All y'all haters, can kiss our ass

[Lil Flip]
Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging 4's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And y'all haters, y'all can kiss our ass

[Hook - 2x]

[Tite]
I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D

She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Won't stop, can't gotta keep it goin' man
See I do it for the fans, they'll never understand
While they goin' off course, me I'm stickin' to the plan

Feel the movement, it's a whole new crew
Fuck Junior M.A.F.I.A., that chapter is through
Them faggots done did somethin' that they can't undo
Whoever ridin' with 'em they can get one too

You know where I go, man the team come too
Pull up in the Phantom or the V-1-2

In the club with my clique though, glass full of Crist-al
In the jail jumpsuit, still a bad bitch though
Rose from the ghetto it was hard from the get go
Then I showed the hood the world ain't just made for rich folk

And when you walk by I couldn't do nothin' but watch
Cause I know you wit a cat who ain't treatin' you right

A hundred dollar chips, let's gamble ma (let's go)
And if the crowd get thick let's scramble ma (let's go)
No gal can cook shrimp better than ma (ha ha)
I had a gal ain't know what berretta or nine

It's 'bout time 'cause hip-hop need a make over (But you don't hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how you get fucked up (But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga, the streets was mine (But you don't hear me)

'cause if you from outta town you about to get taxed
And that's that, I ain't changin' my price for nobody
You can keep them points 'cause you ain't gon' sell four cotties
'cause ya style too sloppy, ya beats ain't knockin'
And when you in public, them freaks ain't boppin'

My 6-4 hoppin' when I'm ridin' down the street
I still feel like I'm hustlin' why? 'cause I'm raw with these beats
You can put me on a plane or put me on a train
'cause no matter where I perform they understand my slang
They understand my pain and how I took over the game
From this day on, rap'll never be the same

Them video's on BET, yeah I know how much I'm worth
How much? I'm worth a lot, 'cause I really work a lot
And since Will Lean my nigga, I gotta help him out
So I'ma put him out man, so nigga kick ya feet up
And when the stores sell out then it's time to re up

So keep yo D up, 'cause we comin' with the heat man
And if you get a deal make sure yo' niggaz eat man
And to my fans, I appreciate the love
So holla at ya boy when I'm at the club

Look I was raised in in the(ghetto)
I got payed in the(ghetto)
a lot of gangsta's got made in the(ghetto)
a lot of wanksta's got, got in the(ghetto)
got shot in the(ghetto)-but not popped in they metal
I use to hang out with the ol' G's and peep game
they use to send me to the store and tell me keep the change
now it's eight years later and I run shit
kiss the ring 'cause now I'm on some dumb shit
and I ain't with that kissing ass shit dawg
you owe me stacks, don't hold me back-I'm backin heat with the Heatmakers
I can spitt it from the head I don't need a piece of loose sleeve paper

I'd rather roll a dutch and mix my single

and I don't know about you but I ain't hurtin'

'cause ya'll greedy ass fuck
niggaz don't take care of they kids they'd rather by a new truck
you want to be a ghetto star and ride in the hood
cause when the D's post up it's goin down in the hood
it's understood that more paper, bring more haters
everybody want to coach but we need more players
in eighth grade I got paid on a regular basis
I'm stepping out with Air Max with the regular laces

The mack will leave you on your back, strap will leave you with
 a gap
Stop smiling! - glances you see visions of the past
You see niggaz with masks, up in cars with no tags
When we balling! - I'm from the apartments, started with all of

Snatching bread then we dip, it's South Side - represent!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now the clique is called D.T.P. so get your crew right
We peer pressure fools, even +Dudley+ don't +Do-Right+

We putting ""foots"" in your asses, how we speak Australian?
I'm trained in the art of whoop ass, check my accolades
Got a knife and I'm giving out free after shaves
Plus a new acting gig, take a look at the CLIP!
It's called one up in the chamber and four on the HIP!
I snatch your girls in the club and use them as throat throttles

Lil' Flip,"I thank god everyday 
For paving the way 
Cause he made me what I am today 
A young entrepreneur with amazing talent 
In order 2 be	 the best you must take the challenge
I'm trying 2 be	 number 1 cause number 2 don't matter 
People trying 2 pull you down when you climb the ladder
Hate 2 see you up but they love it when you down 
That's why I'm always quiet when I come around
cause talk is cheap that's why I rap 
I'm getting NBA money with no salary cap 
Mama it feels good to put money in your mailbox
This for my niggas locked up in the cell blocks

For real I got to get away 

In life you go through drama and pain 
And when someone close dies it'll give you a migraine
And a whole lot of stress, a whole lot of tears
The days turn into nights, the nights turn into years
I'm not happy here, I'm on another atmosphere 
I got to get away just to get my mind clear 
That's why I smoke so much it relieves my stress
Just imagine everyday I got to wear my vest 
I got to watch my back 
Cause niggas hiding the jack
When you see these moving you like fuck you feel that 
To all my niggas in jail you better keep your head up 
To my niggas in the hood you better keep your bread up

That's why I spit these rhymes
To ease my mind
For real I got to get away 

If I died today I have lived my life
And if I could do it again Id do it twice
No more moving white or shooting dice
Or creeping late night trying to screw your wife
Cause I'm a changed man with the heart of a lion 
Even if I was a midget id be fighting a giant 
Ill never give up I'm from the home of the braves
I'm still ballin like pac from the cradle to the grave

This sixteen bars of my brain, I show my scars through my pain
I write my bars on the plane, I bring my boys on the plane
There's nothing like it, I swear
Can't no other rappers compare
Cause I can spit it or write it
Just admit it, you like it
I'm the hottest around
Niggaz know how I get down
But this ain't Making The Band
I'm tired of shaking your hand
I got the piece to the puzzle, I'm on the streets when I hustle
I got the heat with the muzzle, Okay (Okay)
You think you know it all, but I proove to show it all
When I move, you get one shot, hope you don't blow it, dog
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
You just a lukewarm, bookworm nigga and believe me, I can read you
I'm tired of snakes and rats, I'm moving forward, you pacing back

So when we pull up to clubs, they say we known for the brawlin
And all these bottles I'm poppin, it's uncontrollable ballin
Straight from the projects, I'm still cased up with charges
It only takes me three seconds to straight spray out a cartridge

Forget what these boys is talking bout, we wipe boys down
In South Park on MLK, on Sunday we clown
From the streets of Antoine, to the Homestead hoods
From Mo City to Studewood, it's all good
I'm riding on platinum grey, with Z-Ro and Trae
Gon let the top down, it's a beautiful day
Haters jealous on the sidelines, running they mouth
'Cause I roll with T.I.P., the king of the South
Boys know I'm Paid In Full, so they clocking my dollas
Me, Poppy, Joe and Fox all riding Impalas
I'm breaking bread with Mike Jones, and Slim Thug the Boss
It's Paul Wall, still representing Swishahouse
I'm with my boy Big Kaila, I don't bar no hater
I'm on the grind for paper, I'll holla at ya later

Sound like a train cause when I stop, they be like choo-choo-choo
And I'm thugging too homie, the heater kinda like Al Bundy's hand
Believe me every time you see me, it's gon be in her pants
If I do a crime and you snitch, homie the heater will snitch too
'Cause if the police come around, it'll be pointing at you
Somebody give mouth to mouth to this mic, after it melt
'Cause the only rapper out rapping me is me, after myself
I hope you internet thugs, that will swear that I ain't the tightest
Have cyber sex with Cita, until you catch a virus
Why is he saying this, to piss boys off
I officially claim myself, the rap King of the South
The say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you
And I say naw, give that title to the late great DJ Screw, rest in peace

[Z-Ro:]
Remember me, when I use to write my rhymes in class
At Dick Dall Middle School, all them niggaz would laugh
Telling me I would never make it, cause I rap too fast
I was desperately trying to find out, how to go from scraps to cash
Remember, how y'all use to chase me home from school
Just cause I sported corduroy britches, and Pro Wing shoes
I use to have a lunch card, cause them times was hard
Since the seven people living in one house, with no cars in the yard
I remember stressing so hard, I couldn't keep my focus
My only love was for extras, and overs
Fuck all you niggaz, don't make me slap the fuck out all you niggaz
If it ain't related to making paper, I ain't calling you niggaz
I bet Mo City remember, when I took it over with rapping
51-11 Ridgevan, moving that crack bitch I was stacking
Residuals redeemingly, I was raw mayn raw caine
Rapidly running my neighborhood, I was the law mayn
'Member when I dropped my first album, in '98
Fucking with Herman Fisher, but now that nigga hate me he's a cake
Suppose to be mad at me, tal'n bout I owe him some change
Nigga just mad cause they can't eat with me, I eat with Lil' James
Rap-A-Lot Mafia my man, y'all remember the Maab
This isn't Den-Den and Z-Ro, y'all better remember the squad
Two different labels but the same cable, remember we connected
Woodfair to Missouri City, two block of Screwed Up Texas

[Hook: x2]
Remember me, I'm the one they laughed at in all my classes
They use to rank on my low budget clothes, and my glasses
Remember me, the same one they use to call egghead
Now I play with fed bread, and sleep on Gucci bed spreads

[P.O.P.:]
I remember the winters in the hood, no heat cold nights
No gas no lights, a ghetto low life
So my flow twice as strong, from the memories
I remember when my closest homies, turned to enemies
See niggaz tend to be, down when your bread up
But when you in the quicksand, they frown cause your legs stuck
Yeah I remember that, so you remember this
Hard times be my fuel, so I ain't finna quit
I vividly, R-E-M-E-M-B-E-R
Craig up in the E-R, bloody getting CPR
So before, the reaper come and turn me to a memory
I endlessly spit the heat, for the people to remember me
Me P.O.P., so many forgot bout
But not I, this for those who remember little Popeye
And I remember hot guys, ridiculed the flow
Now I'm front and center nigga, haters finna do me so

[Hook x2]

[Bun B:]
Shit I remember back in the game, it was tough
No matter what a nigga had, it was never enough
See if I had five I wanted ten, and if I had ten I wanted twenty
Fuck having some, shit I wanted plenty
Back in the gap, when I first hit the block
With my first 25, and a hand full of rocks
Posted up at Samantha house on the West, on the porch
Ready to give my nigga some work, or give him the torch
I remember telling my T, I wasn't going to college
And was headed to the streets, to get the rest of my knowledge
That broke her heart, and for that I had to go
So I went from the sidelines, to starring in the show
Everything came slow, and nothing came fast
Most times I was out of luck, and dead on my ass
But with the heart of a hustler, and the mind of a G
I came up, now I'm something to see Bun B

Hold up a minute, I'm the King of the Ghetto
Holding the rap game, like wood grain can't let go
You niggas'll never see me, I'm on another level
Stay ready to dig a grave, keep a gun and a shovel
And pouring gas too, if there evidence
Saw me in the rear view, now you wonder where I went
I'm a get you if I owe ya, visit ya residence
Lay the merk game down, and then I'ma hit the fence
Better keep my mouth closed, so they can't see the shining
They think it was Z-Ro, cause all they seen was diamonds
I'm cold as a deep freeze, with bags of ice in it
My 3-57 pretty, but ain't nothing nice in it
Too many bitches, and not enough rubbers
Got so many, all my real niggaz under the gutter
Watch a nigga full of life, light close like shutters
God damn, staying healthy is hard as a mo'fucker

I got diamonds all in my mouth, in my grill and in my jaws
Platinum teeth and princess cuts, my mouth is similar to a disco ball
I'm Paul Wall my smile is blinding, my ice is shining like a chandelier
I tend to brush my teeth with Windex, just so the glass house mouth shine clear
I got mo' karats invested with soup, I'm a Texas icon a People's Champ
Put on your shades when I commits to approach, my mouth is eliminating like a lamp
It got gold grills and platinum and ice, cause that's how it is in the Lone Star State
With a cup full of bar in a candy car, and we jamming on a Robert Davis Grey Tape

Shining down South, brighter than all y'all
When it's time to get your jewelry done who do y'all call
Cause you fellas ain't shining at all, check me out
On the first and fifteenth, I'm some'ing like a pimp
Even with a suspended license, still finna flip
Ain't no limit to this cash, ain't nothing I can't get
Five deuce Hoover cause, ain't nothing like a Crip

Splinters still in my hand from my woodgrain

You know we mix purple stuff in that blue drank

Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin'

I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)

Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)

Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin'
Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A
Playin' the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

Niggas finally get a brick now they think they got weight

Cause you know a roach ain't shit to a rich nigga
And just because you heard I rap you don't know a nigga
Now gimme that, that ain't the right way to hold a pistol (stupid)
You toy soldiers gon catch five and roll over
While me and the other Clover Geez blow doja
And if you bitch made
I'm a run across your face with a switch blade, now take that

I be in Memphis 10, I be with Juice and Paul
I get money from Skinny Pimp (why?) cause that's my dog
I be with killers and convicts that put in work
I can blow five mil' and it will not hurt (damn!)
Cause I learn the game before I earn my change
And I will pay you back if you mention my name
Huh, it could be the mailman at your front do'
Or it could be your biggest fan in the front row
I like drama so call your momma I got a llama
That's what you get bitch for fuckin' with a big tymer
A rich nigga with chrome triggers for all y'all

I can take a weak track and make it a hit
I can take a nobody and make 'em a star
I think these hoes just wanna fuck my car

If you got beef with me then fuck ya?ll

Rock and roll, man roll and rock
I got tens, got twentys, got fifty blocks
I got smoke to buy, coke for sale
Sold much coke, got coke in jail
In the white Rolls Royce with my man Pharrell
This lil' nigga got beats too fresh to be stale
But I'ma take you back to the early eighties
When my cousin Stacey had the pearl Mercedes
My aunt cousin Wack had the black on black
Ac' coupe Legend with the gold in the back
I was just a lil' young'n runnin' wild as hell
Runnin' round wild trynta get that mail
Lil' shorty dudes trynta learn the grooves
I was twelve years old brought it to the school
Cause I was quick to flip, quick to sell that shit

Hey, I'm the candyman, I got mo' than frozen cups
I got your chop top sour diesel roll-ups

But Fam! don't try to roll up (Star Track)

Missin' on the streets, so the fiends is still buyin'
Right on time and money on the mind and
On them twenty-fo's, them bit-ches straight shinin'
But y'all niggaz don't know bout this
Fresh new kicks with the new outfit
Got the all black top with the black on black
You ever see me creepin, just back on back
Cause I got that pump and it is gon' spit
I ain't no punk and I ain't no snitch
From a place on Earth called Huntersville
Where people out there got love for real
Got love for all who got love for me
If a coward ever ran then it wasn't me
I'll be on the curb movin' dubs and d's
And if you ever bought a dub then it was for me
I ever get caught then it was to be
I'ma just make bail by my cousin E
Back on the Porsche with the mobile phone
Like eleven in the mornin' them hoes to go home
Trynta score and get this shit off quick

Aww shit, this is the part when the fight just start
When the fists get to swingin' and the four-fifths spark
And then the bitches get to runnin' and the bitch just scream
And we spin off in Rolls and it's so damn clean

[Verse 3: Fam-Lay]
I stand on my block, the cam on the spot
My hands in my pocket, both hammers is cocked
Waitin' for a nigga to just act up
My right hand big six, got my bait back up
Niggaz lookin' all jealous, lookin' mad as hell
Actin' like lil' girls, like tattle-tales
Mad cause my right hand bad as hell
I would've kept shootin', but I had a sale
See, I'm a crime boss three sixty-five
Lookin' for a Nina Ross, she just can ride
Picked up my cash and slide all sweet
Nigga tried to snatch ass, knocked his heart off beat
Nigga talk trash like the shit all sweet
won't'cha all take the cash dogg, not off me
Hustlin's in my veins - you cannot stop it

Lil' Flip,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You just lost one

Take this muh'fuckin' rap money
And bring it back to the block nigga
Haha, fo' real, so if you gettin yo money
That drank money, you gettin it
You know, I'm just worried about me now
Got all the fuck boys from around me, hey fuck you niggas
Hey, now let's get it

[Chorus]
After I do my concert, I bring that money to the block
And nigga I don't half, cause I want the whole block
Now whip it, now whip it, now whip it, now whip it
Now get it, whip it, ship it, and flip it

[Verse 1]
Ay I told you muh'fuckers I'ma bounce back
With three million in cash, potna count that
If I write you a check, nigga you can cash that
And when I'm in Europe, I use my flatstack
The black car get used fo' times a day
My rims skinny, but my pockets overweight
Go get yo tubes tied, cause you a bitch boy
800 grand, and now you think you rich boy
You better step it up, my paper been straight
And by the way my new chick go to Penn Stae
I paid for her car, I paid for her books
Okay I'm lyin, but don't that shit go with the hook
I got money to blow, I oughta be ashamed
I'm playin with some change, I want Travolta plane
He got a couple of 'em, we always fuck with rubbers
This ain't O.G. kush, I like to call it Bubble

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ay fuck boy, I'm the James Toney of rap
Cause niggas hate me, but I still got it like that
A brand new 'Vette, I'm a ladies man
Plus my Bretlin cost me 80 grand
Ay, money ain't a thang, you know where I hang
And besides music, you know what I slang
And you know what I claim, It's Clover Geez up
And don't you hate it when yo potna smoke, all yo weed up?
I had to roll my sleeves up (why?), cause of my bracelet
And we ain't goin nowhere, so just face it
I lace weed with the syrup cause it burn slow
I make G's with my words cause it earn dough
Who woulda known Lil' Flip 'll scan five mil'
And then be forced to take a break for two years
But the block got love for the God
So you know it ain't shit for me to get a nigga robbed

You want a thang got em yams go straight to Money Gram
I'm from the hood, so you know I'm down wit any money scam
Black glocks, white glocks spit like sheet rock
You know a drank on me, this concert gon' stop
A lot of cops at the scene tryin' to shut shit down
You was a nobody, but now you famous now
I be out in Chi-town wit some real OG's
Matter of fact one of them had dinner wit me
You gotta play by the rules when you on these streets
You lil' niggas tryin' to mimic what you see on beef
You betta

I know some Englewood Bloods (bloods)
And you can ask ??? fans I got Cali love (love)
I got a strap waitin' for me everytime I land
Just to send you a message, I'll clap your man
Now he under white sheets like the Klu Klux Klan
You lil' boys shouldn't beef wit a grown ass man
I got stripes in the hood, I put in work fo' real
And mentioning me, will get you put in dirt fo' real
How much that gramma yay, bitch you carry weigh
Cause I'm on this Alize and I carry cake
I came back to the streets I had to let y'all know
And by the way my new deal worth 8.4
So I'mma

I'm strapped nigga
I'm strapped nigga

Cross lope and you know it's goin' doowwnnn (like Yung Joc)
40 cal, 50 cal, what you workin' wit nigga?
I'm in a Maserati what you swervin' in nigga?
And when I'm out in Cleveland, I'm fuckin' wit X
It's been 'bout 5 years he still holdin' my tech

Can't be a dope boy without a gun and a chain
Make sure you got them extra clips nigga
But on the real nigga, don't hate on a nigga when you see me pull up on that Maserati

Lil' Flip,"[Chorus]
Tell me why I can't see where I'm goin(No)
When everybody else see's,where I'm comin from
And I don't know why I travel down these dead end roads
I gotta turn this car around-and find my way home

When you listen to my music do you feel my shit
Look I don't need punchlines cause I live my shit
A lot of cats selling they soul for radio play
That's why we need mo' rappers like Common and Kayne
Niggas scared to be broke so they fake it,to make it
If my album went gold I'd still be the greatest
Back in the days I would get caught for trulency
But now I'm puttin' money back in my community
I took my homies out the hood now they got jobs
Cause it's more to life then dodgin' cop cars
I played the block hard,now I play the pop charts
Now I'm gettin' dumb money,cause I got smart

[Chorus]

Ayo I never seen a man cry,till I seen a man die
So when you talk to me look me in my damn eyes
Cause I been through it all and my scars prove it
Cause when it come to that paper homie I'm a do it
I just rhyme part time you better know it
These lines comin' from my mind so I never wrote it
Keep my nine by my spine so I never show it
Yeah I'm addicted to pine but I never grow it
And the reason I got signed cause I'm a poet
Half of my niggas doin' time but I'm focused
That's why I'm stayin' on my grind if you haven't noticed
That old Cadillac transformed to a Lotus

[Chorus]

When ya new album drop everybody ya friend
Niggas actin' like they down but I know they pretend
I use to scrap up money for studio time
I'm like Jay Z homie I remember my rhymes
Ain't nobody help me out when my cash was low
Bills comin' too fast so I had to blow
And I walked by faith,not by sight
Cause I know G-O-D will guide me right
I take the bitter with the sweet,I know you feel my pain
Why we gotta get harassed when we board the plane
I ain't tryna preach to you but I hope you relate
Even at a dead end you gotta find yo' way (Okay,Okay)

[Chorus]

I wanna dedicate this track here to my grandparents
Ya know they stuck with me through thick and thin
Ya knah' I'm sayin' since day one,without my family
Ya know I ain't got no back bone man

Drinking beer, shooting dice at school

The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cutting yards for a twenty piece of crack rock
Around my way, ain't nobody watching Matlock
We tryin' to hot wire cars and break pad locks
Turn soft to hard, drop it in Glad locks
And drive flashy cars, and get mad props
And still I won't change
Last week they caught my partner with a block of 'caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him thirty-five years 
His momma went insane

Being grown, tryin' to flirt
Leaving home wearing pants
Then change into a skirt

But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

Many nights you waited up but I never called back
And every time I had a show I would tell you to fall back
I know you think I got chicks in every state
I know my lifestyle fast but I'ma pump my breaks

At the beginning everythang was cool
I used to leave the studio and pick you up from school
You was there when I had to eat Ramon noodles
If you ain't careful stress is what the game'll do ya

I got the world on my shoulders
That's why I lace my girl with a Clover
I know you worried 'cause I stay in the streets, ma
But don't worry 'cause I roll thirty deep, ma, I'm good

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

At first it was restaurants then the movies
Now you typing crazy messages in my two-way
But it's time though I meet a million hoes
But they ain't like you 'cause they ain't got pretty toes

You know thugs never let their feelings show
But anytime you wanna talk just let me know
'Cause I got your back, we a perfect match
It's me and you against the world, who's stopping that?

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

I never meant to break your heart
But you know how life go, shit happen
But you know I still got your back
And I just wanna tell u that

I like to see you with no make-up on
I like to see you with a Jacob on, now do your thang, girl
If you wanna get to know me just holla, girl
Have you ever rode in a drop top Impala, girl?

I could turn a good girl into a bad girl
I got you rocking black ice, no more black pearls

Back befo' Snoop Dogg beat his murder case
I used to jam Run D.M.C
Monie Love, MC Lyte, and Biz Markie

When LL was bad with that gold rope phone
Back when niggas used beepers, now we got mobile phones
Me and my homies used to battle at the park
We had to be back on our street by the time it got dark

We used to wear cross colors now we love Guess
""6 minutes your on"" like Dougie E. Fresh
I'm capable, I'm makin? dough like Puffy did
But this ain't happen overnight, trust me kid

Now e'rybody wanna spit 16
And live the glamorous life on the T.V. screen
But it ain't that easy, y'all rappers cheesy
I can't leave rap alone my fans need me

Ain't nobody scratchin? now
?Cause e'rybody goin platinum now

I'm a Nigga with a attitude like Cube and them
I got fame when I start fuckin? with Screw and them
Freestylin? on tapes for eight minutes straight
Pick a beat, rap to it, get another out the crate

Thanks to hip hop I got a whole lot of cake
I'm like these rappers actin? like they move a whole lot of weight
But wait, in my state I'm considered the great
And I refuse to pay for radio play

Rest in peace Justo, we gon? miss you dog
I know Jam Master Jay and Screw with you dog
They'll never be a DJ better than y'all
And by the way, rest in peace 'Pac and Biggie Smalls, yeah

He make it to third base, but the condom wouldn't fit
And guess who bust in, the lil' girl's daddy
And you know black folks, he beat the lil' girl's ass
Now her stepmom mad, she like send her back
Cause I don't want my real daughter, growing up like that
I tired to tell you last year, when you bought that phone
And you don't know what she doing, when we ain't at home
In these days, the kids looking older now
So a grown man, might tap you on the shoulder now

This about a lil' mama too, if pop was here
I know it's hard to raise a child, and maintain a career
This a message, to all the single mothers in the world
(Don't be wasting all your time)
And if a coward get you pregnant, and he don't wanna help
Don't get stressed out, you can do it by yourself
Cause you a strong woman girl, enjoy your life
And no matter what they say, keep your head to the sky

Now it's eight years later, ery'body seventeen
But everything changed, since Kim left the scene
Now her laid back man, moving crackular
You want a ki, you gotta meet him at the back of the store
But guess who saw who, at the club that night
After exchanging phone numbers, somebody started a fight
Now ery'body running, so Kim ran with him
That's when she said you a playa, why you ain't leaving with them
That's when he said I want you, I been waiting for you
What you say we get a room, just me and you
After too much liquor, one thang led into another
But you know where he messed up, he told her he loved her

And no matter what they say, keep your head to the sky

Now it's two months later, that nigga disappeared
Meanwhile Kim at home, trying to wipe away her tears
Befo' she gave it up, he use to call daily
Another month passed by, now she going crazy
She popping up at clubs, she even keyed his car
That's when she got the phone call, bitch you went too far
Oh now you calling back, cause your car got scratched
You said you loved me, I can't believe I fell for that
Damn, I shoulda known you was a pig anyway
Look my stomach been hurting, and my friend kinda late
Wait, I took a test at least three or four times
But you know what cowards say, it ain't mine

And I know you tired, of hearing that man
A real man take responsibility, for his seeds
This for every single mother, whether you white or black
It don't matter, you know I'm saying
Everybody can't be born rich, you know I'm saying
I come from the hood, I made something out of nothing
You know I'm saying, everytime I do a concert
It's females in the front row, after the show
They like sign my autograph, so I can get back home
My kids gotta go to school, you know I'm saying
So if you taking care of your child, by your damn self
Keep doing your damn thang, if Fantasia can do the shit
Anybody can do it, you dig what I'm saying

Twenty eights when I roll out
Ten clear coats on my gold drop
What's yo name? Where you from, girl?

And all three of 'em ringin' from bad ass bitches that wanna bone
Take one or two calls, take one to the telly and take one home
Cuttin' corners barely missin' the curb, tryin' not to break her bone

I'm sittin' on choppa eighty-threes and fresh ass meat
A nigga tried to jack me for 'em so I opened up his chest last week
I'm rude as a mothafucker but I get nice when I receive head
Might fall off for a minute but I get back right when I receive bread

Talk up on somethin' short and thick, go straight to the bed with it
But on the low, low 'cause someones always watchin' like a Fed visit
Crucify the coochie then cut a couple of corners
Cruisin' with me in the Bentley soon as I borrow ya

The paparazzi tryin' to get another flick of me
Police muggin' like I got a couple bricks on me
They hate when rappers come in town and have they club crunk
Cause we get e'rybody high and leave the club drunk
Poppin' bottles, coppin' tiles, puttin' rims on it
I got mo' paper than you, I put my gems on it
How many rappers walk around rockin' three clovers
A German car but I got a Portuguese chauffeur
No penny loafers, I ain't Mike But I'm Bad nigga
And for that paper I'll get up in yo ass nigga
You too commercial, I'll hurt you and let that nine squirt you

I buy that shit you never knew existed
I hit the road and get paid, you come back home evicted, we stay ballin'

I only wear t-shirts, so fuck Prada
I used to have to win battles rhymin' on my turf
But now I'm walkin' around with diamonds in my shirt
Wrist glitted, car kitted, I'm so gutter
Even when it's Winter time I got fo' hustlers
But when you get rich that's when the snakes come
I had to figure out the real niggas from the fake ones
This rap shit got a nigga goin' overseas
But from Houston to Zurich we all smokin' weed
Them Clover Geez makin' moves while y'all standin' still
Nigga my fuckin' swimmin' pool cost a quarter mil'
Cause I'm a big mack, ridin in my big 'Lac
Like 3-57 with a little kick back
We miss you 2Pac, we miss you Biggie Smalls
Until we meet again, me and Yuk' gon ball, oh boy,oh boy

All my potnas got loot too, yeah
(Hell yeah we got loot too man, what you think?)
Said I'd rather ball with you
(You know we ballin' man, rose gold and platinum, what?)
And we flippin' new Benz Coupes, yeah

And we ridin' on 22's
(Deuce-deuce's baby)

Geah, geah, Yukmouth I'm Godzilla, ridin' with Lil' Flippa
Y'all rappers buyin' adapters we ridin' on real spinners
With goons and gorillas we ridin' with real killers
Cancun and the Villa, we playin' with real scrilla, nigga
I'm still ballin', flossin' and shot callin
Yuk' and Lil' Flip goin' show you who boss hoggin'
Y'all stompin' artist, all of my rocks flawless
Still get the whole club jumpin' like hydraulics
I spit the hottest flows, overseas rockin' shows
Still keep a flock of hoes at Roscoe's and Pappadeux
Rose gold and black diamonds is Rocky Road
Still aim, lock, and load, they'll kill you for some stop-n-go's
I rep the Westcoast, Flip represent the South
Shine with the down payment for a house in my mouth
I rock chains like Slick Rick in '82

To check on my fam and buy my love bro throwbacks
I came a long way, it ain't my fault you went the wrong way
And listen up I'm grown nigga, I don't play
I got show money (yeah), plus liquor money (yeah)
After I get off stage I got picture money
These rap cats ain't stickin' to the G-code
You thing you fly cause you got a few free-throws
I know squares that cook O's, you damn right
And if you want it, you gotta pay the damn price
I do this for the dope boys with them A-K's
I'm a fly yellow nigga like Kay-Kay

Ay, you ain't gotta be fake I know y'all don't like me
Cause when I got shot up, y'all ain't right me
You got a chip on your shoulder, I got a clip in my holster
The difference between us, is I'm focused
Nowadays e'rybody wanna talk about me
But you know you can't mention the South without me
Record labels came, and record labels went
Pay attention to your checks, watch the money you spend
Your kids dirty, but you ride around in a Benz
Everyday at Pappadeux, trickin' ya ends
It ain't the color of our skin, that hold us back
It's a fact, niggas don't know how to act
A few niggas get paid e'rybody want a piece
Shit start goin' wrong e'rybody wanna leave
Record sales low e'rybody wanna beef
(No matter where I go) I keep it H double O-D

[Chorus: x2]

Ay, all my niggas makin' forty-five hunnid a week
We overseas blowin' trees, yeah it's somethin' to see
You'll never hear me say ""I don't need the hood""
All my niggas gettin' fat cause I feed the hood
It ain't my fault y'all niggas don't leave the hood
I did everything y'all ain't believe I could
Huh, you not ahead of me, I got longevity
I'm tryin' to leave my lil' boy, a legacy
I got the recipe, you wanna make a hit
You not impressin' me, talkin' bout bricks
I made it out the hood, and I'm still thuggin'
Accepted by Hollywood, and I'm still hustlin'
And that's a goddamn shame right?
Oh well, I'm tryin' to get my change right
And you'll survive, if you play the game right
I fly G-5's I ain't gotta change flights

Ghetto mindstate

At 15, I was makin' movies
Drinkin' beer, shootin' dice at school
When most niggas had a 9 to 5 shit
On the block, we makin' 9 to 5 grand

Each day, yeah, we got cheap yay
My niggas on lock, they called me on 3 way
The hood hot like a crock pot
Dope fiends cuttin' yards for a 20 piece of crack rock

Around my way ain't nobody watchin' 'Matlock'
We tryna hot wire cars and break padlocks
Turn soft to hard, drop it in Glad Locks
And drive flashy cars and get mad props

And still I won't change
Last week, they caught my patna with a block of caine
And can't no amount of money stop the pain
They gave him 35 years, his momma went insane, damn

I just can't go, I just can't stay
I just can't, you just won't
I just can't get away

I just can't go, I just can't stay
I just can't, you just won't
I just can't get away
Ghetto mindstate

Comin' up with no father figure
I guess that made me a harder nigga
Why? 'Coz I don't like to ask for shit
When I came in the game with a half a brick

But I ain't tellin' lil' kids to go that route
But it's on TV everyday like they don't know that route
And lil' girls bein' fast, bein' grown, tryna flirt
Leavin' home wearin' pants, then change into a skirt

I live in the ghetto, I stay in the ghetto
Run up wrong, I'm sprayin' that metal
'Coz ain't shit sweet around my way
All I know is one thing, how to get paid

With Lyfe on the hook, I know we got another hit
This motivational music, I know you feelin' this
Hey, and I was raised in a church
But where I'm from you gotta do that work

I just can't go, I just can't stay
I just can't, you just won't
I just can't get away

I just can't go, I just can't stay
I just can't, you just won't
I just can't get away

Why everybody tryna bring me down?
Because of me, they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all weren't around
The first week you did a 'Aight'
But then that shit went down

Why everybody tryna bring me down?
Because of me, they respect H-town
Look, I was here when y'all weren't around
The first week you did a 'Aight'
But then that shit went down

They tell you you were born to die
Yo momma, she was born to cry
Yo woman, she was born to lie
Hold you down so you can't rely

I tell you that it's all a lie

Keep your eyes up on the sky
Don't let your dreams pass you by

Hold up (Hold Up), we jammin'

I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)
Cause I'm comin' down, playa surroundin' livin' these ho's fantasy
Cause I'm choppin' blades and playin' maze and these bitches they can't stand it (can't stand it)
Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin'
I'm comin up (choppin' on dubs and showin 'em love)
2000-Fizive and you are not fly enough (young bitch)
Uh Hold up young bitch-bitch I just don't wanna stop comin'up

[Verse 1: Pimp C]
Uh it's never too much the paper I make
These other pussy niggas ain't real them ho's fake
I'm Sweet James Jones when you come through bitch
I treat you good because you know I'm rich
I was in the ghetto-had nothin'
Sold a lot of records and grabbed somethin'
Now I'm goin' through movies in L.A
Playin' the game the way the hustlers play
And everyday I try to stack my grip and make three songs
I'm try'na get my mothafuckin' paper on
I want the new (bone?) and the new cell phone
I want the new two way pager and the new mansion home
In Houston cause that is my city
And them other pussy niggas they record sound shitty
When I see you in the town I'm a hit you up
You never could take my dream cause you niggas fucked up

I can't let nobody hold me down-these ho's could never hold me (never hold me)

Peep up in this game and this thing is so demandin' comin' Up

[Verse 2: Z-Ro]
I remember when I had to come up just to come down
That's the reason for my uncontrollable ballin' right now
Use to be scared to walk in the store I payed the price now
My life is to valuable for me to play with life now
Of course it's gon' be some niggas who think I done changed
They find me guility just because now I got diamonds on every thing
My mouth and my pinky ring, my wrist and my neck
I'm 'bout my business so give me my cash or give me my check
See I can biblically remember me and Trae on the block
Even more then hustlin' sometimes we had to lay on the block
Eat, sleep, shit, piss, pray on the block
To make it through the night to see another day on the block
Movin' rocks got us full pockets-plus knots in our socks
But now money be comin' in wadd's like blocks
Let's go half on a Yacht-I got the pot you got the chicken fried steak
I can't even hear you haters you've been muted by my paper chase

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil' Flip]
Who would've known that this rap shit would take me far
At 18 I had a fifty-thousand dollar car
I went from Jag to Benz but not the regular kind
Now I'm smokin' hydro not the regular pine
I spit one freestyle now I'm rockin' clubs
After ""Diamonds N Yo Face"" I was coppin' dubs
I had to make the transition from a boy to a man
So if you wanna 16 that's forty-grand
Rappers talk a lot of shit but you ain't stoppin' us
Look you don't wanna bump heads with a mafia (Huh)
Look you don't know shit about UGK
Or Mr. Fat Pat and Grey Screw tapes
I rep the Screwed Up Click peep the watch I'm wearin'
I'm the first cat in Houston with a black Meclaron
Lil' Flipper tote pistols for them none believers
Cause down here we poppin' trunks on Cadillacs and Regals (Oh boy)

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)

Lil' Flip,"This for all my players out there ridin',
Spinners I don't care where you at, the club parking lot the expressway
Whatever what I want you to do right now is just stop
And let 'em keep spinnin' baby

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

Pedal to the metal then stop
Take another sip from the syrup then stop
Let my seat back, drop the top then stop
See me something sexy, spot that ass I gotta stop

My rims so shiny they clear like flat screen plasma
Gals faint when they see 'em it's hard to breathe, like they got asthma
Older people trippin' 'cause they think they seein' thangs
My car sittin' still but my rims still rolin' man, they off the chain

Everybody let ya spin wheels spin like a spin mill
Juicy J on certain pills, cruisin' down to Knoxville
See them thangs shinin'
Sparkin' like a diamond, bumpin' the Alpine, why you's a lyin'

Eyes like a Chinese, I'm drinkin' on the heiny
I'm ridin' on the strip, any party you can find me
You rollin' with the finest the north Memphis highness
You ball till ya fall, till a player aged ninety

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

I got twenty inch spinners on my drop
Nothin' but white and yellow rocks in my watch
I'm doin' one fifty so I'm watchin' for the cops
Since I'm in the Lamborghini I ain't gon' stop

I'm packin' a Glock believe it or not I'm ready to bust
And down here we drink purple and we drink that, trust
So grab a cup juice so I can pour it up
And if you represent yo hood, go on throw it up

It's the L-I-L, F-L-I-P
If I ain't smokin' trees, I'm pokin' freaks
So throw the row of keys and let me roll
'Cause this the way we ball, I'm just lettin' you know

We like our music slow but our cars go faster
I'm in the V-12 with my cousin Big Shasta
I'm Lil' Flipper and I'm a top ten seller
Everybody slowin' down 'cause my drop is yellow

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, it's rollin'

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop
I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, I'm rollin'

I saw my dog with the center circles so I
They spinnin' like a saw so don't touch 'em when I
I saw a shanky broad that owe me money so I
See me choke the hell up out my broad when I

When ya stand by the blades you can feel a slight breeze
Stop by House of Dubs just to keep 'em on clean
Fell up in the Peabody, the most expensive suite
Them thangs still spinnin' when I filled out the receipt

I used to be clean in my expedition
A girl see me and she'll be wishin'
That I'd stop and spit some pimpin'
It's mackin' in me baby, I just thought I would mention

She got hot like in the kitchen
You see my kin folks, cars and glisten
Ain't nothin' like Sprewells 'cause they spinnin'
It's CB baby I'm just in it to win it

I'm ridin' spinners, I'm ridin' spinners, they don't stop

What up Lil' Flip, how life treating you boy

[Hook]
Living the life of ice is nice, and fancy cars and all that shit
Going to bars menage tois, and nice ass broads that we just flipped
Up in the mall they call us dogs, but we gon ball until we fall
If you ain't living like us, well bitch you ain't living at all my life yeah

[Lil' Flip]
My life-my life-my life, it ain't great
Cause some days, I barely had food on my plate
So when I get some, a nigga real grateful
Cause when you in the ghetto, rich people hateful
With the he say and she say, from Keisha to Nay-Nay
From Nay-Nay to Shante, Shante and Andre
Sha'll I go on, about the shit I see everyday
Like a whole bunch of black folks, with no place to stay
Nowhere to lay, nowhere to pray
Just imagine, if you wore the same clothes thirty days
With scuffed up dirty J's, and plenty holes in your shirt
And won't nobody help you, they treat you like dirt
It's my life, I married the streets and made the hood my home
And I'ma represent this shit, till I'm gone
And even when I'm gone, you can listen to my songs
Cause I'ma let you know, what's right and what's wrong
It's wrong to borrow money, and never give it back
But if your family poor, it ain't wrong to sell crack
It's right to make cash, and make sure your click eat
And it's right to do a feature, with a nigga like me
Cause I'ma tell the truth, about everything I say
I've been through some shit, nigga I came a long way
From boy to man, from zero to grands
From no shows to mo' shows, and now I'm a man

[Hook]
[Laboo]
See I be trying to spit some knowledge, to these kids
But should I tell 'em go to college, or quit and find a gig
Cause the world don't really give you jack, and if you black
Fucking round with that crack, get you some time on your back
That's why I always, try to keep it clean
The FED time got my brother, doing fifteen
At bed time, send my prayers up
And I stay prepared for the money in the air, I'm trying to have stuff
That's why, I'm all off in the rap game
And worldwide, trying to spread it 'cross the map mayn
But black pride, got me thinking there's no limitation
Gotta survive regardless, any situation well

[Lil' Flip]
I'm grinding (where you at), on the block
(what's that) hand full of rocks, looking for the cops
(HPD) pull up, I wouldn't want to be em
(what you do) hop the first gate, see em
Thank God I'm still breathing, cause I'm a little heathen
I'm the type of cat, that start shit for no reason
Use to have meetings, with the church deacon
Cause I was doing other shit, while he was preaching
And every single thing, he was saying came true
And when we got our shit together, in 9-2
And boy I was a fool, at making that cash
Hit licks flipping bricks, right after every class

[Hook]
(*talking*)
That's right my life, my life of shining
Laboo, Lil' Flip all about grinding, living that life
You know that life that high life, the life of ice
And fancy clothes, and all that shit
I'm talking bout living it up nigga, down here in Texas

Lil' Hd Snoop Dogg,"Whats up nephew?
Sitting here chopping game, my nigga Bad Azz
Niggas get the misconception of us
cause we so cold at what we do
But I really wanna let niggas know what's happening though
You feel me?

[Chorus]
Now I don't want anybody
to get the wrong idea about me
I don't have nothing to hide
I want the world to see,
I'm a gangsta gangsta
Gangsta niggas do your dance
(C-Walk, C-Walk homey, yeah)
Gangsta bitches wave yo' hands

See me, I'm bout my money my paper I'm bout my dollars
Popping collars with this mac and this slack and these two revolvers
See we smoke and go hoeing cause the bitch ain't never shit to me
and pussy stay selling, so I never let it get to me
The shit to me is simple, it relies on credentials
We credible individuals, ahead of you we original
Better known as criminals, thugging off on the stereo
Killing 'em on the radio, some of them wanna hate me though
Fuck 'em cause they can't see me doe and here we go again
The jealousy took me over success, just keep you slower
While, you get nothing, we keep getting more
Pump pump the jam up, drop drop the top
Hit hit the switch and smash down the block
And oh yeah this Long Beach so you know when you see a nigga
And don't never get the wrong idea nigga
(Yeah, nigga what?)  Holla at 'em

[Chorus]

I keep my khakis creased, hat tilted to the East
On a bitch I remain the beast, none the least
Police try to cuff me and stuff me in the back
of they patrol car, cause I'm a former parole star
With the cool name, this nigga here's a fool man
Go on and do yo' thing, gang-bang
in the hood and in Hollywood
Record company executives think it's all to the good
Get to showing me around they house, then he slide me in the back
and had the nerve to try to buy me out, check this out man
I'm down with P, and D-R-E
A real nigga from the motherfucking L.B.C.
I just look like this, I stay down for the twist
I'm real with this, deep as abyss
I gave you a pound, then I gave yo' wife a kiss
I had to dip cause y'all was full of that bullshit

It's the weekend

Aiiyo I heard the party packed from the front to the back
We gon' tear the roof off, make the floor collapse
Jump out the Porsche, candy-gloss, hunchback
Slid right in, gave security dap, they know who I be
Don' need no ID, I'm either on the dance floor, or VIP
I stack that cheese, at club 112 lurkin', sippin' on virgin daquiris
That's me, J I'm the one, besides lookin' quiet
Why don' you slide here hun, let your hair down
Lets have some fun, it's the weekend, and the party just begun

[Hook]
To the windows, to the walls
The club is packed so that's all
See my girls and all my doggs
Won't leave till the window's fog
It's the weekend, what you doin'
Get out the house, want to see you  movin'
Gotta get your money right 'cause it's on tonight
Yeah it's the weekend baby

Aiiyo Jermaine you should see the way I'm gamin' these dames
I'ma soldier, my boy, six Rovers stay in your lane
Chicks get whippa peeled how I grip the wheel
So fast get whiplash, when the wheels peel
I'm so ghetto but the broads still love me
I never fall off my game never rusty, J make the girls stop and stare
The way the chains swing back and forth like a rockin' chair
It's hot in here, why does the jungle, why does the rumbles in the tunnel
Let's pop in here, from 80 to Club Centuries, to the good bar
Everybody know Lil' J the hottest star

Watchin' the OG's in the hood while they flossin' in they rides
Candy paint, chrome wheels, and black magic on the attire
Me, yeah I was lovin' it, but not old enough drive
Parkin' lot pimpin' from the passenger side
I use to walk everywhere I had to show up
Shoe hills, one down like wheel rubber, man I was about to go nuts
Hopefully I would blow up in these rap game man
My people roll swanga's, I wanted to be rollin' the same thang
Never had alot of work, but I was doin' what I could
Movin' nickles, dimes, twenty's, and ounces all threw my hood
Since I had a one yolla fines cash me up
Mean while thumpin' for a ride my homies pass me up
It's all gravy, when I'm able I'm a showin' all somthin'
From a hopte to a foreign, I'm ballin' it's all or nothin'
Treat my feet with' designer to fine sneak's when I leave my home
Only place you catch me walkin' is to my mail box's
Cause on the streets I be on crome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rollin' chrome

Huh, I started off with' a canary yellow cutlass supreme on bald tire's
Yeah I know I was out of line
But that was all I could find
Or should I say that was all I could purchase for what I had to spend
But at least I had somthin' to go from point A to B and
No more offerin' gas money to get a lift
Besides when your driven it's easyer to get a chick
So ani't no more parkin' lot pimpin' at the club I'm up in there
Seekin' little mama, with' thick thighs, I hope she let me in there
Like swim wear, pull up to the motel, and we'll go in there
Nothin' left to do but comit a sin there
And that was in my hopte, but when I show up in my big body with' the gloss
All of the boppers was boppin' I just could'nt shake'm off
Sixteen switches, tewnty-two inches, trunk goin' to war
They don't want to lay here with me, they want to lay in my car
I was lovin' it back then and still love it today
Except I'm not yellow cutlase no more, I'm 300 blue over gray, on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome
I'll keep rollin' chrome
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on
I'll keep rolin chrome

Finally I'm in the mix, ridin' twenty four's or twenty six
My neck and my wrist lite, with' out me sellin' a brick
Tv's in the roof and the dashboard and I'm watchin' a flick
Rollin' with my pistol in my lap and I'm cockin' if
I spy somethin' suspicious in my rear view mirror when I'm creepin'
If you plan on jackin' me I plan on leavin' you sleepin'
I be in different vehicle cause I'm havin' thangs
King of the ghetto entertainment got me havin' change
You can smell it on me, even tho quite, the way I live it be tellin' on me
Don't get twisted I'm still a felon homie
Thinkin' you goin' to rob me that's a N O
And when I'm in N O I roll with god and as always Mr.Marsello
And they be with me when they in Texas don't par take it as a spy
Harlum nights in stores where they drop it like it's hot
So if your tryin' to call me and I don't answer my phone
I can't hear it cause my music to loud I'm bangin' on chrome

I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (rollin chrome)
Wood grain is what I'm holdin' on (holdin' on)
I'll keep rolin chrome (yaah)
I'll keep rollin' chrome (yes I am)

Go on ladies you need to get wet on this one

Don't you know, that I love you so
Don't you know, that I love you so, baby

Don't you know, I love you so
I wan' caress you slow, from head to toe
Deep inside I go, baby scream fo' mo'
We can play our way, at this game I'm a pro
Let you run the show, a queen you will be
Satin sheets, pat lace, Victoria's Secret
And I know your body need it gotta make your mind believe it
All above, all the love, on my purpose is defeated
You have cheated on your man to his spirits a g
When you know that he got flicks with a playa like me
I guess that Lil' Keke has the key to the do'
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so

Bubble bath in the spa, menage-a-trois
You a driver for a car, I'll make you a star
As I floss Jaguar, to wherever you are
Long distance in the distance on my cellular
And no way's too far for my private jet
I'm on a flight, hold tight, keep it nice and wet
Please don't get upset, the fun just begun
want to want a job done, will you make me a son?
Will you make me a daughter?  Do I need to pump harder?
Turn the temperature up on the bed so we can heat 'em warmer
A heart of a villain, a thug-like nigga gets harder gets liver
More deeper to the river
You shiver you shake, ice cream and candy
I wonder how it feel when your water breaks
No mistakes allowed at the rodeo show
And I'm lettin' you ladies know that I love you so, uh

(Chorus)

As I gaze in your eyes, it's not a surprise
That I'm the perfect size bumpin' between your thighs
Just time to realize, don't need a disguise
I'm a star on the rise, only out for the price
Dig deep into your soul, then get caught in the rapture
Yo' mind I'ma capture, night before morning after
First chapter Illuminati, beamas & benzes
7-day vacations, all-paid expenses
I'm a playa fo' life, thanks to this rap
I can floss, I can flap, with my salary cap
H-Town's on the map, and nothing is negative
I'm the owner of the firm, I make you an executive
Cause just then you will see that you do want to be
With Lil' Keke in the land of free
Do you want to, are you gonna?  Let's sit in the sauna
And laugh our life away while we blow marijuana
It's goin' DOWN

No anger to a stranger, but it's one up in the chamber
Of the blared straight glock cause haters come in flocks
It don't face born and raised on the 8100 block of Herschelwood
And the point is understood
We keep it all good in this crack-controlled hood
It ain't too late to set it straight, real players don't hate
Push weight and keep fate and the money that I make I'ma break

Get high as a tower, bust a nut and hit the showers
You gone with the wind, after while it's on again
This time bring a friend, a couple corners we gone bend

You cooking chickens in the kitchen, boy you off in the lab
Boys that hustle they grind, and if your diamonds shine you blind
You making money looking good, then you showing your behind

Have a bitch acting bad, on that do' and that X

And double deuces on a truck, when I crawl by slow
(This year) I'm gonna switch it to the platinum frame
Do shows with plenty hoes, that be screaming my name

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

These cake ass niggaz scary, and singing like canaries

You'll find a cemetery, if you caught up in my mix
I still hit brick licks and I'm good with arithmetic
This game is getting deep and I'm playing for keeps
Contaminating the streets, while you broke niggaz sleep

It ain't no telling 'bout this click, 'cause you know we don't play
It be forever and a day, with that H A W K
It's the 2 double 2, flipping pies we ain't through
CD's and LP's, for the people like you

Get your mash on whoalie, get your cash on whoalie
Niggaz snitching and bitching, but I promise they don't know me
It's a trip mayn, because these punk niggaz telling
Commission rich click, we some 3 time felons what

Crack is what we selling, snitch niggaz be telling
Keep you niggaz bailing, here we go
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)
Crack is what we selling, snitch niggaz be telling
Keep you niggaz bailing, because we 3 time felons

Let's get this money baby, now it's a dangerous job
Y'all so close to getting robbed, by the Southside mob
We do the dumping nigga and it don't matter the state
Y'all continue to playa hate and get yourself checkmate

They better recognize, all this money and power
'Cause it be hour after hour, on you mark ass cowards
I gets my cash and fill up the stash befo' I flash
Superstars mash, with two hundred on the dash

This rap game, the legal crack game
You know it's cocaine and fame, on this hustler's name
I gets my money right, I'm dedicated for real
It be killas and drug dealers, that'll snatch out your grill

I lay the lick down, 'cause I'm gon' get mine
And if these niggaz out of line, then these niggaz dying
I ain't the one mayn, you better watch who you telling

Crack is what we selling, snitch niggaz be telling
Keep you niggaz bailing, here we go

Take a minute to breathe
And put the mic in check

But ain't no disrespect
But on the cool, I be flippin
Followed by some gangsta ass
Niggas that be trippin

Instead of splittin wheels
But ain't no tellin

So I stay holdin on
Instead of sittin back

Plus the straight charge
And ain't no sense in me lying

If I want to live phat

But I'm gonna ball y'all

Lil' Keke,"*Talking In The Background*

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

*Talking till the End*",Intro,2001
Lil' Keke,"E.S.G. huh, Lil' Keke the don
Ha ha, it's long overdue baby
Huh, been waiting for the Southside
That swanging and banging to put it down, what?

Mr. Slim Thug, huh
Northside, Southside let's do this homie
Ha ha, C.M.G. Boss Hogg Outlaws
We platinum in the ghetto, tell 'em Ke

H-Town superstars gotta walk that walk
Popped up on twenty twos, will make you squash that talk
In Texas a living legend, it just ain't my fault
If I see it and I want it, I just go to the vault

We some city slickers
But these niggaz out of state think we some shit kickers
You bring your nuts up on your guns and just try to get us
But I ain't gon' lie you fucking with some real mob figgas
I'm talking hard hitters

We out here stunting, while most of you niggaz faking and fronting
Slim Thug and E.S.G. and Lil' Ke, we pay for hunting
It's a hell of a ride, hell of a role, hell of a stroll
We ship it gold so the paper can fold

Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us?
Cutting corners burning blocks, looking fly as us
Endo, hydro, getting high as us
With a bad little broad on the side of us

'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip
Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip
And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do
Northside, Southside, we got love for you

Now hol' up hol' up, E.S.G. hit the do'
Say, ""Ke, we ain't cooking thirty six no mo'""
I whipped eighty baby, I'm in the game forever
Represent it sold a million independent together

I'm with the Young Don, Boss Hoggs in the do'
Working with a quarter mill, smelling like hydro
Look at the grill hoe, I spent sixty on ice
I'm at the Source Awards looking like a disco light

Purple Sprite push white, FED's starting to get curious
Act a fool like Ja Rule, move fast and furious
What you get when you mix two of the Screwed Up Click
With the Boss of the north standing 'bout six six

Now this is it, watch me spit sixteen from the heart
R.I.P. to DJ Screw, you was there from the start
Now on your mark get ready, playa roll up a ounce
'Cause when the hook come in, drop your top gon bounce, huh

Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us?
Cutting corners burning blocks, looking fly as us
Endo, hydro, getting high as us
With a bad little broad on the side of us

'Cause we bouncing, bouncing, rolling up the strip
Twenty inches when I flip, looking good when I dip
And we be riding, sliding, doing what we do
Northside, Southside, we got love for you

It's H-Town dream team, ball more than a king
I guess it's in my bloodstream to be about my green
A new face on the scene, I'm the rap game rookie
Trying to do some new, I'm tired of cooking up cookies

We getting paid down here, living laid down here
Hit the club with bald fades and braids down here
Slim E and Ke, we Texas best
We three hard young G's, that don't settle for less

You can't mess with the Tex, Boss Hogg on top
When I park at the club, my rims don't stop
They keep cutting, ten G's for these with the buttons
In the DTS strutting, I ain't want for nothing

From the bottom to the top and I can't fail
I'm in a click about they mail, I know you can tell
We living swell 'cause we got a lot of thangs to sell
I know the FED's on my trail but I'm giving 'em hell

Have you ever met some thugs that can ride like us?
Cutting corners, burning blocks, looking fly as us
Endo, hydro, getting high as us
With a bad little broad on the side of us

We really off the hook, we off the chain man

[Lil' Keke]
No doubt, off the rip, ain't no telling about me
Busting haters on a mill that like a half a ki
I come prepared off the block, keeping one in the cham-ber
Back from no where here comes the black lone ranger
From a rookie to a star, to a certified pro 
Cause I'm all about my dough so I'm the ceo
When I turn on the corner best believe they look
Cause I'm platinum in the ghetto and I'm off the hook
When I jump up in my ride I pack a, concealed weapon
Cause ain't, no, half, stepping
Lesson one my man, go on and do what you do
And you need to get the rifle or you worried bout two
Cause I'm hated by many, and loved by few
But I kill down fry 'fore I bother you
I'm no fire, baby I done got me a spot
It's the Commission rich man represented by cops

(Chorus - 2x)
I'm on fire, on fire, that's the name of the game
They say we off the hook but we really off the chain
Wrote a rhyme baby we can sure grind
East and West coast and the dirty southside

[Lil' Keke]
They shouldn't of said ran they mouth say he can't come back
He took a year vacation, and he go like that
I'm sitting swoll like that, you know I'm cold like that
Off the hook, off the chain you know we roll like that
I pledge allegiance to the thug society
I grind all week and act a fool on Friday
We click up, dumping the trucks and do the pick up
In and out all these freaks just like a stick up
Who you know, gone be ready to ball
I'm talking bout let it go, and don't matter the price
It might be tailor mo', cause I'ma sure get mine
And then do a 3-60 or get left behind
Push dubs through the city cause I like to shine
Sitting tall on boys with the seats reclined
I'm 25, really trying to live so live
Praying to reach the top before the day I die
H-Town, Atlanta, you love it the most
D-Town, New Orleans represent third coast

(Chorus - 2x)

[Lil' Keke]
Don't knock the hustle man it's all the same
We all greedy and hungry and want the same damn thang
T-E-X-A-S let me really represent it
Always riding dirty so the windows stay tinted
Haters frowning up nigga take that mask off
God damn right, I'm stunting my ass off
Houston, is how to get that feel
Memphis 10, Orange Mile then a trip to the Ville
Big ups and more props to the big boy flossing
Fellas living gangsta and woke up in Austin
I'm on a mission cause I love to ro'
Hit the stage on fire then the Don explode
No pain, no game, that's the price of fame
Grab the mic and went off and left the place off the chain

(Chorus - 4x)

[Lil' Keke]
Street Port, Lafayette you know they off the chain
Mississippi, Chi-Town you know they off the chain
Alabama, Arkansas you know they off the chain
Miami, Terror Rate you know they off the chain
Atlanta, Cincinnati you know they off the chain
St. Louis, Kansas City you know they off the chain
H-Town, D-Town you know we off the chain
?Cossence? Santa Tone you know they off the chain
It's going down, cause that's the name of the game

I'm a rap star, but I got love for the do
Going hard with the snow, till it ain't no mo'
Cash flow, I keep it cracking and stay stacking
Distribute these goods, and try to ease away from jacking

Birds that get the worm, are the ones up early
It's a hard job, trying to survive the mob
Staying in the limelight, without a playa getting robbed

I got a brick hanging and it's wrapped like a gift
With a poisonous smell, that the dogs can't sniff

It's 20 for a show, 20 for a thang

Niggaz wasn't with it, till you mention big face hundreds
Get the bricks, load 'em in the train
Load 'em in the submarine, load 'em in the plane

It's in the game, like EA Sports
Slip and get hit with bullets of all sorts
You don't wanna play around with me do ya
Hollow tips shred right through ya treat you like I never knew ya

Behind my work
And I'm always one deep when I do my dirt, the truth hurt
It hit you like a boomerang and come back
Like dope fiends, digging for hard crack

I guess that's the life that comes with true love
Sixteen, probably being too fly
But it's a trip girl look how ten years went by
On the passenger side when I drove my first car
With no, a.c. just praying to be a star
We skipped school, and move around on the double
Go to the crib do it like a married couple
You a hot girl, and I wanna be your T
We both learned the hard way, that's how shit be
And a lot of drama, and I ain't gone lie, it's cheap
But at the end of the day girl you still my boo
It wasn't ever bout the money or the late night grind
Cause a nigga went broke, and did it three more times
From the lame game, to the fortune and fame
Your heat still the same, ain't a damn thang changed, c'mon

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

When I left girl, I was coming back to get you
It was picture perfect, but I could paint a perfect picture
I've been hard broke, but it's all in your mind
I use to think about my daddy saying look in time
Cause the media, the public you know how they do it
We use to block em out the way because we so use to it
I don't know everything, but I'm a swear I do
Cause I be damned if another nigga run through you

I use to lace you up, I got you right and tight
Niggas fly as a jet, so don't take that flight
I ain't the one, Lil' Keke the Don, I bar none
Everything done changed since the birth of my son
I'm a different man, whether you see it or not
It's gone be hard for another dude to take my spot
I get my cash baby, because you know it's a must
But the money ain't a thang, that ain't nothing on us, c'mon

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

Ain't nothing in the world could take the place of you
You your daddy's best man, and you just turned two
I love the way you high five and jab like defeat
Get dressed and grab your hat cause you rolling with me
You turn the music up soon as we get in the truck
And when I turn it down to talk to you turn it right back up
When we jump out, you want the first thing you see
And I can't really say nothing shit you just like me
You my heart, you my soul, you my pride and joy
You my nigga, you my ace, you my baby boy
You throw your dukes up homie like you ready to fight
With something new everyday, boy you flying your kite
And you stay motivated, so I keep on strutting
And I swear on my life, I wouldn't trade you for nothing
You the best thang happened, couldn't see it no better
Having anything you want, you my dog forever, c'mon

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

You know what I wanna do
Nothing I could find
You know that mine and it's mine
Ain't nothing but love, and ain't a damn thang changed

I'm thinking back to my teenage love, my teenage life

and then you hear my cell ring, you catchin a attitude

(Verse Two: Lil' Keke)
Lets get ya mind right cause I'm on another page

everytime you see a nigga you talkin bout a change

but you been down for a minute tho you ain't da average ho
ain't no need to lie its gon' be hard to let you go
lets take it slow and not to fast girl this is thug world
chocolate, and vanilla that's a hell of a swirl
holdin hands up on the beach you use to love that shit
shoppin sprees in New york you know we stayed in a mink

and when you layin down and sick that's when I come beside
this ain't no perfect match and it might not happen
just to give it to you straight I'm in love wit rappin

[Lil' Keke]
You know I'm thugged out, cause that's the way I gotta survive
You know I'm dubbed out, on every ride that I drive
Let me take a moment, to introduce myself
Cause baby girl I see you want it, and I could tell you on it
It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I want to stay paid
You know the album is hot, I'm in the spots you not
And if I pull a gun to shoot, then best believe you shot
Cause I'm a soldier a vet, with no time to sweat
From the store to the deck, and checking on internet
I be going off, girl you ain't heard about Lil' Keke
From the Dirty South, he got a bad mouth
It ain't no thang mayn, a bunch of haters in the world
Say it's a damn shame, but I just maintain no game
Get your cash and mash, on your plan
Cause the G in my life, stands for gangsta my man

[Hook - 2x]
I'm a G, it ain't no telling what you cats might see
You know the ladies shake it up, and it's for free
And I be getting my money first, cause that's me
Nigga, and that's me nigga

[Lil' Keke]
Bringing down the rap draft, cause I'm a first round pick
And from the booth to the stage, man I love that shit
You know the Northside, they say they love it the most
You know the Southside, quick to represent for they folk
You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar
And the Westside, you know they down for whatever
This another chapter, of the life after
Selling dope on the block, but now a paid rapper
I'm not a high capper, but I do get plex
Am I living like a baller, then the answer is yes
Listen up nigga, I ain't tripping when I tell you I'm about my scrilla
And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G
And when I'm gunning niggaz running, cause they know me
You better show me, cause all that chatter don't just matter
Nigga homie, cause you gon owe me
Cause this the damn song, you playing games with my family
You get stepped on, so nigga get gone
The Southcoast's host, that you love the most
And you done came this far, and you still ain't close

Gotta have that smoke around me, always want you near me
Cause I can't go on, living without you

[Lil' Keke]
Ride in the Bentley with the, top low
Puffing on Afghan, and not hydro
What the deal, I'm working my wheel and showing skills
Sipping hen on the rocks, floss in the drought
I'm ripping up my chest, cause I'm choking on the best
Smoking endo nothing less, oh yes I confess
Guess what's next, I'm squashing the plex, I'm in the Lex
Bought your girl a new dress, just to give me some sex
Cause I'm ripping up the mic, and I dress so fly
Some people they wonder why, that I stay so high
Cause I'm a O.G., I know you know me
You got some drank up in the glass, go on po' me
We getting gone baby, cause we got it that way
And we gone fire something up, with no time to play
And its me you see, on the call at three
Grab your sack out the car, come and smoke with me

[Chorus: Shima]
[Lil' Keke]
Come and smoke with me, cause you know its going down
Oakland to H-Town, hennessy and the crown
Smoking on a blunt, ain't no time to front
Watch Commission, Avarice pull a whole nother stunt
Lil' Keke the Don, Poetic 1 its all good
Money coast to coast fa sho, its understood
Can't nobody stop this thang, that we do
And the world slowed up baby, thanks to Screw
We some trend setters, focus on the chedda
Paying dues in the game, its gots to get better
Watch the smoke just erupt, let the roof back
When we roll in the trunk
Roll em up fat, and squash the chit chat
Three piece suit, with matching dob hat
I'ma get throwed, and let the game be
Twist one playa, the smoke is on me

[Chorus: Shima]
[Lil' Keke]
I feel like ecstasy, when you take control of me
Cause we rolling strolling hard, and you know its holding me
Getting high, just like the stars in the sky
Floating on cloud nine, when I pass you by
Cause we ride and slide, until the sun come up
And if you got something to do, then you shit out of luck
Cause this the episode, we just waiting to explode
And breaking the microphone, cause my game is cold
Go hard in the paint, when I bump the dank
Its gonna be a little bit better, when I mix the drank
Let's get it cracking, pimping and macking with no jacking
Keep the smoke going, and keep the cash stacking
For real, we smoke the best and feel right
Purple crushed, blue berry and a dash of flight
Its going down, and it ain't for free
Everybody in the place, come and smoke with me

Ah you got to feel that player M-O-E
Rolling with the Los, running with the codeine
And we about break, so take all you can

[Hawk]
Screwed up, what, chest be looking booed up
With the chemistry it's brewed up tracks get chewed up
Brighten the mood up, when I'm spitting this all
Above the law, coldest nigga you ever saw
Stay there, outlaw hand me up the state
I infiltrate your chest stain and increase the death rate
Don't hate, my, it only makes us madder
Pockets get fatter, then a only makes them say matter
Squash all the chatter in the southern region
I pledge of allegiance to my niggas not breathing
We all still breathing screaming S.U.C.
And that's the story mafios, and P-A-T
Niggas can't see me cause I'm rougher than most
You boys are like bread not butter and toast
They can't even come close, they done already told ya
Like the H-A-W-K and a screwed up soldier

Chased with purple sticky drank

Devastating and motivating it's the S.U.C.

Everybody be claiming the click, they want to be down
Wait to trip, on a flip through H-Town
Let's take it back, cause you know we love that
Poppi in the gray lay with the with the fifth on the back of the lac
You know we ride chrome everyday
Having the ghetto dreams like my nigga P-A
We crossed inside and forever we glide
And one thing's for sure man southside's riding
Let's get this cheddar, you got your wood and your leather
Sitting tall on boys pushing dubs or better
This a click full of g's, so we do it with these
Keep the block on pop and the ice on freeze
Mo yo, and Keke for real it don't stop
S.U.C. took a mission on down to Wreck shop, come on

The gangsterism resulting in murderism
Bailing up in your hooptie at the gas station
You facing the killer for real-a punk ass nigga where the scrilla
Jacking you for your shit, taking your ends pull off my mask
Hitting the corner, hopping up in my Benz with your cash
Mobbing I mash out, you ass out
Left you shot up in your seven-trey glasshouse
Because you don't know me like you think you do, I'm
Down for thefetty
Ready to die for them presidents, high powered and deadly
I ask to ball or not to ball, partner answer the question
I meet a nigga running up on my hooptie with Smith
And Wesson

One time for your mind
Here to represent the pimps, playas, hustlas, ballers
All my niggas on the grind, packing nine millimeters
Nine lives like cheetahs, but your still in ?

Hustling, busting down zips making chips
If we ain't making it we taking shit
To the extreme hit the scenery with machine
Gun, get the creamery and ice cream, nobody scream
Nobody run, I come like point blank
Mobbing the motherfucking bank, looking like Benjamin Frank and Itake
So many penitentiary chances, to make
Scrilla scratch niggas must have more stack in the safe
I mean ? nigga your safe is my safe
And I'm gonna make sure that my safe ain't your safe
By putting a .38 up in your face
For running up in my place and shake the spot
And not expect to get your ass shot
Yeah, another one bites the dust, the shyster busts
Caps at your house
Matter fact, niggas don't like the Yukmouth
About to L-U, didn't they tell you
I'm a youngster trying to have something like my
Nigga L-Q
Ballin'

Put a gauge between your throat and tell you that
Your out of place
Motherfuckers don't be knowing we vicious and vicious
To get the cheese
More tickets to G's, cruises overseas
Can't be no punk about the shit that we're in
Got to be a soldier to the game or nigga you'll never get your dividends
Balling til I die, until I die I'll be a baller
Let my riders do the dirt and I'll be the shot-caller
Whatever I got to do for the lifestyle that'll pay them forever
Never slip stay on my toes nigga walk with the yellow stripe
But pull me back, because they cowards and shit
I be the nigga that take your drama and put a twist
In your the shit

Sometimes, Keep your head up trying to find sunshine

[Z-Ro]
Man what happened to the sun on my lawn it's so gloomy and grey
I got a feeling 5-O gone try to do me today
Nothing but backstreets for me cause I don't need a vacation
Looking for front run up that seem the only compensation
The hood is on fire, other soldiers won't let it down
They ain't set tripping but out here jacking has been alive
Misery spinning what they clicking for no reason at all
Even intentions of stacking paper they pleasing them all
And outside, smelling like nothing but formaldrahide
It's an everyday suicide, R.I.P. to the ones that died
Wake up before you get caught up don't keep on selling your soul
Until your life fall up, you got to try to find

We living in a world that's dirty and so shife
You trying to figure out this the game that's called life
These days is cold and got me searching for my soul
Like paper bags and lawn chairs man you unfold
I'm looking out my window for some, sunshine
I'm trying to give it up cause I swear it's my time
I five petreat and start thinking about my sins
Roll up another square and start thinking about the benz
Talent and skills is what I'm bringing
New homes and microphones got the cell phone ringing
Push play on the deck, to let my mind collect
And try to mash on the gas with no time to sweat
This the ghetto, and that's all I know
Another episode from the young don and Ro
If the family is tight, then everything's alright
So quick to catch flight for the sunlight, uh

[Chorus]

[Z-Ro]
Seem like I can't stand the rain prosecution and struggle up in my brain
Got to tell me slow down if you can see all of my veins
'Cause I ain't having none of that riff raff to get back and blood
Keep my enemy close to me cause your killer be your 'cause
I wish I was, able to socialize with why'all
Instead of trading war stories and taking lies from why'all
It's how it be though, Lil' Keke and Z-Ro we on the grind 
Long as they talking about us, we know we staying on they mind
Don't hate us congratulate us, why why'all turning up why'all nose 
'Cause it's been we be spittng straight be burning up why'all glow
Want to take it away from pin and pad and pick up a gun

Where the boys slang birdies, and party till 5:30
Early birds get the worm, so I'm back up at six
Package of bricks, don't miss shit attacking my licks
Northside don't sleep, see we stay on the grind
You don't work you don't eat, and I stay on dine
Now my stash a lil thicker, this the best of my years
I'm getting cash a lil quicker, than the rest of my peers
Making work disappear, from the knowledge I keep
Making a million a year, without a college degree
I'm a Down South boss, holding down my title
Trying to take my position, it'll get homicidal
Get out of line with the boss, I paid what it cost
My fee is five thee, to get you bumped off
My click raw in that Dirty, break a law in the Dirty
Quick to break a fake hater jaw, in the Dirty Dirty

This is how we do in the Dirty ha
Roll chrome twenty inch, blades in the Dirty ha
Candy paint dripping, Escalade in the Dirty ha
This is how we do the damn thang, in the Dirty ha

Get the thang crunk, down here in the Dirty ha
Act a damn fool, down here in the Dirty ha
Roll dime bows in the club, in the Dirty ha

Gon hop, don't stop, gon let your tops drop
I'ma roll till I rock, watch a bad bitch bop
I'm Lil' Keke the Don, just a young phenomenon
Five or six bank accounts, two or three for my son
You know anything goes, when you riding through the Dirty
Sucker free for life, making sure you punks heard me
I'ma get mine, hit licks for heavy bricks
Next do' to Mexico, I get it thirteen six
What you working for, feddy and chips or new cars
H-Town Texas, we born to be stars
A mastermind, I get paid and live splendid
Platinum in the ghetto, you a hundred independent
I'm a young G, and ain't no playing with me
'Cause I multiply the game, got a balling degree
When I mash on a broad, gotta do it with pride
'Cause this the Dirty Dirty, you know the Dirty Southside

In starched out gear, nigga that started down here

And haters with plex, we put they whole block to sleep
Tre to the herb, stay with the syrup
Hitting the club, with big Burb's on the curb
Birds flying away, for fifteen-five a lick

Introducing from Houston, Slim Thug the Boss
The young Hogg out the North, that be running his mouth
Check my files, the Boss man do it G style
I live it write it, and spit it when I freestyle
I'm what them boys on the corner, pumping bumping
Or any hustler, trying to have something bumping
I keep the G's jumping, throwing up they set
And chicks and tricks in the club, po'ing up Moet
If you rich or broke, we gon ball tonight
From 10's to 24's, we goin' crawl tonight
Shot call tonight, you rolling with the Boss Hoggs
Everything free or V.I.P., with the Outlaws
So tell the bartenders, to put it on my tab
And tell the valet dude, to buck you right by my slab
And get what you can grab, from Grey Goose to Bacardi
I'm inviting the world, to my gangsta party

I see the Southside players, showing boys shake ball
I see the Eastside hustlers, pieced up thoed deck
I see the Westside G's, thoeing up they set
Ain't no plex, we all trying to take something home
It's three chicks to one, so no niggaz alone
Bunch of dime pieces in thongs, all on the dance flo'
Ain't no rules we all grown, baby anything go
What happened at the Hogg palace, stays at the palace
I got spots in every hot spot, from L.A. to Dallas
You can't miss me, it's my party you can't diss me
Turn off all your clocks people, let's make history
We gon drank till we faint, smoke till we choke
Dance till we can't baby, ball till you broke
I said drank till you faint, smoke till you choke
Dance till you can't baby, ball till you broke

You in the lot, trying to pop it your hoop on hubs
You and your group at the club, trying to shoot your slugs
You think a nigga won't box you, or shoot your mug

I just came here to party baby, drank and roam blocks
Get a thicky thick chick, and get a quick dome shot
Got a sick chrome glock, and it cough at niggaz
I came here to fuck with women, I talk to niggaz

I'm here often nigga (doing what), buying the bar
Getting crunk with my click, might be eyeing a star
I see white eyeing a bar, while I sip my Belve
Walked over (grabbed her hand), and with her lips she tells me

(get thoed) hell yeah boo, I'm one of the ones
So I pull her close to me, hands under her buns
But it's one thing about her, I just got to know
If she cutting tonight shorty, then I got to go

I looked past that thick ass, and them big ol' thighs
I'm A G, I peep game constantly
So tell me what the fuck, do you want from me

I'm at the bar, taking shots to the head
Trying to find a yellow bone, that give shots to the head
I see a fine looking dime, and she rocking some red
Spit a line and she mine, while she drop in my bed

And fill her up, with game

Lil' Keke,"My life
My life, really feelin hard times

Lookin' out my window, holdin' my weapon like Malcolm X and
And it seems I'm over-stressin', feelin' like hatin' is your profession
And I know a couple Texans that got killed for over-reppin'
So I never be oversteppin' boundaries bounded to my weapon
When they ask me how I'm doin, I just tell 'em ""I'm doin' super""
I got a date with Destiny, allow me to introduce ya
Her little sister Fate told me I'm gon' be the future
And legacy's everything to a Martin Luther King Koopa
This recession is so pathetic, got me feelin' like I'm athletic
And success tryna get away from me and I ain't tryna let it
When they told that Pimp was gone, my reply was ""I don't get it""
And I'm still havin trouble believin' it happened the way they said it
Had to cut some partners off, swear to y'all it ain't my fault
I've been grown since I was seven and I was born to be a boss
But I know there's a bunch of haters tryna see me take a loss
So I be sleepin' with one eye open and put cameras in my vault
I've been thinkin' and gettin' deep and they tryna tell I been preachin'
But I know that they can't see how much of the world that I be reachin'
So stop reachin, stop leachin, I'm a fade 'em out like bleach and
In the spots where they can't get out to is the spots I visit frequent
Europe to UK and Germany, travellin' currently
Made so much in millions that I could cash out in eternity
Accustomed to hittin' customs with that duffle full of currency
When God created hustle, looked at the world and he inserted me, Koopa

[Chorus: x4]
I'm just livin' my life, so cold
In the streets so I'm takin' it slow

Uh, yeah
I'll tell you my story, I only speak the truth homie

It a terrible situation, throwed on the curb within the hands of time
But since I'm blistery breathing I guess a nigga livin' fine
I live a life that's filled with dramatistic people cryin'
And since the hood depend on me, they'll never lose a hand of mine (I gotcha)
I'm paralysis when it come to the good times, I'm used to the pain
Feelin' like a bum under the bridge, I'm so used to the rain
Anything I do is from the heart so it reflect my name
Forgive me for my sins father, I feel like I'm goin' insane
Media criticizing me for checking niggas, fuck it, oh well
I just wasn't raised a little pussy disrespected nigga
I'm tryna live on my own by the ways of a gangster
So every time I leave out I pray so I'm prayin' for a gangster
It's bad enough the world we livin in all about money
Since we runnin' out I choose to believe it ain't nothin funny
I've been stabbed in my back so much I deal with it
I'm tryna kick it with my life before heaven come chill with it

[Chorus: x4]

Last year was a hard one but life goes on
Thinkin' bout my nigga Pimp while I write this song
And the list goes on, all my niggas is gone
I'm tired of hearin' bad news, scared to pick up my phone
Got a call, my nigga Eddy died from Acres home
Just seen him at my video shoot, now that shit wrong
Kelvo, Arborea, even my girl Shantz
I just heard word she got stabbed to death today
Dear Lord, I pray that you take away the pain
From their family and their friends, please help us change
Still warm my niggas sleep dog, stessle and stank
My girl Dee Dee, they got me pourin' out my drank
It's fucked up, all my friends is dead or in the pen
Seem like soon as your life begin it's beginning to end
I'm frustrated, but you gotta smile, your time is dated
You never know when showin' your love might be related, ha ha

They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock

Now ain't that a shame, can't be real with niggaz niggaz ain't real
Can't put my trust in none of em, cause these niggaz'll steal
And if I show 'em they stealing, they'd think a nigga tripping
But yet still they plot to catch a nigga slipping, pistol gripping
When my pockets itching, to stack money
Never thought my baby mama, would bitch and act funny
Walking round fat tummy, talking bout she pregnant for me
Then turn around, and say it's for a nigga named Deep
But I ain't tripping cause I got what I wanted, and let a head in some pussy
Always knew I was gone make it, so she's scared to overlook me

No need to be greedy, cause I'm just trying to get what I'm worth

Bigga fo tank, everything cash
Glass pop red throw the wood in the dash.
Mashin on the gas is a thug like Green.
Prompt for a young I see not in the pin 
Showin naked ass and my stories `bout to kill ya.
Seventeen hundred west appalova silver.
Hit the school zone, fourteen shoocky, 
Caught that lil duce sideways sittin crocked
Pulled in Exxon nuthin less then supreme
Never slippin but I'm trippin candy red on the scene.

Yeah, real talk for my niggaz on the block
I been wrecking for a second, but I promised that I wouldn't stop
I been in it with my niggaz, for a long time
But they gotta give it to me, cause they know I wouldn't drop
Same nigga, with the flow
Same nigga that'll spin a nigga's ass up, throw his ass in the trunk
I'm a representative, for the Assholes
Try to run up on me, I'll teach a nigga how to stunt
Southwest, you better get your hands up
'Fore I send a wave of niggaz, that'll hit your man's up
While you wanna-be thugs, better pull your pants up
Then the shit, hit the fan
Then I fuck, your fans up
These niggaz, really got a nigga fucked up
Hating motherfuckers, I'll show you what the beef is
Show you niggaz how to lose teeth, keep running off at the mouth
And I can show you niggaz, what the sleep is
Better give it up, when you hear the name Trae
When I hit the block in black, your ass better pray
Tell the five in the hood, I don't play
And I got more niggaz, in the slugs
In the tip, of a K
And I run with the see's, and the be's on the block
And the G's, and few B.D.'s on the block
And I kept it real, so I got the keys to the block
I'm a gangsta, they don't make these on the block
I'll put it on the pack, and I'll ride for it first
Nigga jump, gonna be the first nigga that'll slide for it
They don't wanna see me in a zone, when I try for it
Any real nigga, stand up and get an eye for it
Cause I'm oh so real, though homie
And I'm next in the line, finna show the world what it was
H-Town, till the death
Intuition of a nigga named Pac, finna let it rain for the thugs

[Trae]
Somebody better give me the crown, these niggaz out of line
And I see, I gotta put 'em in they place
Everyday it be the same old shit, I gotta click on a bitch
I don't really, wanna pay another case
Whey they niggaz wanna try a nigga, like a nigga soft than a bitch
I'll lean on a nigga, like Boss on a switch
Better chill, 'fore I get to going off on a bitch
Lace the Nike's, and break a nigga jaw in this bitch
Everybody, wanna know about the South
But I promise, you niggaz'll wanna take another route
A.B.N., fin to hit a nigga's ass in the drought
In the town right now, (no doubt)
If you got a problem with Trae, let's get it on
Iggy on lock, so I'm back in a zone still packing the chrome
I was late for the hood, so I'm bad to the bone
Since I roll on the block, it's half of the bone
Shit just got wrong, you can hear it in my tone
(I'm pissed), but I'm still moving along
Yeah Jay?Ton, still grooving along
So the niggaz in the blue, got love for the Home
For the H, and the West state
I""ll put it on a nigga, in the worst way
That'll be your worst day, and I put it on Trae
Motherfuckers better get in a line, or the dirt where you gon lay
This right here, for my nigga named Nick
In a hospital bed, half gone
I'll run up on a bitch nigga, who that out that shout out
Feel I gotta hit his ass, with the chrome
Nothing less, are-E-S-T-L-E double S
Stress, got a nigga on amp
So I got mob for life, like 24/7
And I promise, I'm about to be the champ

All the fallen soldiers man, Southside
Eastside, Westside, Northside, know I'm saying
All my partners, all your dead partners
But shit, I still feel stress, still gotta get something
Off my chest, while these hoe niggas be doing what
They be doing, I don't know though, shit fuck it
We goin' stay two deep in a four door

Slow Loud And Bangin', all in my trunk
Trunk full of funk, I ain't never been a punk
I blow on skunk, I blow on doja
Military minded, I'm a motherfucking soldier
Out the streets, of the Ridgemont 4
Not no bitch, and say I still ain't a hoe
Letting niggas know, everyday of the year
I pimp my pen, and I get my point clear
Why niggas wanna talk down, I don't know
Gotta take a trip to Akapoko, from the 4
With my 4-4 on my side, when I ride
Ready to do another homicide, in a pine box
And I'm gone, nigga old glory
I'm H-Town to Cali, just like Robert Ory
If I do a murder, flee the murder scene
No missing shortage on the drank, I can't find no lean
From Southwest to Southfese, bitch it's about war not bout peace
Nigga like me, I'm bout knocking out teeth
Know I'm saying, I'll loose your grill
A nigga coming down, in the Coupe Deville
Looking gravy, looking real throwed
I'ma be the nigga, pulling over at the fucking cross road
With my K on my side, I'm ready to ride
And if I gotta go, it'll be a homicide
Me and another nigga, on the way to the Golden Gate
A nigga like me, can't wait
Just to make it, to another day
Gotta get the big pay off, so get the fuck out my way
When I come around your corner, so slow
It'll be the nigga, in the damn Polo
It's the rap lawing, jackers ain't barring
Why I skipped the slab, when I went straight to foreign
Said it like I said it, in the old school
Some niggas they be red, but Z-Ro blue
I come around your corner, but I ain't set tripping
But I will, wet niggas and wet women
With the calico, I had to let a motherfucker know
That I come around your corner, in a Lincoln four do'
A fox photo, cause I do it in a flash
Nigga watch out, cause that could be your ass
I rhyme so long, rhyme so strong
I flicks my bar, sip then I swoll' on
Get on, the motherfucking bench
And when the laws hit the corner, I hit the fence
They wonder where I went, they keep looking
I don't give a fuck, like Tyson I keep hooking
Or maybe like Lenox, I'm strong to the finish
I'm like the ghetto Popeye, but I don't need spinach
I'ma keep going, I keep on flowing just like the Nile
Million dollar mouthpiece, every time I smile
Look and load a, nigga ashtray
Every time he smile, he can turn the night to day
You can open up the pop, and let the smoke come out
We don't give a damn, bout a crooked ass cop
Crooked officer, crooked officer
Make a nigga wanna blow the badge, off of ya
Me and Dougie, my motherfucking brother
R.I.P., to my motherfucking mother
That's the Dorothy Marie McVay Matthew
There's ten toes planted, in my motherfucking shoe
I gotta be a man, hope you understand
There's nothing but the work, and the calico in my hand
On a corner on the Ridgevan, and I'm serving a fiend
A real live B-Boy, and you know what I mean
I be stacking up chips, like Lego
Dark on a pump, just like Calvin Kato
Loosen to the rocket, a four-peat like Comets
I don't give a fuck, good punch a bitch nigga make him vomit
On the grind, I'ma take a trip on Greyhound
I be flying on a plane, but the dope is on the ground
Headed to Lake Charles, or headed to Lafayette
Maybe off in Alexandria, but I ain't finished yet
I gotta make a hoe I-10, I sin
Then I, do it again
I get my ends, I'm in my motherfucking Benz-e
Got these hoes running round, in a friends
I be busting full clips, till they empty
A piece of potent pussy, might tempt me
Rain is trying to send me, to the Penitentiary
The main reason why, I ain't friendly
I'm wired up, but I ain't on no damn slaughter
Dejaun in the back, and he got the camcorder
Recording everything, the 4's gon swing
Still pulling up, on Fondren and the Main
Looking lovely, got to look good
I throw up Ridgemont 4, cause that's my hood
Never been a hoe, I'm letting hoes know
I gotta get a fucking P-L-A-T, but first a G-O
L-D, a motherfucking plaque
I keep it straight and simple like that, hit a bitch from the back
And I use my, motherfucking tool

It's the millennium, I'm trying to light up the stage
And I be taking it to the max, because I want to stay paid
You know the album is hot, I'm in the spots you not
And if I pull a gun to shoot, then best believe you shot
Cause I'm a soldier a vet, with no time to sweat
From the store to the deck, and checking on internet
I be going off, girl you ain't heard about Lil' Keke
From the Dirty South, he got a bad mouth
It ain't no thang mayn, a bunch of haters in the world

You know the Eastside, they putting it down for the cheddar
And the Westside, you know they down for whatever

Selling dope on the block, but now a paid rapper
I'm not a high capper, but I do get plex
Am I living like a baller, then the answer is yes

And I ain't tripping, when I tell you I'm a mad killa, but I'm a O.G

You can't jump ship, niggas won't accept you boated
When I was doin' it 4 t.v, I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas try 2 find it and webisode it

It's be Gizzle (Heard me)

Too Hood 2 Be Hollywood (Bust something, shoot something)
One of the realest niggas that ever done it, right chyea, live and in living color
(get em)

[Verse 1: B.G.]
It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass
I'm reppin nigga, take a flight to the motherland
I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you
Have yo people wearing a rest in peace shirt of you
My reputation on the block been A-1
I'm the same N.O. nigga I been since day

[Chorus: Lil Wayne (Trey Songz)]
I said bust somethin, shoot somethin
You just talking I know you ain't gon do nothin
Pussy nigga (ya heard me?)
If you got something to lose, you gon lose something unless you do something
So (ya heard me?)
Gotta use what you've learned, in order to receive what you've earned
Make sure (ya heard me)
Real niggas do real things so recognize real niggas in the game
I know you heard me
You say (ya heard me), I say (ya heard me), He say (ya heard me),
I know you heard me, she say (ya heard me), everybody like it when I say (ya heard me)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in, and I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

I remember way back in the day
All I wanted was a candy car with hella flakes
Crushing hoes, slamming doors while the chassis shake
From the sub, work the juice, bitch I want the bass
Can't be turning on a dime cause the rims scrape
Kill switches for them jackers outchea tryna take
That's my prized possession in recession kept me straight
Clear my mind then recline on the runway, from Monday to Sunday

Popping my collar, rocking gators, fuck some Prada

Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby
Daddy, daddy wasn't home, so momma raised me
And I'm still mommas baby

March 11, 1981
My momma gave birth to a hell raising heavenly son
And my daddy was a fool addicted to brown
So he wasn't ever around, but my momma held me down

When me and big sister had nothing to eat
My momma gave up her last trying to make ends meet
She was a school teacher, working to provide for her fam'
Struggling in AA, to submit to gods plan

Them long twelve's steps of hardway are all on your own
No family, few friends, my momma was all alone
She did it for her children, struggling to make a living
And some how we still had food on thanksgiving

When I can barely talk momma taught me to pray
And right then I knew that we'd have a better life some day
She still give up her last just to see me smile
That's the definition of love for you child, I love my momma

[Chorus]

My momma was my role model, I had no father figure
Just a bunch of pipe dreams of being richer
But as times got tougher my life just got rougher
It hurts so bad to see me watch my momma suffer

Its so hard to cope when you so dead broke
So momma used to make me memorize the song quotes
In the middle of a session momma gave god praise
I knew what it meant to struggle at such an early age

Remember them days she barely earned minimum wage
But made sure I had new cloths to start the seventh grade
She met my step father, and walked down the aisle
I praised he sent somebody that would make my momma smile

He raised me as his own, he taught me to be a man
Adopted me and Anne, and gave momma a hand
I just love to see that beautiful smile on momma face
My momma could never be replaced, I love my momma

[Chorus]

20 years of struggling, done came to a close
No more old, torn up, and hand me down cloths
She deserve the best, and never nothing less
No stress, give my momma that Gucci dress

The times were hard but we done made it out the rain
The storm was severe but we overcame the hurricane
Them rainy days seem to last so long
When them times got hard my momma told me be strong

My number 1 supporter ever since day one
And still till this day momma would die for her son
No more slumz, all them rainy days are done
No a days we taking trips to Disney world just for fun

I put you in a Benz take you out that nova
Its been a long rough road, but that bumpy rides over
You raise me from a baby, my number 1 lady
And until the day I'm in my grave, ima stay mommas baby

Michelle died on the damn run, runnin from life
I'm gettin stares from these bitches, riches got 'em so shife
Evil lurks in my mind, though I'm tryin to find peace
My mom is payin for a crib, a cracker's holdin the lease
These niggas holdin the piece, cock the hammer, heard it click
Gun held in my hand, but the glock it didn't spit
Niggas takin my shit, I ran my clothes and my shoes
??? robbin a nigga, kill his ass if he move
But why'all ain't killin Lavell, without a fight tonight
Nigga, I ain't never did shit, I been a muthafuckin victim

Chicken wings and musket dimes

Swoop his ass up out his vines
Trans bitch, make you rich, pick a style then watch it switch
Maybe why'all can check it like this here, check it
Let me show why'all trill, can a brother get ill
What's the deal if I still feel 
like I won't kill 'cause I just can't pay my bills
And my got damn girl won't take her pills
Make a nigga want to play the field, pray for real
Hopin all my partners stay for real
Can you say boy Crooked Lettaz ain't for real?

Talk that talk, and ya boy can't spit
Ain't no bigger than a small time

These demons searchin for my soul, they gettin closer and warm
Enemies in pale skin in my physical form
No, it's funny, 'cause I don't even mourn for the day
I can't get these white pictures of Jesus outta my head
The preacher's Bible said there's no depiction of Christ
But then they lie to a brother, now my mind ain't right
'Cause if God is white, and black folks ain't shit
But they know that he wasn't, but they couldn't run the risk
Of their town praisin one who looked more like ???
They rather play in my mind and send us all to hell
But I'm here to tell the truth, fuck the myths and the lies
But what's bad they can't even look me straight in my eyes

I wonder if it's still called memory loss,
If you can't remember the last time you lost, aha


[Verse 1:]
Yeah,
The only time I lose, is when it's my memory,
Haters comin' around here, talkin' about ""Remember me?""
Naw amnesia, Cham leader apparently,
You were just a follower, now I'm about to set a speed,
If they can't keep up, with no one ahead of me,
Victory is just, what I said I can achieve,
'Bout to be trouble, you scared? I think you betta leave,
Hope you don't have asthma *ahum*, go head and breathe

Yeah, pull out your inhaler,
You're going to have to catch a breath for this one,

Got that ""S-S"" in the middle of it like Tennessee,
Sorry but the Ferarri there, isn't friend-ly,

If she a freak don't handcuff her, just let her be,

Sell night to the day, and then sell today to tomorrow,

Call George Bush's daughter, I'll sell her Katrina water,

Just to get at her father, just so they have some evidence,
I'm slick enough to take precedence from the president,
America's worse nightmare, is right here,
I stay sizzlin' like flares, look up, (*pheerrm*)
It's quite clear, it's my year 'til I hear,
Somebody smoother, then I'm the ruler, I'm like where,
Is he at just let me know I'ma bury him,
Under the rocks in the bottom of my aquarium,
The chances of me losin' this time are very slim,
If he was bright, then I'm turnin' him down to very dim,
If it ain't me in the sequel, then there will be no sequel,

All of a sudden, everybody wan' bang with us
Don't they know them Gotti kids are dangerous?
Come come now, y'all need to stop
Niggaz better hold they head 'fore they body rock
I got, soldiers in every town
That'll come see y'all like ""Black Hawk Down""
I ain't playin with you motherfuckers
(RAAAAAAID!) I'm sprayin you motherfuckers
If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money? I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect
Niggaz be like, ""Here come the IRS!""
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than ""Jaws""
With or without my boys, I still make noise

New York - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all turn it up
Midwest - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all burn it up

Y'all make them cars jump
Dirty South - when Kim say, ""Can you hear me now?""
That's when y'all get it crunk!

My last album, some of y'all wasn't ready for it
Alright, I slow it up, put the brakes on for ya
I know what I'm doin, I ain't losin my mind
I'm just so advanced I'm ahead of my time
You all stuck at the back, I'm ahead of the line
Even in the dark, I'm still gon' shine
You'll see what I mean in 2009
I kick outer space raps - ILL RHYMES
Live guitars, nigga fuck cars
I'm tryin to buy a spaceship to get to Mars
Look out the window, and reach for the stars
It's a new day, Lil' Kim's in charge
Got a big dick, I'll bone you out
Like money in the bank, loan you out
If you ain't straight I'll comb you out
Lil' Kim and Scott Storch be zonin out!

Ain't wanna do it, but now I got to pop my collar
You actin like y'all real tough act to follow
I got medallions the size of a half a dollar
And about to buy my best friend a beauty parlor
I know y'all don't wanna see Kim on top
Please stop worryin about what I got
What the fuck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters
I might start my day at Piarage'
Or with a Mafia meetin at the Brooklyn Cafe
""Okay, y'all wanna play?""
Like 9/11, you gon' remember this day

Yeaaah!
Back Stabbers!

INTRO/CHORUS
They smile in your face 
All the time they want to take your place
The back stabbers!(Back stabbers)

VERSE 1:(LIL KIM AKA BIG MOMMA)
The Buda got my brain seein my own my blood stains
Dental records checkin my remains,it's hard to explain
First I see 'em then I don't, they disappear
First she tried to slit my throat,now she ain't there
I'm seein bitches in the mirrors behind me
But when I turn around, they hard to find 
See a little bit of weed and a little bit of greed
Make a bitch want to choke me till I bleed
Now watch a bitch breathe from dumb-dums
That some young bum had to bust just for wreck
Earn some self-respect,now should I tote a fo' pound
'Cause a clown wants my autograph
Broken off that hash I think he wants my cash
The Lexus and rings,give a sex simple and plain
But these bitches is mad an' they niggas is bad
So they scheme on a CREAM,you know
Fuck the hos,bitches is detrimental,the guns is essential

CHORUS x 2

VERSE 2:(LIL KIM)
I'm having re-occurring dreams-bitches they want my CREAM
They want to be lieutenant so it seems,I can't sleep
I see an image that keeps movin round and round my bed
The shadow stops,points a Glock to my fuckin head
I grab my pillow,crack the back window
pull out the tre-8,bust three times at the gate
LORD have mercy!The devil tryin to curse me 
I keeps seeing shit that wasn't there in the first
See bitches be livin mad fad-they fuck my man
Steal out my crib,then come an' try an' shake my hand
Yeah man,breakin you down one time
I packs that shit for your ass,Chronic for your mind
I keeps it real on all you bitches,I wish you keep your mind
Off my motherfuckin riches
Bitches,I'm tired of all you hos beggin me for clothes
Bank rolls is all I knows,that shit is dead chicken-head!

CHORUS x 2

VERSE 3:(LIL KIM)
The morning's finally here,damn!What should I wear?
Time to get dressed and do my hair,once again it's on
Somebody's knockin at my door,but when I walk across the floor
Just ope' it up,the motherfucker's gone
I'm hearing voices in the back of my mind
Better grab my 2,'cause this fool might get outta line
I guess it's time to test this bullet-proof dress
From putting holes up in my chest
I'm lookin through the peep-hole to recognise the face
I see three bitches and still I got to play it safe
I hope my dress come in handy,but when I open the door
Three little girls selling candy,ya see bitches is jealous
Of Little Kim because my click is thicker than the rest of them
All I want to do is be rich and stay that bitch
Clock dough on the law,why'know?

For womenizers and a hand full of hoes that hate me

From A's to Z, I break 'em down alphabetically 
Pethtically, I puts the pressure 
In ya Jones that you fall Motorol burner 
Flip ya jacks and ya snitch ass back, to the cell of your block 
HDM lock, and I wish you would stop 
All that baulin'!, cryin'! .....lyin'! 
Cause this black Queen is shinin', you didn't know I was Lieutenant 
Bitch, well that's primary 
You just a secondary secretary, envy against me 
Because I stay laced in Ellen Tracey, Dolce & Gabanna 
And people love me for my style, my personal

Bet I just sit back and enjoy, the optimism given from a girl to a boy

We all know what it means to be broke, breaking niggaz off 
For some ends and weed smoke, some like to mix it with coke 
Trees I like 'em fine, straight up marijuin' 
And I'm put the lent in ya dents 
Then you'll be stressed out with no dollars and no cents 
Dressed in gear from last year, that you bought 
Before you quit ya job at the airport 
Thinkin' you gon' make a mill from this rap game 
But you labeled as a lame and it's a damn shame 
No fame, no name, show no shame 
Who's to blame (tore up in ya frame) 
Now you want to lick a shot cause you ain't got 
Get props, runnin' up in weed spots 
Just a little gets to make game (make the game) 
So you put the steam and the jewels in the stash 
Quick fast, get mad 
Cause ya man's in my whip, honey button ya lip 
Cause my click is too dense, it's all about the guns, the ones 
Just another day that the Earths used the Suns

All 'em wanna be the man right hands wash the left hands
Loyalty's priority in this fam

Number one, his name is Barry Madanno
Push the phat Milano '96 mission cost ya barizano
I lay gently in the Bently through binoculars he seemed popular
Givincci socks Cartier coolats
H-class rocks and charms like Bohemians
Sick like lukemians, receding hairlines
Watch how genuine his gold mine decline
When Frank pops the wine, I cocks the nine
Niggas peeped it from behind and slipped their clips in quick
One chick named Nick thought she was the shit 
Tried to play Big Poppa, don't worry 
Minutes before I dropped her the blow! blow! blow!
Like a parol-e the bitch violated
So how you like it coffins or creameted

We official no fake gators
Coppin' fire arms with dug missles

That nigga Barry still aggy about that slut
Mob nigga what! threw the gang sign up
The nigga chuckles, just slip the loot
On my belt buckles and cracked his middle nuckles
Damn how could a deal for a couple mill
Result to such violence 
And throw our whole shit off balance
Yet still, they pat me down from all angles
Trapped inside this devil's triangle 
Like Bo I had the Jangles
And movin' slow to slide up on these Mexicans
One cross eyed and hunchbacked
The other must be mixed with black
The third nigga had missin' teeth and tatto tear drops
Long hair, chest  for like a bag of rocks
Before this chops 
I grabbed the keys to locks, the jewels and the rocks
The cream in the box, etc. etc. etc. and it don't stop
I got away with everything, the cash and the stash

There ain't a day in my life that rolls by

My man was astonished
He looked as if there was a foul aroma in the air
Stinkin! I know what this nigga thinkin'
Damn she's too little, too pretty, too quiet
The bitch is hired, mob's wife for life
Diamond heist with Trife, contracts on your life
We increase the price, uuhh
So guess who the bitch is, but for now I be the mistress

There ain't a day in my life that rolls by

Lil' Kim,"I know a dude named Jimmy used to run up in me
Night time pissy drunk off the Henny Rimmy
I didn't mind it, when he fucked me from behind
It felt fine, 'specially when he used to grind it
He was a trick when I sucked his dick
Used to pass me bricks, credit cards and shit
Suck him to sleep,I took the keys to the jeep
Tell him ""I'll be back,"" go fuck with some other cats
Flirtin', gettin' numbers, in the summer, hoe hop
Raw top in my mans drop
Then this homey Jimmy, he's screamin ""Gimme""
Lay me on my back, bustin' nuts all in me
After ten times we fucked, I think I bust twice
He was nice, kept my neck filled with ice
Put me in Chanel's, kept me out nice
Cold suckin' his dick, rockin' tha mike
It was somethin' about this dude I couldn't stand
Somethin' that coulda made his ass a real man
Somethin' I wanted, but I never was pushy
the motherfucker never ate my pussy

I don't want dick tonight, eat my pussy right
Uh, uh, uh, uh Lil' Kim, Lil' Kim, bring it to me now

I know a dude named Ron Doo push a Q
Had a wild crew on Flatbush and Avenue you
Had a weedspot, used to pump African black
He used to, seal his bag so his workers wouldn't cap
I used to see him, in the tunnel, with fuckers at dawn
Whisper in my ear he want to get his fuck on
I dug him, so I fucked him, it wasn't nuttin'
He wanted me to suck him, but I didn't, I ain't frontin'
The sex was wack, a four stroke creep
I jumped on his dick, rode his ass to sleep
He called next week, askin' why I ain't beep him
""I thought your ass was still sleepin.""
He laughed, told me he bought a new Path
Could he come over right fast and fuck my pretty ass?
I'll pass, nigga the dick was trash
If sex was record sales you would be double plat
The only way you seein' me is if you eatin' me
Downtown taste my love like Horace Brown
Tryin' to impress me with your five G stones
I give you ten G's nigga if you leave me alone, screamin'

The moral of the story is this
You ain't lickin' this, you ain't stickin' this
And I got witnesses, ask any nigga I been with
They ain't hit shit till they stuck they tongue in this
I ain't with that frontin' shit
I got my own Benz, I got my own ends, immediate friends
Me and my girls rock worlds, some big niggas
Fuck for car keys, and double digit figures
Good dick I cherish, I could be blunt
I treat it like it's precious, I ain't gonna front

And Seebeeaki, smelling up my Kawasaki 
Jawns by Versace all them joints by Jockey

He drive a tricycle and his pants too little 
And his shoes too little

The nigga with, the movie and the mill shit

Nine out of ten women, want to spit, on the skin of Blake Carrington 
But I need much more to get raw, dick to jaw, dick to jaw

Well if he cum up on your chest slow 

If not then your not down with me

Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before

Let you push the 6

And ride it 'til the night

Only real bitches live like queens, get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marvel fortress with matching Rolls Royce's
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff
You can call me a slut
Who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit
I'm a good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
Fuck a prenup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these CARS
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

On the place, jet ski's parked by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
LET THEM make their way through
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door
Vacay, away, a week or more
First class to and fro, freaking off
Got the Hamptons locked
Champagne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop rembrandt, handle, pay the lot
Can't complain, we balling, true or not?

You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch (another bitch), in my life

Uh-huh, uhh, uhh
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game you see through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin', two trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin', he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Jigga, my ace boom coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, Sittin In My Room
Pissy drunk listenin' to Stylistic tunes
Or the O-Jays, thinkin' bout the old days
My nigga's like, fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you? Don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin' 'bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight

What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life

All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black, nasty and mad fat y'all
Shoulda seen the hoe, nigga pack ya shit
You out the door, ohh
What about the fight in the Mirage?
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
Who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin' fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin' ya heat in the passenger seat
Of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin' to hold on
Teary eyed, damn a bitch steamin'
Girls steady screamin', ""Kim you need to leave him!""
When I testified in court, couldn't think straight
Thinkin' 'bout the bitches I fought
Over you, you can have the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin' is my last resort
You see nine outta ten nigga, ain't shit
One outta five niggas suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Shoulda kept the freak bitch off my canape
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked your dick, it's like smokin' a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach

But wait, he got singles in his cake, I ain't fuckin' with him 

Number one rule, always keep your cool, even though 
you ain't a fool, and you see right through the nigga, how he figure? 
If he holdin less than six

Glass shoes and igloos put him dead in his place 
Damn Blake, can't tell this cat is a snake? 
I got 20/20 vision (uhh) funny money vision (uh-huh) 

No dough, no show, dodo, that's a no-no

Duke wanted me to work for him, even flirt for him 

Wear a short skirt for him, he don't know

The play starts at 8:00, let's hit the venue 
Invited his man, and some bitch named Kendall 
Tried to style on em, shoes with the crocodile on em 

But the nigga still was corny, he bore me 
His preference was more sorta like soccer 
Me, I do operas with the Mali and the vodka 
out in Cali gettin' proper, and I, betcha fifty 

My whole committee stay shitty ask Smitty with the Desert E's 
One glance at the Benz-why make ya freeze 
Please, I got a mil on these, what you talkin'? I... 
hate this nigga in the worst way 

And I didn't want to be here in the first place 
But uhh, It's just vendetta for my man 
Do anything for the fam, I'm a go along with the plan 
Tryin' hard not to throw him off 

And I know he soft, when I cough, it's to cover up a lie 
and the lie keep me full of empathy 
So when I shit on this nigga, he goin' still pamper me 
I see, this nigga ain't about nothin', cause he keep frontin' 

He must be up to somethin', round em up, here I come

You don't really wanna stop

Verse One: Puff Daddy

Yeah yeah, uh-huh, check it out, yeah, c'mon
Whether you like it hard or the live guitars
Anything dropped if it's hot it's ours
If it's not it's yours, we on the job
Everybody eatin, everybody involved
You can't stop that like you can't stop rap
Bad Boy stop what's the chance of that?
We don't stop, so check the, mansions and stacks
And we don't have to answer to Jack
No wonder we had this rap shit locked, for eight straight summers
Pull up at the party, eight straight Hummers
Six be the 6th 7th and 8th wonders
Pop corks, we be the toast of New York
And out West, we want y'all to understand
All we wanna do is make you dance
We know the song ain't done wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Verse Two: Lil' Kim

When it comes to the cheese, baby girl roll dough
Fuck Domino's, strictly dice
Bet you niggaz won't flow for this ice, notes is the price
Lil sis' walk away with the dough, y'all niggaz still broke
While my pockets on re-up
Y'all niggaz shit on E, what a pi-ty
Ain't it a shame how your man chose me
And you wanna know why, it's mad simple
Even in the winter, still pull a baller wit my jimmies
Drive a Ta-hoe, wit plenty cash flow
He know, anything I touch I blow
And I crush a show, wit my luscious flow
Gotta crew full of niggaz and a Lexus too
All of them hold me down while I'm pressin you
So who stressin who, and even though my nigga gone
Lil' Kim and Puff Daddy keep keepin it on

Verse Three: Puff Daddy

Now you can pump this in your jeep, on an off road
Pump this to your blows on the way to the tow
Bang this til you're bein old when you at home
On the six-four, sittin on chrome
Yo we don't stall we ball while you playin the wall
We in the middle of the danceflo', gettin off
Gotta bunch of hot chicks gettin live with us
At the end of the night they gonna slide with us
I could tell y'all the rest but it's ob-vious
To the top now, ride with us, c'mon
We don't stop, we run the game, we don't watch
Every single region, we own blocks
Never let up, you tell me, who do it better
Every single I drop, at least two are better
The song ain't the wrong when the party is hot
Y'all don't really want us to stop, do you?

Stampedin' over, pop Mo's, never sober
Flexin' Range Rovers dealin' weight by Minnesota
Avoidin' narcs with camcorders and Chevy Novas

From Daytona, when I was young I wanted to bone her
But now I only hit chicks who win beauty pageants
Trickin' and takin' me skiin' at the Aspens, uh

Pack a black pistol in the Ac' coupe that's dark brown

German Ruger for yo' ass, bitch, deepthroat it
Know you wanna feel the womb 'cause it's platinum-coated
Take your pick, got a firearm you shoulda toted, suck a dick
All that bullshit you kick, player-hatin' from the sidelines

My West Coast shorty push the chrome 740
Rockin' Redman and Naughty, oh, where my kitty cat?
Half a brick of yay in the bra where her titties at
And I'm livin' that for life, we push weight
Fuck the state pen, fuck hoes at Penn State
Listen close, it's Francis, the Praying Mantis
Attack with the MAC, my left hand spit
Right hand grip on the whip for the smooth getaway

Take so long you got to bend
Grab yo' man snatch yo' bitch

Or get mad cause they ain't grew like us

They don't fit the shoe like us
Don't know who's who like us who dat?
Strangers, ain't aware of the danger
They head's up wit thoroughbred cats
That knock 'em back, they get the axe
And a hard case to crack

Ain't nobody boss but us
We got force wit us, of course it's us
It's no being better off than us
And ain't a hotter source than us
And these streets ain't divorcing us
We ain't got no remorse in us
Know to hold your horse with us
No cuttin' shorts with us
Here to stay, no abortin us, no extortin' us
Between us we got the mic domain and artillery
Therefore, it's all free reign, who's domain

Who walks away with the gain

Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

You can never see what I see, motherfucker
Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder

When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust

Aiyo, Aiyo, Gansta, Gansta
The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back 
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick building, grown ladies jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga

Lil' Kim,"I say people people come on and check it out now
You see the mic in my hand now watch me wreck it now
What is a party if the crew ain't there?
[what's your name?] call me Guru that's my man Premier
Now many attempts have been made to hold us back?
Slander the name and with-hold facts
But I'm the type of brother with much more game
I got a sure aim and if I find you're to blame
You can bet you'll be exterminated, taken out, done
It doesn't matter how many they'll go as easy as just one
Bust one round in the air for this here
'Cause this year suckers are going no where
'Cause my strret style and intelligence level
Makes me much more than just an angry rebel
I'm Gifted Unlimited Rhymes Universal
Mc's that ain't equipped get flipped in my circle
I'm aiming on raining on the bitch ass chumps
'Cause their rhymes don't flow and their beats don't pump
And niggaz better know I paid my dues and shit
I'm bout to blow the fuck up because I refuse to quit
I'm out to get the props that are rightfullly mine
Yeah me and the crew think its about that time
But on the DL you know that Gangstarr will conquer
That's why you stare and point and others cling on to
My nautica, asking for a hookup
Well sorry but my schedule is all booked up
Nobody put me on I made it up the hard way
Look out for my people but the suckers should parlay
'Cause it's business kid, this ain't no free for all
You have to wait your turn, you must await your call
So now, now it is my duty to
Eliminate and subtract all of the booty crews
And suckers should vacate
Before I get irate
And I'll kick your can
From here to Japan
With force you can't withstand
'Cause I'm the muthafuckin' man

Yo right now I got my man Lil' Dap from the Group home
Yo step up to the mic and tell them why you're the man

So much anger built inside
So don't stop to say hi, muthafucka just die
My shit holds a mouthful so I guess you know what's up
Why punks get killed at the end of the month
Styles and styles I flip
Lil' Dap remains sick
Yes the Group Home is thick
So all you punks hear this
Everytime you riff
The more fame that we get
Muthafuckas act hard
Thinking that they are God
Niggaz just don't understand
Let me be my own man
Did everything on my own
And everyplace wasn't home
Everywhere that I'd rest
I had to dress with a vest
I guess you get the routine but with a lot of stress
Frustration on my mind
Brothers doin' mad time
Rhymes are organized like crime
As we're rippin' the lines
Brothers just don't know
How shit got to go
'Cause I was told
To never give my back to the street
As I walk through the ghetto
Dead souls I greet
See my man give him pound
Then I walk with a frown
Another minute
Another brother's gunned down
Shit is getting too close that's why the Group Home is thick
So everytime you riff the more fame that we get
My father always said don't watch the one across the street
Watch the one right next
Because he's easy to flex
Took heed to what he said
Yeah that deep ass nigga
While brothers hang around
Tryin' to get down
Niggaz just don't understand
I'm the mutha fuckin' man

And also on the set from Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
We got my man Jeru the Damaja
Yo tell them why you're the man

I'll tap your jaw
You probably heard it before
Step to the bedlamite I'll prove my word is law
Drugstore with more
Dope rhyme vendor
Not partial to beef
The chief ambassador
Niggaz get mad 'cause they can't score
Like a wild west flick they wish to shoot up my door
But I incite a riot
Don't even try it
Bust up chumps so crab kids keep quiet
Like I said before
I tap jaws
Snatch whores
Kill suckers in wars
Vic a style you said was yours
Money grip want to flip but you're fish
House the mic like your hooker and did tricks on the bitch
Dirty Rotten Scoundrel and my name is Jeru
Utilizing my tools in '92
MC's step up in mobs to defeat us
When we rock knots and got props like Norm Peterson
Lot's of friends, lot's of fun, lots of beers
Got the skills, kreeno so I always get cheers

Watch poppi and them, hit it up with the paint balls

.. My Aunt Dot
left a glock and some blood on my sheets
Told me clean the shit up, then she hit the streets
Even though I'm her niece, she copped me a piece
Wack-ass caliber, nickel-plated with the silencer
What? She don't know I like my guns pretty?
Like my boy Castor Troy with the twin-glizzies
I heard a knock at the door {*knock knock knock knock knock*}
To my surprise I saw these two familiar eyes
Who are you?

[Lil' Shanice]
Whattup? I'm Shanice, don't remember me?

[Lil' Kim]
She called me by my government name, Kimberly
Who sent you?

[Lil' Shanice]
My mom sent me; her name is Dottie
She packed a note in my knapsack along with a shottie

[Lil' Kim]
Hmmph, she was cute; and mad fly
She had the Prada knapsack, with the hat to match
Bavari hiking boots, with the mink bubblegoose
and I could see she was admiring my Minski suit
Then she handed me the note

[Lil' Shanice]
Here - read this

[Lil' Kim]
I just stared her up and down
cause I couldn't believe this - then I opened it
It said, ""Bitches is out to get you;
your so-called friends, put a bomb in your Benz.
I'm on a mission now to do some harm to your friends.
They know where you live, so evacuate the crib.
And oh, the little girl, that's your cousin Shanice.
Since I can't be with her, I need you to babysit her.
Besides; she looks up to you - you're her idol -
and tomorrow is her first violin recital, 
and she would be more than happy if you could take her.
Peace, my number's on the back of the paper, hit me later.""
Damn.. what went wrong? 
Can't we all just get along, and make hit songs? 
Bitches all up in my ass like a thong
If this was a show, why'all hoes would get ""gonged""
Cause if it's on, then it's on, bring it on
What the fuck you waitin for? see'mon, let's get it on
What? What's takin you so long? I got plans for the future
to bring back your head like Medusa

Chorus: Lil' Kim (repeat 2X)
Girls be actin stink, and mad funny
why'all bitches bleed like me, on the monthly
Can't stand the pain then pop a ""Humphrey""
I know it hurts.. (I'm killin why'all)

[Lil' Kim]
Uhhh, we in the Range in this fucked up weather
It's snowin and I'm tryin to put the whole shit together
How Laverne, she always wanted to be like me
and dress like me, and look like me
and Nicole, it's like she lived in my house
Askin me for money, day in - day out
And last but not least the grimiest one Tayesha
She planned it all, come to find out her name is Keisha
see'mon Shanice I'm takin you to my house in L. Conn.
(I want to go with you!) Uhh, be quiet, and we'll get along fine

[Lil' Shanice]
see'mon please, I want to be just like you
600 Mercedes, and 380's in my doll babies
Crazy baguettes in my barettes; and,
H-class rocks inside my baby G shop
Fuck Barney and Lambchops; I don't love them hoes!
But anything goes when it comes to bankrolls
Diamonds on my toes, X-and-O's
Versace hottie in designer clothes
Scoop Lil' Nique and Jus, then take 'em to Toys'are'Us
Make em spend they cheese then kick 'em out and take the bus
I'm the S-the-H-the-A-the-N-the-I-the-see-the-E
but all my friends call me Miss Little Queen Bee
What what? I like the green, know what I mean?
Ever seen The Professional? (uh-huh) Well I come cleaner

[Lil' Kim]
You know what? I like you; little big person
but rule number one - no cursin
Anyway, what you know about that?
You too young for that, when I was your age
I woulda got hung for that
Then I picked up the phone, to call my Aunt Dot
so she could fill me in a little more about the plot
Hmm.. nine-one-seven, eight-five-eight, two-one-two-two
""Hello?"" Yo, what's the deal?
Why these bitches buggin out; 
I mean, what's this all about?
""See it's sorta like what Tonya Harding did to Nancy
They don't want you to win no more
Soul Train they don't want you to attend no more
And I guess that's why, they ain't your friends no more
The other day, when I was comin out the grocery store
I saw the bitch Nicole in front of the salon next door""
For real? ""Yup, then I choked the bitch out
At least one to the heart, tied up her hands and feet
Through her in my backseat,
then I dumped her on a dead-end street
The other two? Yeah they still linger
But don't you lift a finger, I'ma get 'em
so just pray I come home
and when we hang up, get rid of your phone""
Whoo! When Aunt Dot comes, oh brother
It's like five Bloody Mary's, one after another
Hmmph, she have you stressed, no wearin white, no sex
And when she get vexed, you guess what happens next
Cause them other two girls, that's still on the menu
is the reason why the story is to be continued..

Chorus",Aunt Dot,2000
Lil' Kim,"I gets right to the point - no time to play around
When it comes to this cheddar - lay a nigga down
Bust shots at his Rover if he dare come back around
Pay me on time or I gots to take mine
At first I seem friendly; but that's just in me
I warn you - when I blow, it gets a little windy
You make me want to fight you, I ain't nothin like you
Y'all ""Paper Thin,"" my shit recycled
They call me Lil' Kim, a.k.a. Cover Girl
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another fuckin world
Niggaz buy me glass slippers and diamond fingernails
And aww, shit, I got it all in this bitch

[Chorus: (x2)]
Goodness gracious, the papers!
Where the cash at?  Where the stash at?
Nigga pass that!
We rollin in tinted Nav's
TV's in the dash, see we love the cash

To all my bitches in the strip club - shakin they ass
(I ain't mad, do your thing mami!) Get that cash!
And all my hustlin niggaz still out on the ave.
Fightin over blocks and who got the best rocks
And ""Goodness gracious,"" the struggle never stops
The things we all do to keep our pockets filled with knots
People fuck to my music - they say it's pornographic
My Billboards is nice; one day gon' be a classic
I fuck with dudes, with ""Members Only"" jackets
That sleep on brass beds, with money for a mattress
""Gettin' Money"" bitch, and I roll with dimes
Take pictures with our nines on the cover of New York Times
Tattoos down our spine with the the picture of a dime
Cuttin niggaz short like inmates for phone time
Everything I get is - custom made
Niggaz, want to get laid; I gotta get paid
(The papers..)

Yo Check them out Yo yo yo
When it's murder on my mind, I do it all the time
Got tombstone flow, wit a casket rhyme
Your gats is plastic, I got platinum nines
With gold shells Banger Vegas tap yah spine
I'm the type to spazz out and take back what's mine
Rep for my hood niggas slinging crack and dimes
Half is mine
So you know it's half my time
In the pen or the box
With my man on the ox
We gon do it like we did it on the block
Let's roll
Like wit 60's 30's
forty niggas with me
Rep yah hood
Rep yah block
Rep yah city
This is me talkin, without the Remy in me
I kick it from the heart, that's why niggas feel me
Show ya'll the true meaning why Banger act willie
Cause I start to spazz and smack a bitch silly
They call Leo Ganza wit the twin nine millis
Yeah niggas

Chorus: All (Lil' Kim) Lil' Cease

Go head and fight (All my bitches grab a nigga)

[Verse 2 Lil' Cease]
Ayo yo ayo
This is for them niggas frontin, don't really want it
My thirty-two bullets got all yah names on it
Hit them in the brain, niggas slaying
Layinh dormant
Iced out grenade, with the big chains on it
New Years blimp With B.I.G. name on it
Iceburg sweaters with Kim name on it
Cease-A-Le Tee with big blood stain on it
Every time I sign a check, I sign a thug name on it
Niggas got rhymes but they flow's so boring
No stage shows, so forget about touring
Mad at my team cause my niggas stay scoring
All you gotta do is make a false move and it's warning
My guns bust
Niggas get wet when it's pourin
Rain down long like Kim gettin dressed in the morning
Five star general, spit a uzi at yah coffin
Run up in yah crib without a search warrant

Chorus

Once again it's on
The mother fucking psychos M.A.F.I.A.

My Bed Stuy niggas is who I ride for
Send that ass slow like I ride a six four

Got a new attitude for the Y2K

So I'm about to get on some Left Eye shit
And start burnin' down niggaz cribs

When we met, I can't front, I was all in your shit
Even though I was a bitch playin' hard to get
'Cause see I never felt this way in my life
It didn't take long before you made me your wife
Shoppin' sprees and puttin' money in my pockets
Pictures of you inside my heart-shaped lockets
And my girls, knew you wasn't no good
They told me bout them broads you was fuckin' in the hood
You said I was a diamond, and you was like a pearl
So daddy how could you do this to your baby girl?
Memories, is all it brings when I look at my rings
And ""Heartbreaker"" is the song I sing (c'mon, c'mon)

Breakfast in Paris, dinner in Milan
Sex on the beach, yeah we had it goin' on
Then one day you hid my birth control pills
Said the way I sucked your dick it had you head over heels
When you got rich I helped you run your company
For eleven years, and now you want to dump me?
And just to think, I was about to have a baby for you
And then some bitch you was fuckin' said she was havin' one too?
You wrong!  Nigga dead wrong, you know the song
""Don't know what you've got til it's gone""
After the fight, the other night, and we both went to jail
I burnt all your clothes up, I was ""Waiting to Exhale""

[Chorus]

Now I'm back to my old ways, like in the old days
Flirtin', not givin' a fuck, what?
Got you lookin' in the mirror sayin', ""Damn!""
Sick thinkin' 'bout the next man fuckin this tight pussy
Niggaz want me, even though they got a honey
If I'ma be number two, they givin' me some hush money
Ask Whitney, I learned how to break a heart from you
'Cause when a woman's fed up, it ain't nuttin' you can do
I'm that Bitch, don't you ever forget

The wounds heal slow, you just don't know
At times, I don't know what to say
And all I do is pray, day to day
But still, I feel my strength might die
Like right now, I'm tryin' hard not to cry
Even when I close my eyes, I still see it
Damn, I just don't believe it
The bad times I buried, like the cemetery
Unworthy people playin' beneficiaries
A lotta people eatin' off of one man's death
Don't you worry B.I., I'ma ride to my last breath
You killas, caused a lotta devastation
You have no idea what you did to this nation
I fuckin' hate you, excuse my frustration

Passed away, now bitches wanna claim his name
I been with my nigga before he came in the game
No one's, no V's, we used to take the train
Just us and the Mafia goin' out to parties
I guess back then we was real nobodies
But he was my nigga, and I was his bitch
I rolled hard with him, how could I forget him
Had beef with yo wife that ain't patched up
But still got love for your kids
Even wrote 'em in my will
And I'ma make sure the fam keep a decent meal
No matter what I got to do, or who I got to kill
Shit is real, baby, there ain't no appeal
If I'm fucked up, imagine how Mrs. Wallace feels
Sometimes I sit and think how it would be if we was married
Of if I woulda kept the child that I carried
So to my ladies, don't think I haven't walked in yo shoes
Or thought this was only happenin' to you, righ'
Here's my shoulder, you can lean on this boo
Cuz trust me, I know exactly what you're going through

Don't you give up, be strong
Hold on, hold on
Things are gonna get better
Tough times, they last so long
Hold on, hold on
If you believe, they will get better

So I guess you know the story of how it all ends
Depressed, stressed, don't know who's my real friends
One thing's for sure, I can count on my mens
D-Roc, Money, L, Lil' Cease, and PD
My whole B.I. family, remind me of you
We miss you so much, I love you so much
Never thought life without you would be so rough
But I know we gon make it
We ain't happy, but we fakin'
And to New York, thanks for the support
And all our real fans, I'm shoutin' out the whole land
This is somethin' young kids just won't understand
How they took away this beautiful man
Who shared so many memories
I could go on and on, but a song can only be so long
It's been hard, but I told God that I put up a fight
So here's a Long Kiss Goodnight, Frank White

Ah hell I even f*** with different races
A white dude - his name was John
He had a Queen Bee Rules tattoo on his arm, uh
He asked me if I'd be his date for the prom
And he'd buy me a horse, a Porsche and a farm
Dan my nigga from Down South
Used to like me to spank him and cum in his mouth
And Tony he was Italian (Uh-huh)
And he didn't give a f*** (Uh-huh)
That's what I liked about him
He ate my pussy from dark till the morning
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin'
Puerto Rican papi, used to be a Deacon
But now he be sucking me off on the weekend

He had a big as* dick and a hurricane tongue

Sixty on the bezel, a hundred on the rings
Sittin' pretty baby with a Cash Money bling

After three bottles I'll be ready to f***
Some niggaz even put me on their grocery lists
Right next to the whip cream and box of chocolates

And a whole bunch of guns wrapped tight in their arms
See them bastards woke me up when they broke my alarm
I was getting my ass licked by this cat named Tom
(Stop!)
I heard three guns cocked that's when Tom dropped
They sent the bow and arrow right through his tank top
(Oh she's lying!)
Lying? Blood was gushing on the floor
Fingerprints all on the door
Need I say more?
Pulled out the remote can and shot blows after blow
Ploom! Queen off her toes
They fell down like dominoes
I think it was the Matrix, I mean it was the Matrix
What was I do?
Sit back and just take this?
Yo I tell you now
If I lose this debate
Like in Dead Presidents
I'm going out like Lorenz Tate
See I ain't gon be stupid
I'm gon take all why'all to the shift
I should be able to say what I want
What the fuck I plead the fifth

The first female king and they mad cause I'm a girl

[Cee-lo]
Uh with all due respect your honor
Excuse my client's temperament
Who has had social intelligence?
With so much innocence we have to implement
She was slightly out of place
But if you grant us a grain of your grace
I'll assure you it's only stress due to the severity of the case
Imagine for a minute, yourself in the same shoes
The same sense of survival and the same nothing to lose
Your children, your lovely wife
I mean look at her
The only thing she's guilty of is having no choice in the matter

[Kim]
Lord I cry, I cry
From the things that I've seen
That I've seen
And Lord I cry, I cry
From the things I've seen, ooh

Oh yeah
You'd know why
You'd know why I cry, I cry, I cry

[Redman]
Order! Order! Order!
Order! Order! Order!
Order in the courts, I'm examining her thoughts
And the notes on why you started slaughtering the fort
The men dressed in blue they were undercover cops
Hungry to see another black motherfucker shot
They ran up in your spot and no one gave the orders
Even Tom was tapped with a mic and a tape recorder
(He was in on it too!)
Yeah
(I should've known)
Yeah
(Objection your honor)
Yo objection overruled
I know the news they tried to pay the grand jury
To give you life sentence with parole up in thirty
Now that's dirty, surveillance and you debate
Fuck Will! Now you're the new Enemy of the State
Angela Bobbett's cake compared to you
And Junior Mafia that clique ain't scared to move
So they took precautions
Grenades from all force and
Professional marksman with four fours of war hymn
But you stopped, dropped, rolled and duck
Shot back other bitches would've folded up
Now that's my kind of bitch
I know I'm the judge
But I love that bitch
And I'm coming with her
Creme of crop and me I'mma hold her down
Resign with A-K's so we blowing the trial
Look it's a setup

Where you're allowed to smoke weed

See I used to dig this bitch from Botswana
Half-African but she looked like Madonna
And yo check, she had a tiger for a pet
I'll never forget, the restaurant where we met

All I could think about is how he killed my man Smiles
Cut his head off, masacre style
Yeah, Syrus did it
Syrus the virus they call him
When I finish with 'em, please, his name is Swiss cheese
My main focus is his right-hand man Mousey
Sheisty and two-sided, confession, dick ridin'
And his boys, they seem to be all on his dick
I mean the whole situation is really makin' me sick
And when Sysrus got up and dipped off to the bathroom
We started suckin' niggas up like the vacuum
Bullets flyin' non-stoppin', bodies droppin'
Puff yell (Bloody!), that's the cops then
My trigger finger startin' itchin'
That's when Syrus came spittin' from the kitchen
The next second, he missed me
Listen, it's soundin' like the 4th of July
Like a solar eclipse is lit right in the sky
I can't believe this guy, he won't fall over
Holes in his body the size of cup-holders
One more shot, he's over, shit Puff I'm empty

But I'ma hold my breath 'til he falls to his death
But he was helpess, his little kid beat off in his pelvis

To all my motherfuckin' gettin' money hoes
Used to sellin clothes
And all my ghetto bitches in the projects
Coming through like bulldozers
No, we ain't sober
Bum bitches know better than to start shit
Niggas love a hard bitch
One that get up in a nigga's ass quicker than an enema
Make a cat bleed then sprinkle it with vinegar
Kidnap the senator
Make him call his wife and say he never coming home
Kim got him in a zone beating they dicks
Even got some of these straight chicks rubbing their tits
What? I'm loving this shit
Queen Bitch!
What bitch you know can thug it like this?
Imagine if I was dude and hittin' cats from the back
With no strings attached
Yeah nigga, picture that!
I treat y'all niggas like y'all treat us

Come here so I can bust in ya mouth

Count a million bucks in the back of an armor truck
While I get you fucked up off the T.O.N.Y.
The BX, the chron-chron
And the list goes on and on
(On and on and on)
Like Erykah Badu
Once he drink the Remi down
Ooh I got this nigga now
He asked me did I love him
I said what came to mind like niggas be doing
Yeah baby, I love you long time
Look I ain't tryin' to suck ya
I might not even fuck ya
Just lay me on this bed and give me some head
Got the camcord layin' in the drawer where he can't see
Can't wait to show my girls he sucked the piss out my pussy
Been doin' this for years, no need to practice
Take lessons from the Queen and you'll know how to mack this
Niggas know he gave me all his cake
I peeled the Benji's off and threw the singles back in his face

I'm try-na see my face on a hundred dollar bill
Met this dude name Jaleel at this Abdulla fight
He said he'd pay me ten grand just to belly dance
Cum all on his pants
I met him at the studio
He showed up with his homeboy named Julio
I said 'Whoa! Who's the other guy?'
Hope you know you paying extra for this fuckin' third eye
Something about him, I knew he was a phony
Put the burner in his mouth
'Fool, Give me my money!'
He was just a nigga frontin' like he knew mad stars
In his homeboy's whips like he got mad cars
Niggas ain't shit but they still can trick
All they can do for me is suck my clit
I'm jumpin' up and up after I cum
Thinkin' they gon' get some pussy but they gets none

Don't come to my house, it might hurt your feelings

Fired me a few mill and a couple of oil spills
That's how we do it, you chicks is no thrill
Doin' it Flinstones style, car with no wheels
Still on tricycles, riding bicycles
Our diamonds be so white they look like icicles
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing all these rough drafts
On the countdown, don't make me laugh

[Intro: Kiely]
Haha, 3LDub baby, A Girl Can Mack

[Verse 1: Kiely]
Yo, if you don't like expensive things
Then you can bounce if you don't want to get it together
You could be out, 'cause I'm all about gettin' them things
From the truck to the house, to the gear and them rings
No doubt, coulda done it but ain't no hoe for you
Now I try to tell you but all you do is sit around
It takes more than hope and a dream
I got a mean team puttin' in work to get the cream, what

[Chorus: Lil' Kim (3LW)]
Money and hot rides (I need that)
The platinum and shine (I need that)
The house and the gear (I need that)
I'm sayin' baby (I... want... that...)

[Verse 2: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Life can turn you in so many different directions
Then I got a mind to win
(Can't remember why I got with you)
I want everything, but I need to stay realistic
I'm gonna live this dream
(From hear on out, that's what I'm about)

[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3: Adrienne (Kiely)]
Boy I feel for you, you think you have it real easy
You don't even have a clue
(Can't remember why I got with you)
I'm gonna do my thang, sorry if you feel rejected
You need to do the same
(From here on out, that's what I'm about)

[Bridge: 3LW (Lil' Kim)]
I need these things, you can't supply me
It's too easy, for you to stop tryin' (Uh-huh)
Get off your feet, do it for yourself (Let's do it)
I can't stick around with shady feelings
(Lil' Kim, Queen Bee, 3LW)

[Verse 4: Lil' Kim]
Jackpot, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at, where the stash at
Nigga pass that, up the bonds and stocks
And the canary yellow D flawless rocks
Introducing the Lil' Kim Shepard Watch
I'm on fire, 'bout to turn it up a notch
Keep ya yacht, I want ships inside my estate
With FullForce written on the license plate
Heliports and helicopters with gold propellers
Tryna have more cheese then mozzarella
I need stables, there's only one way to live (What's that?)
Horseback ridin' in the back of the crib
Two Indian braids like the Navaho
Yippi iy ya, yippi iy yo
Make this money, take this money
Ain't no way you gonna take this from me, ow

Uh-huh, (I... want... that...)
If you don't want that baby, then you can't have me baby
Don't depend on me baby, finally do ya own thing baby

Ooh (I need that)

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!
Pop! Six! Squish! Uh uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

Pop! Six! Squish! Uh Uh, Cicero, Lipschitz!

You know how people have these little habits
That get you down like Ernie
Ernie like to chew gum, no, not chew, Pop

Like, I come home this one day and there's Ernie
Layin' on the couch chewin', no, not chewin', poppin'
So, I said to him, I said
""Ernie, you pop that gum one more time"" and he did

So I took the shotgun off the wall
And I fired two warning shots into his head

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame

I met Ezekiel Young from Salt Lake city about two years ago
And he told me he was single and we hit it off right away
So, we started living together

He'd go to work, he'd come home, I'd fix him a drink, we'd have dinner.
Then I found out, single, my ass
Not only was he married, well, he had six wives
One of those Mormons, you know

So that night, when he came home
I fixed him his drink as usual
You know, some guys just can't hold their arsenic

He had it coming, he had it coming
He took a flower in its prime
And then he used it and he abused it
It was a murder but not a crime

Now, I'm standing in the kitchen
Carvin' up the chicken for dinner
And in storms my husband Wilbrin in a jealous rage
""You been screwin' the milkman""

He says and he kept sayin'
""You been screwin the milkman""
Then he ran into my knife
He ran into my knife ten times

If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

But did you do it?
Uh uh, not guilty

My sister, Veronica and I had this double act
And my husband, Charlie traveled around with us
With the last number in our act
We did 20 acrobatic tricks in our world

One two three four five, splits, spread eagles
Flip flops, back flips, one right after the other
Well, this one night we were in Cicero

The three of us, we were in this hotel room
Boozin' and havin' a few laughs and we ran out of ice
So I went out to get some

I come back, open the door
There's Veronica and Charlie
Doing number seventeen, the spread eagle

Well, I was in such a state of shock, I completely blacked out
I can't remember a thing, it wasn't until later
When I was washing the blood off my hands
I even knew they were dead

They had it coming, they had it coming
They had it coming all along
I didn't do it, in spite if I'd done it
How could you tell me that I was wrong?

I loved Alvin Lipschitz, he was a real artistic guy, sensitive, a painter
But he was always trying to find himself
He go out every night looking for himself
And on the way, he found Ruth, Gladys, Rosemary and Irving

I guess you can say we broke up because of artistic differences
He saw himself as alive and I saw him dead

The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum
The dirty bum, bum, bum, bum, bum

They had it comin', they had it comin'
They had it comin' all along
'Cause if they used us and they abused us
How could they tell us that we were wrong?

He had it coming, he had it coming
He only had himself to blame
If you'd have been there, if you'd have seen it
I betcha you would have done the same

You pop that gum one more time

Touch of her skin feeling silky smooth
Color of cafe au lait alright
Made the savage beast inside roar until he cried,
More, more, more

But when he turns off to sleep memories creep,

And I'ma give it to you raw whether you like it or not
Like it's my last bullet and I only got one shot
Aim straight for the middle like I'm throwin a dart
And when I spit, believe it's goin straight to your heart
I lay my mack game down nigga, straight from the start
Don't take it personal baby -- fuck you, pay me!
Ain't nuttin but ladies in my dark blue Mercedes
With the Parabas kit, got niggaz mad as shit
No we never sip unless it's ice in our drinks
But sometimes we get cold from the ice on our minks
That fly-girl persona, it's the primadonna world
Act like you ain't heard about the, Gabbana girls
Holly-Hood style gettin LOVE around the globe
You might catch me next season on the cover of Vogue!

Bitches talk slick, but they ain't got nuttin for me
When I'm in they terriotory, it's a whole 'nother story
We never get stuck, sometimes we take the long route
When our back's against the wall, we bang our way out
I'm in the gettin money mode, livin by the street code
Bout to have, every corner of this rap game sewed
Hey hey - you homies better start, showin some respect
Or get slapped silly -- heard my man G. Dep!
Hey hey hey - quit tryin to holla at the bee and you think you fly
Impress me dog, throw some money in the sky!

Don't ride but I still cop a Harley
Don't lie - who else is hot besides me?
Worldwide, I crush everybody!
And I shouldn't have to tell why'all who run the city
Even my seven-year-old niece Rizzy, knows I gets busy
You know the name, Lil' Kim, high class (woop woop!)
Shake it shorty with yo' high-priced ass
Tryin to be a billionaire, I got things to do

Lil' Kim,"So what am I not supposed to have an opinion
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled

When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act
So he does what every little boy would do
Makin' up a few false rumors or two
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard
So what do we do girls, shout out loud
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Nobody can hold us down
Never can, never will

So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore
I don't understand why it's OK,
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named
All my ladies come together and make a change
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard
So what do we do girls, shout out loud
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground
So lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud
Take a deep breath and say it loud
Never can, never will
Can't hold us down

Here's something I just can't understand
If the guy have three girls then he's the man
He can even give her some head, or sex her off
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore
But the tables about to turn
I bet my fame on it
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it
It's aight though, you can't hold me down
I got to keep on moving
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac
Do it right back to him and let that be that
You need to let him know that his game is whack
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back

You're just a little boy
Think you so cute, so coy
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things
You're just a little boy
All you do is annoy
You must talk big to make up for smaller things

This is for my girls all around the world
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard
So what do we do girls, shout out loud
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground

The hardest rapper to ever cop on poppy and put it in a song
Ma how could you go wrong?
Ha ha ha ha worse than a armed robbery
Know that I'm armed properly, whenever the arm's rocky

You can go on clockin' me, ain't nuttin' gon' stop me
High as Allah I be, movin' in peace but I
Move with the piece, so them, dudes in the streets
Will never remove my piece, ha ha, got me

Niggaz'll never get me, I never move sloppy
Move with the Glock 50, got some Tupac with me
Let's not test my gangsta, just, raise your glasses
Mami, shake ya asses, this is a thug classic

Make a hole, make a hole and let the queen come past
I come through in the speedboat, with 808's in the glass
Push big things here, bet most of y'all crash
Back to trainin' lightweights, you in the wrong weight class

Haters, stay awake, fuck the Harlem shake
We 'Slam' dance like onyx, check my Ebonics
You got, heat nigga you thinkin' we won't blaze?
Gotta come hard 'cause these are the last days

When I do it I do's it, ain't no more to it
Ask Ice Cube I puts my back into it
From car dealers to Macy's, the cashiers embrace me
We train like the Navy for whatever the case may be

I pass on the 6, they don't impress me much
I want the bulletproof 7 'cause the doors lift up
They pick the best of all girls, so how y'all sound?
I got the best of both worlds, holdin' me down

And that Malibu view on the mountain top
Just a few reasons why you feelin' the kid
You know, spacious cribs, outrageous trips
Forget about your friends, man,

They would make the switch
Who knew those words I do

That'll come see y'all like ""Black Hawk Down""
I ain't playin with you motherfuckers

If gettin money is a crime, then I confess
Ain't about money? I could care less
When you see us comin know it's time to collect
Niggaz be like, ""Here come the IRS!""
Kick down doors, shoot through walls
Queen Bee's a movement, fight for the cause
Got a bite that's bigger than ""Jaws""

You all stuck at the back, I'm ahead of the line
Even in the dark, I'm still gon' shine
You'll see what I mean in 2009

Live guitars, nigga fuck cars
I'm tryin to buy a spaceship to get to Mars
Look out the window, and reach for the stars
It's a new day, Lil' Kim's in charge

And about to buy my best friend a beauty parlor
I know y'all don't wanna see Kim on top
Please stop worryin about what I got
What the fuck y'all know about the Yonker Rock
When I'm cookin, keep your hands out my pot
Them boys ain't bad and ain't no bitch greater
Stop tryin to use me as a respirator
I'm the same bitch on the escalator
And I still ain't got no time for you fuckin haters
I might start my day at Piarage'

After me there will be none, but you could call me Miss White
Most people know me as, Lil Kim the head of the La Bella Mafia
Oh, shoutout to my girl Victoria Gotti and the whole family stay up

This time around I ain't takin no shit, this time around I never get bit
This time around I switched up my flow
Got rid of the pits and put rotts by the do'
This time around it ain't like befo'
This time around I'm gon' crack ya jo'
The feds is watchin me so I can't do much
Speak the wrong words bitch and you will get touched
I'm back on the scene my favorite color is green
I'm buildin a empire got a whole new team
Pimp game is strong, raps is just harder than they ever been
You can never win
Made my way through Hollywood fashion world adores me
Music's my first love a nine to five bores me
Love me or hate me Lil Kim come through
My fans across the world I came back for you

I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl
I came back for you
Everybody's waitin on me all these hoes hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

It's the real hip hop mami check the facts
I'm sick of all you acts with your bubble gum raps
Like the sand in the hour glass you out of your time
Tried to go against the queen is you out of your mind?
Even be at number two, your chances is slim
Cause when God made Adam, he should've made Kim
I gave a few passes but I never forget
It's enough I got to put up with this Doo Doo Brown chick
Now you and you wanna come at me from all sides
I'm gettin money, don't think I just be lettin shit slide
I'm very concerned with fashion ain't my fault y'all don't know how ta
Rock this Hollyhood thang y'all need to let me style ya
Come back, to the light ma, I started the shit
How soon we forget I'm the heart of the shit
So keep your tacky ways and go back to your stripper days
As long as I'm around, you gon' bow down

I came back for you
All incarcerated scarfaces gangstas with the fed cases
I came back for you, all my fans across the world holla at your girl

Everybody's waitin on me all these hoes hatin on me
I came back for you, the mink rockin Benz coppin keep the bottles poppin

This time around either your in or your out
This time around you better watch your mouth
This time around you gon' hang or bang
This time around you better do your thang
Cause I'm the best that ever done it, the best that lived it
I ain't no overnight success goddamnit I was born with it
The Prada mama, the Dolce and Gabbana drippin
The Blue Hypnotic Martini Mimosa sippin
Y'all better team or get it together
Or you, you and her can get it whenever
Huh, I got a army y'all can't harm me
If the show was on the other foot you probably try to starve me

I can't put these - cars in a box with the ashes
I can't take these diamonds with me when I day
I can't build that pretty white house in the sky
I know you wishin that you wrote this song
But these same words comin from you, would be a joke
You better off takin heed from your boy Jada
I know you, hate dyin - but you gon' die a hater
I got a vision, I think for the future baby pah
why'all nearsighted, lotta why'all, can't see that far
Rocks like the street light - baby watch 'em glow
Red yellow and green - don't know whether to stop or go

Like a bottle of fine wine I just get better with time

What is she like, what does she need?
What is her type, I want to give it to her, tell her please
Be my girl, I'll give her anything
Whatever her heart desires, in this whole world

[Lil' Kim]
Just cause you ain't a millionaire don't mean you can't compete
You ain't gotta be filthy rich, but you can't be cheap
I like a man that can stand on his own two feet
Got a strong business mind, straight out the streets
He gotta have security, power and wealth
Cause I can do bad by my God damn self
And if you spiritual, got a good heart and can make me laugh
And can fuck..

You want Kim? Name the location
75 grand and that's just for conversation

I'ma remain loyal while y'all crumble like the foil 
It's tradition to rock diamonds in my crown, I'm royal
Niggas ain't believe in me, they thought it was over
Baby girl risin' up like the early mornin' sun
Y'all think y'all know but y'all have no idea
What the fuck I been goin' through these last 7 years

(I pray for love
I pray for love 
I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
Every day, yo
And every night
They just don't make my breed no more
Word, that's it
(I pray for love)(Every day, yo)
(I pray for love) I'm the last of the Mohicans
(and every night) after me 
There will be none
(I pray for love)
(I pray for love, joy, peace and happiness)
And every night
Nobody lives by the code of the street no more

I'm sayin'
I just wanna be happy, that's all I don't ask for much
It makes me happy to see my people smile you know what I'm sayin
I ain't a hater, I don't even like sayin' the word
(Nobody lives by the code of the street no more)
I'd sacrifice everything I got right now to have my man Biggie here wit me
You see that's just how I am
'cause I'm a rider (Keep the fam together god knows I tried)
What good is it to have everything
If you can't share it with the one you love?
If you can't be wit the ones you love... then love the ones you wit
Don't take nobody for granted
You ain't promised tomorrow
Karma's a motherfucker
I'm appreciative (Payback's a motherfucker, put that on the Stuy)

Lil' Kim,"[Havoc]
Now here's a little story I got to tell
About a gangsta-ass bitch, y'all know so well
It started way back, in history
With Lil' Kim, Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G.

Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! ... WHOAHHHH!

[Lil' Kim]
Now here's a little story I gots to tell
Bout the first rap bitch to rock Chanelle
Tought you how to get money and pop Cristal
Even gave y'all tips on ridin cock as well
The Beehive, sticker say ""better beware""
If it's buzzin in the spot you know my boys is here (bzzzz)
Cause we in the parkin lot, you know the toys is there
Pushin drop Bee wagons, two doors, ya hear?
Hold it now, the Queen's sittin in the chair
Now y'all wanna dress sexy and dye your hair?
Will the real Kim stand up? It's frauds in here
I'm bout to pull the plug on all y'all broads this year
(Lights out!)

[Chorus 2X: Lil' Kim]
When we come to the clubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
When we pull up on them dubs they be like (hold it, hold it now)
Where my bitches and my thugs gettin right (hold it, hold it now)
Come chill in V.I.P. with us for the night - WHOAHHHH!

[Lil' Kim]
Now all my all my all my bitches rub ya titties (if ya love Biggie)
And all my niggaz grab ya dicks if you feelin a bitch
I'm in the middle of the dancefloor (go Kim, go Kim) killin the shit
With the Belve', tryin not to spill any shit
You know the Queen show love when I'm up in the club
I like to play with my coochie when I'm up in the tub
You a, sensitive thug, lemme give you a hug
Y'all thirsty-ass niggaz take this bottle of bub
I'm the, First Lady, so I can't lose
Because of me y'all rock rhymes in high heel shoes
Lil' Kim the Grammy winner get love worldwide
Now hold that, yo Havoc, let the beat ride

[Chorus]

[Lil' Kim]
And since Frank White taught me how to play the game
La Bella Mafia, nigga I play to reign
They put my album in the street like they pump the 'caine
I'm like bleach - Lil' Kim leave a permanent stain!
I'm feared in my country like Saddam Hussein
I might give a, little head to {""hold it, hold it now""}
All we ask is y'all show respect
Cause we don't want talk, big homey, just cut the check!
Now I'm sittin outside in my 6.6
Just signed a lil' deal bout 6.6
Used to transport bricks and make 6.6
If you look in my garage I got 6 joints

[Chorus]

Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! Go Kim! (hold it, hold it now)
Go Kim! ... WHOAHHHH",Hold It Now,2003
