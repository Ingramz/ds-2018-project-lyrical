John Kay,"Intro:
We're gonna do a song about those dangerous little plastic cards in our
wallets.
The ones that get a lot of us into trouble every month!
'Cause we wind up paying this incredible interest for something we bought a
month ago and doesn't work anymore.
It's called ...
Sign On the Line
So many toys so little time
You got your share and I want mine
I'd love a trip to paradise
But I ain't got the cash to pay the price
Everytime I turn around
Someone's at my door
Who say's he's got the answer
I've been lookin' for
Sign on the Line!
Buy Now, Pay Later Sonny
Sign On The Line!
Don't worry 'bout a thing
Sign On The Line!
Go on, It's only money
Sign on the Line!
Go! Have your fling!
I want the high life on T.V.
Just like they do on Dynasty
To live a life fit for a king!
And have the best of everything
But everytime I save a Buck!
Someone's on my case
Wavin' pen and paper
Stick it in your face
Sign on the line ...
Been spending like a millionaire
On women, cars, a house in Belair
And all the things I can't resist
Now I've got handcuffs on my wrists
I said ""Judge, a man like me can't make a dime in jail.""
He said ""Son, use your credit card, so you can make your bail.""
Sign on the line
Just buy your freedom, Sonny
Sign on the Line!
And just walk on out of here
Sign on the Line!
Go on, It's only Money!
Sign on the line!
But don't you disappear! Ya hear!
Sign On The Line!",Sign on the Line,2000

John Kay,"I don't know why you moan and pout
All the world lies at your feet
Like a child you sit and wonder, 
Who's to blame for your defeat
I have tried to give you comfort
I have lent you a patient ear
Had I known why you're complaining, 
I'd have shown you trouble and fear

Gonna take you to the cliff side on a mountain so high
That when you look down, 
Lord you'll shake and tremble
Afraid to die, afraid to die
Gonna send you the devil when your nightmares arrive
Then when you wake up, 
Lord you'll feel glad to be alive, to be alive

I don't know why you moan and pout
All the world lies at your feet
Like a child you sit and wonder, who's to blame for your defeat
I have tried to give you comfort
I have lent you a patient ear
Had I known why you're complaining, I'd have shown you trouble and fear

That you might touch a helpless hand with some compassion
And learn to care, yes learn to care",To Be Alive,2001

John Kay,"Though I can't show you the years of my life
That I spend on the road to freedom
Don't let it throw you, I know of your strife
I know what it's like to roam
I sang 'em a glad song, played 'em a sad song
Sang 'em the whole night long
Just for a dollar or what they could offer
To somebody's ramblin' boy

When the fun was done, I would pack my bags and I was gone
Though the women were kind there was nothing to bind me to one
'Til somebody changed my rough and rowdy ways
Somebody changed my ole carousing days
Oh when I was a young boy I learned to survive
'Til somebody came and stayed my sportin' life

I lived in the barrooms the juke joints and gin mills
I worked any dive in town
Never to proud to pass my hat around
In every place I found
I'll sing you a glad song, play you a sad song
Sing 'em the whole night long
Just for a dollar or what you can offer
To somebody's ramblin' boy

There were times when lonely was the only feeling left in me
Or when the cold and the rain made it hard on a man to be free
'Till somebody changed my tough and hungry days
Somebody changed my rough and rowdy ways
Now I don't really care no more 'bout nickels and a dime
The one I love is all I need to help me spend my time
Somebody came and rolled away my stone
Somebody came, and she made me feel at home
Somebody changed my rough and rowdy ways
Somebody changed my ole carousing days
Oh when I was young boy I learned to stay alive
'Til somebody came and stayed my sportin' life

I'll sing you a glad song, play you a sad song
Sing 'em the whole night long

John Kay,"I like to dream yes, yes, right between my sound machine
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night
Any place it goes is right
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride
You don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me
Fantasy will set you free
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl
Let the sound take you away

Last night I held Aladdin's lamp
And so I wished that I could stay
Before the thing could answer me
Someone came and took the lamp away
I looked around, a lousy candle's all I found

Well, you don't know what we can find
Why don't you come with me little girl
On a magic carpet ride
Well, you don't know what we can see
Why don't you tell your dreams to me

And we carried him down the hollow
Where we laid his kind soul down to rest
Then we sang until the dawn just to him memory
And found these words to be his last requestâ?¦

When my time draws nigh stay near me
And when I die will you dance to my song
When I'm gone won't you come and cheer me
On my journey back home where I belong

Now how could he know
Just where he would go
And what did he see that made him run so free
And why do I feel, that's he's far away and right beside me still

In the night somebody touched me
And the sea rolled out his name
While I thought of all our times together
His echo keeps callin' back againâ?¦

When my time draws nigh stay near me
And when I die will you dance to my song
When I'm gone won't you come and cheer me
On my journey back home where I belong


And we carried him down the hollow
Where we laid his kind soul down to rest
Then we sang until the dawn just to him memory
And found these words to be his last requestâ?¦

When my time draws nigh stay near me
And when I die will you dance to my song
When I'm gone won't you come and cheer me

And when I die will you dance to my song
When I'm gone won't you come and cheer me

John Kay,"Words and Music by Alan O'Day

Well you are such an easy evil
Such a sensuous sin
Sometimes I don't know where I'm going
'Till I've been taken in

Such an easy evil
Such a promise of fun
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing
Till I'm done, you're a sneaky one

Here she comes now touching me, calling my name again
Here I go now, like a moth to a flame
I'm a sucker for you baby

Such an easy evil
Such a sensuous sin
Sometimes I don't know where I'm going
""Till I've been taken in
I've been taken in

",Easy Evil [Stereo],2015
John Kay,"Come and tell me, who stole your smile?
I wanna help you girl, to laugh a while
'Cause everybody feels the power sometimes
To heal with kind affection
Everybody's heart is troubled at times
In need of some protection

If I could only touch you
I know you'd like it
But every time I try to reach you
You run away frightened

Somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Somebody loves you
Just the way you are

Nobody knows just how long
Nobody knows just how strong
I've cared for you through all these years
You know I love you darlin'
But you don't wanna hear

'Cause everything I try to tell you
Goes in one ear and out the other
I can't quite put my finger on it
It seems you just don't bother",Somebody [Stereo],2015
John Kay,"I recall when they would say
No one lives for just one day
Don't save dreams that can't be sold
Don't chase rainbows, just their gold
Tried in their way, tried it mine
I won my race before my time
But golden trophies, fancy toys
Don't compare to childhood joys

Walk beside me darlin' come listen to the rain
And watch the rollin' water to ease your pain again
When night comes down to free us, and sorrow's finally gone
I long to hear your secret dreams and rock you in my arms

There lived a nation proud and free
It tried to show us harmony
But we stood much too close to see
To read the hand of destiny
I know a child who's only seen
A sunrise on the silver screen
She never watched the birds in flight
Or saw the dew by morning light

Walk beside me darlin', come hear the howlin' wind
He'll be a true companion, he'll listen like a friend
When night comes down to free us, your sorrow finally gone
I long to hear your secret dreams and rock in my arms",Walk Beside Me [Stereo],2015
John Kay,"The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me

Just trustin' you was my great sin
(Ya gotta trust in me, baby)
What can I do? You win again

This heart of mine, oh, I could never see
What everybody knows but me

Just trustin' you was my great sin

What can I do? You win again",You Win Again [Stereo],2015
John Kay & Sparrow,"At six a.m. this morning, oh the man knocked at my door
I screamed in his ear, I'm not the guy you're looking for
But got taken, I got taken just the same
When it comes to getting sleep at night
Oh I just can't seem to win

I went down to the zoo where I thought I might hide
There I met a friendly grizzly bear, who took me for a ride
And I got mangled, oh I got pushed all out of shape
When it comes to being sociable
Oh I just can't seem to win

While climbing up Mt. Everest to get away from all the noise
I slipped on a banana peel and almost got destroyed
And I was worried all the way down to the ground
When it comes to holding safety nets
Nobody seems to be around

When I put myself together I found that it was best
If I no longer tried to be just like all the rest
Because I'm twisted, yeah but that's the bag I'm in
When it comes to being normal
Oh I just can't seem to win

John Kay & Steppenwolf,"Good evening one and all, this is channel 24
Bringing you the latest news around the world
Down in Florida today, someone tried to get away
When he commandeered the train at Disney World
Until noon it was a standoff, but then he lost his luck
When someone shot him down, dressed up like Donald Duck
It was a midget G-man
And we're sorry that we could not show it live
But we'll have film of the shooting here at five
Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll
Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control
From Washington today, called a senator to say
That our future has been cancelled 'cause we're broke
We called the white house without end finally reached the President
Says he don't know if it's real or just a joke
And last night at the playoffs, things got pretty grim
They crucified the referee and tore him limb from limb
Ah, you should have been there
And in the weather, there's a hurricane in sight
And that's the way it is with us tonight
Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll
Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control
Seems like every single day another mind gets blown away
And the world goes just a little more insane
I got problems of my own, tryin' to keep my house and home
And I sure could stand some cheerful news again
My agent called to tell me my record's on the chart
It's number 90 with an anchor, I never said that it was art
I gotta eat too, ya know
And my buddy who still owes me for his bail
He says, ""don't worry, your check is in the mail""
Give me some news I can use, let me smile for a while
For the madness has taken it's toll
Give me some news I can use, just a break for the sake
Of my mind which is losing control",(Give Me) News I Can Use,1987

If the heart is a lonely hunter
Then the mind is a loaded gun
Sometimes it begins to wonder
If the love you seek is on the run
All day you've been thinkin' 'bout the coming night
It's the only time you really fear
It holds no tenderness
For you're alone in this wilderness

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

A rough night in the daily jungle
And it's tough times on the nightly news
Somehow you ignore the rumble
Of the heart that's shakin' in your shoes
""Someday"", you just keep on sayin'
""Someday, I will find a way to live my dream""
But there's no guarantee
Still, you got hope and your fantasy

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

Keep on dreaming, keep on scheming
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on hoping, keep on coping
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on believing, keep on achieving
Stay fast and young, your time will come

John Kay & Steppenwolf,"He was barely a man that morning when he got on that plane
In his pocket some music and pictures of home
A few days later he's lying in the jungle, beneath the pouring rain
Listening to songs of freedom, feeling scared and alone
Can anybody tell me why I'm here, where's the rhyme where's the reason
It's all so crazy, it's madness over here, just who are we fighting for
The guys back home, they're feelin' no pain, yeah, they're living and lovin'
While we are flyin', dancin' and dyin' in this rock 'n roll war.
Everything looked the same that morning, when he came home again
In his baggage some medals and memories of war
But he was different, changed forever and out of touch with time
Walking the streets of home, he felt lost and alone
Can anybody tell me where I am, I feel like a stranger
Some call me hero, some have called me names, some don't call anymore
I made it home, but I'm still in pain, I'm not livin' or lovin'
For I'm still flyin', fightin' and dyin' in that Rock n' Roll war
Tell everybody I feelin' better, It's been slow but I'm healing
Through mother earth and father time, I don't hurt like before
I love a good woman, we have a son, he's our joy, our salvation

John Kay & Steppenwolf,"Crossing the line in the dead of night
Five years old and on the run
This ain't no game, boy, don't make a sound 
And watch that man with the gun

Say a prayer for the ones we leave behind, say a prayer for us all
Come take my hand now and hold on tight
Take one last look at that wall

Think of the shattered lives, think of the broken hearts
Think of the battered dreams, of families still torn apart
Wall of bitter tears, wall of crying pain
Wall of chilling fear, you will never keep me here

For I, I shall crawl right down through that wall
I will crawl right on through that wall
That fateful night I was one that got away,
A young and restless renegade

Chasing my dreams, still on the run, 
I had some moments in the sun
Years flew by like a speeding bullet train, I sang my songs to one and all
Then came the day when I had a chance to pay 

My respects to the names on that wall
I saw the wooden crosses, saw the bloody stains
Saw the gruesome pictures of all the ones that died in vain
Wall of countless victims, wall of endless shame

Had just one thing gone wrong I might have joined that list of names
And I cried for all who died there at the wall
I recall weeping at the wall
""Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect,
But we've never had to put a wall up to keep our people in""

While the wall is the most obvious demonstration of the failures of communism, 
We take no pride in itâ?¦for it is an offense against humanity, separating families, 
Dividing husbands and wives, brothers and sisters and 
People who wish to be joined togetherâ?¦

All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin 
And therefore, as a free man I take pride in the words ""Ich bin ein Berliner"". 
(Excerpts from John F. Kennedy speech at the Berlin wall June 26, 1963) 
Turned on the news in November '89

I could not move, I could not speak
Something was burning up in my eyes,
Something wet ran down my cheek

All those laughing faces, all those tears of joy
All those warm embraces of men and women, girls and boys
Sisters and brothers dancing, all singing freedom's song
God, if only I could be there to shake your hands and sing along

Oh I, I would climb right up on that wall

Chasing the promise of freedom and hope
Came to this country to build a new vision
Far from the reaches of Kingdom and pope

Like good Christians some would burn the witches
Later some got slaves to gather riches

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands, to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

And once the ties with the crown had been broken
Westward in saddle and wagon it went
And till the railroad linked ocean to ocean
Many the lives which had come to an end

While we bullied, stole and bought a homeland
We began the slaughter of the red man

But still from near and far to seek America
They came by thousands to court the wild
But she just patiently smiled and bore a child
To be their spirit and guiding light

The Blue and Grey they stomped it
They kicked it just like a dog
And when the war was over
They stuffed it just like a hog

And though the past has its share of injustice
Kind was the spirit in many a way
But its protectors and friends have been sleeping
Now it's a monster and will not obey

The spirit was freedom and justice
And its keepers seemed generous and kind
Its leaders were supposed to serve the country
But now they won't pay it no mind

They babble about law and order
But it's all just an echo of what they've been told

If the heart is a lonely hunter
Then the mind is a loaded gun
Sometimes it begins to wonder
If the love you seek is on the run
All day you've been thinkin' 'bout the coming night
It's the only time you really fear
It holds no tenderness
For you're alone in this wilderness

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

A rough night in the daily jungle
And it's tough times on the nightly news
Somehow you ignore the rumble
Of the heart that's shakin' in your shoes
""Someday"", you just keep on sayin'
""Someday, I will find a way to live my dream""
But there's no guarantee
Still, you got hope and your fantasy

Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and believe in your chance to win
Hold on, never give up, never give in
Stay young and don't ever betray your dreams

Keep on dreaming, keep on scheming
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on hoping, keep on coping
Stay fast and young, your time will come
Keep on believing, keep on achieving

The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leave
But there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
And when I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for days

Someones on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someones got his finger on the button in some room

I asked for providence to smile upon me with his sweet face

And I do not feel the romance I will not be
(And I will not be a pawn for the prince of darkness any longer)

Maybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeve
Oh the cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder

Did you borrow the soul
The soul that you sell now?

Where are the demons
Of your desire?
Why does my love destroy you?

To a road that will only misguide you?

When I met a man who had his hand out.
So I gave him, gave him a dollar,
But as I walked away I heard him call out,

""Tell me Brother, can you see the sun
From where you're standin' now?
I've been up and I've been down,
But I've never been to this part of town.""

So I started thinkin' 'bout, this world we live in,
And about how far I've got my hand in.
Sometimes it seems that all we have, we have taken,
But maybe next time, won't be the forsaken.

Tell me Brother, can you see the sun
From where you're standin' now?
I've been up and I've been down,
But I've never been to this part of town.

So I went to see my girl, told her about my day.
She said, ""Life can be that way.
But don't give up, don't give up, no,
'Cause where there is love, there is hope.""

Wonderful teachers ready to teach me

I love the beauty of rare innocence

Don't fall for a magic wand

If it can never be

Little coquette, making fun of the one who loves you
Breaking hearts you are ruling

Someday you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you.
Maybe the one you love will just be fooling too.
And when you are alone with all your regrets, 
You know, my little coquette, I love you.

John Kirby Sextet,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2002

We were wild, wild boys on a wild weekend
We were down in the dumps and we didn't have to try hard
Our old town was just like a graveyard

We come around a corner and what do we hear
Oh rock and roll music coming loud and clear
The joint is jumping, no hesitation
We're all giving ourselves free invitation

Ah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party

So we crashed the party

There was Monks and Eddie, and Weasel and Freddy
There was the gang of four, we beat down the door

We did the alligator and the mashed potato
Oh, we cracked some heads and broke some hearts
Oh we crashed the party

We got in the cellar, or just about
We got right in but we couldn't get out
Weasel got stuck in the bathroom window
And pushing didn't do any good

Yeah, we crashed the party, oh, we crashed the party

Like a cowboy shooting badmen on the range
And nothing satisfies and the soul inside me dies
As I duck each punch and never risk the change

Time to see the sky
Time to close my eyes
Just to feel
Just be real

A chance to learn and grow
A place that I call home
A woman and child my own
Just for me
Just be free

A star to reach for
So little yet much more
Something I can really hold on to

A love I take with me
A hand to lead me

'Til you gave your heart
And all of your soul
I look at your face
And I see it all

Baby, you showed me
The meaning of love
You opened my eyes
You were patient and wise

Baby, you showed me
The meaning of love
You brought me this far
In all that you are
I see the meaning of love

So insecure
Afraid of mistakes
Knowing too well
The toll love can take

'Cause I stood with a storm
Raging inside
'Til you brought me in
Out of reach of my pride

",Amoroso [Variation 1 Bloo],1998

HOLDING THE HAND OF A DEAR FRIEND AS THEY TAKE THEIR LAST BREATH OF LIFE ON THIS EARTH,

John Klemmer,"This is insane
All you did was say hello
Speak my name
Feeling your love
Like a love I used to know
Long ago.

How can it be
You're a different space and time
Come to me.
Feel like I'm home
In a place I used to know
Long ago
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that I once knew
Is it you
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that might come true
Shining through

I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you
Deja vu
This is devine
I've been waiting all my life
Filling time
Looking for you
Nights were more than you could know
Long ago

Come to me now
We don't have to dream of love
We know how
Somewhere before
It's as if I've loved you so
So long ago
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that I once knew
Is it you
Deja vu -
Could you be the dream that might come true?
Shining through
I keep remembering me
I keep remembering you

I'VE BEEN LIVING ALL MY LIFE
LIVING JUST TO PLAY FOR YOU
PLAYING ALL THE WORDS
I COULD NEVER SAY
BUT THE MUSIC SAYS IT ALL
AND YOU KNOW THAT IT'S TRUE, YES YOU DO
THAT I HAVE TO PLAY THE WORDS
THAT I CAN'T SAY TO YOU

IT'S A LIFE HEARD THROUGH A HORN
IT ALL COMES FROM THE HEART, YOU SEE
AL THE WAYS YOU STAY
TOGETHER & A PART OF ME

ALL MY LIFE I'VE PLAYED FOR KEEPS
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO
I'VE PLAYED IT ALL FOR LOVE

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

I challenge you all
For all you own
And all you know

Reality the fantasy of youth
But living is a problem that
Is common to us all
With love the only
Common road to truth",Sympathy,2002
John Lawton,"We told our tales as we sat under
Morning's sleepy sky
With all the colors of
The sunrise shining in our eyes

One, then another
With a story of yesterday's life
Or of a lover who had
Gone in a moment of strife

No thought of sleep ever dwells
Upon the wise man's mind
Some task or audience
Stealing every moment of his time

Thus we have learned to live
While mortal men
Stand waiting to die
How can we do what must be done
In just one short life

And if you ask
Then you must know
If you still doubt
You should be told
It was not we
That made it so
It was by those
Who went before

And there you sit
Tomorrow's child
So full of love
So full of life
But you must rise
To meet the day
Lest you become another tale

Another tale",Tales,2002
John Lawton,"At the age of eighteen
I had had enough
And by twenty one
I decided to get tough
And then I found the guard
Was still too rough

And I've been hurt
Ever since that day
I've been hurt and I've lost my way
I still think I have a chance
To find your love

Well, I tried to love you
One day at a time
Each day waiting
Hoping for the sign
It was clear I needed luck
More than this time

And I've been hurt
Ever since that day
I've been hurt, well, I've lost my way
I still think I have a chance
To make you mine

My empty heart is
Counting all the ways
Fire and desire
Sat and count days
Will you, won't you
When and where
Do you, don't you, do I care
That same eternal question
Is always there
It's always there

John Lawton,"She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing in the mid-winter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me 
From a fight I could not win
Ah, ah, ah

She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men 
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of men or God
And I begged her give me horses 
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
Ah, ah, ah

But she would not think of battle that 
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she the mother of all men 
Had counciled me so wisely that
I feared to walk alone again 
And asked if she would stay
Ah, ah, ah

Oh, lady, lend your hand, I cried
Oh, let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust in me, she said and filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
I've no such misconceptions
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away
Ah, ah, ah

Thus having spoke she turned away 
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear
My labor is no easier 
But now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you 
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah",Lady in Black,2004

When we're sitting on the banks
of the sunshine
We hear your song
High above the living

Brother gull, see him soar the sky
He's so pleased to be
Buoyant and triumphant
On the raging sea
Backing nature, feeling free

Loving nature, rest your head
Hear the message, man is dead
See the cities fall
While Brother Bird still.... flies!

Brother Lark, see him wake the day
See him fly on by
Above the streets now empty
To his mournful cry

To a club called ""The Loser"", like a dog that's gone lame
Took the club elevator to the floor with a view
I took out life subscription, it's the only one they do 

I stepped out on the guard rail, saw the crowds slowly part
Heard a voice shouting ""Don't jump, please for God's sake let me move my car!""

Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had

Luda, listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowin' me and you got that mental telepathy
Meet me up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga bread, stay poppin' up like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella, we’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm, sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the thriller in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Than throw you on a grill
'Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal, for real

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had

Can we wait just a minute
Slow it down for a minute now baby
Your talkin' loud
Your wilding out
Don't seem like my old lady
Lets go and play the song we used to play
Can we reignite the flame
'Cause things just ain't the same

We can talk about the baby
We can talk until we're crazy
We can focus on it now
Or we can focus on it later
We can start another fight
We can argue and fuss all night
But I propose that we go to floor and we slow dance

Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with you man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move yea

Can we wait just a minute
Turn that TV off for a minute
Now politics and talkin' shit ain't really none of my business
Lets go and play the songs we used to play
On that old school radio
Let the music soothe your soul

Forget about the world
I'm groovin' with my girl
Forget about the news
Lets put on our dancin' shoes
Lets not talk about the war
Do we know what they fightin' for
I propose that we go to the floor and we slow dance

Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with you man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move, move
Move yea yea
Move yea yea

But now the rain clouds are lonely inside
They don't know how it feels to know how I feel
I try to escape from everything that is real

Hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation
Never out of time, somewhere in my mind
There's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing
Day by day creating in my imagination

The well has run dry of all my ideas
Silence so loud, have to cover my ears
I'm closing the door, it's hurting too much
I'm runnIng away from everything I can touch

To hide in my imagination, there is always magic waiting
Never counting time, always on my mind
There's a place that only I see, far away from all that I see
Inch by inch creating, in my imagination

I can stop it all from hurting

Asked me, ""How am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you,
'Cause I know what you're prone to do?""

Are you doing it again?
You said it would end, but here it goes again and again and again

Damn, I love you, but this is crazy
I have to fight you, almost daily
We break up so fast and we, we make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each other?
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, the pain begins
I come back, and we're doing it again

But she doing all of that for you
She got this, she got that
She's off the hizzle
I mean when you find one like that
You got to make that change man
Cause they don't come too often
And when they do come
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change
Like Sam Cooke say change gon' come nephew
And you better believe that

As I look back on all that I've done to you
My biggest regrets
The things that I never could do
I see the light now baby it's shining through
Gotta give up the game
Yeah I got some changin' to do

I won't get high if you want it
Get that straight
Nine to five if you want it
Keep my ass home at night if you want it
Whatever you need me to do

When you talk I'ma listen
Give you all that attention you missing
Girl I swear I'ma handle my business
Just like a real man should do

I can change
I can change (you know I can change baby)
I can change
For you (you know I can stop baby)
I can change (you know I change baby)
I can change
I can change
For you (you know I can stop baby)

I'll give up all the places I used to go
Stay out the club
Stay home because I'm with you
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know
They don't compare
Baby I swear it's the truth (you know it's the truth baby)

So I'm through with the women
Yeah that's right
I give up on the pimpin'
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin'
If that's what you want me to do

I'll get right if you want it
Go to church
Get baptized if you want it
Girl you opened my eyes and I'm gonna
Be much better for you

Baby believe me
Baby believe me

I can change (you know I can change baby)
I can change (know I can change baby)
I can change
For you
I can change
I can change
I can change
For you

[Snoop's Rap]
Take me to the river
And baptize my soul
I'm so outta control
Needing someone to hold
Man it's cold
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin'
I'm focused
Bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'

I'm trying to figure out a way
But I just don't know how to say
But I'm rearrangin'
Hopefully I'm changin'
And you can see that
Baby 'cause it's hard for me
Kinda sorta odd for me
But ain't nothing to it
If you need me to do it
I guess

I can change
I can change
I can change
For you (I'll give up on the pimpin' for you)
I can change
I can change

For you (sing it again why'all)

Gotta believe me (mmm yeah)

You know I can stop baby
Gotta believe me (believe me)
Gotta believe me (believe me yeah)

John Legend,"Girl, I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Passed the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
Seems like we argue everyday

I know I misbehaved and you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work but I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Baby we should take it slow
Take it slow, ohh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, ohh
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie love
No fairytale conclusion why'all
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances we take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Baby we should take it slow
Take it slow, ohh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, ohh
This time we'll take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe we'll never fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow, we'll never know
Baby you and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cause we're ordinary people
Baby we should take it slow
Take it slow, ohh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, ohh
This time we'll take it slow

People let me paint a picture
You know I ain't a Christian
I ain't a Muslim, ain't a Jew
I'm losing my religion
I speak to god directly
I know my god respect me
Cause he let me breathe his air and he really blessed me
I ain't knocking you, but I don't fuck with hospitals
Spit the gospel, truly knowing jesus like apostles do
Return like the prodigal son to honor Mohammed too
Stay away from ham like Abraham, Lord I follow you
Even when you took my man Chaka God and what I'm a do
You gave the hood a modern day martyr in Brother Amadou
I'm on the block, I'm tracing your footsteps, I keep the faith in you
Your love, plus hard work and ambition
We gonna make it through, my songs is psalms I'm spiritual when I'm lyrical
This is for my soldier niggas looking in the mirror who
Sitting home scratching off serials eating cereal
The way we find a way to survive, shit is a miracle
We got mice in the crib and roaches in the toasters, rice in the fridge
Bread in the oven by the roaster
We be takin' gypsy cabs and chasin' 50 bags
They be laced with shitty swag and it really get me mad
The way we saluting flags, wrapping them around our heads
When niggas ain't become American till 9/11
Feeling like you gotta sneak into heaven
When the reverend looking like a pimp and the pimp look like the reverend

Around my way
Around my way
All the corners filled with sorrow
All the streets are filled with pain
Around my way

These conditions make us strong
And we create our own businesses so later on
Our children have things in their name that they can say they own
A mix tape freestyle become your favorite song
No place like home when the cops ask you about your neighbors
Beat on you, threaten to incarcerate you
Till you spill your guts like you a Garcia Vega
We roll blunts not the papers
Cop the greatest take it coast to coast
L.A. to Chicago like Smooth Operators
Cop the Dro and cop the blacks
Cop the four, cock it back
Drop the flow, rock a hat on top a stocking cap
Be a doctor or a lawyer or make your momma a promise that
You'll finish school, but when you got a dream you gotta follow that
And make sure when you make it out the hood, you always holler back
Think about what you got from that
And always put your dollars back
On top of that, this is a legacy and we a part of that
The hood is where my heart is at
Catch me around my way

They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be telling derick, ""tell kara get us a show""
Little com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga wit dough
They say ""you ripped"" ""wow"" yea, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like jamie in ray
Painting a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye

Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they saying ""damn, yea snapped wit this beat!""
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did d'angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
If you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But god don't ever give me nothing I cant handle
So please don't ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messing with my health then

Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or isis
They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writing for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""we can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was mr. f
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""king"" like don, or frank white

And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are

We'll go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away yeah
Ooh this feels so crazy
Oh this love is blazing
Baby we're so high
Walking on cloud nine

(You've got me up so high) So high
(My shoes are scraping the sky) So high
(You've got me up so high) Oh

John Legend,"Question for the ages
What's going on with my back pages?
Rappers wanna be down, but listen listen
You got to feel it within your body and your spirit
When you listen to the rhythm (come on)
It's the abstract Will's on the beat
Women all around the globe, the world
You got to follow me
Change your history, categories
Different people in the same territories
Hip-hop in here for my Black Eyed Peas
So watch it watch it be marveled on the speakers please
'Cause they gonna marvel and shake the ground
Break addles break the sound
Fill the embraceful pound
Treat all the things profound
If you wanna dude to help you out
Make it cool around your friends without smoking now
Play the song kinda loud, it could help you out
And you could work it out, yeah you could work it out
It's like that, and a

And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
It's like that, like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Yeah we got it like that (like that)

It's like that 'Cause I got it like that
And I got it like that also
Got a style that's way out like Bosto
You know I'm a crook a nigga like Chocko
Steady jumpin' around like it's heavy cargo
(Can I kick it?) Yup, really far though
From El Segundo to Toronto
I once hit a girl up in Chicago
But I'd never say who unless my name was Tanto
Yup, you know how the date rape go
'Cause we show the classic example
Now they know the Peas collect the dough
So they knocking on our door like we was Fargo
Yup, they see me in a Will.I.Am suit
But I wasn't that cute when I didn't have the loot
And I don't smoke birds but I'm still real nice with the birds
So fuck (hey!) what you heard
'Cause we got it like that

And we got it like that (like that)
You know we got it like that (like that)
Y'all we got it like that (like that)

Talib, just hit 'em like that
I'm from the jungle, brother, and I got it like that
Yo, my life got me running through a maze like a white rat
I need a shot at ramming like my rap
It's like the yak is the fights that got me spillin' on the right track
And I like this Will so I might get ill
On the mics somebody might get killed
So many damn rappers there's a stifle in heaven
My tongue is a weapon and plus when I bust all this stuff with Legend
When this Brooklyn MC come after you
You be running like I herd a carrel at Murdell Avenue
There we yattin' that ain't pretty that's the attitude
To be at Fight Club, even Brad had to crack a tooth
Stare into the sun, they try to copy
Let your eyes get used to the light because you gotta watch me
Sneak up on you like sake
My lyrics get out a split atom like Hiroshima and Nagasaki

It's the Apl.De.Ap in the lab with the rap
Demonstrate how we act, we attack any track
It's the Black Eyed Peas and we back with the facts
Start with the fat skills that rose in the past
We got it like how you know how to beast rocks
Entertain you, see you soon at the next spot
The crew got you bouncing and dropping your eye
Making you
Tss tsss tsss, I'm a roll with the hot
I'm a flow from the soul when you can't hold me back
Ke-ke-keep on keep on rolling the track
I'm a simply simply always attach

These people are running off at the mouth
Trying to convince me that I'm running on empty
Trying to convince themselves that the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
And start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying to be bigger than the bickering
Bigger than the petty name calling
Under-the-breath talking
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today

You people are running off at the mouth
Trying to make me take myself off safety
Trying to make my friends turn their backs on the team we've built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complaining about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, same way that I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing
And start asking the names that I'm not saying
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention
You like the hype but pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away

Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe
Is anybody out there listening

All I really want I'll say again",High Road,2005

But when you come down, who will you call?

Whatcha gonna do when your money's blown
Your friends are gone and you're all alone
Now you barely hanging on with no one else to run to
You should know it won't make you whole
You gain the world but lose your soul
Spend your life in the search for dough
You'll find out it just won't save you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

You think that having money brings joy and peace to you
But the pursuit of it might bring out the beast in you
Chase the American Dream but can't face reality
That what you're chasing only lasts temporarily

You're so high now
You think you'll never fall
But when you come down, who will you call?

Before you ask me to get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars
Things we seen on the screen are not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas guns clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
And Jesus, and one day that she'll see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
Now my lil' cousin smokin' those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of the noun

Everybody´s leaving we´ll have some fun

Creep to the bedroom while your Mama´s out

I wanna kiss you underneath the stars

If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I´ll tell the world I´m in love any time
Let´s open up the blinds cause we really don´t mind

Ooh I don't care about the priority
Let´s break the rules and ignore society
Maybe our neighbor like to spy too
So what if they watch when we do what we do

Show that you're listening
Show me, that you love me
Show me that you walk with me

Sometimes the price of what you gave to me,
I can't stop questioning
Oh God of love, peace, and mercy, why so much suffering?
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
Wonder if you're listening

When people go, why do they go?
Why don't you choose me?
But someday I'll know that I'm gonna go
I hope you're waiting for me

Ever since I was a baby girl, I had a dream
Cinderella theme
Crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
But I would have to wait
Make so many mistakes
I couldn't comprehend
As I watched it unfold
This classic story told, I left it in the cold
Walking through un-open doors that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth
I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Mmm

I remember the beginning you already knew
I acted like a fool
Just trying to be cool
Frontin' like it didn't matter
I just ran away
Put on another face
Was lost in my own space
Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
I was scared to give up me
Afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the mess that I had made
Finally got out of my own way
I finally started living for today
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my mate has met my soul

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Mmm

Finally, finally

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have our differences

Now my life doesn't seem so bad

John Legend,"As I walk through
This wicked world
Searchin' for light in the darkness of insanity.
I ask myself
Is all hope lost?
Is there only pain and hatred, and misery?
And each time I feel like this inside,
There's one thing I want to know:
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?
And as I walked on
Through troubled times
My spirit gets so downhearted sometimes
So where are the strong
And who are the trusted?
And where is the harmony?
Sweet harmony.
'Cause each time I feel it slippin' away, just makes me want to cry.
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding? Ohhhh
What's so funny 'bout peace love & understanding?

Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka

Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears
Young kids where I'm from wear permanent tears

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at

And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy,

But I wish you the best, I guess.

They brought it all in anyway

I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down

Before you get into the shower,
Before you worry about your hair,
Baby give me one more hour,
I want you to stay right there,
I don't wanna lose a moment,
I don't wanna miss a kiss,
If I could plan the perfect day, love,
Then I would start it just like this

Good morning,

It's my favorite love song,
I waited all night long,
For morning,

Before we start the day dear,
I'm whispering in your ear,
Good morning.

Now baby how can I commence you,
I'll make it so you can't resist,
Whatever else you have to do now,
It can't be half as good as this,
I'll case you underneath the sheets, love,
And I won't let you get away,
The day won't be complete, love,
Unless we get a chance to say,

Open your eyes,
See my sunrise,
I feel your skin
So warm inside,
Day breaks so sweet,
When you're next to me,
So stay each night,
So each morning will be

You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kinda star
No I'm a comet, I just want you woman

Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl ""ooh he can get it"" admit it,
You did it let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin' we both going to where you livin'
Ha, I got you gigglin' like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket, I hope you are more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady so let me quit it

I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her

You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do

Why don't you give me (give me give me give me give me your love)
Give me your love (give me give me give me your love
Is that too much to ask you can I
Get some satisfaction from you

You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do (you do) you do",Satisfaction,2008

We danced and sing, somewhere in between heaven and hell
Gabrielle, that was her name
Everyone was smiling, even through their tears, under her spell
But in Gabrielle's eyes, nothing
I asked, ""Do you not like the music?""
She said, ""It's alright""
But she dances to her own side
So she says,

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby

Long as I'm there with you

I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream
Nightmares live where you live
Tears were in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall
I get the world to know a her smile is
I asked, ""do you dance with me now?""
Let me try to figure out
The fastest round out of town
And she says

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby

Oh oh yeah yeah yeah
I got a full tank of gas
Anywhere you wanna go, girl
All you have to do is ask girl
Oh, she said,

Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby

John Legend,"Ran into you yesterday
Memories rushed through my brain
It's starting to hit me
Now you're not with me
I realize I made a mistake
I thought that I needed some space
But I just let love go to waste
It's so crystal clear now
That I need you here now
I gotta get you back today

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
It's not like I planned it
Left empty handed
'Cause I'm still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight
Is there someone new now
What can I do now
'Cause I need you back by my side

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take the chance
This time I'll be your man
I can be all you need
This time it's all of me

Last time I wasn't sure
This time I will give you more
I'm more mature
I'll show you
Last time I didn't know
I messed up let her let you go
I need you, don't say no

Laying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Pick up the phone
Won't you come home

This time I want it all
This time I want it all
I' m showing you all the cards

John Legend,"First time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew
It was wrong to do
I guess that's why I was drawn to you
Second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time

I feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright
Fleeting joy and faded ecstasy
Here goes again, sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree
Sweet taste of sin

And I'm doing it again
Yes, I'm doing it again
Oh, I'm doing it again
I said it would end
But here it goes again

This time you told me you saw me at the same motel
You said you knew me well, and I had that familiar smell
Asked me, How am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you,
'Cause I know what you're prone to do?""
Accusations fly like bullets do
Here it goes again
Oh, you know me because you're doing it too
Cycle never ends, it never ends

Oh, you're doing it again
Yes, you're doing it again
Are you doing it again?
You said it would end, but here it goes again and again and again

Damn, I love you, but this is crazy
I have to fight you, almost daily
We break up so fast and we, we make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each other?
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, the pain begins
I come back, and we're doing it again

Yes, we're doing it again
Oh, we're doing it again
We said it would end
But here it goes again

Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Saying things'll change, you'll take away the pain
Then we flash back to the first time you put your spell on me
You envelop me, you feel good as hell to me
One moment leads to another few
Here it goes again
Leaving you is oh so hard to do
I just can't pretend, can't pretend

I keep doing it again
Oh, I'm doing it again
Yes, I'm doing it again
I said it would end
Oh, oh, oh

Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began
Before it here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand

There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong, you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go
Will I ever know?

It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat, and we can start to dance

Sometimes when we talking words
Drowned on by the sound
Let's get back to touch, and we'll get back on solid ground

Let's hold hands
Like a young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love
Like back way in the day?
We can lose control
Baby, don't say no

So will you come back to me?

Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you turn me on
Ooh, we'll take a visit to your Mama's house
Creep to the bedroom while your Mama's out
Maybe she will hear it when we scream and shout
And we will keep it rocking until she comes knocking

Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss u underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care
We just don't care
We just don't

Let's make love, let's go somewhere they might discover us
Let's get lost in lies
We just don't care
We just don't care
We just don't care

If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I'll tell the world I'm in love any time
Let's open up the blinds cause we really don't mind

Ooh I don't care about the priority
Let's break the rules and ignore society
Maybe our neighbor like to spy too
So what if they watch when we do what we do

Oh, let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care
We just don't care
We just don't

Say you'll be mine

Oh, I know I keep it burning right
If you stay, won't you stay, stay?

Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love, save a little
Save a little for me
Won't you save a little?
Save a little for me, oh

This just might hurt a little
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Don't be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side

Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see I can be all you need

People livin' like they ain't got no mamas

Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Badness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how a n**** works and operates
N**, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

Where is the love (The love)

The love, the love

It just ain't the same, always unchanged
New days are strange, is the world insane
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin'
in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love

Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' our own direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids act like what they see in the cinema
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness in equality
Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under

Hey , when I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came out from nothing , all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle, no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that, right or wrong, I'm a call it how I see it
Don't forget that impossible is nothing, you're environment is irrelevant
Just don't let your emotions over power your intelligent
Refuse to give up, your mistakes will define you
Down dictate where you heading, then remind you
That time keeps ticking, let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking, be aware of your decision
Be aware of the collisions
And the potholes hidin' in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission
Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken, 
If you live you could learn to just be patient

[Chorus]
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the places I go
And all the things that I know
Through all the highs and lows 
Cause life is like a slide show
And all the things that I've seen
And all the things that I've dreamed
You cant take away from me
Cause life is like a slide show

As I look back at a fly young cat
Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that
Beginnin' on Bankhead, then I spread out
Vision in my head, all I had to do is to get it out
When I walked out of my house, and look at my street
All I see is the opportunity that lead me to truancy
I ain't really have a roll model to influence me
Uncle Joink, said next year it's just gonna be you in it
As a juvenile caught cases so fluently 
Look at my life and learn from it, don't do it
If I only knew back then what I know now, 
How much better life it would have been if I slowed down
Maybe I have been Kanye, instead of seeing gun play
But god got a plan, I'll understand one day,
But one day of life like a snap shot is taken,
If you live you could learn to just be patient

[Chorus]

Looking back on my life time
See the slides go by
Time to wonder why
Looking back on where I've been
I remember when
You remember

Dr. King once said that the arc of amoral universe is long
But it bends towards justice, it bends towards justice
But here's the thing, it does not bend on its own
It bends because each of us, in our own ways put our hands on that arc
And we bend it in the direction of justice
Because we organize and we mobilize, we march, we vote",Pride (In the Name of Love),2008
John Legend,"[Chorus:]
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go through
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed

Let me talk to you, when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give ?
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See, every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you

[Chorus]

Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walking with me going through the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you

[Chorus]

I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of ? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you

You gave me rainbows and butterflies
We did enjoy our happiness?
When our love was over
I was such a mess

I smiled at you
And you smiled back
That's when I knew
There's no turning back
You said you loved me
And I did too
Now though it's over
I still love you

You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start

I tried to fight it
I tried so hard
And every day
I pray to god
That you and me were meant to be
But you had another
You had a lover

And now is gone
I don't know why
I feel like crying
Just want to die
I can't look at you
And you know why
No, I tried so hard

Yo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man, and I'm involved
But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by eight
With no time to be at work at nine
She'll be back by six, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of

I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it
Here take my keys, come upstairs in a minute

Let's stop faking, let's just go get naked
No more discussion, we can get to kiss and hugging
My premonition, told me I got what you're missing
So let's stop playing, baby girl, that's all I'm saying

Ancient wisdom, valuable like gifts of gold

I embark on life; my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can't crack
I understand the folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal

Uh, it's just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo

Free Lancer

Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors

All-black diamonds, times were hard
New Rolls Royce--guess you made it nigga
All-white neighborhood; you they favourite nigga

Just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairy tales
Go to hell; this is God engineering
This is Hail Mary pass; y'all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double check your appearance

Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing that I made it though the maze that I was in
Lord, forgive me; I never would've made it without sin
Holy water my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red hot; I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus piece flooded, but thou shall not covet
Keep your eyes off my cupboard; I'm a bad motherfucker

Never, never say
Never say Legend didn't go in (I'm-a go in)

Lord knows I've waited for this a life time
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or canceling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it

Before my time starts to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush; it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart--I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not be a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing; I refuse to make the same mistake

And who to blame, you to blame, me to blame
For the pain and it poured every time when it rained
Lets play the blame game

I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure

Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gon' for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely

Let's play the blame game, I love you, more
Let's play the blame game for sure
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, for sure

I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
No, I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much
I can't love you this much

And I know that you are somewhere doing your thing
And when the phone called it just ring and ring
You ain't pick up but your phone accidentally called me back
And I heard the whole thing

I heard the whole thing
Whole thing, whole thing, whole thing

Oh my God
Baby you done took this shit to the nother motherfuckin' level!
Now a neighborhood nigga
Like me ain't supposed to be gettin' no pussy like this
Goddamn, Goddamn! Who thought you how to get sexy for a nigga?
(Yeezy taught me)
You never use to talk dirty, but now you you goddamn disgusting
My, my God, where'd you learn that?
(Yeezy taught me)
Look at you, motheruckin' butt ass naked, with them, Jimmy Choos on
Who thought you how to put some Jimmy Choos on?
(Yeezy thought me)
Yo you took your pussy game up a whole 'nother level
This is some Cirque du Soleil pussy now shit!
You done went all porno on a nigga OK
And I, and I love it
And I thank you, I thank you, my dick thanks you!
How did you learn, how, how did your pussy game come up?
(Yeezy thought me)
I was fuckin' parts of your pussy I never fucked before
I was in there like ooh shit I never been here before
I've never even seen this part of pussy town before
It's like you got this shit re-upholstered or some shit
Who the fuck happened?
Who, who the fuck got your pussy all re-upholstered?
(Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy)
You know what, I got to thank Yeezy
And when I see that nigga I'ma thank him
I'ma buy his album
I'ma download that motherfucker I'ma shoot a bootlegger!
That's how good I feel about this nigga
Ahh, I still can't believe you got me this watch
This motherfucker is the exact motherfucker I wanted!
You went to bezel! This is the motherfucker I wanted
I saw this, I saw it
Twista had this shit on in The Source
I remember! Twista had this on in The Source
That's right, that's right!
Yo yo babe, yo yo this is the best birthday ever!
Where you learn to treat a nigga like this?

Me querendo, procurando
Não sei não eu vou me apaixonar
Eu não tava nem pensando
Mas você foi me pegando
E agora não importa onde vá

Com você é bom qualquer lugar

You go with me, you want me
Can't help myself I gotta be in love
I wasn't even thinking
And now you got me sinking
I need you baby, I can't get enough
You got me
That's where I'll always be
I know you see me just the way I am
But just think of me
What you want me to be
I know you found the moment that we met
It's giving me a love I won't forget

John Legend,"In this proud land we grew up strong*
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail

No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose

Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not beaten yet
Don't give up
I know you can make it good

Though I saw it all around
Never thought I could be affected
Thought that we'd be the last to go
It is so strange the way things turn

Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground

Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up
We don't need much of anything
Don't give up
'Cause somewhere there's a place
Where we belong

Rest your head
You worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough
You can fall back on us
Don't give up
Please don't give up

Got to walk out of here
I can't take anymore
Going to stand on that bridge
Keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come
And whatever may go
That river's flowing
That river's flowing

Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs

Don't give up
'Cause you have friends
Don't give up
You're not the only one
Don't give up
No reason to be ashamed
Don't give up
You still have us
Don't give up now
We're proud of who you are
Don't give up
You know it's never been easy
Don't give up

There's a place where we belong",Don't Give Up,2010

Now it's victory

I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss

Oh, victory (Victory)
(Nasir!)

Speedboats, three tokes and pass it
Grass lit, hittin' slopes in Aspen
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough 'til we back to ashes
Driven in fly sedans to the M-G-M Grand
Picture lots of sand, two blonds, implants
Remy in hand, we tryna tan, deal my cards with an honest hand
A modest man, aware of any counter-scam
Palm trees, magnum Don P's, L-V monograms
Hottest girls flew from Rio
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido
Sex so strong, without the E though
Hollow threats, we don't see those
Higher death toll whenever we roll
That process is pivotal
My pitiful poverty-struck criminals will get a Jew
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house
'Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out
Contemplatin', there is no bond with Satan
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin
For my hustlers, here's some motivation
He who has begun is half done, why you waitin'?
I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress
It's too much paper to rest, fuck around, you face death
I know some niggas from Astoria
That'll cut your daughter up
Like I used to cut a quarter up
Makin' all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks
Kill all you fucks, easy
I be on the golf cart, sleepy
Y'all beneath me
Y'all be at the pawn shop, pawnin' watches
Obnoxious, can't stop us, we shottas
Say you killin' Pablo? Impossible
Nonsense, preposterous, bizarre at best
Unfulfilled promises
I feel intelligence is my wealth
However, how enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers
See me at the Oscars, lookin' dreamy, hood opulent
Means esoteric, how I wore it
Exoticness makes you curious to see how serious my closet is
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit
Niggas actin' thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit
