Nat King Cole Trio,"I've been looking for a playmate
Someone on whom I can depend
This must be my lucky day, mate
'Cause you're the kind I wanted
And I'll stick right to the end

Oh, I wanna be a friend of yours
And a little bit more
I wanna be a pal of yours
And a little bit more

I wanna be your buddy, buddy
Though the road be smooth or muddy
I wanna be a friend of yours
And a little bit, and a little bit, and a little bit more

I wanna be a pal of yours
You bet I do
I'll stick around and see you through
Stick even tighter than glue

I'll greet you with a cheerful howdy
Though the skies are clear or cloudy
I wanna be a friend of yours
And a little bit, and a little bit, and a little bit more

Nat King Cole Trio,"I never lost my heart while stealing a glance
Taking a chance, try and romance
But when your eyes hang off that danger sign
Ooh, kickaroonie

I never had a yearn for making a date
Leaving at eight, staying out late
But when you put your sweet, sweet lips to mine
Ooh, kickaroonie

This is one time I can't say
It's just one of those things
Since my heart spends all its time
Tied to your apron strings

I never had a yearn for taking your arm
Holding your charm, buying a farm
But when you put your sweet, sweet lips to mine
Ooh, kickaroonie

This is one time I can't say
It's just one of those things
Since my heart spends all it's time
Tied to your apron string

I never had a yearn for taking your arm
Holding your charm, buying a farm
But when you put your sweet, sweet lips to mine
Ooh, kickaroonie
Ooh, kickaroonie, that's all

Nat King Cole Trio,"You look at me and wonder
You look at me and doubt
Darling, your eyes are asking
""Will the flame burn out?""

No one is sure of sunshine
No one is sure of dawn
But I am sure
My love will live on and on!

I'll be tired of you
When stars are tired of gleaming
When I am tired of dreaming
Then I'll be tired of you!

This I know is true
When winds are tired of blowing
When grass is tired of growing
Then I'll be tired of you

Beyond the years till day is night
Till wrong is right, till birds refuse to sing
Beyond the years the echo of my only love
Will still be whispering, whispering!

If my throbbing heart
Should ever start repeating
That it is tired of beating
Then I'll be tired of you!",Then I'll Be Tired of You,2005
Nat King Cole Trio,"At last my dream's come true
Today he said ""I do.""
Friends said it couldn't be done
But all his love I know I've won
Cause third finger, left hand
That's where he placed the wedding band

He walked right up to me
And pledged his love for me
I longed to hear him say
The sweet words he spoked that day
Made me feel so good inside
Til tears came to my eyes
I love him above the rest
Cause in my book, he's the best

Cause he did something 
That no one else did
Friends said it couldn't be done
But all his love, I know I've won
Cause third finger, left hand
That's where he placed the wedding band

His words were a precious few.
That moment on, my heart knew.
That no other boys in line
Could ever change my mind
Other boys I've sent away
I locked my hear til our wedding day
I love him above the rest
Cause in my book, he's the best

Cause he did something 
That no one else did
Friends said it couldn't be done
But all his love, I know I've won

Tonight I'll serve a supper, 
We'll eat some food that's rare. 
And at the head of the table, 
I'll place brother Henry's chair-
Invite all the local big dogs,
 We'll laugh and talk and eat, 
But we'll' save the bones for Henry Jones, 
‘cause he don't eat no meat- 

Today I'll go to market- 
and buy a lot of fish, 
That will thrill Brother Henry, 
Because that's his special dish.- 
Get a large can of molasses,
 so we'll have something sweet, 
But save the bones for Henry Jones, 
“cause he don't eat no meat. 

Henry is not a drinker, 
he rarely takes a nip, 
He don't need a napkin, 
‘cause the things he eats don't drip. 
One day we had a banquet, 
It really was a bake, 
They started off with some short ribs,
 they finished off with a steak. 
But when the feat was over, 
brother henry just kept his seat, 
and we served the bones to Henry Jones,
 ‘cause he don't eat no meat. 
To- he don't eat no meat.

Mixin' up love with arguments.
So meet me at no special place,

I'm all fed up on stormy weather,
I'm going where it's June.
Here's hopin' I see you never

Now that I've put my heart on ice,
Missing you will seem paradise.
So meet me at no special place,
And I'll be there at no particular time.

You'd better bring along your glasses
In case I'm hard to find,
You'll wish you could see before you
As clearly as you can see behind.

You can turn back in retrospect
Of the times you stuck out your neck.
So meet me at no special place, 
And I'll be there at no particular time.

All we do is make up
Then quarrel all over again,
But this is it ~ the breakup

Baby, baby, what is the matter with you?
You got the world in a jug

'cause when I'm always with you
I get the third degree

That ain't right
Baby, that ain't right at all

Nat King Cole Trio,"He just got here yesterday,
Things are hot here now they say,
There's a new gal in town.
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt. 
All the guys just rave about
Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say

No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown. 

All you gals will get the blues, 
All you pals will surely lose.
And, there's but one excuse.
Now I've told you who she was, 
And I've told you what she does,
Still, give this gal her dues.
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere 
 
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.

And always wear a smile,

An old music master sat composing a tune,
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy,
When right out of nowhere stepped a little colored boy.

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played
On the Happy Cat Hit Parade.

You better tell your friend Beethoven,
And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Long about nineteen seventeen
Jazz'll come upon the scene,
Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.

The old music master simply sat there amazed,
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.

He hit a chord that rocked the spinet
And disappeared into the infinite,
And up until the present day,
You can take it from me,

Another groom, 
Another sunny honeymoon,
Another season,
Another reason
For making whoopee.

Somebody makes good wages.
Somebody wants her share.

She calls him 'Toodles' and rolls her eyes.
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies.
What is it all for?
It's so he'll fall for making whoopee.

What's this I hear?
Well, can't you guess?

He says he's busy.

Says, ""You'll pay six to her.""

Nat Shilkret and the Victor Orchestra,"Every time I hear that dear old wedding march
I feel rather glad I have a broken arch.
I have heard a lot of people talk
And I know that marriage is a long long walk.

To most people weddings mean romance
But I prefer a picnic or a dance.

Another bride,
Another groom, 
Another sunny honeymoon,
Another season,
Another reason
For making whoopee.

The chorus sings, ""Here comes the bride.""
Another victim is by her side.
He's lost his reason cause it's the season 
For making whoopee.

Down through the countless ages
You'll find it everywhere.
Somebody makes good wages.
Somebody wants her share.

She calls him 'Toodles' and rolls her eyes.
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies.
What is it all for?
It's so he'll fall for making whoopee.

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear?
Well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected so he's suspected
Of making whoopee.

She sits alone most every night.
He doesn't phone or even write.
He says he's busy.
But she says, ""Is he?""
He's making whoopee.

He doesn't make much money: 
Five thousand dollars per.
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, ""You'll pay six to her.""

He says, ""Now judge, suppose I fail?""
The judge says, ""Budge right into jail.""
You better keep her.
You'll find it's cheaper
Than making whoopee.",Makin' Whoopee,

Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood

And slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower

Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years

I ran all the way
I remember knocking twice and waiting for the moment till she came
And then I saw a rose in her the kind of rose that you can throw in summer rain
She smiled that little smile she has and asked me if I could start right away
And that was ten short years ago
Neither of us could have known that I'd come to stay
Now I'm the gardener for her roses I love and care for her tender roses
Now I'm the gardener for her roses that bloom today out where our children play

I can still remember when a park bench was the only home I had
And it's much better being here she can call me dear and children call me dad

A poor little baby child is born in the Ghetto and his mama cries
'Cause there's one thing that she don't need
Is another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto

He'll grow to be an angry young man someday
Take a look at you and me are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way while the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a running nose
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto and his hunger burns 
So he starts to roam the streets of night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
Then one night in desperation the young man breaks away
He buys a gun steals a car tries to run but he don't get far and his mama cries
As a crowd gathers round and the angry young man
Paces down the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto and as her young man dies

And found my cleanest dirty shirt

With cigarettes and songs

Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Caught the sunday smell

With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song

Nat Stuckey,"Take time to love her for days at home and nights alone
Are the kind of the things that she can't understand
Take time to love her or someone else who has more time
Will come along and take her off your hands

When's the last time you took her out and danced with her till morning
And set her pretty roses the way you used to do
There was a time when you took time to show her she was wanted
But have you show her lately how much she means to you
Take time to love her...

How long since you called her up without a special reason
And told her that you thought of her cause love was on your mind
How long since you bought her gifts when there was no occasion
To let her know that her love grows sweeter all the time
Take time to love her...",Take Time to Love Her,2006

If you're not in my arms then you're too far away
And when you're far away I'd get the blues
[ Connie ]
You're the first thing I think of at the dawn of day
And the last thing that I'll ever want to lose
[ Nat ]
Oh I start to weak all over when you're out of my sight
And I know till your return I won't feel better
[ Connie ]
So keep on loving me the way you do
[ Nat ]
Just as long as you want me to
[ Both ]
And we'll always be together
[ Connie ]
At times I know my feet don't even touch the ground
And it's because of you I feel this way
[ Nat ]
Hmm there's not a thing that I can think of that can keep me down
Just as long as I can see you every day
[ Connie ]
I've heard 'em say that true nearly always fades
Ah but we know something they don't we know better
[ Nat ]
So keep on loving me the way you do
[ Connie ]
Just as long as you want me to
[ Both ]
And we'll always be together

Nat Stuckey,"If there's a chance that your heart misses the words I try to say with kisses
If I don't seem to be as happy as I should
I wouldn't want to live without you I love everything about you

Yes even the bad times are good

Oh your middle name should be perfection cause that's what you are to me
Even in my darkest moments you made it easier to see
I wouldn't change one thing about you if I knew that I could

Yes even the bad times are good

You never let me feel mistreated your love is all I ever needed

When I was weak somehow you always understood
We're not afraid of stormy weather

Nat Stuckey,"Don't get no attention from the people on the street
But they don't even see us they just step right on our feet
Just two unnoticed people in this great big world are we
And when I think about it yes that's all we'll ever be

But I got you and you got me and if they look they can see that we don't care
'Cause honey I've got you and you've got me
And baby that's all we will ever need

Looking through the window of a fancy diamond store
Going window shopping for the things we can't afford
Well there's people all around us with their noses in the air

I'll share my world with you everything that I own
My earthly possessions there's no good if I'm alone
Let me bring you the sunshine when it's fresh with morning dew
[ Both ]
Can't you see that I'm waiting to share my world with you

I'll share my world with you if you'll be mine alone

Let me give you my two arms they'll be happy if you do

I remember when you said with this ring I Thee wed
Now you've gone betrayed my trust rings of gold have turned to rust
Tears can't wash away the sin love that's dead can't live again
Knowing there's no hope for us turns these rings of gold to rust
Plans we made just yesterday sands of time had chipped away
Now they've crumbled into dust rings of gold have turned to rust
[ guitar - steel ]
Love before was clean and pure never more can I be sure
You will not betray mu trust rings of gold have turned to rust

Nat Stuckey,"There's something pretty in a summer rainbow there not just colors anymore

And there's something pretty in the way the stars flow something I never saw before

There's so many pretty things the whole world looks new

I never saw the sun until I fell in love with you

And now there's something pretty in the side old moonlight

Or did it always blow that way

'Cause there's something pretty in the same old tonight

Something pretty everywhere today

There's so many pretty things

Stand beside me stand beside me you're the only one who ever made me care
[ Connie ]
I can't stand to think that I might be alone
No alone again like the way it was back then
Before you walked into my heart and told me we would never part
So stand beside be don't ever let me be alone again

Stand beside me stand beside me for if I should lose you I just couldn't get anywhere
Stand beside me stand beside me you're the only one who ever made me care
[ Nat ]
Oh there'll be times when everything goes wrong
But darlin' I won't care if I know you're standing there
No matter what we have to do together we can see it through
So stand beside me and I'll be standing right there next to you

So many things to see in this old world but all I can see is you
[ Connie ]
In a crowded subway train walkiin' in the country rain you're there with me too
[ Nat ]
All of the songs sung in any day your voice is all I hear
[ Connie ]
Though each song has its own place finished quickly fades away I hear you everywhere
[ Nat ]
And though I know you want me pleased with everything I do
[ Connie ]
Honey I can find the way to open look what I don't like about you
[ Nat ]
Well it's been said many times that we are by ourselves and each man is on his own
[ Connie ]
I don't care that may be true I just wanna be with you

Together alone
And though I know you want me...

Nat Stuckey,"May the fruit of my toil be yours love and may the food from my soil be yours love

And from this moment on may a love that is strong and lives on and on be yours love
May the sons that I raise be yours love may the comforts I praise be yours love

And if I ever get weak may the love words I speak
And the arms that I seek be yours love

May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love

And from this moment on may a love true and strong and lives on and on be yours love

May the Lord's shining grace be yours love may the happiest face be yours love
And may the last fingertips that touch these two lips
As life from me slips be yours love",Yours Love,2012
