Valerie Day,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,2003
Valerie Day,"(Hey Michael, come on and swing)
(Looks like you got the world on a string)

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
Got that string around my finger
What a world, what a life; I'm in love

I've got a song that I sing
And I can make the rain go
Any time I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see? I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I've got that string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let you go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on the rainbow
I've got that string around my finger
Oh, what a world, what a life; I'm in love

Life's a wonderful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a crazy so-and-so
If I should ever let her go

I've got the world on a string
I'm sitting on a rainbow
I got that string around my finger

Oh, what a world, what a life
Oh, what a world, what a life
What a world, what a life 'cause I'm in love
(He's in love, he's in love)

I'm in love
(Got the world on a string)
And what a wonderful thing
(All right)
When you get the world (Uh huh) on a string",I've Got the World on a String,2003
Valerie Day,"It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
(doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah
Doo wah, doo wah, doo wah, doo wah)
It makes no diff'rence 
If it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm

Valerie Day,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,2003
Valerie Day,"I can only give you love that lasts forever,
And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.
If you're wond'ring what I'm asking in return, dear,
You'll be glad to know that my demands are small.
Say it's me that you'll adore for now and ever more, that's all, that's all.",That's All,2003
Valerie de la Cruz,"We can't play this game anymore, but
Can we still be friends?
Things just can't go on like before, but
Can we still be friends?

We had something to learn
Now it's time for the wheel to turn
Things are said one by one
Before you know it's all gone

Let's admit we made a mistake, but
Can we still be friends?
Heartbreak's never easy to take, but
Can we still be friends?

It's a strange sad affair
Sometimes seems like we just don't care
Don't waste time feeling hurt
We've been through hell together

La la la la, la la la la
Can we still be friends?
Can we still get together sometime?

We awoke from our dream
Things are not always what they seem
Memories linger on
It's like a sweet sad old song",Can We Still Be Friends?,1998
Valerie de la Cruz,"When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep you head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at you door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there

Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold
They'll hurt you, and desert you
And take your soul if you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend
You've got a friend

Ain't it good to know you've got a friend
Ain't it good to know you've got a friend",You've Got a Friend,1998
Valerie de la Cruz,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2009
Valerie Dore,"So many things we have
Why don't you stay with me tonight?
I'm trying to discover you
Together again for all the night.

There's something going on right now
Feelin' happy
Feel the moon.
Let's get closer

Baby
'Cause we're dance and dance.
All my friends are talking to me

Valerie Dore,"I can see you standing here alone
Man in armour looking at the dawn.
Shadows now cross your eyes
Who is on your mind
My young Lord?
You are known as Lancelot Of The Lake
Man with strength that nobody can break
You're the Kingdom's pride
Fortune's on your side again.
You are riding across the land fighting for your lady
Holding so tight her silver sword.
She is so beautiful dancing among the maidens
But will she ever free your heart?
Riding over mountains - loving in the night -
Dancing near the mountains
Holding a graceful lady.
Hiding in a castle - living in a dream -
Fighting for your love one
Lancelot.
Dream you hold the woman in your arms
You have nothing still to shield your heart.
I know beauty can win the bravest men forever.
You shall try to forget the dame
Fighting the mighty battles
Until the night will make you dream.
And your courage will bring you fame
Inside the courts and castles.
Minstrels will sing it to your queen.
Riding over mountains - Loving in the night - . . .
Riding over mountains - Loving in the night - . ..
And now when the music will end
Will she turn and forget
Will she cry?
Will you still be fighting the wind now
And dreaming your love in the night?
Holding a graceful lady - Lancelot -
Holding a graceful lady - Lancelot.

But why I loved you I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you

And oh, ah, whoa, the pain you put me through
You don't care 'bout my love for you, huh
But I found a reason for livin'
And I'm through with cryin' over you

Valerie Giglio,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,
Valerie Giglio,"There is no greater love
Than what I feel for you
No greater love,
No heart so true

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing to me

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known
And to think that
You are mine alone.

There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you

You're the sweetest thing
I have ever known,

You are mine alone.

That music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die

And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck

In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lennon read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark

The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast

It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin'

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away

I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets the children screamed
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And they were singing

Bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die

Non resto qui, ossessionato dall'ipotesi.
Io mi rifiuto di soccombere,
Non credere sia facile mollare tutto è così.

Il tempo guarisce, rimargina, muore diceva quel viso,
Che freddo rimase a guardare la soglia del suo paradiso.

Lasciandomi solo a fissare o un specchio
Che non fa più male.
Me ne andrò libero dai tuoi rimpianti,
Freddissimo amore.

Non resto qui ossessionato dall'ipotesi.
Io mi rifiuto di amarti in un modo
Che non mi appartiene, che non ci fa bene.
Non resto qui, ossessionato dall'ipotesi.
Io mi rifiuto di soccombere,
Non credere sia facile mollare tutto è così.

Freddo come l'aria, assente ormai vuota di emozioni,
Brividi e di noi.
Dissolverò quel mio ricordo di te, svanirai.

Non resto qui ossessionato dall'ipotesi.
Io mi rifiuto di soccombere,
Non credere sia facile mollare tutto è così",Parole di cristallo,2014
Valerio Scanu,"Addormentarsi qui per poi sognare altrove
Provare a essere quello che non si è
Accontentarsi sì di sopravvivere
Centimetri di vita che non godi mai
A cosa servirebbe restare fermi qui
Analizzare tutti i sintomi di questo silenzio
Molto più stupidi di chi va via
Con la speranza di incontrarsi ancora

Perché siamo liberi di tornare sui nostri passi
Pianificare di nuovo il percorso, passare attraverso
Milioni di cuori o restare da soli per sempre
Per sempre, per sempre

Invulnerabili, lo sguardo immobile
Travolti dall’indifferenza, pronti per la fuga
E non si asciuga mai, piove bisogno d’amore
E speranza di salvarsi ancora, ancora, ancora

Perché siamo liberi di tornare sui nostri passi
Pianificare di nuovo il percorso, passare attraverso
Milioni di cuori o restare da soli
Liberi di tornare sui nostri passi
E rimanere noi stessi per sempre
Salvare l’anima dai rimorsi e
Senza troppi discorsi tornare indietro
Tornare indietro, tornare indietro

Quindi cosa importa se proprio devi andare
Il mare porta via con sé ma spesso sa anche riconsegnare
Riportare a casa cose che hai perso da tempo
E tempo ce n’è, tempo ce n’è

Perché siamo liberi di tornare sui nostri passi
Pianificare di nuovo il percorso, passare attraverso
Milioni di cuori o restare da soli
Liberi di tornare sui nostri passi
E rimanere noi stessi per sempre
Salvare l’anima dai rimorsi e
Perché siamo liberi

Perché siamo liberi

Di tornare indietro, tornare indietro

Accanto un cuscino al tuo posto perché
Il caffè in un miraggio di zucchero amaro
Mi uccide il pensiero e il mio dolce di te

Time be my friend

I don't know but I want you back 
So just tell me why? 
I really want to know 

No way, I'll never let you go 
No I am with you 'til the end 
Just bring back the old you once again
I never will forget those words from your mouth that I once heard 
You don't know how much they hurt 
You told me you could care no more 
For something you used to live for 
This can't be happening to you 
So make up your mind there's not much time 
The answer is waiting for you

I look back at what I've known for so long
Today is the day we leave our past behind

Held close by until the day that I die
Good luck my friends make it to the end
I wish you all the best until we meet again
I can't believe it seems like yesterday
Just kids and now it's time to grow up
That thought makes me feel sick now I want to cry
Separated for the rest of our lives
I don't know why it turned out this way
We always thought things would work out OK
Now I see everybody telling me what I must be
When all I want to do is go back in time with you

With my best friend

Vampiros,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

There was Hannah pouring water on a drownding man!

Van Canto,"I am the man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
And when the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you run your fingers down the wall?
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark

Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklores
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there

And when I'm walking a dark road
I am the man who walks alone

Van Canto,"Cold sweat dreaming, am I awake? I feel drained
With fevered screaming, my thoughts, they break, I am pained
Lights are flickering down the wall and my eyes, they burn
An angel's voice then starts to talk, hypnotized, my head I turn

I have started many miles away
To find our hero and to finally lead him astray

Oh, is it me they call hero?
Oh, is it me they await?
Oh, is it me they call hero?
Heroes are there to change fate

Wheezing winds slit my ears, it's hard to breathe
My eyes, they water, my eyelids hurt, it's hard to see
Try to figure out the way, I am flying
What's this journey all about? Again the angel heaves a sigh

I have started many miles away
To find our hero and to finally lead him astray

Oh, is it me they call hero?
Oh, is it me they await?
Oh, is it me they call hero?
Heroes are there to change fate

Yeah, it is me they call hero
Yeah, it is me they await

What are you doing the rest of your life?
North and South and East and West of your life
I have only one request of your life
That you spend it all with me

All the nickels and the dimes of your days

All begin and end with me

Water-baby black eyes stare
From my ceiling:
You who I now truly know...

Now I cannot see too clearly
And already my trellis stands bare...
How can I break free of these over clinging
Arms which entwine and enfold me?... And reach

To the clear blue sea?

disappearing to a darker night,
doomed to vanish in a living death, living anti-matter,
anti-breath

no people around, no-one to touch.

I am the lost one,

Minds stumbling strong, we hurtle on
Into the dark portal

Into the unknown maw
And as the Elders beat their brows
They know that it is really far too late now to stop us

What is the point in catching breath? Expel it!

Still waiting for my saviour,
storms tear me limb from limb;
my fingers feel like seaweed...
I'm so far out I'm too far in.
I am a lonely man, my solitude is true
my eyes have borne stark witness
and now my nights are numbered, too.
I've seen the smiles on dead hands,
the stars shine, but they're not for me.

I prophesy disaster and then I count the cost...
I shine but, shining, dying,
I know that I am almost lost.
On the table lies blank paper
and my tower is built on stone
I only have blunt scissors,
I only have the bluntest home...
I've been the witness, and the seal of death
lingers in the molten wax that is my head.

of sailing-ship spars sinking low

of all the ancients myths

No time now for contrition:
the time for that's long past.
The walls are thin as tissue and
if I talk I'll crack the glass.
So I only think on how it might have been,
locked in silent monologue, in silent scream.

I'm much too tired to speak
and, as the waves crash on the bleak
stones of the tower, I start to freak
and find that I am overcome...

S.H.M.
'Unreal, unreal' ghost helmsmen scream
and fall in through the sky,
not breaking through my seagull shrieks...
no breaks until I die:
the spectres scratch on window-slits -
hollowed faces and mindless grins
only intent on destroying what they've lost.

I crawl the wall till steepness ends
in the vertical fall;
my pain has sailed into the sea:
no joking hopes at dawn.
White bone shine in the iron-jaw mask
lost mastheads pierce the freezing dark
and parallel my isolated tower...
no paraffin for the flame
no harbour left to gain.

Would you catch the final words of mine?
Would you catch my words?
I know that there's no time
I know that there's no rhyme...
false signs find me
I don't want to hate,
I just want to grow;
why can't I let me
live and be free?
but I die very slowly alone.
I know more ways,
I am so afraid,
myself won't let me
just be myself
and so I am completely alone...

The maelstrom of my memory
is a vampire and it feeds on me
now, staggering madly, over the brink I fall.

Lighthouses might house the key
but can I reach the door?

I want to walk on the sea
so that I may better find a shore...
but how can I ever keep my feet dry?
I scan the horizon
I must keep my eyes on all parts of me.

Looking back on the years
it seems that I have lost my way:
Like a dog in the night, I have run to a manger
now I am the stranger I stay in.
All of the grief I have seen
leaves me chasing solitary peace;
But I hold experience in my head...
I'm too close to the light
I don't think I see right, for I blind me...

The Clot Thickens
Where is the God that guides my hand?
How can the hands of others reach me?
When will I find what I grope for?
Who is going to teach me?
I am me / me are we / we can't see
any way out of here.
Crashing sea - a trophied history:
Chance has lost my Guinevere...

I don't want to be one wave in the water
But sea will drag me deep

but I know I'm just a man;
Do I join or do I founder?
Which can is the best I may?

He looks into the future and remembers what is past,
Wonders what he's doing on this battlefield,
Shrugs to his shadow, impatient, too proud yet to kneel.

In his wake he leaves scorched earth and work in vain;
Smoke drifts up behind him, he is free again,
Free to run before the onslaught of a deadly foe,
Leaving nothing fit for pillage, hardly leaving home.
It's far too late to turn, unless it's to stone.
Charging madly forward, tracks across the snow,
Wind screams madness to him, ever on he goes

Too soon by far to falter.

Surrounded, but striving through will and fear.
Ahead of him he knows there waits an ambuscade

Carrying his world around upon his back,
Leaving nothing behind but the tell-tale of his track.

He will not be hostage, he will not be slave,
No snare of past can trap him, though the future may.
Still he runs and burns behind him in advanced retreat;
Still his life remains unfettered, he denies defeat.

In step, with great precision, these dancers of the night
Advance against the darkness - how implacable their might!
Eyes undulled by moon, their arms and legs akimbo,
They walk and live, hoping soon to surface from this limbo.
Their minds, anticipating the dawn of the day,
Shall never know what's waiting mere insight away
Too far, too soon.

Senses dimmed in semi-sentience, only wheeling through this plane,
Only seeing fragmented images prematurely curtailed by the brain,
But breathing, living, knowing in some measure at least
The soul which roots the matter of both Beauty and the Beast.
From what tooth or claw does murder spring,
From what flesh and blood does passion?
Both cut through the air with the pendulum's swing
In deadly but delicate fashion.
And every range of feeling is there in the dream
And every logic's reeling in the force of the scream
The senses sting.
And though I may be dreaming and reality stalls
I only know the meaning of sight and that's all
And that's nothing.

The columns of the night advance,
Infectiously, their cryptic dance
Gathers converts to the fold -
In time the whole raw world will pace these same steps
On into the same bitter end.

Somnolent muster now the dancing dead
Forsake the shelter of their secure beds,
Awaken to a slumber whose depths they dread,

Make reason of the sensory whorl

Or does the anaesthetic darkness take hold on its very own?
Does your body rise in service with not one dissenting groan?

In the mirror are twisted and buckled,
Lashes flicker, a catch of breath,
Skin whitening at the knuckles.

Not to rise again.

My body deranged;

Still that's only from one point of view

With no idea of what it's all been about
Except in the context of time...'

Or a litany - all the signs are there of fervent devotion -

There was no reason to expect such disaster.

Is it my fault that I'm here to see you crying?

a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart:
it's hopeless, I know,
but onward I must go
and try to make a start
at seeing something more than day to day
survival, chased by final death
if I believed this the sum
of the life to which we've come,
I wouldn't waste my breath
Somehow, there must be more. There was a time
when more was felt than known
but now, entrenched inside my sett,
in light more mundane,
thought rattles round my brain:
we live, we die...and yet?

In the beginning there was order and destiny
but now that path has reached the border,
and on our knees
is no way to face the future, whatever it be.
Though the forces which hold us in place
last through eons in unruffled grace
we, too, wear the face of creation.

As anti-matter sucks and pulses periodically
the bud unfolds, the bloom is dead,

may claim us for its own

on us it grows!

We might not be there to share it
if eternity's a jest
but I think that I can bear it
if the next life is the best.
Even if there is a heaven when we die,
endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie
that always comes as answer to the question,
""Why do we see through the eyes of creation?""

Adrift without a course,
it's very lonely here,
our only conjecture
what lies behind the dark.
Still, I find I can cling to a lifeline,
think of a lifetime which means more
than my own one -
dreams of a grander thing than we are.
Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders:
when all life is over who can say
no mutated force shall remain?
Though the towers of the city are denied
to we men of clay
still we know we shall scale
the heights some day.
Frightened in the silence -
frightened, but thinking very hard,
let us make computations of the stars.

Older, wiser, sadder, blinder, watch us run:
faster, longer, harder, stronger, now it comes:
colour blisters, image splinters gravitate
towards the centre, in final splendour disintegrate,
The universe now beckons
and Man, too, must take His place...
just a few last fleeting seconds
to wander in the waste,
and the children who were ourselves move on,
reincarnation stills its now perfected song,
and at last we are free of the bonds of creation.

All the jokers and gaolers, all the junkies
and slavers too,
all the throng who have danced a merry tune -
human we can all be,
but Humanity we must rise above,
in the name of all faith and hope and love.
There's a time for all pilgrims,
and a time for the fakers too,
there's a time when we all will stand alone
and nude,
naked to the galaxies -
naked, but clothed in the overview...

She's into lizards, she's into snakes,
he's into trauma - still got the shakes
from a lady who only talked dogs and cats
making love in the alley - she thought like that....
So he doesn't notice he's falling in
to a change in colour of chameleon skin.

And the sun beats down on the baking earth
in the land where the lizards play.
And the tongues flick out - though they want to touch
all the words get in the way.
And it's you and me and it's he and she
and it's everything I say.

Frozen vision,deaf and dumb:
still trying to work out what I've become....
I tried to reach you, I tried to score,
I shot the bolt on the open door...
the secret reaction, base metal to gold,
and all I felt was my blood froze...
I walked on water - I was wearing skis -
and now the water must dance on me.

Anyway, for all that, will you dance with me?
will you dance with me?
And the sun beats down on the baking earth
in the land where the lizards play.
And they shed their skins and at last begin
to find colours for the day.

Van der Graaf Generator,"Letters in pencil, some of them as heavy as lead,
as dated as carbon, as black as coal,
but burning as red.
Clues faintly stencilled: the message,
though leeched, is unbled,
as secret as marble - as young, as old,
as living, as dead.
And always that laugh
that comes as though it's from pain:
though I'm lashed to the mast
still it hammers round my brain.

Laughter in the backbone,
laughter impossibly wise,
that same laughter that comes
every time I flash on that look in your eyes
which whispers of a black zone
which'll mock all my credos as lies,
where all logic is done
and time will smash every theory I devise.
And the hour-glass is shattered
only by the magic of your touch
where nothing really matter....
No, Nothing matters very much!

So the siren song runs through the ages,
and it courses through my veins like champagne;
and with all the sweet kisses of addiction
it's calling me to break my bonds again.

Future memory exploding like shrapnel,
some splinters escape on my tongue,
some of them scar comprehension...
beneath the scab they burn,
but the wound becomes numbs.
And always the song draws me forward,
rejoicing in the search and the prayer,
bored with all but the mad,
the strange, the freak, the impossible dare.
Still your laugh chills my marrow
till I embrace it on my knees....
Oh, when the mast becomes a flagpole,
what becomes of me?
What becomes, oh, what becomes of me?",The Siren Song,1977
Van der Graaf Generator,"I remember what it felt like at seventeen,
I was a cat, a snake, a lizard, a mouse;
still got an interest in the limousine
and a spouse and a brat,
country house, London flat.

I'm gonna head for the island when the summer's out,
I'm gonna do all the stuff that I can,
drink like a fish in a waterspout -
I'm a fan of the flow,
it began long ago,
I'm a man who should know it doesn't stop.

so much to forget:
we're all in the possession of the future tense,

experience and youth,
so we feel the need acutely
for any kind of Truth.

Oh, but we get copped some days,
caught between options we've failed
to play, such wasted chance.
So I join the wastrel's dance:
it has slow as well as fast movement,
and any change must be an improvement
on simply fossilising, standing still.

The wave is out of reach,
trailing words from the hand

Dumb:
What have we become?
What have we chosen to be?
Now, all history is reduced to the syllables of
Our name-
Nothing can ever be the same:
Now the Immortals are here.
At the time it seemed a reasonable course
To harness all the force
Of life without the threat of death,
But soon we found that boredom and inertia
Are not negative, but all the law we know,
And dead are will and words like survival.

Arrival at immunity from all age, all fear and
All end
Why do I pretend?
Our essence is distilled
And all familiar taste is now drained,
And though purity is maintained
It leaves us sterile,
Living through the millions of years,
A laugh as close as any tear;
Living, if you claim that all
That entails is breathing, eating, defecating,
Screwing, drinking,
Spewing, sleeping, sinking ever down and down
And ultimately passing away time
Which no longer has any meaning.

Take away the threat of death and all you're
Left with is a round of make-believe.
Marshal every sullen breath and though you're
Ultimately bored by endless ecstasy
It's still the ring by which you hope to be
Engaged
To marry the girl who will give you forever-
It's crazy, and plainly
That simply is not enough.

What is the dullest and bluntest of pains,
Such that my eyes never close without feeling it
There?
What abject despair demands an end
To all things of infinity?
If we have gained, how do we now meet the
Cost?
What have we bargained, and what have we
Lost?
What have we relinquished, never even knowing it
Was there?

What thoughts now of holding fast the line,
Defying death and time?
Everything we had is gone,
Everything we laboured for and favoured more
Than earthly things reveals the hollow ring
Of false hope and false deliverance.

But now the nuptial bed is made,
The dowry has been paid:
The toothless, haggard features of eternity
Now welcome me between the sheets
To couple with her withered body - my wife.

 away from you
You think that you can hold the searing, moulten gold between
 your fingers ...

exposing the white of a knuckle ...
flesh-and-metal forming letters in the mould.
Cradling you gun, after choosing the ones you think should die-
Lying on the hill ... crawling over the windowsill into your
 living-room

bodies torn by vultures ..

 of death
Ghosts betray you, ghosts betray you, in the night they steal your eye
from its socket ...
and the ball hangs fallen on your cheek.
Complaining tongues are stilled; a thousand mouths are filled
 with rusting metal.
Your face a shade of green; somehow you try to speak through all the
 garbage in your mouth

throws your fame into the flames and you are burned.

 on your threshold;
Begging for your life as the impartial knife sinks in your
 screaming flesh ...
without malice, merely taking murder's toll,
you must pay the price of hate, and that price is
 your soul ....

Pansying around; look at all the nerks
In their leather platform boots,
Making with the heavy sound...
I'm gonna stamp on the stardust
And scream till I'm ill -

Looked down, around, and all that I could see
Were those that I would dearly love to share with
Crashing on quite blindly to the sea

I tried to ask what game this was,
But knew I would not play it:
The voice, as one, as no-one, came to me
'We have looked upon the heroes

And they are found wanting;
We have looked hard across the land,
But we can see no dawn;
We have now dared to sear the sky,

But we are still bleeding;
We are drawing near to the cliffs,
Now we can hear the call.
The clouds are piled in mountain-shapes,

There is no escape except to go forward.
Don't ask us for an answer now,
It's far too late to bow to that convention.
What course is there left but to die?

We have looked upon the High Kings,
Found them less than mortals:
Their names are dust before the just
March of our young, new law.

Minds stumbling strong, we hurtle on
Into the dark portal;
No-one can halt our final vault
Into the unknown maw.

And as the Elders beat their brows
They 
Know that it is really far too late now to stop us.

In search of something we're not quite sure of?'

Time may finally prove

No life lies in the quicksand.

Young minds and bodies on steel spokes impaled

Mind and machinery box-press the dreams.

The fight is beginning

Unite our blood, abate the flood,
Avert the disaster

How good the time was and how I laughed 
Times have changed, now you're far away, I can't complain:
I had all my chances but they slipped right through my hands - like so much sand;
I know I'll never dance like I used to

Hoping that I can catch all of the memories,
Then I must crawl off upon my way, all of me

You see my love at all

At some point I lost you, I don't know quite how it was;

I looked around and I found I was truly lost:
Without your hand in mine I am dead 
Reality is unreal and games I've tried just aren't the same:
Without your smile there's nowhere to hide
And deep inside
I know I've never cried as I'm about to 

If I could just frame the words that would make your fire burn
All this water now around me could be the love that
Should surround me.

Looking out through the tears that bind me
My heart bleeds that you may find me .. or at least that I can
Forget and be numb, but I can't stop, the words still come:
I love you",Lost,2000
Van der Graaf Generator,"i. Eyewitness
Still waiting for my saviour,
storms tear me limb from limb;
my fingers feel like seaweed...
I'm so far out I'm too far in.
I am a lonely man...my solitude is true
my eyes have borne stark witness
and now my knights are numbered too.
I've 
seen the smiles on dead hands--
the stars shine, but they're not for me.
I prophesy disaster and then I count the cost....
I shine but, shining, dying,
I know that I am almost lost.
On the table lies blank paper/my tower is built on stone/
I only have blunt scissors/I only have the bluntest home....
I've been the witness, and the seal of death
lingers in the molten wax that is my head.
When you see the skeletons of sailing-ship spars sinking low
You'll begin to wonder if the points of all the ancient myths
are solemnly directed straight at
you...
ii. Pictures/Lighthouse
(Eddies/rocks/ships/collision/remorse.)
iii. Eyewitness
No time now for contrition:
the time for that's long past.
The walls are thin as tissue
and if I talk I'll crack the glass.
So I only think on how it might have been,
locked in silent monologue, in silent scream
Anyway, I'm much too tired to speak
and, as the waves crash on the bleak
stones of the tower, I start to freak....
...and find that I am overcome...
iv. S.H.M.
'Unreal, unreal!' ghost helmsmen scream
and fall in through the sky,
not breaking through my seagull shrieks...
no breaks until I die:
the spectres scratch on window-slits--
hollowed faces, mindless grins
only intent on destroying what they've lost.
I craw the wall till steepness ends in the vertical fall;
my pail has sailed into the sea: no joking hopes at dawn.
White bone shine in the iron-jaw mask
lost mastheads pierce the freezing dark
and parallel my isolated tower....
no paraffin for the 
flame
no harbour left to gain
v. The Presence of the Night/Kosmos Tours
'Alone, alone,' the ghosts all call,
pinpoint me in the light.
The only life I feel at all
is the presence of the night.
Would you cry if I died?
Would you cry if I died?
Would you catch the final words of mine?
Would you catch my words?
I know that there's no time
I know that there's no rhyme...
false signs find me
I don't want to hate,
I just want to grow;
why can't I let me
live and be free?..but I die very slowly alone.
I know no more ways,
I am so afraid,
myself won't let me
just be myself and so I am completely alone....
The maelstrom of my memory
is a vampire and it feeds on me
now, staggering madly, over the brink I
fall.
vi. (Custard's) Last Stand
Lighthouses might house the key
but can I reach the door?
I want to walk on the sea
so that I may better find ashore...
but how can I ever keep my feet dry?
I scan the horizon
I must keep my eyes on all parts of me.
Looking back on the years
it seems that I have lost 
the way:
Like a dog in the night, I have run to a manger
...now I am the stranger I stay in.
All of the grief I have seen
leaves me chasing solitary peace;
but I hold experience in my head....
I'm too close to the light
I don't think I see right, for I blind me....
vii. The Clot Thickens
WHERE is the God that guides my hand?
HOW can the hands of others reach me?
WHEN will I find what I grope for?
WHO is going to teach me?
I am me/me are we/we can't see
any way out of here.
Crashing sea/atrophied history:
Chance has lost my Guinevere....
I don't want to be one wave in the water
But sea will drag me deep
One more haggard DROWNED MAN...
I can see the Lemmings coming, but I know I'm just a man;
Do I join or do I founder? Which can is the best I may?
viii. Land's End (Sineline)/We Go Now
Oceans drifting sideways, I am pulled into the spell;
I feel you around me...I know you well.
Stars slice horizons where the lines stand much too stark;
I feel I am drowning...hands stretch in the dark.
Camps of panoply and majesty, what is Freedom of Choice?
Where do I stand in the pageantry...whose is my voice?
It doesn't feel so very bad now: I think the end is the start.
Begin to feel very glad now:

you got some stock in a gilt-edged bond,
you stretched out tight by the terms of debenture,
the game is on...
You chase the bulls in eternal corrida,

you scan the index for a market leader,
a tip and a prayer,
You better see daylight:
night comes on the City so soon.
You say you are a christian capitalist,

rationalize, strip the assets and run

the bed of roses where we lay,
the crown of thorns I was so keen to give away.

the passion's played.

I could foresee what was to come,
I had a sense of what might happen.
The river runs and very rapidly
becomes a torrent, sweeping us

It takes a lifetime to unravel all the threads
that have tied us in our webs of tourniquet.

I stand on ceremonial quicksand.
I look for something with solidity to hold:
something lasting, something pristine,
with no sense of decay.

Can you remember how that was?
Can you remember?

It takes a lifetime's understanding of the flow

And their names ought to go down in history

The steelband music is really sweet
You get that rhythm in every beat
The steel the grater and the oil drum
Will make you jump up and make you hum
It's fantastic in every sense

Darling keep the home fires burning

And you the Trinidadians only catchin' hell
How many times do you want to be told
Your own comes first all over the world

If you think I lie, I invite you please
Just take a trip through the West Indies
Make your first stop at Grenada
Tell them that you come to look for labor
If you miss and say you're from Trinidad
They lick you from Grenada down to Fyzabad
But you can't blame them on a whole
My friend, that's the policy of the world

So, Granadians for Granadians
Jamaicians for Jamaicians
Even Barbados take the same route
Trinidadians, buck up and follow suit
Well now you really lookin for blows
If you think you goin' anchor in Barbados
The Bajuns goin tell you bloomin' fast
Don't you know Bajuns first and outsiders last
Then you heist your anchor to Jamaica
Feelin' that your chances might be better
But as I've led you to understand
Boy, we only have work here for Jamaicans

I'm not all selfish, I love to give
And I believe in the slogan live and let live
If the other islands aren't doin' that
Well I don't see why we should be Miss Howard's cat

So they lay suspended dreaming of some kind of god
With their limbs akimbo and extended to the mind of God

Is that if you should find that your hand's in the fire
You pull it back quickly and you retire like

Now just feels so economic
I feel tragic you want comic

More than for fortune and fame

Van Dyke Parks,"Orange crate art was a place to start
Orange crate art was a world apart
Home for two with view of sonoma
Where there's aroma and heart

Memories of her orange crate art
Orange crate table and a rockin' chair
Barnyard gate waiting some repair
Trust in fate and sweet inspiration

You could go bust to replace
Just what is here by the case
Hear the lonesome locomotion roar
Hobo hop on if you dare

And it rolls where grapes of wrath are stored
Stops on a bracero's prayer
On the dawn of a vintage cruise
Calms the wine of this rendezvous

This old house can't take that much more
And it just might take you and me under
Makin' such a great commotion
You could hear the clatter
Put the pots and pans on the floor
And just let it pour

In the tintinnabulation
You can hear the rain as it (rains?)

Underneath the pitter patter
Say it doesn't matter
Somethin' say you feelin' ok
And just fly away

On the wings of a dove
You bring me my love
She's singin' so sadly
Wings lifting my love
She's drifting above
The push and the shove
On wings of a dove

This whole town is covered in gray
God let it rain my nights to tomorrow
Someone here in tribulation
Say does it matter
Someone say you feelin' OK
On one rainy day

On the wings of a dove
She's singin' of love
The thing we need badly
Things I wish I had

We had the girl and the boy
And love was never a toy
Just like that old rusty ford we restored out in back

It made that clickety-clack
Our new old house by the track
At her window was a touch of lavender lace
I remember her face

Too many rainbows to chase
Right through the cracks of the paint
Come the tracks of the train
Scatter like diamonds of rain

Down our old blacktop two lane
Hold back time
Don't talk about tomorrow
Tell that old clock on the wall

He'll just have to call it a day
Hold back time
When we're in each other's arms
We're in each other's arms

So hold back time
With that old country hymn spinning round in her brain
She kept her fancy for play
More than for fortune and fame

Now when we feel every wheel spinnin' steel on that track
We shake the dust off the sack
In our old house by the track
Hold back time

Don't talk about tomorrow
Tell that old clock on the wall

With a Chevy for my summer home
Let's get the party started
It's looking like the city towed
My other apartment

She got a doorbell sign that said
Bring it or don't ring it
She's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman

Fate is my pimp
But she was cool
Said if you're doin' business with me, honey
What does that make you?
Some Casablanca gin joint
You're a nervous wreck
Your I.Q. plummets fourteen points
Her thunder thong around your neck

The song ain't dirty
It's really just the way we sing it (sing it)
She's the woman (sing it)
She's the woman
She's the woman
She's the woman

She wanted something to regret
Tomorrow morning
This suburban garage-a-trois
Was worth exploring
Yeah dreams come true
But it remains to be seen
By the time mine usually do
It's no longer me!

Is a world apart
And you're walking through a wonderland
With your eyes closed
Did you ever think
We're really not that far

[Chorus:]
Down, down we go
But we're half way home
It's a million miles
A thousand doors
All we're really looking for
Is something to believe in

Well you wonder why 
It's raining down on only you
But the sky's unclear
But I'm right here
So take my hand
Feel me close
Let's get back what matters most
It's the simple things
Just you and me

[Chorus:]

Something soul that we can feel
Something pure and someone real
I don't want to be here alone
With nothing to believe in
With nothing to believe in
With nothing to believe in
With nothing to believe in

Something to believe in

Something to believe in
Something to believe in

Van Hunt,"Hey
I don't want nothing in my puddin', but the chocolate

Country girl, name of pearl, came around
Took off her shirt, shoved her skirt in my mouth
I made her soft murmur and shout when I felt the sweet Georgia brow
And I don't want nothing in my puddin', but the chocolate

We danced to go-go, we drank cocoa from Manila
Her sisters Cherry and Strawberry and Vanilla
Took me into the sheets and tried to beg, borrow, and steal my love
But I don't want thing in my puddin', but the chocolate

Tell er'body

He don't want nothing in his puddin', but the chocolate
I don't want nothing but the, nothing but the
I don't want nothing but the, nothing but the
I don't want nothing but the, nothing but the
I don't want nothing but the, nothing but the

She moved for good to Hollywood, we had to part
'Cause the touches with her brushes turned her blonde
And I like my movie stars just like my liquor, dark
I don't want nothing in my puddin', but the chocolate

Hey, I don't want nothing in my puddin', but the chocolate
I don't want nothing but the, nothing but the

And the heavens open every time she smiles
And when I come to her that's where I belong
Yet I'm running to her like a river's song

[Chorus:]
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love
She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down
And when I come to her when the sun goes down
Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

[Chorus]

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

And when I'm returning from so far away
She gives me some sweet lovin' brighten up my day
Yes it makes me righteous, yes it makes me feel whole
Yes it makes me mellow down in to my soul",Crazy Love [#],1970
Van Morrison,"Little Jimmy's gone
Way out of the backstreet
Out of the window
Through the fallin' rain
Right on time
Right on time
That's why Broken Arrow
Waved his finger down the road so dark and narrow
In the evenin'
Just before the Sunday six-bells chime, six-bells chime
And all the dogs are barkin'
Way on down the diamond-studded highway where you wander
And you roam from your retreat and view
Way over on the railroad
Tomorrow all the tippin' trucks will unload
Every scrapbook stuck will glue
And I'll stand beside you
Beside you child
To never never never wonder why at all
No no no no no no no no
To never never wonder why at all
To never never never wonder why it's gotta be
It has to be
Way across the country where the hillside mountain glide
The dynamo of your smile caressed the barefoot virgin child to wander
Past your window with a lantern lit
You held it in the doorway and you cast against the pointed island breeze
Said your time was open, go well on your merry way
Past the brazen footsteps of the silence easy
You breathe in you breathe out you breathe in you breathe out you breath in
You breathe out you breathe in you breathe out
And you're high on your high-flyin' cloud
Wrapped up in your magic shroud as ecstasy surrounds you
This time it's found you
You turn around you turn around you turn around you turn around
And I'm beside you
Beside you
Oh darlin'
To never never wonder why at all
No no no no no
To never never never wonder why at all
To never never never wonder why it's gotta be
It has to be
And I'm beside you
Beside you

To never never wonder why at all
I'm beside you
Beside you
Beside you
Beside you

Van Morrison,"I dreamed you paid your dues in Canada
Left me to come through
I headed for the right way
I knew exactly just what to do
I dreamed we played cards in the dark
And you lost and you lied
Wasn't very hard to do
But hurt me deep down inside

[Chorus:]
Mmmm, these dreams of you
So real and so true
These dreams of you
So real and so true

My back was up against the wall
And you slowly just walked away
You never really heard my call
When I cried out that way
With my face against the sun
You pointed out for me to go
Then you said I was the one
Had to reap what you did sow

[Chorus]

(Bridge:)
And hush-a-bye, don't ever think about it
Go to sleep don't ever say one word
Close your eyes, you are an angel sent down from above

And Ray Charles was shot down
But he got up to do his best
A crowd of people gathered round
To the question answered ""yes""
And you slapped me on the face
I turned around the other cheek
You couldn't really stand the pace
And I would never be so meek

And the sun begins to shine
I see my freedom from across the way
And it comes right in on time
Well it shines so bright and it gives so much light
And it comes from the sky above
Makes me feel so free makes me feel like me
And lights my life with love

[Chorus:]
And it seems like and it feels like
And it seems like yes it feels like
A brand new day, yeah
A brand new day oh

I was lost and double crossed
With my hands behind my back
I was longtime hurt and thrown in the dirt
Shoved out on the railroad track
I've been used, abused and so confused
And I had nowhere to run
But I stood and looked
And my eyes got hooked
On that beautiful morning sun

[Chorus]

And the sun shines down all on the ground
Yeah and the grass is oh so green
And my heart is still and I've got the will
And I don't really feel so mean
Here it comes, here it comes
0 here it comes right now
And it comes right in on time
Well it eases me and it pleases me
And it satisfies my mind

And they'll talk to you while you're in trances
And you'll visualize not taking any chances
But meet them halfway with love, peace and persuasion
And expect them to rise for the occasion
Don't it gratify when you see it materialize
Right in front of your eyes

Just like talking to yourself

Through the fields of streams and meadows
Laughing all the way

Oh redwood tree
Please let us under
When we were young we used to go
Under the redwood tree

And it smells like rain
Maybe even thunder
Won't you keep us from all harm
Wonderful redwood tree

And a boy and his father
Went out, went out looking for the lost dog
You know what oh haven't they learned
Since they did that together
They did not bring him back
He already had departed
But look at everything they have learned
Since that, since that very day

Oh redwood tree
Please let us under
When we were young we used to go
Under the redwood tree

And it smells like rain
Maybe even thunder
Won't you keep us from all harm

Take a walk when autumn comes to town

Little stroll past the house on the hill
Some more coal on the fire will do well
And in a week or two it'll be Halloween
Set the page and the stage for the scene

Little game the children will play
And as we watch them while time away
Look at me and take my breath away yeah

You'll be smiling eyes beguiling
And the song on the breeze
Will call my name out and your dream

Chestnuts roasting outside as you walk
With your love by your side
The old accordion man plays mellow and bright
And you go home in the crispness of the night

Little later friends will be along
And if you feel like joining the throng
Just might feel like singing Autumn song
Just may feel like singing Autumn song

You'll be smiling

Well the plastic revolutionaries take the money and run
Have you ever been down to love city
Where they rip you off with a smile

Don't it hurt so bad in love city
Don't it make you not want to bother at all
And don't they look so self righteous
When they pin you up against the wall

With the tear drops in their eyes
I just can't stand it, stand it no how

Saying power to the people, dance to the music

Have you ever heard about how he could paint
And he didn't have enough money for his brushes

Cause when you stop to think about it
You don't need it

Have you ever heard about the great Hollywood motion picture actor
Who knew more than they did
And the newspapers didn't cover the story
Just decided to keep it hid.

Somebody started saying it was an inside job
Whatever happened to him?
Last time they saw him down on the Bow'ry
With his lip hanging off an old rusty bottle of gin

Have you ever heard about the so-called hippies
Down on the far side of the tracks
They take the eyeballs straight out of your head

Singing songs about Edith Piaf's soul
And I hear blue strains of no regredior
Across the street from Cathedral Notre Dame

Meanwhile back in San Francisco
We're trying hard to make this whole thing blend
As we sit upon this jagged
Storey block, with you my friend

And it's a long way to Buffalo
It's a long way to Belfast city too
And I'm hoping the choice won't blow the hoist
'Cause this town, they bit off more than they can chew.

Against the safeway's supermarket in the rain
And everybody feels so determined
Not to feel anyone else's pain

No one's making no commitments
To anybody but themselves
Talkin' behind closed doorways
Tryin' to get outside, get outside of empty shells

And for every cross cuttin' country corner, country corner
For every Hank Williams railroad train that cried
And all the chains, badges, flags and emblems
And every strain on brain and every eye

You've got your pen and notebook ready

And meanwhile we're over in a 52nd Street apartment
Socializing with the wino few

With a childlike vision leaping into view
Clicking, clacking of the high heeled shoe
Ford and Fitzroy, Madame George
Marching with the soldier boy behind
He's much older now with hat on drinking wine
And that smell of sweet perfume comes drifting through
The cool night air like Shalimar

And outside they're making all the stops
The kids out in the street collecting bottle-tops
Gone for cigarettes and matches in the shops
Happy taken Madame George
That's when you fall
Whoa, that's when you fall
Yeah, that's when you fall
When you fall into a trance

Sitting on a sofa playing games of chance
With your folded arms and history books
You glance into the eyes of Madame George
And you think you found the bag
You're getting weaker and your knees begin to sag
In a corner playing dominoes in drag
The one and only Madame George

And then from outside the frosty window raps
She jumps up and says, Lord, have mercy I think it's the cops
And immediately drops everything she gots
Down into the street below
And you know you gotta go
On that train from Dublin up to Sandy Row
Throwing pennies at the bridges down below
And the rain, hail, sleet, and snow

Say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
And as you leave, the room is filled with music
Laughing, music, dancing, music all around the room
And all the little boys come around, walking away from it all

So cold, and as you're about to leave
She jumps up and says, hey love, you forgot your gloves
And the gloves to love, to love the gloves
To say goodbye to Madame George
Dry your eye for Madame George
Wonder why for Madame George
Dry your eyes for Madame George

Say goodbye in the wind and the rain on the back street
In the backstreet, in the back street
Say goodbye to Madame George
In the backstreet, in the back street, in the back street
Down home, down home in the back street
Gotta go, say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Dry your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye, your eye

Say goodbye to Madame George
And the loves to love to love the love
Say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Say goodbye goodbye, goodbye, goodbye to Madame George

Van Morrison,"Linden Arden stole the highlights 
With one hand tied behind his back 
Loved the morning sun, and whiskey
Ran like water in his veins
Loved to go to church on Sunday
Even though he was a drinking man
When the boys came to San Francisco
They were looking for his life
But he found out where they were drinking
Met them face to face outside
Cleaved their heads off with a hatchet
Lord, he was a drinkin' man
And when someone tried to get above him
He just took the law into his own hands

Linden Arden stole the highlights
And they put his fingers through the glass
He had heard all those stories many, many times before

Or wish on a toilet roll
You can just soak up the atmosphere
Like a fish inside a bowl

When the ghost comes round at midnight
Well you both can have some fun
He can drive you mad, he can make you sad
He can keep you from the sun

Some exotic bird
I prefer to spend some time just listening for that special something

I like a new song to sing, another show or somewhere entirely different to be

And so I yearn for mistress calling me
That's the muse, that's the muse

Left to lose
I make it to spring and there's no bed of roses
It's just more hard work and bad company
But baby you make me feel so free

All right

I heard them say that you can have your cake and eat it
But all I wanted was one free lunch
How can I eat it when the man that's next to me
Now, he grabbed it, Lord, he beat me, he beat me to the punch

How can I even talk about freedom when you know
Oh, it's sweet mystery, but baby, you, you
You make me feel so free

I'm gonna lay my cards just right down on the table and spin the wheel
And roll the dice
And whatever way it comes out, and whatever way it turns out, baby you know
Well, that's the price
Well, I'll order again there's no need to explain
I just need somewhere to dump all my negativity

Down through the weeks of ages
In the moss borne dark dank pools

Rave on down through the industrial revolution
Empiricism, atomic and nuclear age
Rave on down through time and space down through the corridors
Rave on words on printed page

Rave on, you left us infinity
And well pressed pages torn to fade
Drive on with wild abandon
Up tempo, frenzied heels

Rave on, Walt Whitman, nose down in wet grass
Rave on, fill the senses
On nature's bright green shady path

Rave on Omar Khayyam, rave on Kahlil Gibran
Oh, what sweet wine we drinkin'
The celebration will be held
We will partake the wine and break the holy bread

Rave on let a man come out of Ireland
And rave on, Mr.Yeats
Rave on down through thy holy Rosy Cross

Rave on down through theosophy and the golden dawn
Rave on through the writing of a vision

Get together and sing some songs
Like rhythm and blues you make me feel alright

Nothing to lose and so much to gain
Everyone knew who everyone was
And they knew it because of the street

We walk in haunts of ancient peace.
At night we rest and go to sleep
In haunts of ancient peace.
The love and light we seek,
The words we do not need to speak,
Here in this wondrous way we keep
These haunts of ancient peace.
Let us go there again
When we need some relief
Oh, when I can't find my feet
When I need rest and sleep.
The Sunday bells they chime
Around the countryside and towns
A song of harmony and rhyme
In haunts of ancient peace.
The holy grail we seek
On down by haunts of ancient peace.
We see the new Jerusalem
In haunts of ancient peace.
Oh, when I can't find my feet
Oh, when I need some relief

You know I want to go there one more time again.

Van Morrison,"Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field
Let him look up into the heavens and laugh in the bright air
Let the enchained soul shut up in darkness and in sighing
Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years

Rose and look out, his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open
And let his wife and children return from the oppressor's scourge
They look behind at every step and believe it is a dream
Singing, the sun has left his blackness and has found a fresher morning
And the fair moon rejoices in the clear and cloudless night

For empire is no more
And now the lion and wolf shall cease

For everything that lives is holy
For everything that lives is holy
For everything that lives is holy
For everything that lives is holy

What is the price of experience? Do men buy it for a song?
Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No, it is bought with the price
Of all that a man hath, his house, his wife, his children
Wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to buy

And in the withered field where the farmer plows for bread in vain
It is an easy thing to triumph in the summer's sun
And in the vintage and to sing on the wagon loaded with corn
It is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted

To speak the laws of prudence to the homeless wanderer
To listen to the hungry raven's cry in wintry season
When the red blood is filled with wine and with the marrow of lambs

It is an easy thing to laugh at wrathful elements
To hear the dog howl at the wintry door
The ox in the slaughter house moan
To see a God on every wind and a blessing on every blast

To hear sounds of love in the thunder storm
That destroys our enemies' house
To rejoice in the blight that covers his field
And the sickness that cuts off his children

While our olive and vine sing and laugh 'round our door
And our children bring fruits and flowers
Then the groan and the dolor are quite forgotten
And the slave grinding at the mill
And the captive in chains and the poor in the prison

And the soldier in the field
When the shattered bone hath laid him groaning
Among the happier dead
It is an easy thing to rejoice in the tents of prosperity
Thus, could I sing and thus, rejoice but it is not so with me",Let the Slave,1985

Van Morrison,"The streets are always wet with rain
After a summer shower when I saw you standin'
In the garden in the garden wet with rain 

You wiped the teardrops from your eye in sorrow
As we watched the petals fall down to the ground
And as I sat beside you I felt the
Great sadness that day in the garden 

And then one day you came back home
You were a creature all in rapture
You had the key to your soul
And you did open that day you came back to the garden 

The olden summer breeze was blowin' on your face
The light of God was shinin' on your countenance divine
And you were a violet color as you
Sat beside your father and your mother in the garden 

The summer breeze was blowin' on your face
Within your violet you treasure your summery words
And as the shiver from my neck down to my spine
Ignited me in daylight and nature in the garden 

And you went into a trance
Your childlike vision became so fine
And we heard the bells inside the church
We loved so much
And felt the presence of the youth of
Eternal summers in the garden 

And as it touched your cheeks so lightly
Born again you were and blushed 
And we touched each other lightly
And we felt the presence of the Christ 
Within in our hearts
In the garden

And I turned to you and I said
No guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the father in the garden 

Listen no guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father and the
Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden, wet with rain
No guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature and the Father 
And the Son and the Holy Ghost
In the garden, in the garden, wet with rain

No guru, no method, no teacher
Just you and I and nature
And the Father in the garden",In the Garden,1986

We will partake the wine and break the Holy bread

Van Morrison,"I walked in my greatcoat
Down through the days of the leaves.
No before after, yes after before
We were shining our light into 
The days of blooming wonder
In the eternal presence, 
In the presence of the flame.

Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

On and on and on and on we kept singing our song
Over newtonards and comber, 
Gransha and the Ballystockart Road.
This spike an boffyflow 
I said I could describe the leaves 
For Samuel and Felicity
Rich, red browny, half burnt orange and green.

Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision bright
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

It's easy to describe the leaves in the autumn
And it's oh so easy in the spring
But down through January and February 
It's a very different thing.

On and on and on, through the winter of our discontent.
When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too
I said I could describe the leaves for Samuel and what it means to you and me
You may call my love Sophia, but I call my love philosophy.

Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder
Didn't I come to lift your fiery vision
Didn't I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame.

When the lilacs were in bloom

And the sun shone through your window pane
To the place you kept your books
You were reading on your sofa
You were singin' every prayer
That the masters had instilled in you
Since Lord Byron loved despair
In the palace of the Lord
In the palace of the Lord

And if you get it right this time
You don't have to come back again

I was going down to Geneva
When the Kingdom had been found
I was giving you protection
From the loneliness of the crowd
In the palace of the Lord
In the palace of the Lord

They were giving you religion
Breaking bread and drinking wine
And you laid out on the green hills
Just like when you were a child

Breathe it in all the way down
To your stomach too
And breathe it out with a radiance
Into the night time air

Well I guess I've been marking time
I've been living in another country

And my shield in my hand

There's a battle for the throne
And it's raging down in your soul
It says this love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always
This love will surely last forever
This love will surely last always

I've been accused of truth and alchemy
I've been accused of speaking out for freedom too
I give a demonstration in front of a crowd
A man saw my hands move and he began to shout

Here come, here come, her come horsemen through the pass
They say cast a cold eye on life, on death

From your Ivory Tower

And I don't have none

All kind of things

Just to do everything I have to do
Do you think that there's nothing to it
You should try it sometime

And by the mansion gate
We stood enraptured by the silence
As the birds sang their heavenly song

And prayed to our father
And climbed up the mountainside
With fire in our hearts

On a golden autumn day
We were standing in the garden wet with rain

Outside Jerusalem

Following the big sun in the west

And you filled me and you filled me

By the clear cool crystal streams
Where the roads were quiet and still
