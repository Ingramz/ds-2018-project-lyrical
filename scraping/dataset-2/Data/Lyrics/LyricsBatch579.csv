Laurie Veldheer,"Gentlemen, we need to sell more papers
There's an answer right before your eyes, but you're just not thinking this through
Nunzio knows, when he's cutting my hair
Trim a bit here 
And then trim a bit there
Just a modest adjustment
Can fatten the bottom line

What if we cut back personnel?

How about a few salary trims?

We could lower the price of the paper

Bankrupting me even faster
Let me try again
Shaving is tricky: The razor should float
Shave me too close 
And you may slit my throat
Its the simplest solutions
That bolster the bottom line

I've got it 
If we charge the Newsies sixty cents per hundred instead of fifty

They'd have to sell ten more papers just to earn the same amount as always

My thought exactly
It's genius

It's gonna be awfully rough on those children

They'll be learning a real life lesson in economics 
I couldn't offer them a better education if they were my own
Give me a week and I'll train them to be
Like an army that's marching to war
Proud of themselves and so Grateful to me
They'll be begging to pay even more
When there's dirt on our shoes, boys
For God's sake, relax
Why throw them out?
All we need is some wax
Listen well to these barbershop lessons
For they'll see you through

When you're stuck in the muck you'll be fine
You'll erase any trace of decline

With a trim

And a snip

And a shine

And the power of the press
Yes, once again is mine
The price for the Newsies goes up in the morning
Just a few common cents
Gents, that's the bottom line

Every new outcome
It's income for you
Thanks to that bottom line",The Bottom Line,1992
Laurie Veldheer,"Well, hello again

Please go away
I'm working

A smart girl, eh? 
Beautiful, smart, independent

I got no use for moonlight
Or sappy poetry
Love at first sight's for suckers
At least it used to be
Look, girls are nice, once or twice
Till I find someone new
But I never planned on someone like you
 
Don't come a-knocking on my door (I got no use for moonlight)
You aren't welcome here no more
I should have known you stunk like yesterday's trash (Or sappy poetry)
The night you stole my heart plus forty dollars in cash
Turns out my beau is just some bum (Love at first sight's for suckers)
Turns out that 'love ain't blind' it's dumb 
You never told the truth or worked a day in your life (At least it used to be)
In fact, you're so revoltin', I feel bad for your wife (What are you doing?)
I won't be shaving your back anymore, no se√±or (Quiet down, there's a show going on)
Don't come a-knocking on my door! (You are the most impossible boy) (Shh!)
Don't come a-knocking on my door! (Ever)
Don't come a-knocking on my door! (No, I never planned on someone like you)",I Never Planned on You/Don't Come a-Knocking,1992

Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.

Laurie Z,"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tinny reindeer.

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!

""Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On, Cupid! on, on Donner and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.
So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,
With the sleigh full of Toys, and St Nicholas too.

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St Nicholas came with a bound.

He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.
A bundle of Toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.

His eyes-how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.

The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!

He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight,
""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!""",The Night Before Christmas,2001
Laurie Z,"Met my old lover in the grocery store
The snow was falling Christmas Eve
I stood behind her in the frozen foods
And I touched her on the sleeve
 
She didn't recognize the face at first
But then her eyes flew open wide
She went to hug me and she spilled her purse 
And we laughed until we cried
 
We took her groceries to the check out stand
The food was totaled up and bagged
We stood there lost in our embarrassment
As the conversation lagged
 
We went to have ourselves a drink or two
But couldn't find an open bar
We bought a six-pack at the liquor store 
And we drank it in her car
 
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how
 
She said she's married her an architect
Who kept her warm and safe and dry
She would have liked to say she loved the man
But she didn't like to lie
 
I said the years had been a friend to her
And that her eyes were still as blue
But in those eyes I wasn't sure if I saw 
Doubt or gratitude
 
She said she saw me in the record stores
And that I must be doing well
I said the audience was heavenly
But the traveling was Hell
 
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to now
We tried to reach beyond the emptiness
But neither one knew how
 
We drank a toast to innocence
We drank a toast to time
Reliving, in our eloquence
Another ""Auld Lang Syne""
 
The beer was empty and our tongues were tired
And running out of things to say
She gave a kiss to me as I got out
And I watched her drive away
 
Just for a moment I was back at school
And felt that old familiar pain
And, as I turned to make my way back home
The snow turned into rain",Same Old Lang Syne Medley,2001
Laurindo Almeida,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, everything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low [Alternate Take],1955

Laurindo Almeida,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars,1955
Laurindo Almeida,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning

And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad

Laurindo Almeida,"Every time we say goodbye, I die a little
Every time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know
think so little of me that they allow you go

When your near there's such an air of Spring about it
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it
There's no love song finer but how strange
The change from major to minor
Every time we say goodbye",Every Time We Say Goodbye,1966
Laurindo Almeida,"Many men with lofty aims,
Strive for lofty goals,
Others play at smaller games,
Being simpler souls.

I am of the latter brand;
All I want to do,
Is to find a spot of land,
And live there with you.

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any family will,
But we will always be called,
""The folks who live on the hill"".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

Laurindo Almeida,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,1966
Laurindo Almeida,"Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl I'm sorry I was blind

But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I never told you
That I am so happy that you're mine

Give me, give me one more chance

Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about,

After it brought my lover near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day,
Funny, that rainy day is here.

In fields of dawn and forests of the night

I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

Deep in my heart, dear
I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

Those days (those days)
Those days (those days)

Walk around the neighborhood
Where my old friends ain't like they should
Should've done my best
Only books in their life will shine
So much trouble in their minds
Better days aren't behind
Looking back in yesterday
Things don't ever feel the same
My friends faces on my mind

[Chorus:]
Days of youth
Play on my mind
All on my mind
Days of youth
Hanging on my mind
All on my mind
Hey yeah
On my mind (my mind)
Hey, ah, hey now

Back when playin' was the game
Mama said don't let God catch your butt out
Don't let time slip away
Mama's word stays on my mind
I never noticed it was dark
I'm still playing at the park
Sneaking slowly to my room
But can't nothing pass Mama by
Now those tears roll down my face
She said wipe your eyes
Then she kissed me and held me tight

Hey, ah
Ah yeah
Do you remember
Those days

It's a candy coated dream
So good it makes me want to scream
So don't you dare stop the flow
'cause I don't want to have to
Quench the fire
'cause it's on for you, yeah
Desire and pass on
Come and get some of this good love

Lauryn Hill,"The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooo baby just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
See like a queen a queen upon her throne

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know

I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know

It was the, ah
I tried to explain
Ah, but baby, it's in vain

Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like amaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know",The Sweetest Thing,1997
Lauryn Hill,"I asked my mother, why do you cry?
She said your brother he just died
Well I told him not to go outside
He said he had to fight for his country's right
But don't you know that mo-mother

Don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no
Because the war is not over
Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (pow)

My brother's been dead ever since
I didn't beleive it, but when I saw him I was convinced
Two shots to the head he was already dead Lord
I headed for revenge in the city of Port Au Prince
Screaming bro-brother

Don't you know that we can't stop the violence, no
Because the war is not over
Until you can feel love, peace, and hear silence
But I smell gunpowder (pow)

Zion's gunpowder (pow) L.A.'s gunpowder (pow)
I wanna know why Christians pray for a new day
(We don't need no, we don't need no, we don't need no)
But its still the same way
I wanna know why ghetto people pray for a new day Hey, hey, heeey
And its still the same way
But the preacher man told me
Good things come to those who wait (Do good things come to those who wait?)
I wanna know tell me
Good things come to those who wait (Do good things come to those who wait?)
We wanna know, we wanna know, we wanna know

Lauryn Hill,"I remember comin' from Haiti growin' up in Brooklyn
On Flatbush got my first sneakers tooken
Learn the game quick so I got my first device
Mom moved to Jers' so we could get a better life
But little did she know a ghetto is a ghetto
Good times found myself like Jimmie Walker sayin' ""Cello""

Yellow cheese bus gettin' beatings if I cuss
Lay away another day in stripped Lees and Le Tigres
But the lyrical bomber momma tried to stop
Paranoid cause this boy around my neighborhood got shot
Name plait hair, straight metal braces on my teeth
Fat laces on my feet when crack first hits the streets

I use to push up on a girl Salt 'N' Peppa Push It Push It
D's in school cause the music was my focus
Jokes in class but when I learned I didn't pass
I knew it was my ass with my mothers leather lash
Belt buckle said Nelly Nel similar to Melle Mel
Hits the third rail Beat Street made Gazzels sells

As the tale gets poetic watch the streets turn magnetic
Tawana Brawley's rape is alleged
Hang out in hooky places watch streets corners turn to oasis
Young men aspire to be Scarfaces

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year

Late at night the light was bright on the [ave]
I went to pick up cash from my cousin little Kev
He told me Joe had a dream in jail he got steamed
His wife became a fiend fuckin' little Raheem
Damn, drugs will make you do terrible things
He told me when he get out he's murdering by any means
The day came I saw him on the train
He pulled his gun and aimed and started firing like the son of Kane
I saw civilians runnin' for their life
Like the devil on judgement night running from Christ
Ice and Amaretto please as I fell to my knees
Being shot by Ferguson the vigilante

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year

Clef it kind of remind me of this chick I once knew
Use to be a dime now she's strung out in Bellevue
See the serpent played tricks run game like the Knicks
Build you up just to lose the championship
I seen her reminisce over Wu-Tang could It Be that Simple
She lost her Prince cause there were Thieves In the Temple
Tragic depression made her lose all her teeth
Lost and turned out gave her body to the streets
Sweet Mary don't you weep
Still waters run deep
So be careful of the company you keep

In the year of the dragon lots of men disappear
Quiet as it's kept they won't be back next year",Year of the Dragon,1997

Well could it be that through these Cartiers I swear 
Their stares a specimen smooth as Sidney Poitier 
Clean cut & dapper seems he's straight & narrow 
Tingle in the bone marrow ??? 
But I ain't that aggressive instead I act suggestive 
Bat my eyelashes make smooth & subtle passes 
Timed perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses

Amountin' all the words to do magic 
With all due respect he approached it 
And offered the roach clip as I respectfully declined to smoke it 
[Nah nah I don't I don't do that]  
Broken the ice his demeanor was nice 
He tried to freak it to my mental

Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the dean, sirat al-mustaqim
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinkin' it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sleepy, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
Come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass because your thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again!
You know I only say it because I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem
Baby girl!  Respect is just the minimum
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans 
Fake nails up out Koreans 

Come again
Yo! A-When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)
When when come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)
My friend come again! (Yeah-Yeah!)

[Chorus]

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend 
Popping game (Like you got yen!) 
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pissed out by they waste men
Crystal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the ""big men.""
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child supports late
Money taking and heart breaking
Now you wonder why women hate men
The sleepy silent men
The punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men!
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?!
Unh-Unhh Come Again!
Bro-Straight come again!
Sit straight come again!

What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

I wrote these words for everyone who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception, instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)
We're so confused (We're so confused)
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that

Everything is everything
Everything is everything
After winter, must come spring
Everything is everything

I philosophy
Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen, from the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flipping in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper slash actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (Betty Shabazz)
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication

After winter, must come spring

How can I explain myself?
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do

Although them again we will never never never trust

Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

Fling skin grin while them plotting for you, true!

Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Me nah tellin' them no more)
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Be real, them not a clue!)
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things, to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do

Why every Indian want to be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gonna idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they comin', gunnin' I stand position

Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uh

Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this

That everyday people, they lie to God too

The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man

He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses blurred my sight
I used to love him but now I don't

I used to love him but now I don't
I chose a road of passion and pain
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen

Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
Torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated

For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled till the poison was gone

And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Father you saved me and showed me that life

Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets deeper than oceans
My soul was weary but now it's replenished

Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul

And totally let my creator control
The life which was his to begin with
I used to love him but now I don't",I Used to Love Him,1998

",Intro,1998
Lauryn Hill,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one

So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

But deep in my heart, the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be

Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that his strength is within me

Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like armoretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I`m, I`m not alone

But everybody told me to be smart

Lauryn Hill,"Fell real good wavin' your hands in the air
Admit two shots in the atmosphere
Put 'em up, put 'em up

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Remember when he told you he was about the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't here him, but gave him a little trim

To begin, how you think you're really going to pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus when, you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably do it again

Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the Gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?

Showing off your ass 'cause your thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem

Baby girl, respect is just the minimum
Nigga's creepin' and you still defending him
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at what you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails up out Koreans

Come again
Yo, when when come again
When when come again
My friend come again

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only, about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Tim's than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend poppin' game, like you got yen

Let's stop pretend, the ones that pissed out by they waste men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his Mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids

But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sleepy silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the scene, stop acting like boys and be men

How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?
Come again

Yo yo, come again
Bro-straight come again
Sit straight come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls you know you'd better, watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Guys you know you'd better, watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

Sweet sweet tell him

Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
'Cause he's all that I got and tell him

Tell him I need him 
Tell him I love him 
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect (I know I'm imperfect)
And not without sin (and not without sin)
But now that I'm older all childish things end and tell him

Tell him I need him 
Tell him I love him 
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
'Cause love is not boastful
Ooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright

Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared and tell him

Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him 
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

And no one ever will

You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (This is crazy, uh-huh)

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself?
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we've got to do

Lauryn Hill,"Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‚ÄòCause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

Lauryn Hill," 

Adam lives in theory
Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out 
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices
Praying to the alter of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else

He takes the unsuspected
'cause he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives

Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual

Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitaion in the field
She handed him her virtue
'cause he told her ""I won't hurt you""
So she lay with him to see how good it feels

Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dying by the poison she perceived to be good head
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
'cause everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion,
Next time just use protection

Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust,
Both of them were dealt to us
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion,
They can't even entertain the solution,
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution

Hiding from the truth,
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done

Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies

Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,
To this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do,
He will try us

Just don't regress,
Or slip into hopelessness
Once he's satisfied his love,
He won't deny us,

And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now",Adam Lives in Theory,2002

Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church of decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committing election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic deprivaty
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Apallin', callin' religious
Some program on television
How can, dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhD's in illusion
Masters of massconfusion
Bachelors in past illusion
Now who you choosin'
The head, the tail
The bloodshed of male
Or confidence in the tale
Conference is in Yale
Discussin' doctrines of bail
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word is nail
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, the true enemies defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb is Saddam and Minister Farakkkhan
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you
What authority do we do
When the majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand

Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them out really white
Internally they absent of light
trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse
Evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first
Angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth
Burnin' up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turning me ill
Let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real
Surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep
Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap
Causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come
Find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh
Self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed
Hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die
Let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you soughtwas based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught
Where the majority remains caught

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

Lauryn Hill,"Oh Jerusalem yeah, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem, oh Jerusalem...

Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Text book solutions are so improbable
'cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
...behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect, 'cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see, only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
'cause I... can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be in sanity
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God (?) don't need material

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord, with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall correct our paths
Be (?) you can follow him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem keeping them from perfection

Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare
...fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine, ye are the branches, He's in live in me
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit
Without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name
teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
...for why would he die
Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and his word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy face those lies within thee
Oh Jerusalem, providing you no protection

Oh Jerusalem...",Oh Jerusalem,2002

Soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress

I wish I didn't get so weak

Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me

So unattached within
So much that I learn
That I need somebody so
Still I'll just go on
Hoping that I'll find someone

Gotta find me an angel in my life

I know there must be someone, someone for me
I've lived too long without the love of someone

Lauryn Hill,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication leads to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand ""l-boogie's"" non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L's been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you want to ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now how come your talk turn cold?
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful
Every man want to act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't want to hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done?  it's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand man universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!
You can't hold god's people back that long
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!

You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done, it's so silly how come?

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?

Scales and beauty
Audio scenery
Electric love and

Written in memory
Beautifully crafted scenery
Complex or simplicity
Sonic energy
Piercing insensitivity
Sympathetic poetry
For some even identity
Collective entity
Something to belong to
A source of energy
The possibilities
Wave lengths and bandwidth
Higher vibration
Energizing entire lands with
Or stand for
Lovers to walk hand in hand with
Then plan for
Sanctuary chords
Harmony, melodies, even riffs can be
Disguised human essence
Sonically bottled ecstasy
Or melancholy
Agony blues angst
Exercising anxieties
Fueling entire societies
Making economies
Stimulating, generating
Inspiration synonymously
Entertaining expression
Intangible, invisible, but undeniable
Plays the language of excitement on survival
Some call it tribal
But perspective is everything
Connected to everything
Some say collectively everything

Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me 
No! 

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could

Had to lose myself, had to lose myself

Couldn't tell me I was love when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love. 
Should a told me just me because!
I'm worth receiving it 
But all I ever wanted was love 
There's is something awkward about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you!
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see! 

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself 
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is'

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head
So I peerlessly had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said!
So I could make it better

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself 
So I could love you better

Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you

Cried a whole lot years I suffered quietly 
And though it may have taken years I can finally!
Tell you that you were always on my mind!

I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself 
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did

Gotta recreate y'all 

Yo  check it,
Knowing you the best part of life  do I have the right to take yours 
Cause I created you  irresponsibly 
Subconsciously knowing the act I was a part of 
The start of something, I'm not ready to bring into the world 
Had myself believing I was sterile 
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl 
Turning this woman's womb into a tomb 
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need 
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed 
But someone, I would of fed this information I read 
to someone, my life for you I would of had to leave 
Instead I lead you to death 
I'm sorry for taking your first breath, first step, and first cry 
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially 
Having a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me 
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family 
I don't want to, go through the drama of having a baby's momma 
Weekend visits and buying J's ain't gon' make me a father 
For a while bearing a child is something I never wanted to do 
For me to live forever I can only do that through you 
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun 
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son 
I could have sacrificed going out 
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on

You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt 
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are

An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation 
Back and forth my feelings was pacing 
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it 
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it 
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust 
Busting, more than the sweat in somebody you trust 
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough 
And believe, having this child'll make us have to stay together 
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better 
Thinking we all in love cause we can spend a day together 
We talking spending the rest of our lives 
It's too many black women that can say they mothers 
but can't say that they wives 
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding 
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning 
It's so much in my life that's undone 
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one 
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from 
But I'm walking, finding myself in my God 
So I can, discipline my son with my writing 
Not have a judge telling me how and when to raise my seed 
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame 
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed 
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy 
So quit smoking the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy

Lauryn Hill,"We're living in a joke time, metaphorical coke time
Commerce and guru men, run the whole world man
Old drunken debauchery, old world brutality
Cold world kills softly, whole world runs savagely
Reading into prior things, program TV screens
Quick scam and drag queens, real likely to blast fiends
Think twice and past dreams, crime if you ask clean
Quick fast, the poison has entered the blood stream
Psychological master, consequences of tragedy
Mythological characters, men and women is parody
Superficial vanity, borderline insanity
Out of order humanity, crime committed so passively
Desperados and casualties, corporations want batteries
Explanations of strategies, domination and mastery
Own Jones in the bankrupt, grown people so corrupt
Light swords and yellow men, junkies in popularity
Culture so independent, vultures scavenge reality
Past feeling depravity to kings social cavity
Prey on human ignorance, popular immorality
Sympathy disease head, population misled
Self indulgent past dead, absence of the God head
Pimps, pushers and harlotry
Nepotism, no artistry
Despotism and privacy
Desperation, dishonesty
Physicist is your policy, more money, less equality
Inflated global ego, imitating reality
Fuel cycle pharaoh, poisonous poison arrows
Hypocritics on salary, idle hands that was agency
Predisposed to complacency, jealousy, and audacity
Contagious social gluttony, stages of mass malignancy
Effort to make conception, generation in atrophy
Glam life in debt, scam life in editors
Byproducts of neglect children hiding from creditors
Absence of self respect, fully scared of competitors
Lifestyle of luxury at someone's expense
Sensitive children, used up and sacrificed
Blind to the consequence, smoked up on dope pipes
Ecstasy, fast life, recklessly past life
Narcotics and cash fight, just neurotic society
Benefactors turned actors, addictions triple captors
Experience manufactures just neurotic toxic society

It's like post-war, they're looking for the Communists or who the Marxists is
Ten thousand pictures on Facebook, it's like the pot calling the kettle narcissist
Come on really, saying it's the devil, but you're the chief arsonist
Hypocrites can't even see their own part in this
No reflection, vampire paradigm
No introspect, this star track, star rant break down
Three months before pure obsession, picture can't take down
Children, this a shake down, they just looking for a sacrifice
They've been doing this since before Bobby Darin sang Mack the Knife
Before James Dean's car did a jackknife
Perhaps it's because they lack life or lack guts
Never confuse the head with the butt
Opinions are like assholes and most of 'em stink
I was told by a woman, so rethink
Don't ever let them ever lead you to drink
Leave you to doubt
Lead you to fall, get up, stand up, pass Lucifer out
Shake it up baby, watch them twist it and shout
Insecure assholes looking for a ticket
To ride on somebody like the picket
It's fucking wicked, shame on 'em
This neurotic toxic society

Sick cycle psychology in desperate need of psychiatry
Exorcism, sobriety, forcing social lobotomies
People stuck in dichotomies, pseudo-sicko anxieties
Serial criminals dressed in variety
Social transvestisms, subliminal dressed up as piety
Transforms projections like Cartesian images
Robbing innocence, stealing inheritance
Quiet victims with no defense portrayed over dollars and cents
Maladjusted ignorant malediction and dissonance
Too much addiction, no consciousness
Don't trust it, this cosmology is busted
Broken returns to the dusted, stems of corruption
Oppression, deceit, abuse and repeat
They don't feel complete unless they're robbing the sheep
Man is not a product if you call it that then stop it
In this neurotic godless society",Neurotic Society [Compulsory Mix],2013

Laverne Butler,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true

Can't feel insecure again 
You're the key and this I see

What I feel yeah love is real 
Ooh I might as well 
Sign my name on a card 
Which could say it better

Just about all that I can do do do

here's a fact I feel you can ignore no more. 

Verse One:  Frost

Homicide, on the murder scene
Another frustrated gang-related senseless slaying
Victim: a young product of the project system
The sad fact is nobody's gonna miss him
True, a few may stand in disbelief, but
The majority will sigh a relief
Because of the fact he was a menace to society
And gang violence was his first priority
So, now you take a look to see what this abouta
Someone quicka with the trigga, straight cold shot him
Dead, in a puddle of blood he lay,
Another typical day in the streets of L. A. 

Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder scene

Verse Two:  Frost
Ho-Homicide, and just for trying to act brave
Tryin' to be a hero sent you to a early grave
The violent death, it took place at around six
And eyewitnesses say that it went like this, 
There was this lady who was chillin' in a alley
Positive I.D. included that her name was Sally
Sally had just got off the bus from a job,
When she met three young thugs who decided to rob
A man heard the screams comin' from her mouth
Ran down the deserted alley just to check it out
And when he came across the scene,
He knew what was happenin', but by then it was too late
The thugs started blastin'
Now, asked in this situation, exactly what would you do?
If you heard someone screaming, would you go to the rescue?
My man, he tried, that's hwo he died
He was shot right between the eyes
Tryin' to do a good deed, shoot, that could've been me
I'm glad I'm not the one who must explain this to his family

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder 
scene 
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Break it down!

Verse Three:  Frost
Homicide, it's also know as manslaughter
It can be a father, mother, son, or daughter
It can happen at anyplace, at anytime
It can happen as I'm runnin' down this rhyme
First degree murder, blood flows red
One day you're alive, the next day, you're dead
Nobody seen nothin', the suspect fled
Shot on the spot with a bullet to the head
As soon as it happened, everybody broke
Nobody seen nothin', and of course nobody spoke
Bein' questioned, it doesn't pay to rat-a-tat-tat
For if you rat, you might too get the gat,
And get added to the list of those who fatally died
In the statistics, that's known as homicide

Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene

Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene
Ho-Homicide on the murder scene, on the murder scene, on the murder

A fire inside that I just don't believe

The french is the center now,
Hey boys that's great

when I woke up in hawthorne,
I took ocean down to the fairground to see everyone
So beautiful that I drown in the waves of the haircuts
Spin kicks and jumps
Well I got my bottled water and my nachos,
It came in under twenty bucks
I got this bad taste in the back of my mouth
From my time on the back of a bus

this summer vacation, it's cheap and it's true
It's ideals are intact, it's the best we can do
This time you turn into your own enemy
Not sell outs but dictated economies

(whoo!)

these thieves, these thieves in their flip-flops and bro attitudes
Are the very reason we do what we do
When I say fuck the man, it's what I believe
No matter who that man happens to be.
No matter who that man happens to be.

this kevin or that one, it all seems the same
Exploit the avenues, fix all the gains
Maybe they'll buy everything that you sell
But I'm outside these fences,
Rolling fast down that hill...

for your empty tale

Lawrence Arabia,"Since you met me you've been trying to pull me out of this apple pie bed
You've been pulling, you've been winching, you've been hoisting
But my legs are made of lead

And all I could hear from the very start was the frequency 
Of your beating heart
I was consumed with greed
You were like weed in a time of need
Lord, I got down on my knees and believed

Apple pie where my body's made of lead, oh
Apple pie bed, apple pie where my body's made of lead, ooh

Since you met me you've been trying to pull me out of this cold, defiant soup
You've been pushing, you've been pinching, you've been prodding
But my mind was in a loop

And all I could hear since the dawn of man was the ocean 
In a cola can
I was consumed by you
Was like beer in a glass to you
Girl, I don't know what I'd do without you

Lawrence Brooks,"Soft breeze, whispering trees
The summer winds are sighing
The leaves are lullabying
Violins are all around you
I can hear the chords resound
Of sounding brass
That seems to say I've found
I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke, did it start.
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?
You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of.
So Dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

Lawrence Brooks,"I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!

Bill, my boy Bill
I will see that he is named after me, I will.
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Aha-ha-ha-ha!
He might be a champ of the heavyweights,
Or a feller that sells you glue,
Or President of the United States,

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums

I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you,
That look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know its true
That visions are seldom all they seem
But if i know you
I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once,like what you did once upon a dream.
Once upon a night,
I dreamed we'd be together
In love forever.

I was wishing for a never,

Told me, told me that you did ask about me

You know being they got that lottery, I hit it
I'd like to kind of make up for
A lot of things that just seemed not to go right
Don't want you to think I'm trying to buy back your love or your friendship
But now I feel I got a chance to kind of make things up to you a little bit
Heh, enough about you and me
How's my little son
Hmm, he ever ask about me
Just a little bit
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket

Lawrence Tibbett,"Last night when we were young
Love was a star, a song unsung
Life was so new, so real so right
Ages ago last night

Today the world is old
You flew away and time grew cold
Where is that star that shone so bright
Ages ago last night?

To think that spring had depended
On merely this, a look, a kiss
To think that something so splendid
Could slip away in one little daybreak

So now, let's reminisce
And recollect the sighs and the kisses
The arms that clung

When we were young last night",Last Night When We Were Young,1995
Lawrence Tibbett,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love
This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover where can you be

You came at last
Love had its day
That day is past
You've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing

I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

I grow lonely
Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

I'll never know what makes that grass so tall
I only know there ain't no love at all

A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

Lawrence Welk,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suffering and shame;
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

O that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

In that old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see,
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.

To the old rugged cross I will ever be true;
Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
And exchange it some day for a crown.",The Old Rugged Cross,1971

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,1987
Lawrence Welk,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright

Of paradise, where roses grew

A-though I danced each girl in a twist and a-twirl
Ney one would do.
And I went a-my way 'til the fatal day
In the fling I was flung a-with you.
Oh

Now my heart is prancin'
A-gay as a lark and happy as a king.
The years I'll weather, in the hame on the heather,
With my one and only highland fling.
I thought you were fallin' for Andy MacPherson.

Ney, ney. He became an impossible person.
But what about you and that Connie MacKenzie?
She talked when I putted and drove me to frenzie.
But what of the lad known as Bobby MacDougal?

It pays to be thrifty, but he was too frugal.
And weren't ya daft about Megan McDerrmot?
I tasted her cooking. T'would make me a hermit.
How jealous I was of McDonald McCutcheon.

His neck had a head on, but there wasn't much in.
And what about Sandy?

His hands were too handy.
And wasn't there a Jenny?

I'm not wantin' any
I'm not wantin' any but you.

When I went a-dancin'
No special lad I was encouragin'.
Every lackly laddie was
My highland fling.

No glance I was glancin'.
Well, nothin' really worth a-mentionin'.
Hopin', watchin', waitin' for the
Real, real thing.

Though they spoke me soft in the moonlit oft',
Ney one would do.
'Til it came to pass to this lucky lass
In a fling I was flung with you.
Oh

Now my heart is prancin'.

And wondrous wishing wells
And nowhere else on God's green Earth
There be such lakes and dells

No wonder that the angels love
That shamrock covered shore
It draws my heart home again
And I love it more and more

Have you ever heard the story of
How Ireland got its name
Well, I'll tell you so you'll understand
From whence old Ireland came

No wonder that I love
That dear old land across the sea
For here's the way my dear old Father
Told the tale to me

Sure, a little bit of heaven fell
From out the sky one day
And it nestled on the ocean
In a spot so far away

And when the angels found it
Sure, it looked so sweet and fair
They said, ""Suppose we leave it
For it looks so peaceful there""

So they sprinkled it with stardust
Just to make the shamrocks grow
'Tis the only place you'll find them
No matter where you go

Then they dotted it with silver
To make its lakes so grand
And when they had it finished
Sure, they called it Ireland!",A Little Bit of Heaven (Shure They Call It Ireland) [*],2008

Expect the unexpected you never know what you learn
You never know what you do or what you'll get in return
See life is like a mission, you only get what you earn
But you would be in attention you really didn't deserve
But now we're feeling vicious
I kicked the bitch to the curb
And you have been booted
That's just how we do it
If I had a remote then you would be muted
But you made your choice and now you feeling foolish
But ask me how I feel
I don't give a mass of two shits (Ha!)

I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, dirty when you talk

(Dirty talk)

Kitten Heels, Lingerie,
Pantyhoes, Foreplay,
Legs up, on the bar,
In the back of your car,
Latex, champagne,
Bubble bath, whipped cream,
Cherry pop tag team,
Can you make me scream

I wanna do some dirty things to you tonight,
I wanna fight, all through the night, night

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, dirty when you talk

(Dirty talk)

Blindfold, feather bed,
Tickle me, slippery,
G-spot, nasty pose,
In a video
Love machine, by myself,
Climax,hot wax
S&M on the floor, I like it hardcore

I wanna do some dirty things to you tonight,
I wanna fight, all through the night, night

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, dirty when you talk


I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, dirty when you talk

(Dirty talk)

Can you go down,
Are you up for it, baby
Can you turn me out, are you up for it

Talk to me talk to me
Talk dirty to me talk dirty to me

Talk to me talk to me
Talk dirty to me talk dirty to me

(Dirty talk)

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, dirty when you talk

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, dirty when you talk

Layne Brooks,"This town ain't big, this town ain't small
It's a little of both they say
Our ball club may be minor league but at least it's triple A
We sit below the Marlboro man, above the right field wall
We do the wave all by ourself
Hang off, a blind man could've made that call

We like beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher what's his name
Well we can't even spell it
We don't worry about the planet much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats

The game was close, we'll call it a win
Go off to toast the boys again
That local band is back in town
They got a kinda minor league sound
They're not that bad, they're not that good
But all in all it's understood
We wanna dance, they wanna play
We wouldn't have it any other way

We like beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher what's his name
Well we can't even spell it
We don't worry about the planet much
We just like to see the boys hit it deep
There's nothing like the view from the cheap seats
Cheap seats

Now the majors called up oh what's his name
And one more buildin' rises come
And suddenly we're all grown up
And this old town not quite so small
But I'll always miss the middle size town
In the middle of the middle-west
With no name pitchers and local bands
And mustard and relish and all the rest

We like beer flat as can be
We like our dogs with mustard and relish
We got a great pitcher what's his name
Well we can't even spell it

Layne Redmond,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,2000

Why does December seem sunny as Spring?

Why is each new task a trifle to do?

So you better change your location

Mo Thug be the love
Slug for the perfect picture
Chronic bud to save your struggles
So somebody suffer, scriptures
Time to rip ya, hit ya really good
I'll split ya, ditch ya
Gotta put ya in my hall of flames
And damn, it's shame
Listen up tight you can hear the storm, it's a hurricane
Bone, II Tru, Hustla'z, and Shifters (We are the soldiers!)
Bustas, no need to be runnin' from trues
Sucka, get murdered with skills
The ? to peel ya, straight up from infantry
Wars begin, we done sayin' they playin' to win
But we got it all within
So roll with the sheets, 'cause the thugs, they creep
Go and step on the ? with the midnight streets
Where they playin' for keeps, so fake soldiers...

[Mo! Hart]
Late hours of the eve
Now brothas out schemin'
Tryin' to break your heart
Gotta alleviate the problem before it even start
Sit relax and never losin' my composure
Brotha done told ya, better beware
'Cause this Mo Thug click got plenty of soldiers
Just open your eyes and realize
It's gonna be Mo Thug 'til I die
Never esitate don't flip
I can pin you all in them disguises
So if you want to come test
Definite action must proceed
But before it goes down
I gots to alert the rest of my family

[Jhaz]
why'all want no lovin' to a sister flowin'
Face me, you claim to be the sweetest
But the style I flex is crazy, never again no struggles
See Mo Thug, we on the rise everyday
I feel the swisha as my method of the high
No more want for money or place to eat or sleep
You see we family, now
Comin' up in game backdoor with the heat
Krayzie's friends out the walls
? by my lonely, before a sista was broke
Blow up Mo Thug open up more money...

[Souljah Boy:]
It be the Mo Thug, it's buck, quick bandages
One of these soldiers just can't stand 'em
Make me had to do a one-eighty-seven (one eighty-seven)
With a MAC-10, reactin' like you really want to know what's happenin'
Down with buckin' why'all with me strap and best a be duckin'
'Cause I'm blastin' real fast when I see fake-ass O.G.'s

[Ken Dawg]
I'm ridin' real; Mo Thug is where I be
I'm down with Ken
So put 'em up as I cock the pistols
Fin to dip home, get shot
Blown, who the next blown?

[Sin]
Tell me have you ever had this feelin'
Or a vision, that you played major part in a killin'?
The man that you murdered let's say for instance
That it's sickness and you did him
Pull the trigger bust the gun (are they evil)
The motive was death
You took his breath without a second guess
His chest was littered with blood
That pop unleashed, now fill the bag
Along with the shells from the slugs
And when they finally found him
All they got was the smell and the skull
Now further endanger the species
'Cause these niggas they plot
They rush up on the block with shots
From fully automatic weaponry
They had to be a least two or three cars deep
Then all of a sudden
One came up hatin' face to face with ?
Come around our way, you lay six feet
In a grave underneath in a coffin

[Tony Tone]
It's that Hustla with Hustla'z poetically known as Tony Tone
With them thugstas and Shifters, trues, and a playa
Let it be known that we're trues with weapons
Double I'm steppin', Mo Thug militant soldiers
Sucka better feel this bass
On the real, this fake
Don't needs this in this click
Now, you want to ride or die
Because there's hatred in your eyes?
I'd advise stay wise, better pray to God
'Cause these scriptures might
Just rip your mentals straight apart
It's from the heart
Demons that drop our lives got pinned inside
Realized they fell off
So many want to roll, but don't know how we stroll
They never know we're good go
So let's make our dough, for sure

Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the Bone

Flamin' my dank, and drinkin' brew

This click of soldiers, who keep it real until the end
Some green in their hand, and we in it again, right

[Brina]
Let a sista nip this in the bud
You can't face me, this playa
Hell of a rhyme, sayin' these family scriptures
The last to remain by sneakin' up on you, backdoor
Hear 'Brina comin' relentlessly bustin'
Trues bringin' the drama for them bustas, never no bluffin'
No, gotta run my game tight
Never know weaklings, when a sista fall victim hit 'em
We Cleveland original money makers up in your system

It's the Mo Thug Family Scripture
We singin', my people and me
Ya better believe the family tree's much deeper
Than what you see and believin'
Hey, gotta give up peace to the love inside of my halo
Gotta stay headstrong for soldiers
Like I told ya we need peace (Dear Lord, can you help me?)
(Never forget) to pray for the people
'Cause when you need 'em, they there
You better beware Mo Thugs' steppin' with weapons
We comin' with the word of the Lord
To teach the people not knowin', we showin'

Don't step in our face or my bullets ?
Fed up with these haters, I'm breakin' 'em up
'Cause they fakers, and fakers fakin'
Pullin' them gat on Mo Thugs
But ain't no soldiers, this lunatic get the chrome
Now they get gone (on the dark
'cause the gat flipped) with them roll
And handlin' them demons makin' me crazy
Knowin' that Gates can't be fucked with
When I'm swangin' them thangs
I'm feelin' ?, and I'm bustin' men
Gotta load me clip when I rip
Then slip them slugs up out the chamber
Shoulda flexed upon me, stranger

Busta, you in danger
Tell 'em they in danger

All consequence

I take it that flippin'
Realize what it is that you have missed
Attention: be down for the family
That don't get no realer than this
Now what you gonna do when that won't get better, man?
You playin' within the game
That's why we done train and prayin' everyday
Family never divided
You heard it before, but this time you can buy
Some bustas fell off, we leave 'em behind
I'm mean we tried, but they could not fall in line
So this is what we've done, hell: eliminated haters, every one
Keepin' it real, makin' a mill
How do you feel? (I just want a mill, mill)

Takin' a journey deep on the darkside

I'm headed for the background
When I'm runnin' through a touchdown like Mike Prewitt
Wonder how we doin' it to prove it?
Guess who, and it's this doin' nothin'
But the quick pull-ups
And you get full of some bullets snitch split
Put that ass in ditch, flip, ?
You're dead. I'm too swift
Lit your block up like Christmas trees, you offendin' me
You were no kin to me, you my enemy
As a matter of fact, you off key
And all I see is R.I.P
Fin to jack those, lookin' for the backdoor
Fin to act up, when you got robbed
You ain't fast enough
Take ten paces back and watch me blast shit up
Enough about my section, without directions
Got to catch 'em, got to fetch 'em like a dog would do
Roof, roof, you oughta be amazed
And dazed at all the shit I've been through
That's why I pick you to be the listener
Bendin' the rules that I be makin'
Think they're real, but they're fakin'
I'm a killa, cap peeler, the realer
Bow down, and I'm about to get with ya
Sit back with the guys, smoke a Swisha
Motivate and contemplate how
I'm a have to go get ya (multiple personality)

Um, you distur-, -turbed in the brain
It isn't worth it - to battle me it'll take fists
But believe it: we can hurt you
Sharp pains to your chest, man, layin'
""Oh, you think we're impressed with your thing?""
I can see straight through you like water

Little nigga hear the fall out

Roll a Lex coupe, so swoop, and Benz drop-top

Picture me rollin', strollin'

Everywhere it's smoke in the air

Even down the way, they smoke a pound a day
With my diamonds on the world
Comin' through a nigga hood
Niggas got sacks, tryin' to kick it, blueback
Soldiers, sell me somethin' good
Now I'm feelin' alright
Do it all night long
Kick it to the break of sunlight

Sendin' niggas invitations to a gunfight

I'm checking for ya ladies, where ya at? 
If I could go back, way back 
I swoop that n**** E up in my Caddillac, and we could hit a corner, get a fat a** sack 
Yes, I'm checking for the ladies, where ya at?

Remember that cool a** n****, true thugs, my n****, that G that put me on
Thinking about it, it should'nt go wrong, why would a n**** Eazy-E, he gone 
Never really had a chance to say thank you for giving Mo Thug mo love, and now that you laugh and sing on up above, you gotta be laughing, n****s we set it off multi platinum

Stacking my chips, I'm dropping these hits down every hour 
And I been smoking these weed trees with them sticky leaves
Blaze to the mighty power 
Six deep in the Benz-O, 6-double-O thug stroll to the studio, little Lay, Kray, Biz, Wish, Flesh Here to rhyme so cold, rap flow never heard before

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

If I can go back, I be me and Stack, hitting, thugging it in drawely 
When all of this rapping was really a hobby 
Rolling in a Malibu, mobbing with Wally
To this day, feeling like yesterday, when it was Bizzy, Flesh, [Wish], lil?Lay, and Kray

We took a one-way ticket to L.A. 
Creeping on a come up, we had to meet Eazy, better believe me  
Them was the good times, dropping them good rhymes, yes indeed 
And you know we put it down for the love of the cheese, for the love of the game, and the real O.G.s
 
For the love of my Cs, I'm a let it be known
Hip hop thugsta, clique tight with the bones 
And a war been on since the first song 
Remember them Northcoast thugstas splitting your dome 

Hit em home with Tha Crossroads
Dedicated to the lost souls  
Bennefit ya, forever we miss ya 
Better believe that well never forget ya 

Take a picture and capture the moment 
On a quest for the best, its victory 
Nevertheless, we stress this history 
Is you feeling me, is you hearing me?

As we ride, as we roll, roll 
Reminiscing out the games we played 
Those were the days, those were the days 
Never let em slip away

I sending my chrome upside your dome, hater, disrespect my home, n****, lets get it on 
Fifth Dog flipped out, and its on 
Oh no, y'all testing the Flesh-N-Bone, you wrong 

Too many true soldiers set up for murder, stuffed 
Unsolved, and it makes me wonder who really involved in killing our prophets. 
Crossing them off the list, b****es 
So we still on the rise, it ain't no surprise 

Beat us, so violent, rowdy Mo Thug riders

Verse 1

And when it began it was the world
And we got heard again and again
And all that the world was kept with God
In ? in it was God himself the boyfriend
And everything that was made
Was made by him
Without him nothing would be in existence
Hit them up psycho
For the life what's life
For me it's this rapping and this ? this shine
Figure it out and again
The Lord oh yes
The Lord has spoken a world
And the word was me flesh
Now every last word that is spoken from the God comes
alive
And giving it you will need it
Exercise good teaching prophesy
In the last days
Open your mind and focus your eyes
And pay attention
Listen off course to what they be kicking up words
So fix them in your eardrum
You want some now come get some
Many mo faking no less
Send and a merchant
You probably see the gift and pick it up hutch
Protest this plain it simple
Get it then let it
Mo got the blessing
Cause then he is resting
Don't let these demons mess and distract him
If you let them
Suggest you pick up the bible
Then you say hellow
Then they protect you, Holy Ghost
Here be the original cost of cig
And them all keep smoking

Chorus (2x)

Jesus wept, get to you
Nobody sought to work in his footsteps in the beginning
When he was placed on the face of the earth
Onto the cross, onto resurrection
Lots found the Lords direction
If you want to leave it there
Only Jesus Christ be willing to find
Then follow the rapper the Lord got here
Who ever think now but the change
They got chains bound to their souls
Oh no, here come on again
5th dog holler and hail they go
Letting and foe
Flesh harass those so cold
When I put it down rapping
You want to diss this out it
Never then put my pistol in your mouth
What's happening monster?
Break off the enemy taking more conches
Leave it alone to sieve in the world
I'm taking no nonsense
His coming since defeat them and you stay
And safe up with your own last
Put your ass
Keep sending and ever repent
Take a look at your past
You nothing like in the first lane
You seemingly suddenly like in sane
Gotta maintain

But ain't nobody said it was gonna be easy
You know what I mean?
Together we stand
That's how we're struggling
Divided we fall
What's happenin ya'll?
What's crackin?

Ain't nothing changed since I was a kid
Nothing but the days, months and the years
Putting it down and keeping it serious
Trying to keep from shedding these tears
You would have thought that it would have got better
Making that rapping and doing these shows
But to me it only got worse
Close to (?) nobody knows
The real steam, the reason why, I do the things that I do
Getting so high, drinking these brews
Feeling like I've got nothing to lose
I payed my dues and the Lord blessed me
But now I pray to save my mother, and my brother
Lord please help me
Heavy loads should be for heavy people
But niggas just trying to provide for their family
Facing cops and evil
And we need our higher powers
So what I'm going to do is keep my prayers to the sky for you
Won't tell no lie for you, but nigga I'm willing to die for you
Undivided, reunited
With the fist in the pyramid
Right about now I'm about to tip my lid
Somebody tell me what this is
A dream, a reality, my sanity about to give in
Got the fame and the fortune but this ain't living

This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road
This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road

From the past, the present through, I'm talking about the struggle
The shit hit me so hard I be swearing I'm seeing devils
Sometimes it makes me wonder how I hold and maintain
No matter which direction always seems against the grain
What to do, what to do? I'm praying for solution
In the course that I be kicking have me in a institution
Trying to rid this life, of one I didn't chose
How you gonna fuck me, I payed my dues
Every minute of my life I be trying to focus
Just when I think I got it someone make me know it
Ain't the way I need to be
And my eyes way heavy but 
I keep on pushing 'cause I ain't livin' for nothing

This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road
This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road

On a quest for peace, on a quest for peace
But I can't escape these wicked streets 
Got me to realise that I could jeopardize
A chance for my kids to be
What they want to be and what they could be
And I ain't trying to be that hoody 
But I wish somebody understood me so they could see the good in me
Trying to do thangs to make the world better
And everybody hittin' me to be doing what I'm doing
Strickly out here chasin this cheddar
Ain't nothin' free ain't nothin' fair to me
So all in all it's only me 
Take care of me and you should be doing the same thang

Trying to do to much explainin'
When the key is really maintainin'
Waitin' for the Lord to stop the rainin'
Playing it safe we got to check ourselves
Before we wreck ourselves
First we got to respect ourselves
'Cause a nigga won't give us nothin' else
Don't sit there and talk me to death
Go and get off your thang
I'm a see a change when you make a change
I believe I know the game 
Enduring our pain 'cause you got to take it
And if you want it you'll make it
See the drama and shake it
Get your mind right 

This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road
This ain't livin', but it's the only thing I know 
This ain't livin', I've got to find a higher road

He's on drugs 'cause he's unhealthy
Family's splitting up 'cause they're struggling
Somebody out there, don't you feel the need?
Feeling hopeless 'cause I'm in (?slowly?)
I'm lookin' for a better day
I be praying for a better day

mixed together with a pinch of they sensual side that gets me energized 
Fly and confidant, respected and highly dominant 
Got me on the rise every time he draw me with compliments 
Joey I'm fallin for a thug, should I sacrifice 
or let it go brother you never gave me bad advice 
[Fat Joe] 
It's only right that I let you know which route to go 
No doubt fo' sho', once he hits it, he's out the do' 
Know I seem like a cock-blocker, but he's not proper 
Besides you're my little sis, I gotta watch ya 
Gotta stop you from dealin with snakes 
You're sealin your fate let alone I feel it's your wake 
Eliminate all the wrongs in your life 
Don't you fall for them guys, like Pun says, it's all in the eyes 
[Interlude + hook] 
[Fat Joe] 
I only speak on what I know, he cheats, he gotta go 
You think he ain't gon' creep (not at all) 
That's a damn shame, I see you fallin for this man's game 
The truth is even if he want it man he can't change 
That's the life of a player livin lies like the mayor 
Hittin them thighs, be wise and beware 
But don't be surprised, one day you'll find a decent guy 
Someone that cares and provides a piece of mind 
[Angie] 
I know you right, but I'm torn inside 
I got a jonz for a boy that was born to ride 
My only vice(?), saw the guy, leave my momma mortified 
It's no surprise, it happens all the time 
Got me stressin and I'm comin back for me 
Got me, checkin my messages expectin him to call 
I need to, let it go need to stay focused 
But can't, forget him yo so I remain hopeless

As the world turns round and round
These last days, so crazy, oh I

Everyday

As the world turns round and round

They tellin' me the crime is decreasin'
And what is the reason for the brutality? Huh
They killing these niggas in cold blood, Bone Thug
Been a part of the reality, all the insanity, ain't no more humanity

What ever happened to family?
Lost men way back in the game, back when the crack came.
And it ain't too much changed here today
Seems like it's neva' gon' get betta'

Wonder if we'll ever get to live in peace, these days of our lives
They keep on getting shorter everytime that I realize
That it won't be too long before, we wake up and the world is gon'
And it won't be no World War, it'll be Armaggedon fo' sho'

Well, what is there to do when you out there stunnin' like, ooh?

And I can feel your pain young thugs, stay focus

Even though the end of days are comin', comin'
You can get it right, right now do something for somebody

Sometimes I sit back and I think, why me?
Now how did I become a victim of the struggle?
Everyday tryin' to piece this puzzle
And every second I'm out on the hustle, I sit and I gussle

Hopin' reality done pass me by, right on by
And I'm not gonna' sit and lie, all of my life is bein' fine
Like a test on wheels, a lot of determination and skills
And the death ain't neva' come easy

Now with a nickel gotta pay these bills and scrape this meal
Feed the man in the house, gotta' keep that money comin'
I gotta' be out here doing somethin'
Rather than sit back broke with nothin'

Can you feel me? If I have to come and get chu I'ma get chu
You gon' feel me and what did they say about Lil' Lay?
He's a ghetto legend, niggas is out here threatnin'

For pay, sometimes I miss when we were kids is all
Now since ninety-five back when Eazy died of a A-I-D's
Oh what a disease an' how many harmony out could it be now

Everybody wanna keep us twisted you better believe it
Little Eazy whispers different gotta keep my distance
Me payed up on the buildin' none of us used that
Just don't stop until I get shot, shot wheelin' and dealin'

Me back in the day from the crack lock yeah
I see Greg roll it I seen bad murder, murders

And the hard headed came to break it down, lick it out

Resurrection of the radical, none of these rappers compatible
Ready for combat, fanatical, tragedies never tattle
Automatic guns rattlin', moppin' up blood stains, grievance
And I done seen about everything in the world but Jesus

I been to Armageddon, under war, one disciple
Tear it up and start it all over, let me rewrite the Bible
My shit's maniacal, drink Henny until I spit up bile

Divided hands
A pact of treachery
A knife in the back

Suppressing fire

Lazyboy,"The warmest welcome to everybody reading the manual
The manual gives you the basic information
About the ingredients and the six step easy to follow guide
Please pay attention to the useful advice and the helpful tips
As we lead you through

Ingredients
You need, a small piece of thick paper as a mouth piece
The most common is to use the top side
From a hard top cigarette pack

You need large size rolling papers
One of the best brands on the market is smoking
Because their rolling papers are very thin
And are the perfect size

You need tobacco
The finest tobacco is hand rolling tobacco
But a second possibility
Is to use the tobacco from a normal cigarette

You need, pot, grass, ganja, marijuana
It has various names
But they all refer to the following three main types

Weed, weed is the bud from hemp plants
The effect is usually uplifting and mellow
Hash, hash is the pressed pollens and resins of the marijuana plant
You will experience a more relaxed feeling
And a stronger effect than weed

Skunk, skunk is the artificially grown hemp plant
And is usually the strongest of the three
There are different ways to make a joint
But we have produced this six step easy to follow guide

One, if you have hash you need to heat it and crumble it
If it's weed, you need to remove the seeds first
And then crumble it as well

Two, roll the mouth piece
Fold the end of the paper three times
And then roll it in to a cylindrical form

Three, take the rolling paper
And hold it with the gum side on top away from you
Four, now mix the weed, hash or skunk with the tobacco
On the rolling paper

A good mix makes the joint burn nice and smooth
But be careful
Half a gram is enough to get four people stoned
If you're beginners

Five, begin rolling
Place the mouth piece in one end of the rolling paper
Then start rolling from the middle going outwards
Let your thumbs do the walking
And try to give support and pressure with your fore fingers

Six, wet the glue and seal the joint
Now you have a joint
It?s up to you what you want to do with it",The Manual [Chapter 4],2006

Love? Well we've been married almost fifty years
You have to try real hard and work at it
And look away

Love it hurts and love is the truth
Love never lies, love is not jealous
And love is beautiful

Be faithful to the one you love
Remain true to the one you love

Love is my Harley Davidson American made
Nothing like it in the world

I'm first in everything
If I can't love myself, I can't love you

Love the flower love the trees love everything

When you open your eyes in the morning
You say it's a love for me I'm happy

Don't settle no matter how old you are
If you're a girl thirty years old and your biological clock is ticking
Coz you feel like you have to have a child
Unless you find a person
Don't settle
Keep looking
Even if you don't find that person till your forty or forty five
Keep looking

Follow your heart that it

Don't go after the beauties

There's a very thin line between
You know being open to love
And just letting someone take advantage of you

Keep it with god and in your heart
And it works out pretty good
You can't be evil, you gotta have good in your heart

Go with the flow

Never lose respect

Don't get your heart broken

I mean don't be too weary

Love yourself then it all kind of
It kinda goes out from that direction
I think a lot of people try to find things and people and cause
Without searching for it within themselves
You got to hit the base first
Or its all kinda hollow

Best thing to do is it talk about it
Whatever it is just talk
Even if it risks the other person getting angry

You don't go to bed angry at each other

Sono in classe col prof che ci urla
‚ÄúRagazzi c‚Äô√® troppo casino, silenzio‚Äù
Per√≤ fare silenzio √® un casino
Il silenzio non √® degli innocenti
Ma √® di chi lo compra
Io spesso ho parlato e detto la mia
Anche se non era mia la colpa
Il silenzio √® di chi lo ascolta
E magari anche di chi lo affronta
Io sono qualcosa che non √® pi√π tuo
Come le parole che hai in bocca

Delle volte parlo, delle volte meno
Alle volte piango, altre volte tremo
Poche volte saggio, tante volte ingenuo
Il silenzio √® oro ma se lo sprechi √® zero
So che dormo poco e che √® notte tarda
C‚Äô√® chi tace e ascolta, chi non pensa e parla
So che un ferro uccide, che la voce √® un‚Äôarma
So che gli occhi parlano pi√π di certe labbra",Silenzio,2017
Lazza,"Solo i fogli che ho io in casa
Sanno quello che c‚Äôho in testa
La mia psiche fucking drama
E pensa che manco l‚Äôho scelta
Io sono lo stesso di prima
Ho solo i tattoo da galera
E so che se penso al futuro mi tocco le palle
S√¨, come in barriera
Ho imparato ‚Äòsta roba per strada senza codici vari
Ma il mio lato migliore √® da un po‚Äô che sta a casa
Come ai domiciliari
Odio le gare, rischio di farsi legare
L‚Äôora legale, che presupposti
Che ne sai che mi invento una svolta
E riscrivo la storia in quell‚Äôora che sposti
Vedo i cloni di cloni di cloni, pecora Dolly
Fottiti la vita a pecora e dormi
Non realizzarsi fa schifo
√à per questo che sto a un metro dai sogni
√à duro il destino finch√© non sei un cocco di mamma
Non ho mai cash, frate‚Äô corto di braccia
√à come un thriller col doppio di suspence
Datemi il colpo di grazia
E ne ho visti un sacco che c‚Äôhanno tentato
Flow √® un attentato
Parli di strada, ma in strada tu non ci sai stare
Sembra che sei neopatentato
Parlami proprio se pensi che faccio ‚Äòsta roba per moda
Seduto al banco io prendevo note, ora niente pi√π scuola
Torno per dettare legge che intorno che prender√† nota

Sono in studio fr√† mi sembra L.A., e-e-ehi
Prendo questa tipa e poi la porto a casa take away, e-e-ehi
Pi√π guardo i tuoi amici fake, ehi
Fr√† pi√π voglio bene ai miei, ehi
√à da un po‚Äô di tempo che fanno il tuo nome e io non so ancora chi sei, ehi

Lo sai che c‚Äôho il fuego nel sangue
Le foto sui banner in after
Il culo in un paio di Balmain
Tu spacchi s√¨ un paio di palle
Sappiamo che vuoi fare il gangster
E muovere un K di M
In sella d‚Äôun KTM
Ma giri con la Bati M, yeah
No conversazioni, soldi, muoviti ti ho detto, yeah
A me la Corona come Dominic Toretto, yeah
Non mi hanno mai visto fallire
Parli di pistole, palline
Poi c‚Äôhai la pistola a palline
Me lo ricordo come fosse ieri
Che sembravo 50 fuori da Foot Locker
Per le sneakers in vetrina
La mia alternativa forse era di fare il clocker
Anche perch√© le strade
Tolto 'sto successo che stiamo facendo erano poche
Mo √® diverso se passiamo, sai che abbiamo fatto fr√†
E tieni le orecchie basse come un cocker

Lazza,"Ehi, non chiedermi quando ti vedo
Chiedimi quanto ti devo
Quelli che parlan di pi√π
Di solito fanno di meno
In zona mia il mio nome sui muri
E giuro non l‚Äôho scritto io
Mi piace qualcuno che copia
O per qualcuno sono Dio
‚ÄòSta pussy mi fa uscire crazy
Serio mi fa uscire crazy
Faccio il gesto di scoparla
S√¨, come i gatti cinesi
Il mio flow ti buca addoso
Il tuo flow mi asciuga troppo
Il mio flow tipo un AK
Il tuo flow √® un accappatoio, ah ah
Ne ho 22 come Kak√†
Alla fine sento fare blabla
Tu fai la star, Lady Gaga
Quella tua lady non ti caga
Siamo io, me stesso e me nel posto
Insieme a qualche scappato di casa
Dammi uno stipendio a serata
Magari scappano di casa

Per i frate‚Äô sono Zzala
Sanno il mio nome a memoria
A chi mi ha detto ‚Äúfarai strada‚Äù
Gli ho risposto ‚Äúfar√≤ storia‚Äù
Sono pieno di tattoo ignoranti
Senza Educazione Siberiana
Quando sta piovendo in zona
√à perch√© sono fuori casa

Sedicesimi nella mia testa
Non la voglio quella maglia Bershka
Lari che mi fanno la richiesta
Giro quella ma poi fumo questa
Spendi bene questi soldi
Che ti sei vestito male
Sembri l‚Äôispettore Gadget
Senza rispetto del budget
A ‚Äòsta tipa non le manco
Giuro, manco per il cazzo
Anzi frate‚Äô forse s√¨
Fr√† le manco per il cazzo
Habla habla sono il diablo con le Nike
Nuove di un altro colore
Fr√† ho quel super io che mi ricorda
Devi essere sempre superiore
Ti sorrido ma ti odio
Il tuo disco non √® ancora uscito, s√¨
Ma quando esce volano risate
Pi√π che un disco sembra un matrimonio
Trito, giro, lecco, chiudo, accendo e fumo fino a che sono uno spettro
Vorrei parlare col capo
Per√≤ qua non c‚Äô√® uno specchio
