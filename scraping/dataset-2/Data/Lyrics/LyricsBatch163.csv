Don Braden,"A few stolen moments is all that we share
You've got your family and they need you there
Though I've tried to resist being last on your list
But no other man's gonna do
So I'm saving all my love for you

It's not very easy living all alone
My friends try and tell me find a man of my own
But each time I try I just break down and cry
'Cause I'd rather be home feeling blue
So I'm saving all my love for you

You used to tell me we'd run away together
Love gives you the right to be free
You said be patient just wait a little longer
But that's just an old fantasy
     
I've got to get ready just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love for you
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you

No other woman is gonna love you more
'Cause tonight is the night that I'm feeling alright
We'll be making love the whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yeah I'm saving all my lovin'
Yes I'm saving all my love for you 
For you",Saving All My Love for You,1995
Don Braden,"All or nothing at all
Half a love, never appealed to me
If your heart, never could yield to me
Then I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love, there is no in between
Why begin then cry, for something that might have been
No I'd rather (rather) have nothing at all

But please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes, the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may go dizzy and fall

And if I fell (I fell) under the spell of your call
I would be, caught in the undertow
So you see, I've got to say no, no
All or nothing at all",All or Nothing at All,1999
Don Braden,"Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you
Now to say
That I've got to throw my
Castle away

Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from
Too far away
For you to say come back some
Other day

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me
Now to find
The love that I sought can never
Be mine

And though you don't believe
That they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you
Would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

And though the odds
Say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you
Will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over
You, over you",Overjoyed,2000
Don Braden,"If you hear
A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song so gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies
A prelude to a kiss",Prelude to a Kiss,2001
Don Braden,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2002
Don Braden,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,2008
Don Braden,"Once I had a secret love,
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love,
Became impatient to be free

So I told a friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are,
And why I'm so in love with you

Now, I shout it from the highest hills
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's
No secret anymore.",Secret Love,2008
Don Braden,"Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes.",Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds,2012
Don Brewer,"Out on the road for forty days
Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze
Sweet, sweet Connie, doin' her act
She had the whole show and that's a natural fact
Up all night with Freddie King
I got to tell you, poker's his thing
Booze and ladies, keep me right
As long as we can make it to the show tonight

Four young chiquitas in Omaha
Waitin' for the band to return from the show
Feelin' good, feelin' right, it's Saturday night
The hotel detective, he was outta sight
Now these fine ladies, they had a plan
They was out to meet the boys in the band
They said, come on dudes, let's get it on
And we proceeded to tear that hotel down

I got her number, sent her phone a cheeky photo
Hey, fella who you talking to? I dunno
And now you've got an idea of the kind of guy I'm really like

You forgave me and I really couldn't ask for more (I'm not good enough, I wasn't good enough)
So I took aside the girl from work and told her
Whatever she thought we had going was over
And then she started kissing me I couldn't tell her how to stop
I wasn't good enough, I wasn't good

Go down that line, devise some plan, some way to tell you

Don Byas,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep

Don Byas,"Perdido,
I look for my heart
It`s perdido
I lost it way down in Torito
The day the fiesta started

Bolero,
I sway that they play the Bolero
I kissed me the listing sombrero
And that`s when my heart departed

High, was the sun when I held him close
Low, was the moon when we said, ""Adios""

Perdido
My heart ever since is Perdido
I know I must go to Torito
To find what I lost Perdido

Don Byas,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1995

I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me, melody, haunting me
Sweet and lovely sweeter than the roses in May
And she loves me, there is nothing more I can say

Haunts my reverie

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Don Byas,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2001

Don Campbell,"As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)

Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm

We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky",As,2001

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out

I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, Ive laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

",My Way,1995

",Tenderly,1995
Don Cherry,"In the hustle of the day we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much

A word, a smile, and a kiss
When a woman loves a man he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realise

She may be weary, women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary try a little tenderness

She may be waiting, just anticipating
Things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental she has her grief and her care
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear

You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness

",Try a Little Tenderness,1995
Don Cherry,"Beautiful miracle, pardon my lyrical rhapsody,
But can't you see, you've captured me.
Being so glamorous, can't you be amorous just with me?
Make it soon, take a look at the moon.

Love is just around the corner, any cozy little corner.
Love is just around the corner when I'm around you.
I'm a sentimental mourner, and I couldn't be forlorner,
When you keep me in a corner just waiting for you.
Venus de Milo was noted for her charms,
But strictly between us, you're cuter than Venus,
And what's more you got arms.
So cuddle in a corner, any cozy corner,
Love is just around the corner and I'm around you.",Love Is Just Around the Corner,1995
Don Cherry,"I've never wanted wealth untold
My life has one design
A simple little band of gold
To prove that you are mine

Don't want the world to have and hold
For fame is not my line
Just want a little band of gold
To prove that you are mine

Some sail away to Araby and other lands of mystery
But all the wonders that they see will never tempt me

Don Cherry,"When I walk up Main Street
It isn't the same street
To me it's a haunted avenue
The crowded ballroom seems empty and blue
This town's a ghost town without you
What memories I find
In the café we dined in
The sound of our laughter lingers on

This was a gay town
From dusk until dawn
Now it's a ghost town  since you're gone
Sweetheart your face is in all those places
And my heart embraces each vision of you
If only we'd make up
These shadows would break up
And I'd see that sun come shining through
So, darling, come back, I need you, I do",Ghost Town,1999
Don Cherry,"My world is like a river as dark as it is deep
Night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
My days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
Filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm

She slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
Wondering from room to room turning on each light
Her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
And I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories
Sweet memories
Sweet memories, hmm",Sweet Memories,1999
Don Cherry,"I don't believe in frettin' and grievin'
Why mess around with strife'
I never was cut out to step and strut out
Give me the simple life

Some find it pleasant dining on pheasant
Those things roll off my knife
Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes
Give me the simple life

A cottage small if all I'm after
Not one that's spacious and wide
A house that rings with joy and laughter
And the ones you love inside

Some like the high road, I like the low road
Free from the care and strife
Sounds corny and seedy, but yes, indeed
Give me the simple life",Give Me the Simple Life,2007

You'll remember yesterday
In its haunting strain
Vienna lives again
Free and bright and gay
In your mind a sudden gleam
Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last
In that happy city of the past
Does she still recall the dream
That rapture so supreme
When first she heard the haunting third man theme?

Carnivals and carousels and Ferris wheels and parasols
The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine
The zither's sweet refrain
Keeps swirling in your brain
Like new may wine
Strauss waltzes, candle-glow
And the laughter of long ago
Fill the magic chords and make it seem like today

Enchanted by a melody

Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this?

Some day if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be there

Don Cherry,"And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out

I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, Ive laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
No, oh no not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Don Cherry,"In the hustle of the day we're all inclined to miss
Little things that mean so much

A word, a smile, and a kiss
When a woman loves a man he's a hero in her eyes
And a hero he can always be if he'll just realise

She may be weary, women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
And when she's weary try a little tenderness

She may be waiting, just anticipating
Things she may never possess
While she's without them, try a little tenderness

It's not just sentimental she has her grief and her care
But a word that's soft and gentle makes it easier to bear

You won't regret it, women don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
And it's all so easy, try a little tenderness

Grab yo toy baby grab yo strap
I'ma kick back light up a sack

You know the deal do
So grab the dildo
And let's do the damn thing
So I can tell my kin folks
About that there shit we did
About that there freak you did
And landed on my face, ooh
Baby girl but I love the taste
Got me livin' my fantasy
Baby come and dance for me
You got that candy cream
Let me see you pull yo panty string
Let yo thong slide to the side
Chica open wide
And let my fine ass baby mama put her tongue inside
Tongue kissin' naked to the world
Such a nasty girl
You got me fiendin' every time I'm dreamin' of the pearl
Twice last night, once in the mornin'
That's yo favorite song
It turns you on
Leave your pumps on
Baby watch me hit it strong
Baby Bashy you so nasty
Love the threesome for the top notch jazzies
Smokin' on some of that purple grassy
Now what yo body do

Ya heard, fuck it, every body in this mutha fucka
We doin' this hit not givin' a shit
Shadow the chicken plucker
I want to know what you got on your mind
Is it the same as mine
We can bump and grind
And tell your friend she can come along, Why?
I would never leave her behind, hell no!
Never mind the love we share
Remember I'm a thug you bitch
Fuck her up rub 'round your dick
'cause all I give you dirty tricks and that's it
No shame in the game I play
Me and Bash got pie to lay
Texas Californ-I-A
Smokin' weed, pokin' bitches all night and day
Ride away in the hot one
Put my hook in the sea then I caught one
I gotta take it or leave it
And believe it or not
I got the eye of an eagle and I spot them

Blaze up a sack get the chronic often

You got me trippin tryin to make you my lady. Tell me what's you sippin, I got you baby. Hard rock body with your hard rock life. You got a real hard brother tryin to be real polite. Better yet, I'm tryin to be nice. And if I give it to you once your gonna beg for it twice.

Whoa! Its like the matrix, incredible. A pretty girl with a body, unforgettable. Mamacita from the valley. She got me knowin that I'm goin back to Cali. I got a proposition.

Most of the time when a player shove it. I like that ass a lot but I never love it. See I'm gonna keep that, keep it fly. And I thought I'd be a player until the day I die. But somehow you got up in my dome. And begged JT to take ya home. Once we got there, all was good. You put it on a pimp like I didn't think you could. Your super thick and extra pretty. The kinda chick you usually find up Magic City. Her eyes were green and her skin was brown. I looked, wow, and then Mamacita kicked me down.

She give me love, love, love, love, crazy love

Take away my trouble, take away my grief
Take away my heartache, in the night like a thief

Yes I need her in the daytime
Yes I need her in the night
Yes I want to throw my arms around her
Kiss her hug her kiss her hug her tight

Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway

Don Cooper,"There's something in the way she moves
Or looks my way, or calls my name
That seems to leave this troubled world behind
If I'm feeling down and blue
Or troubled by some foolish game
She always seems to make me change my mind

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine

Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning
And I find myself careening
In places where I should not let me go
She has the power to go where no one else can find me
Yes and silently remind me
The happiness and the good times that I know, but as I had got to know them

It isn't what she's got to say
But how she thinks and where she's been
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound
I like to hear them best that way
It doesn't much matter what they mean
What she says them mostly just to calm me down

And I feel fine anytime she's around me now
She's around me now
Almost all the time
If I'm well you can tell she's been with me now
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
Yes and I feel fine",Something in the Way She Moves,1970

Don Cornell,"I sometimes wish I was a kid again
Down in the old neighborhood
Just to be with Charlie, with little Joe and Pete
Boy, we had a quartette that was mighty hard to beat
I'd love to stand down by that cellar door
Just to hear that quartette sing once more
 
""Heart Of My Heart"", I love that melody
""Heart Of My Heart"" brings back a memory
When we were kids on the corner of the street
We were rough and ready guys
But Oh! How we could harmonize
""Heart Of My Heart""
Meant friends were dearer then
Too bad we had to part
I know a tear would glisten if once more I could listen
To that gang that sang ""Heart Of My Heart""

Don Cornell,"In the sleepy town of San Juanita
There's a story that a padre tells
Of a gay senor and senorita
And the serenade of the bells

Seems they asked the padre for permission
To be married early in the spring
But their folks had made just one condition
That the mission bells had to ring

Ev'ryone knew the bells were broken
And hadn't sounded for a long, long time
Then one night the village was astounded
For the bells began to chime

Still the bells are broken, goes the story
But if in your heart a true love dwells
They will ring for you in all their glory
That's the serenade of the bells",Serenade of the Bells,2007

Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight

I can't let you go with that
You have won all my money and my brand new
Stetson hat

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his forty-four
Said, I'm goin' to the barroom just to pay that
Debt I owe

Stagger Lee went to the barroom
And he stood across the barroom door
He said, nobody move and he pulled his
Forty-four

Stagger Lee, cried Billy
Oh, please don't take my life
I've got three little children and a very
Sickly wife

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh, he shot that poor boy so bad

Me dió tu querer

Que seas en mi vida
Lo que ya no fue

Déjame hablarte en secreto
Quiero decirte al oido
Que mi último nido
También fracasó

Pero tú no hagas recuerdos
Dale al pasado tu olvido
Why empieza otra vida
Sin ver tu dolor

Don Cruz Lizárraga,"Se que entre tu y yo
No hay futuro no hay amor
No quedan rastros de pasión
Y la emoción nos dijo adiós
Ya no debemos seguir
Si en nosotros ojos hay maldad
Siempre luchando por lograr ser el que gane el que lastime mas
Yo por me parte hoy doblo las manos
Tiro la toalla pues nada ganamos
Porque los dos perdemos mas
Si no nos separamos

Para que seguir moliendonos la vida
Para que dañarnos siempre si medida
Abortando el miedo de causar heridas
Y despedazarnos como dos suicidas
Para que seguir si ya no viene caso
Todo entre tu y yo siempre sera un fracaso
Decirnos adiós es la mejor salida
Antes de que el odio gane la partida

Every Beat Of My Heart
Red Hot In Black
I met her in a little French cafe
Legs like a young giraffe
She was sitting reading Baudelaire
Not exactly working class

She had a studio in St. Michel
Crucifix around her waist
Che Guevara all over the wall
She can't stand the sun on her face

Hey boys, what a look
Stop a train at fifty feet
Matching hair, matching clothes and eyes
Kinda like a tiger in heat
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Revolution running through her veins
A radical from head to toe
The only record that she ever played
Was ""just like a rolling stone""

We started talking by the candlelight
Her lips get closer to mine
We started dancing all around the room
Helped by a bottle of wine

Hey boys, mystery
Didn't even know her name
One night in Paris, with a girl like that
Never going home again
Red hot in black
Red hot in black

Oh my, when I woke up
She'd already gone out to her work
My head was aching and my back was scratched
I've never, never, never known a night like that

Took a walk along the avenue
So in love and so confused
My plane was leaving in half an hour
What would you have done in my shoes?

Hey boys, so you see
Couldn't get her outa my head
My regards to the folks back home
Gonna spend some time with red

Don Davis,"Out among the stars I sail, way beyond the moon
In my silver ship I sail, a dream that ended to soon
Now I know exactly who I am and what I'm here for
And I will go sailing no more

All the things I thought I'd be, all the brave things I'd done
Vanished like a snowflake with the rising of the sun
Never more to sail my ship, where no man has gone before
And I will go sailing no more

But no, it can't be true I could fly if I wanted to
Like a bird in the sky if I believe I can fly, why I'd fly
Clearly, I will go sailing, no more",I Will Go Sailing No More,1997
Don Davis,"There's a book called The Duke of Deception, written by Geoffrey Wolff. 
It's about his father, who was a tremendous liar, 
Though he appeared to be completely beyond reproach. 
He'd created this whole parallel identity, pretending to have attended certain 

Schools, pretending to have certain businesses. He made a profession of lying. 
I'm not talking about an occasional lie - 
That does not qualify for "";Big Hat, No Cattle."" 
I'm talking about people who base a whole life on lying, 

People who have cards that say ""producer"", or ""CEO"",

Bring storms for you to ride it

You didn't turn up, should'a gone to work

Why didn't I say the things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away

I can say it so clearly but you're nowhere around

And I'm missing you and nobody knows it but me

It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why can't I

I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me

It's all so simple, relax, let go, let fly
Someone tell me why, why can't I
I can dance a Tango, I can read Greek, easy
I can slay a dragon any old week, easy

What's hard is simple, what's natural comes hard
Maybe you can show me how to let go
Lower my guard, learn to be free
Maybe if you whistle, whistle for me
Whistle for me

Don Dokken,"What's wrong with you may be right for me
Don't need to feel your sympathy, no
In the dark
I feel at home
I need the night to make my feelings known

Alright like lone wolf, can't you see
Living in false realities
Do you know just how i feel, can't explain it,
But its real

Lost in a world full of fear, it gives me passion
I'm just a lone wolf who's waiting
Waiting for life's attraction to give me

The hunger, burning in my soul
With the hunger, everybody knows
It's the hunger to give me what i need
With the hunger, satisfaction guaranteed

Blackened sky on a full moon rise
Destiny, it calls to me
Some call it love, some call it more
I'll play that game if it gets me through the door

With the hunger, everybody knows

With the hunger, take a walk with me

In the night i call your name

It is it love or fantasy

Don Drummond,"With these swollen hearts the fires will rage
A scar from the past sends icy rains
The warmth of love will turn healing to pain

Past scars. Jaded.

Dig away, scrape the pain
Another foot to the shovel
Bleed these wounds and drink the cup
Honor the oath two souls as one

Will we be forgiven?

This won't come easy
We fought for this in the past
Jaded and hopeless
We let it fall through the cracks
Hatred now heats the blade
It divides and it cuts
You gave in and I gave up
Through glares of disgust

Jaded

The first time was the last time

How could it get this far?
Why did it come to this?
My heart's been ripped apart
Torn by your poisoned lips

How could it get this far?
Why did it come to this?
Our souls are ripped apart

The wounds of love forget the oath

Bitterness the soil, resentment the stone
A grave of shallows filled with her bones
Buried my heartache, buried my hope
My soul now dies with her down in that hole

With these swollen hearts the fires will rage
A scar from the past sends icy rains",Nimble Foot Ska,1996

Don Edwards,"Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone
It was long late in the evening when he rode into our camp
On a little old brown pony he called Shaw
In his brogan shoes and coveralls a harder lookin' kid
You never in you life have seen before

His saddle was a Sother kack built many years ago
An OK spur on one foot idly hung
With his bed roll in a cotton sack was loosely tied behind
And a canteen from the saddle horn he'd slung
Said he had to leave his home because his paw had married twice
His new maw beat him every day or two
So he saddled up old Shaw one night and lit a shuck this way
Thought he'd try and paddle now his own canoe

Said he'd try to do the best he could if we'd only give him work
Though he didn't know straight up about a cow
So the boss he cut him out a mount and kinda put him on
And we knew he liked our little stray somehow
Well he taught him how to heard the horses and learned to know 'em all
And to get 'em in by daylight if he could
And to follow the chuck wagon and to always hitch the team
And to help the carsonaro rustle wood

We had driven to Red River and the weather it was fine
We were camped down on the south side of the bend
When a Norther started blowin' we called the extra guard
Cause it took all hands to hold the cattle in
Now little Joe the wrangler was called out like the rest
Barely had the kid got to the heard
When the cattle they stampeded like a hailstorm on they flew
With all of us a ridin' for the lead

Between the streaks of lightnin' we could see a horse ahead
It was little Joe the wrangler in the lead
He was riding old Blue Rocket with a slicker o'er his head
And he's trying to check the leaders in their speed.
We finally got'em millin' and they sort of quieted down
The extra guard back to the camp did go
But one of them was missing and we all knew at a glance
Twas our little Texas strayboy wrangler Joe

We found him there at sun up where old Blue Rocket fell
In some washout twenty feet below
Beneath his horse smashed to a pulphis spur had rung the knell
For our little Texas stray bos wrangler Joe
Little Joe the wrangler he'll wrangle never more
His days with the remuda they're all done
It was long about last April he rode into our camp
Just a little Texas stray and all alone

Don Edwards,"When I was but a young man, wild and full of fire
A youth within my teens but full of challenge and desire
I ran away from home and left my mother and my dad
It grieved them so to think their only boy was bad

I fell in with an outlaw band, their names were known quite well
How many times we robbed and plundered, I could never tell
This kind of sinful livin' will lead only to a fall
I learned that much and more the night I heard my master call

One night we rustled cattle, a thousand head or so
And started them out on the trail that leads to Mexico
When a norther' started blowin' and lightnin' flashed about
I thought someone was calling me, thought I heard a shout

At that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from me
And left there was a giant cross where once there was a tree
This time I knew a heard a voice, a voice so sweet and plain
A voice that came from everywhere, a voice that called my name

So frightened, I was thinking of the sinful deeds I'd done
I failed to see the thousand head of cattle start to run
The cattle, they stampeded and were running all around
My pony ran but stumbled and threw me to the ground

I felt the end was nearing, that death would be the price
When a mighty bolt of lightning showed the face of Jesus Christ
Then I cried, ""oh Lord, forgive me, don't let it happen now
I want to live for You alone, God these words I vow""

My wicked life unfolded and I thought of wasted years
When another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of steers
And the others rushed on by me, and I was left to live
The Master had a reason, life was His to take or give

A miracle performed that night, I wasn't meant to die
The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven high
And right behind it, there was I, afraid but safe and sound
I cried and begged for mercy, kneeling there upon the ground

A pardon I was granted and my sinful soul set free
No more to fear the angry waves upon life's stormy sea
Forgiven by the love of God, a love that will remain
I gave my life and soul the night the Savior called my name
I gave my life and soul the night the Savior called my name",The Master's Call,1992
Don Edwards,"Was a cowboy I knew in south Texas,
His face was burnt deep by the sun,
Part history, part sage, part mesquit,
He was there when Poncho Villa was young. 

And he'd tell you a tale of the old days, 
When the country was wild all around, 
Sit out under the stars of the Milky Way, 
And listen while the coyotes howl. 

And they go... hoo yip hoo yip hoo

And the outlaws are gone, 
Geronimo is gone, 
And Sam Bass is gone,
And the lion is gone, 
And the red wolf is gone. 

Well he cursed all the roads and the oil men,
And he cursed the automobile, 
Said this is no place for an hombre like I am, 
In this new world of asphalt and steel. 

Then he'd look off some place in the distance, 
At something only he could see, 
He'd say all that's left now of the old days, 
Those damned old coyotes and me. 

And they go hoo yip hoo yip hoo

And lion is gone,
And the red wolf is gone.

He disappeared without even a word,
But that night as the moon crossed the mountain, 
One more coyote was heard.

and purple streaks the sky,
when cattle bunch up closer for the night...

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.

Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet

On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.

Don Edwards,"Old Red was one of the orniest yet
I've seen at the big rodeo
He'll bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode

Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed

From Idaho, a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McLean
And Billy had never been thrown

The greatest desire filled the young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
""I'll ride him or drop over dead""

Old Red was wicked way down in the shoot
He was kicking, stomping about
Billy climbed into the saddle with ease
Then he yelled turn him loose let us out

Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Trying to get rid of the man on his back
But the man went wherever he goes

Billy was racking Old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doing right well but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in

Old Red was runnin' straight for the fence
Suddenly stopping and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him

There was a hush in the crowd and they knew
This would be Billies last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billies chest when they fell
And under Old Red Billy died

Old Red lay still, no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In trying to throw Billy of off his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell

Out in the west, there's they place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there 'neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode

Don Edwards,"There's something strange in the old corral
There's a breeze, though the wind has died
Though I'm alone in the old corral
Seems there is someone at my side

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are you roundin' up the dogies, the strays of long ago
Are you on the trail of buffalo?

Empty saddles in the old corral
Where do you ride tonight?
Are there rustlers on the border, or a band of Navajo
Are you headin' for the Alamo?

Empty guns covered with rust
Where do you talk tonight?
Empty boots covered with dust
Where do you walk tonight?

Empty saddles in the old corral
My tears will be dried tonight
If you'll only say I'm lonely as you carry my old pal
Empty saddles in the old corral

There is no smoke, still the fires burn,
There's no song, still I hear guitars,
There is no dust, still the ghosts return
Softly to vanish through the bars",Empty Saddles,2005

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted

Where ox and ass are feeding?

I want to lead you into Nature's hall

And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me

Don Ewell,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,

Must it be forever inside of me,

Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Don Francisco,"The crowds were in the streets that day when Jesus came
To town
All the synagogue was there and more from miles around
So I asked him home to dinner just to see what I could
See
Of this famous local prophet from here in Galilee

And I don't know just how that woman got into the room
But you couldn't miss her gaudy clothes and her strong
And sweet perfume.
She went straight to Jesus' feet and stopped and stood
Right there
Then cried and wet His feet with tears and dried them
With her hair.

Now of all the women in my town none was more well
Known
For the flagrant sin she'd lived in and the wickedness
She'd sown.
But He didn't move to stop her -- seemed this phophet
Couldn't tell
That the woman who was touching Him was the kind they
Buy and sell.

And I had no idea just what this Jesus planned to do
When he said ""Simon, there's something I need to say to
You.""
So I said ""Teacher, if it's on your mind then tell me
What you will.""
But as He began to speak to me the room grew quickly
Still

He said ""Take a good look at this woman now, in spite
Of all her fears
She's kissed me and anointed me and washed my feet with
Tears.
She's honored me and you've been only rude to me
Instead.
You gave no kiss of greeting, no anointing for my
Head.""

And her sins were red as scarlet and now they're washed
Away.
The love and faith she's shown is all the price she has
To pay
For the depth of God's forgiveness, it's more than you
Can see
And in spite of what you think of her, she's beautiful
To me

Now my anger flamed to hatred, I wanted nothing more
Than to take this prophet by the throat and throw Him
Out the door
To act like God, forgiving sins, and then speak so to
Me.
This itinerant from Nazareth in backwards Galilee.

But instead I sat and trembled, shaken to the core
The woman still was weeping as she knelt there on the
Floor
Jesus turned to her and said, ""Your chains have been
Released
Your faith has saved you from your sins, rise -- walk
In peace.""

Your sins were red as scarlet but now they're washed
Away.
The love and faith you've shown is all the price you
Have to pay
For the depth of God's forgiveness, it's deeper than
The sea
And no matter what the world may think, you're
Beautiful to me.",Beautiful to Me,1986
Don Francisco,"She kept on getting weaker as day dragged into day
The doctors gave no hope for her; she seemed to fade away
My hours were filled with constant dread; time became a knife
That slowly and relentlessly cut the cord of life

There was a teacher in the region then some of us had heard
That He'd healed the paralytic by the power of just His Word
So with hope again rekindled I went at once to see
If I could find a man named Jesus from a town in Galilee

I began to search the city and soon I saw the crowd
They were pressing in to touch Him and they called His Name out loud
But with the strength of desperation I pushed them all aside
I through myself before Him and from my knees I cried

""Lord, come and heal my daughter, even now she's close to death
Her fever's uncontrollable, she fights for every breath
But God's given You the power; life is Yours to give
If you'll just lay Your hands on her I know that she will live""
(She will live, she will live)

Well, He'd just begun to go with me when a face I saw with fear
Came towards me with the news I knew I didn't want to hear
And although I tried to steel myself I trembled when he said
""Why bother the Teacher anymore, your little girl is dead.""

Then Jesus touched my shoulder and He told me not to grieve
The trembling stopped when He looked at me and said, ""Only believe""
Then He sent the crowds away except His closest men
And they followed right behind us as we started off again

But we were still a long ways down the road when I heard the sounds and cries
Of the mourners and musicians as they strove to dramatize
My grief they had no business with beneath their loud disguise
My wife just sat there silently and stared through empty eyes

Then Jesus asked the mourners, ""Why is it that you weep?
She isn't dead as you suppose, the child is just asleep.""
It only took a moment for their wails to turn to jeers
""Who does this man think he is? Get him out of here!""

With authority I've never heard in the lips of any man
He spoke and every sound rolled out with the thunder of command
And in the sudden silence they all hurried for the door
Wondering what the reasons were they'd ever come there for

Then He called his three disciples that were with Him on the way
He led them and my wife and me to where our daughter lay
He took her by the hand; He told her ""Child, arise""
And the words were barely spoken when she opened up her eyes

She rose and walked across the room and stood there at our sides
My wife knelt down and held her close and at last she really cried
And then Jesus told us both to see that our daughter had some food
But as to how her life was saved, not to speak a word
Not to speak a word

Don Francisco,"The gates and doors were barred and all the windows fastened down,
I spent the night in sleeplessness and rose at every sound,
Half in hopeless sorrow half in fear the day,
Would find the soldiers crashing through to drag us all away.
Then just before the sunrise I heard something at the wall,
The gate began to rattle and a voice began to call,
I hurried to the window and looked down to the street,
Expecting swords and torches and the sound of soldiers feet,

There was no one there but Mary so I went down to let her in,
John stood there beside me as she told us were she'd been,
She said they moved him in the night and none of us knows where,
The stones been rolled away and now his body isn't there.
We both ran toward the garden then John ran on ahead,
We found the stone and the empty tomb just the way that Mary said,
But the winding sheet they wrapped him in was just an empty shell,
And how or where they'd taken him was more than I could tell.

Something strange had happened there but what I did not know,
John believed a miracle but I just turned to go,
Circumstance and speculation couldn't lift me very high,
Cause I'd seen them crucify him and then I'd watched him die,
Back inside the house again all the guilt and anguish came,
Everything I'd promised him just added to my shame,
But at last it came to choices I denied I knew his name,
Even If he was alive it wouldn't be the same.

But suddenly the air was filled with a strange and sweet perfume,
Light that came from everywhere drove shadows from the room,
Jesus stood before me with his arms held open wide,
And I fell down on my knees and clung to him and cried,
He raised me to my feet and as I looked into his eyes,
Love was shining out from him like sunlight from the sky,
Guilt and my confusion disappeared in sweet release,
And every fear I'd ever had just melted into peace.

He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,
Heavens gates are open wide.
He's alive, He's alive, He's alive and I'm forgiven,

Heavens gates are open wide.

Don Friedman,"Daylight, see the dew on the sunflower
And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [From Cats],1995
Don Friedman,"My old flame, I can't even think of his name but it's funny now and then
How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame
My old flame, my new lovers all seem so tame
For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became of my old flame

Don Friedman,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

Don Friedman,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

But I'm still here and I still love you so
And I can't leave no matter how hard I try

You know I love you, you know it's true
I just can't leave you no matter what you do
And I can't go no matter how hard I try

It's shame, oh shame
You feel my pain running 'round on me
But I lost my pride, I'm still by your side
And that's where I want to be

Well, maybe you'll change and maybe you won't
But I'll be here if you do or if you don't
Cause I can't leave no matter how hard I try

It's a sad affair when the one you love
Don't even care about you
But why should I took blame? I love you just the same
And that's all I want to do

Well, maybe you'll change and maybe you won't
But I'll be here if you do or if you don't
Cause I can't leave no matter how hard I try",I Can't Leave,1991
Don Gibson,"When my eyes behold the stars
This heart of mine is filled with wonder
My poor mind cannot grasp their array
But the hand that spilled them there
All across the wide heaven
Had a plan when He placed them that way

[Chorus]
Known only to Him
Are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him

In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely heavy cross I must bear?
Then He tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trust worthy
He gives me strength far more than my share

[Chorus]",Known Only to Him,1991
Don Gibson,"I've wandered far away from God now I'm coming home
The path of sin too long I've trod Lord I'm coming home
Coming home coming home never more to roam
Open wide Thine arms of love Lord I'm coming home

I've wasted many precious years now I'm coming home
I now repent with bitter tears Lord I'm coming home
Coming home coming home",Lord I Am Coming Home,1991
Don Gibson,"Everybody's going out and having fun 
I'm just a fool for staying home and having none 
I can't get over how she set me free 
Oh, lonesome me 

A bad mistake I'm making 'bout just hanging round 
I know that I should have some fun and ain't to town 
A lovesick fool that's blind and just can't see 
Oh, lonesome me 

I'll bet she's not like me 
She's out and fancy free 
Flirting with the boys with all her charms 
But I still love her so 
And brother don't you know 
I'd welcome her right back here in my arms 

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues 
Forget about the past and find somebody new 
I've thought of everything from A to Z 
Oh, lonesome me 

Well, I bet she's not like me 
She's out and fancy free 
Flirting with the boys with all her charms 
But I still love her so 
And brother don't you know 
I'd welcome her right back here my arms 

Well, there must be some way I can lose these lonesome blues

Don Gibson,"Well, you ask me if I'm happy
If I have sweet peace within
If I'm worried 'bout tomorrow
When I reach my journey's end

Well, I'm satisfied with my Jesus
When He knocks I let Him in
He'll go with me through the valley
For I know He is my friend

Satisfied, satisfied
Well, no troubles can ever get me down
Oh, when my eyes are closed in death
With my Jesus I'll be at rest
Then you'll know I'm satisfied, hmm

Hmm, if my friends they all forsake me
And they turn me from their door
If they sow no seeds of kindness
Make the thorns in my path grow

Oh, it won't matter over yonder
When I reach that other side
For I'm a gonna sit down by my Jesus
Satisfied, I'm satisfied

Satisfied, satisfied",Satisfied,1991
Don Gibson,"Why must you always try
To make me over, take me as I am or let me go
White lilies never grow on stalks of clover
Take me as I am or let me go

You're trying to reshape me in a mold love
In the image of someone you used to know
But I won't be a standing for an old love
Take me as I am or let me go

You're trying to reshape me",Take Me as I Am (Or Let Me Go),1991
Don Gibson,"On your knees you are taller than trees
You can look over heartaches and fears
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go growing stronger and taller than trees

One night it was a long time ago
Now I knelt at my mother's knee
For I weary, I was heartsick, I was blue
She said, son lift up your eyes to Him
To Him up in the skies

And you'll grow, oh yes, son
You'll grow tall and strong
Like the mighty oaks

And this was the answer I felt
As down at her knees I knelt
Down on your knees
You can go taller than trees

And my boy, you can look over all your heartaches
And son you can look over all your fears
When my faith is gone to my knees
I will go growing stronger and taller than trees",Taller Than Trees,1991
Don Gibson,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show 
That you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do 
Is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past 
Keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

Another love before my time 
Made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now 
For things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said 
That make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

You'll never know how much it hurts 
To see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love
Yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from lies
To try, it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart

There was a time when I believed 
That you belonged to me
But now I know your heart 
Is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you
The more we drift apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind 
And melt your cold, cold heart","Cold, Cold Heart",1992
Don Gibson,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden indian standing by the door 
He fell in love with an indian maid over in the antique store 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

He always wore his sunday feathers and held a tomahawk 
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk 
Kaw-Liga, too stubborn to ever show a sign 
Because his heart was made of knotty pine 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Kaw-Liga was a lonely indian, never went nowhere 
His heart was set on the indian maid with the coal black hair 
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show 
So she could never answer yes or no 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head 

Then one day a wealthy customer bought the indian maid 
And took her oh so far away, but old kaw-liga stayed 
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be 
And wishes he was still an old pine tree 

Poor old kaw-liga, he never got a kiss 
Poor old kaw-liga, he don't know what he missed 
Is it any wonder that his face is red? 
Kaw-Liga,that poor old wooden head

Don Gibson,"(Take these chains from my heart and set me free)

Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free 

Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new, let me find a new love, too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

Give my heart just a word of sympathy (sympathy)
Be as fair to my heart as you can be (you can be)

Don Gibson,"The news is out all over town that you've been seen a runnin' round
I know that I should leave but then I just can't go you win again
This heart of mine could never see what everybody knew but me
Just trusting you was my great sin what can I do you win again
I'm sorry for your victim now cause soon his head like mine will bow
He'll give his heart but all in vain and someday say you win again
You have no heart you have no shame you take true love and give the blame
I guess that I should not complain I love you still you won again",You Win Again,1992

Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you.

I love you because my heart is lighter
Every time you're walking by my side
I love you because the future's brighter
The door to happiness you've opened wide.

No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But, most of all I love you 'cause you're you.",I Love You Because,1994
Don Gibson,"It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

I never will forget one time when I was on a little visit down home in Ebenezer, Kentucky. 
I was a-talkin' to an old man that had known me ever since the day I was born, and an old friend 
of the family. He says, ""Son, you don't know how lucky you are to have a nice job like you've got 
and don't have to dig out a livin' from under these old hills and hollers like me and your pappy 
used to."" When I asked him why he never had left and tried some other kind of work, he says, 
""Nawsir, you just won't do that. If ever you get this old coal dust in your blood, you're just 
gonna be a plain old coal miner as long as you live."" He went on to say, ""It's a habit (CHUCKLE) 
sorta like chewin' tobaccer."" 

Come and listen you fellows, so young and so fine,
And seek not your fortune in the dark, dreary mines. 
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul, 
'Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal. 

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew, 
Where danger is double and pleasures are few, 
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.
It's a-many a man I have seen in my day, 
Who lived just to labor his whole life away. 
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard his wine, 
A man will have lust for the lure of the mines. 

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll, 
My body will blacken and turn into coal. 
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home, 
And pity the miner a-diggin' my bones.

The midnight, the morning, or the middle of day, 
Is the same to the miner who labors away. 
Where the demons of death often come by surprise, 
One fall of the slate and you're buried alive.",Dark as a Dungeon,1994
Don Gibson,"I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold,
I'd rather be His than have riches untold;
I'd rather have Jesus than houses or land,
I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand

Than to be the king of a vast domain
Or be held in sin's dread sway
I'd rather have Jesus than anything
This world affords today

I'd rather have Jesus than men's applause,
I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause;
I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame,
I'd rather be true to His holy name

He's fairer than lilies of rarest bloom,
He's sweeter than honey from out the comb;
He's all that my hungering spirit needs;
I'd rather have Jesus and let Him lead",I'd Rather Have Jesus,1994
Don Gibson,"I'm looking for that Lonely Street
I've got a sad, sad tale to tell
I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

A place where there's just loneliness
Where dim lights bring forgetfulness
Where broken dreams and memories meet
Where's this place called Lonely Street?

Perhaps upon this Lonely Street
There's someone such as I
Who came to bury broken dreams
And watch an old love die

If I could find that Lonely Street
And just by chance someone I'd meet
Someone who feels the way I do
And knows just what false love can do

I need a place to go and weep
Where's this place called Lonely Street?",Lonely Street,1994
Don Gibson,"Well, it looks how love has finally come my way
At last it looks like love has come way
After all the heartaches I've gone through
They were worth it all for you

Well, I'm a little bit older now, a little bit wiser now
I know you're the one for me, goodbye blues and misery
At last it looks like love has come way
No doubt about it, love has come my way

Paradise with great big eyes of blue
My love has come my way with you

Well, now I'm a little bit older

Yes, love has come my way with you
Mhm, love has come my way with you",Love Has Come My Way,1994
Don Gibson,"I'm in I'm out sure then I'm in doubt
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
I win I lose I'm happy then I'm blue
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
I tell myself I ought to leave you I almost make it through the door
I'd be a fool to try and leave you I'll just come back for me
Your hello goodbye make me laugh then cry
What a crazy kind mixed up love I'm in
Oh and I tell myself I ought to leave you",Mixed Up Love,1994
Don Gibson,"When you found somebody new, I thought I never would
Forget you, for I thought then I never could
But time has taken all the pain away
Until now, I'm down to hurtin' once a day.

Once a day, all day long
And once a night, from dusk 'til dawn
The only time, I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, everyday, all day long. 

I'm so glad that I'm not like a friend I knew one time
He lost the one he loved, then slowly lost her mind
He sat around and cried his life away
Lucky me, I'm only crying once a day.

Once a day, all day long 
And once a night, from dusk 'til dawn
The only time, I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, every day, all day long.

The only time, I wish you weren't gone
Is once a day, everyday, all day long.",Once a Day,1994
