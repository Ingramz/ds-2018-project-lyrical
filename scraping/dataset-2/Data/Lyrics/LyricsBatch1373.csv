Calvin Harris,"I can pay for everything that's on you
So everything is on me
Got them girls gone Cindy Lauper, Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy, you're on the wrong beat
Tell the bar that we don't want no glass
Just bottles and I'm buying everybody one each
Yes so bring the Veuve Clicquot
We about to hit the big 3.O
Party like it's carnival in Rio
Life's too short, I need a V.O
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fight
Also we can have a good time, yeah

I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

We're drinking from the bottle

Yo, as long they ain't getting it wrong then everything is alright
Got the girls going Heidi Klum, the Kardashians, Rihanna, all types
If you ain't lean, then you in the wrong scene
If you ain't high, then you not on my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need to sparklers or nothin',
Just keep the bottles coming all night
Yeah so bring the Veuve Clicquot
We about to hit the big 3.O
Party like it's carnival in Rio
Life's too short, I need a V.O
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fight
Also we can have a good time

I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
Who's wearing something new and something old
And something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow
Tonight, we're drinking from the bottle

We're drinking from the bottle

I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
A next top model
A next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
A next top model
A next top model
A next top model
Tonight,we're drinking from the bottle
We're drinking from the bottle",Drinking from the Bottle,2012
Calvin Harris,"I need your love

Calvin Harris,"Love the way I feel, streets replaced with fields.
Wide awake in here, you shine.
Ran away from goals, left you in the cold.
Nothing's in our way tonight.
You know that you'll never be replaced.
And everyone here made the same mistakes as me.
And either way our time won't go to waste
Our﻿ hearts will never be the same again.
Our hearts will never be the same again.

Our hearts will never be the same again.",Iron,2012

Calvin Harris,"You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And
With the word, all my love came rushing out
And
Every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tryin' to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

It isn't easy for me to let it go
'Cause I swallow every single word
And every whisper, every sigh
Eats away this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now

So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing

And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
Sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

And it's not enough
To tell me that you care
When, we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothing

It's not something that we're used to
No other way to say, I need you every day

Without you babe

Got the face rockin' on the sound
Got my phone in my hand
My baby hit me two times
I gotta hit her back, she says she's flyin' in tonight
See my baby's been gone for so long
She's back in town, it's time to get it on
She told me she would meet me at my spot about 8:00
That gives me two whole hours to get my shit straight
I hit my place around six
It's almost time to see her, almost time to get my fix
I just can't wait to see my baby's face
She's not like all these others on the paper chase
She's the kinda girl that you want to stay true to
There's nothin' that this girl wouldn't do for you, no
I think I hear her in my driveway
Open up the door and this is what she had to say

I found someone to, do what you used to
Boy you thought you were decivin' me with your infidelity
I found someone who really deserves me, and he's all I need
I'm makin' my moves, I found someone new and got no more love for you

How could you go and do this to me baby?
Since you hit town your had me running around actin' crazy
And had I known you treat me this way
We had to swing this drama for another day baby
This was your night, the room was on, beepers on
My shit was tight, you blew it baby, now it's blown
And after all I done for you
You messed around and blew the best thing that ever happened to you baby
Now don't go and put this all one me
Since I left town you've been tryin' to run down with every girl you see
I can't believe you do this to me, oh ooh baby
I heard about your friend with the red dress
Now why you want to go and play a game you can't win
You didn't know she was my best friend
And now we're all up in your pockets for your Benjamins

Looking back, reminiscing on
Caught a brother doing bad, and you put me on 
You told me not to be ashamed of what I got
Never mind them hatin' niggas up and down the block, babe 
You held it down and the bills got paid 
She said, ""Go ahead baby, do your singin' thing
And when God blesses us I want a Lexus
With a hide away mansion in the Hamptons""

Girl you must have lost your way from heaven 
Could it be for me you came so far
There is nothing like the honor of every woman
You're the very beat inside my heart

Shining like a diamond in outer space
Girl your like my mother, my sister, my lover
Irreplaceable, nothing can take your place

You're the blood in my veins, you're the air I breathe
On a hot summer day your like a shirt with no sleeves
What makes me a man, any fool could see
You're more then a woman to me

Girl if you take that back, there would be no cure
I would sail there forever, like a ship with no shore 
What makes me a man, any fool can see
You're more then a woman to me

Look at us, living luxury 
And I been thinking maybe we should start a family 
A girl for you, and a boy for me 
Matching stones separate guests, would you marry me
And if you'd have me I'd gladly give my life
Today I'd take this vow to make you my wife
Nothing temporary you know its quite contrary
Just you and me for an eternity

Can't help but wonder what this means to me

Jupiter and the stars, a new horizon slowly

I've seen shallow waters made some sons
And daughters, had my highs and lows, came face to face
With blows but as I reminisce on things like this
I'm beginning to see sweet victory, I can almost taste it

I want more, I wansumo, I want more
I wansumo, I want more, I wansumo, I want more

'Cause in this world we live in, I'm just an average Negro
Tryin' to get a race on this over crowded stage
Doin' what ever it takes to come in or any place

Because the world we live in, yeah, no
(Sure ain't giving up nothing)
So as a brotha I'm stretching like a rubber band

I want more, I wansumo, I want more

You never made love before (no not like this)
It's just for you
You say you had everything
And nothing was missing
What you thought was right is wrong
So baby just let me in
Girl, I know you had it but not like this

Girl, you must have heard all the things I'm tellin you
I'm not tryin to pressure you
But, I have to come at you with what I really feel
Girl, I, I'm sick over you
You ain't been told 
That you're worth more than gold (now you know)
Girl, you are
Now, girl, I'll take the time
The time to treat you right
'cause, girl, I just want to settle down

Girl, you're so special
I will be the one
That makes you believe (that makes you believe)
That you ain't had a real good man
I just can't see it 
So how could it be that

(Chorus)

So I take all the time that I need
(To show you how I really feel about you)
And I do all the things just to prove
That I never want to be with out you
So baby girl the things you never had
I'll give you, and I'll,
I'll be the one that's gonna claim you
I'll be the one that's gonna name you
Girl, I'll be the one for you. Oh,

With forbidden thoughts

Strangers all around
With the lights down low
I was thinkin' maybe we could
Well...you know

I don't wanna stop just because
People walkin' by are watchin' us
I don't give a damn what they think
I want you now
I don't wanna stop just because
You feel so good inside of my love
I'm not gonna stop no no no
I want you
All I wanna say is

Flowin' freely through infinity 
Free to be sure of 
What I am and who I need not be 
Free from all worries 
Worries prey on oneself's troubled mind 
Freer than the clock's hands 
Tickin' way the times 
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines 
Life running through me 
Till I feel my father God has called 
Me having nothin' 
But possessing riches more than all 
And I'm free 
To be nowhere 
But in every place I need to be 
Freer than a sunbeam 
Shinning through my soul 
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold 
Free from conceiving the beginning 
For that's the infinite start 
I'm gone - gone but still living 
Life goes on without a beating heart 
Free like a vision 
That the mind of only you can see 
Freer than a raindrop 
Falling from the sky 
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes

Flowin' freely to infinity 
I'm free to be sure of what 
I am and who I need not be

Woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

In Trinidad there was a family
With much confusion as you will see
There was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to marry and have a wife of his own

He met a young girl who suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said, ""Son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

A week went by and the summer came down
And soon another girl on the island, he found
He went to his papa to name the day
His papa shook his head and this time he did say

""You can't marry this girl, I have to say no
That girl is your aunty but your granny don't know

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family

Now, he went to his mama and covered his head
He told his mama what his papa had said
His mama, she laughed, she said, ""Go man, go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know""

Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, woe is me, shame and scandal in the family
Hey, worries, it worries me, shame and scandal in the family

Create in me a clean heart (I'm so sorry)
Your mercy is what I need

Woke up this morning too depressed and shamed to leave my bed
Can't stand to see my own reflection so I hang my head
Feel like a disappointment like the scum of the earth
I'm so hurt I know you see I can't cover my dirt
My souls dying hearts weak and I can't even cry
I'm sposed to run to you but WHY I'm such an evil guy
The sun's shining but for me it's the darkest of days
Try to pretend it never happened but the guilt remains
I leave the house it feels like everybody knows I did it
Feels like they reading my mind and know the sin I committed
Through your blood I'm aquitted but my heart doesnt get it
Oh God I'm desperate for Help cause I'm grieving your Spirit
I couldn't sing in the sunday service, Lord I felt fake
And when they started communion I just made an escape
I'm in need of your grace
Feels like you hid your face
Lead me back to cross and show me my sins erased

I'm waste deep in my pity
Is Satan tryna trick me and tell me you won't forgive me
Cause it's startin to get me
Jesus help me quickly I hate wrong I've done
I know we all fall but I feel like the only one
Feels like I should be shunned
Should I punish myself
I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt
But my sin is been felt
I didn't want to do it
But what I want to do I don't
I swear I'm gonna to lose it
Try to open my bible I need to read your pages

I need you Lord but my guilt has got me feeling so faithless
Help me see where your face is
Take me back to the basics
Help me find my joy in you and not people and places
My sin is ever before me I turned my back on you
Oh father break and restore me to bring me back to you

Have mercy on me God according to your steady love
Wipe away my transgression and wash me in your blood
Create in me a clean heart renew a right spirit
Don't take your Spirit away your Presence keep me near it
I'm waiting patience on you Lord I know you hear my cry
Restore your Joy in me
For you alone I live and die

It's you I Glorify cause you don't want my sacrifice
You want me broken and contrite trusting in the Christ
I confess to you my sin and you show me mercy
I turn away from it demonstrating that you are worthy
Over lust, over pride, over all sin
Is my affection for Jesus is who died for all them
I was lost now I'm found I was toss to the ground

Feel like a disappointment like the scum of the earth
I'm so hurt I know you see I can't cover my dirt

I couldn't sing in the sunday service, Lord I felt fake
And when they started communion I just made an escape
I'm in need of your grace
Feels like you hid your face
Lead me back to cross and show me my sins erased

I'm waste deep in my pity
Is Satan tryna trick me and tell me you won't forgive me
Cause it's startin to get me
Jesus help me quickly I hate wrong I've done
I know we all fall but I feel like the only one
Feels like I should be shunned
Should I punish myself
I know it's dumb cause by your death all my sin has been dealt

But what I want to do I don't

Wipe away my transgression and wash me in your blood

Waste my life no I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gonna do about
Everything in Luke 12: 15 down to 21
You've really gotta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrected we've wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryin' to show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living
To get a minute of any women and men that you admire
It ain't no lie

We're created for Him
Outta the dust he made us for Him
Elects us and he saves us for Him
Jesus comes and he raises for Him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless Him
To the world we confess Him, resurrects Him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ
If you don't see His ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes you can stop my life
Then I lost my rights
I lost my life

The cost is Christ

Because the money is God's you better steward it right
And stay focused, you ain't got no ride
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work
The colour your skin, naw you're a Christian first
People get to living for a job
Make a little money start living for a car
Get 'em a wife a house kids and a dog
Then they retire they're living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ and that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all
He's the treasure you'll never find in a mall
Your money your singleness marriage talent your time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is Divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See my whole world is built around Him He's the life in my lines
I refused to waste my life
He's too true to chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time 'cause I'm constantly trying to be used to praise the Christ
If he's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in place that rules your days and nights

There is so much that we
Don't understand
And the only thing we know
Is things don't always go

We will stand by your side
Filled with hope and filled with pride
We are more than we are
We are one

If there's so much I must be
Can I still just be me
The way I am
Can I trust in my own heart
Or am I just one part
Of some big land

Even those who are gone
Are with us as we go on
Your journey has only begun

Tears of pain tears of joy
One thing nothing can destroy
Is our pride deep inside

Let me see you get together,
Love one another right now.

Fading on the grass.

The sour scent of poverty seep through the sewer drain
The hourglass body but the mind of a bird brain
What's the odds of being my unconditional love thing?
You could turn the darkest clouds to sparkling sun rays
Make a nigga need sunscreen
So high, I mean, I wish it was some shade
Burn that eighth, sitting watching you sunbathe
The sound of the storm gets you warm
You're texting me like ""hey, come play""
Hit the airport, ""give me that one-way""

Quick to check a nigga if he sayin' something
Under his breath, two shells is left
Everyday niggas dance with death
I got a tone that make you one-two step
You see, life's too short to be so reckless
Which one? Your life or that gold necklace
Could niggas soul check it?
And all my life I been so patient
They say ""life is what you make"" so it's all for the takin'
Seen a family get evicted, had me reminiscing
Yet I'm bitching about life, I should be happy I'm alive
But shit, we tired of flipping fries
Niggas trapping on the side
Don't need no blue check, bye, to be verified
I'm so solidified, they don't question my qualifications

Cam Smith,"You've never been the one to blame
That one to know that I'm at fault
But never take it out on me
If the two of us were both the same
I wouldn't know where I need to be
You're the bigger picture I can't see
This one goes out to You
Solitude, at least that’s what I call it
Keeping those streets of gold on my mind
I don’t know why, as the years they pass me by
It gets harder just to take my time
No one to keep me from You
No one to stay my hand from seeking the truth
From reaching up for the only hope I ever knew
For every time I wasn't honest, kind, or true

I used to think I was lucky, but I've realized now I'm just blessed that I found some sort of home in a heart even though I lived so long in selfishness. Because I've learned you know my heart more than you know my routine and most nights it’s all I need to be able to fall asleep. Because I've learned running away from home is like finding strength in weakness, but I always come back around knowing that I can't continue to live like this. So thank you for your honesty, I've found that love has gone from just being sobering to being so refreshing. And even if pain doesn't go away, I just thank God you decided to stay. Because I know I have purpose when you purposefully tell me you that see something in me, even when I can't see myself.

If this hasn't been waiting in vain, I could consider this monogamy
Living devoted and betrothed to the One
Who believed in me and wouldn't give up
If the clock looks like it ticks too slow
Even when its given time to grow
I'll know for sure that it was my own impatience
That I'd feel better if my ego was vacant

In closing, I'd like to thank You for her
For every word she spoke to help me rest assured
That I'm not lonely, that I'm not falling away
For every time she reminds me of You and lives up to her name
Thank you for everything, thank you for having patience with me
Thank you for reminding me that God is all that I will ever need
Thank you for praying for me, thank you for giving me room to breathe
Thank you for letting me see who I am and who I want to be",Impatience,2015

Don't ever fuck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the Jon Cletta
Or the black boots
Jumpin out to act cool
Cars never lease 'em
Girls ? 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants got a crease in 'em
All calls valid
Never hard mallet

Been up in you favorite star's stlyus

Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert

Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door
Gun hold for fun though

Guy- Yo, yo, yo, yo (Cam- What's up?) what the fuck is wrong with you
Cam- Fuck that it's not a game
Guy- Yo, you ain't gotta be rythmin for niggas like that

Cam- What?
Guy- Tell these niggas the real deal
Cam- Aight check it

Aiyyo I'm ?, cook up the crack
Everytime you look up a gat
Got you shook up attack huh
Look in the back, nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up in check
On this work of the rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the fuck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns, you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner and you're a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain dead
Light this herb 
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnapings and hostages
So, y'all better obey
We shoot pro way 
Mess with us no way

Cam'ron,"(Cam) Father
(Minister) Yes my son
(Cam) Forgive me for I have sinned
Its been 21 years since my last confession
(Minister) 21? That seems like a very long time for
you to miss confession my son
(Cam) Yeah, but I'm only 19
(Minister) 19?
(Cam) Yeah
(Minister) that's interesting
(Cam) Yeah, its like I just have these dreeeamz, and you know

Verse 1

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo father, where you want to start
How I love ladies
Or how I'm slug crazy
Or how I'm a thug maybe
From a drug baby
I need more than just a slight high
I mean father I'm blind out my right eye
Don't mourn and cry
Cause we were born to die
So fuck mom and father cries
I was one never to bother guys
But when my girl got sadamized
I was dramatized
Shoved the dick down her throat and
Told her it was a taste test and
Take a deep throat so she wouldn't have to waste breath
I mean they fucked her and stuck her
I said man fuck a AIDS test
Cause I'm gon' go raw anyway
I'm one that like to chase death
But that guy, got to get him hit
Wild hairs and tattoos and spanish
Wait, wait, wait, who that description fit
Don't give me chrome for Jenny Jones
My man with the crime sheet
But he kept talkin bout my girl was a dime piece
And she had a nice figure
Drove a nice Vigor
And for mr to bag her
That I had to be a nice nigga
Wait, wait, don't appall me yo
I can't jump to conclusions that's all we know
But his wife did use to call me yo
Now I roll for the hell
I'm sorry father
Let me go head and tell
How I really want to be old in a cell
See my two year old nephew
I swear I was holding him well
Til he cried, and he cried, and he cried
I had to scold him and yell
Ya know one thing led to another
I said oh what the hell
Then I threw him against the wall
His parents I told them he fell
that's why I'm going to hell
This shit ain't going that well
Too many things I did that aren't loose
Smoke and leaks like giving a car a boost
My grandfather got me mad
And I peed inside hid orange juice
And asked him if its tangy
When I'm angry
Then one day
When I thought it wasn't a sin left
I ran into my aunt
With the fat ass and the thin chest
I don't really want to talk about it
Or get in depth
But father I'm gon' leave you
With this last word called incest

(Cam) You know what I'm sayin'?
(Minister) My son, my son, remember the words of the Lord. 
Isaiah chapter 59, verse 1, behold, the Lords hands is not shortened,
that it cannot hear, but your enipirings have separated
between you and your God, and your sins hath speakath
boastfully, that he will not heal.

Verse 2

Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
See father I lost my scruples
Went straight banoodles
When I raped that putu
And tried to turn the putu
Into, veh, Oodles of Noodles
Now I'm chased by the voodoos
See what that dust does
I love that Vanessa heffa
But I jerk off 'til I bust blood
Oh yeah I got my balls pierced
And my psychiatrist I ain't seen him all year
He........

(Cam singing)
Hey little baby don't you cry
Mama gon' make sure you get high
Put that vodka in your milk
Make sure that your bottle filled

Oh that was just a little song my mother 
Sang when she was stressed yo
I don't know why she got mad when I cry 
If the bitch deaf yo
Who the F know
But death row
I'm coming by the inches
And them niggaz outside on the benches
Don't think that we in the trenches
Cause we got a 600
And we ride like the Princess
But my cousin Blood yo he died like the Princess
20 years old and dead
BMX days he played the front
I rolled the pegs
My girl want to know why I'm cold in bed
Tellin' me to hold my head
Askin' why I scold my kids
Cause I don't want them litlle muthafuckas
To touch the drugs I sold and did
But fuck it I'll take my own life
And cut a vein Black
Why don't you do like the cartoons
And tie me up to the train tracks
Or fuck the glory
Why don't you drop me from the 6th story
That'll be a sick story
Wait, wait, wait, speaking of sick stories
Oh father don't start me tweakin
I don't want to talk about that Sunday evening
That cold November weekend
When I had to grab that Deacon
And put him into my dungeons of heathens
And then in tongues I was speakin

(Cam speaking in tongues)

Then I woke up to loud preaching
Oh that's just the Pastor
Flippin through the Bible
Reading the scriptures on the rapture
I guess it was my soul he was trying to capture
He missed me by a hairbone fracture
But he wanted to lay me down in a green pasture
But yet aiya
Still feel like I'm in a bed of fire
Like Jebaniah
why'knaw I'm sayin cause
It's like Daniel trapped in a lion's pit
Father I feel like I'm dying quick
that's why I ain't shit

(Cam) So, could you just please fuckin' help me please?
(Minister) My son, my son
(Cam) Please
(Minister) I understand that you're stressed my son, but
don't forget the words of the Lord my son, which reads....",Confessions,1998
Cam'ron,"[Cam'ron]

This song is about young children
who live in single family homes and
their mother or father chooses their 
boyfriend or girlfriend over you. Remember
parents, kids don't ask to be born.  So I'm tell this
story and it starts back in '88.

Yo, this nigga named d-rugs
My moms dates him
Swear to God I hate him
If I could I would break him
When he comes around, her brain sizzles like a Steakum
Damn, can't jakes take him
She neglected me
Run around with this punk nigga recklessly
Had him in her tongue
Guess she was in ectasy
For her love
Took the best of me
O-d'd excessively 
That's her boyfriend 
Or her toyfriend see
Let me specify 
The last man 
Took the money
Left the guy
Desert dry
And gave it to d-rugs
He kept her high
Runnin around 
He's a facial
Smelled like a fragrance
She sniffed it in her nasal
Beggin her to listen
I told her he ain't faithful
Fuckin wit Aunt Rachel
Ya'll so dumb
Makin me look disgraceful
He got a girl named Hazel
And another white one
But wit him
he ain't racial

[Chorus]
I'm your mother 
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga 
In the alley
I'm your doctor 
When in need
I'm your Coke
I'm your Weed
You know me
I'm your friend
Your main boy
Thick and thin
I'm that monster in your dreams
For my love 
You will feen.

[Cam'ron]
What the deal dun?
It's '91
Moms still strung
On this nigga d-rugs
His game's tight
Every night she tries to go pursue him
Then she screws him
But my man Un knew him
Schooled me to him
Said he got mad hoes
He used to pimp him
Said he can get you mad doe
What you mean?
He just ain't wit your mother
He's got other partners
He's a foreigner though
The cops don't like
Illegal alien 
Can't even say his name on the phone
But you can get money with him
Then leave him alone
Or you'll be inside the new cuffs
Plus a news rush
Said some more about him
Then he introduced us
Took me to the block where everybody get him off
Showed me his clientele
Ever since--Hit it off
He was right
D-rugs got dumb freaks
Men and women love him
Got him 10 grand in one week.

Chorus

[Cam'ron]
Now it's 98 
D-rugs, he payed me well
500 S-E-L
Got me land in A-T-L
It's all swell
Way before a felony
But now that we together
It seems that moms in jealous
Cause he wit me now
And everyone time I g him
But when it comes to her
She even pay to see him
Eh yo, money excites me
But my niggas on the block
They got shysty
Cause I'm wit d-rugs
They don't like me
Tried to snipe me
Right before the damn feds had indicted
And my mother 
Her nostrils wide
Too much of d-rugs left her hospitalized
We both was arrested
Stars of the block
Her by cardiac
Me by the cops
But for my mother
Man there's nothin but love
But that's what we get--Fuckin wit Drugs.

[Chorus]",D Rugs,1998

(Come on chill man, don't take me)
Don't take you why not? Cause you rhyme now? 
Listen here muthafucka lie down

What about that bitch that you fucked wit' AIDS?
Aww shit come on death I ain't know that, 
You know I wouldn't of went up in that bitch kojak
Yeah but her ass was so phat. But let's go back to when your ass stole cracks
But I was a little cat that ain't know jack
So I know that but lets go black when they put you in the trunk of the gold
hatch
Oh yeah with the cold rats. But back then I even came back with rabies
But you still living that was way back in the 80's nigga
But yo you tried to get me once when my house caught on fire
So I let you go when your girl called you a liar and choked you with your
necklace
And what about when your ass drove wreckless
Wha what in the Lexus? Come on now I'm thinking of Blood in the BM
Well I know where he at nigga yo you want to see him
Ayo don't play wit me nigga you'll get lead in yo head
Yo shut up nigga you bout to die you can't kill me I'm dead
This is how I get extortion. I coulda got your ass when you was a portion
Mom wanted abortion
Yo why didn't you come get me when my time was done?
When I didn't have a penny and I was confined to crumbs?
When I wanted to kill myself and couldn't find a gun
Oh yeah that time you was beeping me 911
But to mean I was petty
But now I ain't ready
Man Cam hurry up I got to go get little ready
Me and her got a little 2:00 appointment 
She playing with wires while she eating on a ointment
Yo but I don't want to even join the casket crew
Too bad mutha fucka be back in a few
Yo chill, chill chill yo, shit.

(chorus) x3

Oh you slid up on me. Ayo Death hurry up before they give up on me. 
Come on, my man
It's your time, it's your time
Ayo Death I forsake you, I ain't trying to snake you
Well why shouldn't I take you
Well I understand I stole bottles. But nowadays I'm the one the little grove

Yo I'm like a role model. And my girls pregnant
Look don't hand me the game
Yo for real I don't want to see my family in pain
Look Cam, man, shut up
But, but
What, what
Yo man that fucked up
Yeah, well tough luck
Ayo just show me the light and get me through the fog
What about Mr. Diggs and Jimmy and the God
Oh your crew after you left they got a little chest hair
After hard rocks yo they'll meet you here next year
Ayo what happened to em
You know niggas on the hill sniped em
Ayo why they just ain't fight em?
See funerals I like em you see family and friends
Yeah don't forget the snitches
While you looking for them man I'm looking for the bitches
And you don't need no ends, and nigga no friends
I'm just gonna go wit you I ain't got no wins
Lemme get my shit man I'll go check it. 
Matter fact death you got to give me one second
Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die.....
Ayo man, cut the crap man just get yo shit man and that'll be that
Man fuck it death I'm ready to go lying in the ditch
Aw Cam yo you always fucking crying like a bitch

Just wanted to waste time you someone to laugh at
Ayo why you fuck with me just give me one answer
Ayo I see you next album with my man lung cancer

Cam'ron,"Eh yo  why am I gonna sit here and let ya'll bug me 
'Cause I got a dime and a girl who love me 
And when we alone she ain't all lovey dovey 
Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga fuck me 

And uh I don't do nothing for my baby girl to not trust me 
I don't do nothing for her to bust me 
I would love her if her rings were rusty
Feet were crusty and arms were musty 

'Cause ain't nobody gettin' that just me 
And ain't nobody hittin' that just me 
If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me 
'Cause she know how many girls lust me 

Back in the day they wouldn't even touch me 
Now they say they don't want nobody but me 
To tell the truth, them girls just disgust me 
'Cause I already found the one that love me 

[Chorus: x2]
It's all good lovin' somebody 
As long as somebody loves you back 

Mess with her? I ain't have to 
But player I was glad to brown skin dove 
But her love won't pass you promised her a ring 
Along with a shine never stressin' my rhyme 

All she wanted is time, where you find her at 
'Cause you a grimy cat 
Puffin' dime sacks to see where my mind be at 
And I told my other niggas that I told her yo 

I don't always have to hit the twat 
Just to get you hot you don't believe me 
Then pick a spot but remember, I lick a lot 
Ayyo she likes to trick a lot just to get a bigger knot 

Loves to see her nigga hot worries if I'm jigged or not 
And her stuff hot and divine 
And the things she cops top of the line 
Baby is hot and divine always poppin' some wine 
And then she told me Cam, I got a rock on my mind 

[Chorus: x2]

It feels good when you love em' 
And they lovin you back go tit for tat 
Never scratch your back 
Matter of fact she touches and grabs 

Not to lust you bad just to get you mad 
When we alone she screams and moans 
She don't front on me 'cause she don't want to be alone 
Come on everybody needs somebody 

Ay Papi, take her out 
Uh-huh no doubt 
Then we lace her out 
Uh-huh no doubt 
Then we ski her out 

Ski her out 

Then we eat her out 

Eat her out 

Come on, where your man at? 
Where's your plans at? 
You ain't go away this year, where your tan at? 
'Cause me and ma just came from the tropics 
Wit her legs cocked and she beggin' me to stop it

Sprinkle ten grams of coke on their corn flakes
To make em frosted flakes
Oh, these jewels on my neck
You'll say the Lord I'm saved

You think you can afford a date
But yo your men should know
That my crew, we intend to blow
Treat you cats like Martin Lawrence
And motherfuckin end your show
When I say no
What don't you understand the N or O
Like that nigga Jigga said
Yo, you either friend or foe
So respect my wish 
I'm a perfectionist
And wit the gun
Is the only time a nigga plays catch or kiss
Check the list, how many necks I twist
Who expected this, Exodus
Blow over night, or even sex a bitch
But she catch feelings everytime I hit her off
On my dick so bad I need Cochran to get her off
Ask my nigga Digga
Or my other nigga Mr. Ross

To make it that you get across

Niggas grab they dick and diddy bop
Then pull they skully down
And put their ice grill on 
Like they don't trust a nigga
And walk around the club
Like they bout to crush a nigga
I get a nigga mad enough to when he snuff a nigga
No need to boast 
Yo, I fuck around and bust a nigga
You got to love a nigga 
The way I rhyme what
Cause out west they fuckin throwin gang signs up
Wildin all out and not carin where they wind up
Next day same ice grill along the lineup
Ya'll niggas' time up

I'll snatch your kids quicker than B.C.W
What you mad about?  I see a lot of tightened jaws
I got a lot of hoes, but I'm really, really liking yours
Not to nag her, wonder if I can bag her
It ain't if I can have her, it's HOW I'm gonna have her
I'm a lay her like a quarterback
On her back
On the mat
Found out that you want to act
We ran through her
You want her back?
Come on wit that
You kiss a hoe
But when the bitch leaves
You fuck around and miss the hoe
Oh, I'm the type to kiss the hoe and diss the hoe
Choke and threaten to kill her, like her last name's Carlissimo
Listen yo, trick the hoe and get her dough
That was Pryor like Richard yo
See I done been around the world
See I met Puff and I know Mason
But still the best nation
Nigga is donation
So let me hold somethin
Yo, you can't change my livin
This robbery's a holiday
Call it Thanksforgivin'

And I'll do anything for you, even give my last breath
I wish you the best, man I love you to death

I don't care what they think about us
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they think that we're fucking
I only love you this way

Don't care about the way girls thinking you twistin' my back
Bought the chrome almost so you can christen the AC
In '91 when you was young and I was dumb and
Robbing niggas splittin' the figgas wit you boo, screw who?

Incest, never dissed a kiss shine on your wrist for a birthday gift
Niggas like, you must've bent that she never would've spent that
On Cam'Ron I bought me my first box of tampons
Bleeding in the pants at the school dance

Never took a chance at romance although all my friends think ya fly
But me doing that, I think I'd die, we like Thelma and JJ, Brandy and Ray J
Anyone against C and C, pulled a AK
Thinkin' 'bout sucking your dick, had me sick
But if I lost my mind, you'd be the first I'd lick

I don't care if they try to avoid us
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else but
Me and you boo, me and you boo, me and you boo

A-yo I'm sorry yo, but when it come to Charli
I wouldn't hit that, we got back like Atari
How you live mister? Yo you see me and CB she a wig twister
Call her my big sister she game heads

Never wear the same threads
I wouldn't hit that if we slept in the same bed
Fucking with her, yo shit get sliced her wrist is ice
And rappin', the bitch is nice

She told me how girls fool you for the bucks
And I should stay low, cool up in the cut
I told her the difference a wooler from the blunt
That's how we get down so cool I call her cha'

And any girl next to her, just to run her up
That's why y'all run a muck thinkin' that I done her up
I thought about it once when we grew up
But then I saw her naked and I threw up

A-yo Cam, yo
Yo I know you knocked Charli off
No I did not man, yo stop lying
Word to my mother, I did not hit that man

A-yo I'm your dog duke you can tell me
Nigga I would tell you if I did her
Yo I know you hit that, yo how the head, how the head kid?
Yo I did not touch her, that's like my sister

Yo, stop frontin' that's like my sister, word to mother
Yo you lying, whatever man whatever
Yeah, aight a-yo Charli, what's up with you and Cam
Nothin' that's my dog, saying this together

Come on now I know how that nigga roll and he look good
Come on that's like my brother, he probably got a lil' dick
Let me find out, a-yo see we're just alike, call it ironic
But why they don't listen when I say we're platonic

Well you know how niggas talk just for wreck
If my dick was hard and your clit was wet
A-yo a-yo Cam watch your mouth, don't disrespect
I remember when your ass got hit with the Tech

Well I remember that girl tried to slit your neck
And you remember that stank bitch hittin' the deck
Yeah that's when your pretty ass ate coochie free though
And I took you off canal right down to Tito's

But when the cops pulled us over I had to keep the heat low
But I gave you the money to pay off the repo
A-yo you real funny, yo you know how we go
Yeah, motherfucking peoples, uh, without the egos

And I'll do anything for you, even give my last breath
I wish you the best
Man I love you to death

[Chorus]
I don't care what they think about us
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they think that we're fucking

Mama used to say take it in your stride.
Uh, uh, Killa Cam.

Live your life.

Eh yo, Cam, this rap shit.
How you know I love games?
It's like I got a habit.
Gotta keep the drug game.
Why?
Until we blow up with that ol' platinum thug thing.
Eh yo, what you think, lame nigga, I feel the same.
'Cause I be outside, nigga, cocaine and me.
But if it ain't about money, then it ain't about me.
Well I ain't in poverty and no one's starving me,
'Cause when we first felt heat we sought robbery.
Now, ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black?
I know y'all ain't gonna come out and front like that.
When y'all got knocked, y'all was dying in jail.
The way you keep on calling, crying for bail,
Acting like criminals, y'all some fake generals.
What you know about bail being more than ten thousand?
Peep the old way, how I done sold cake
Behind the closed drapes, on one of your old plates,
And the tubes of Colgate.
Two and four states, yeah, I can verify;
Man, a nigga never lie.
Go 'head wit' your killer schemes.
Nah, we gotta iller dreams.
Land in the Philippines, I got about four mil' a piece.
Kiddies on the corner, they got a lil' team,
And they keep frontin'.
Are they gonna jump me too?
I wish they would
Jump me, please, jump me too.
That's what I'm sayin with y'all.
Monkey see, monkey do.
Now y'all niggas can see why I want to plead insanity,
But what the fuck am I gonna do, this just my family.

Mama used to say take it in your stride.
Mama used to say live your life, live your life.

Now when it's time to chill out
I might pull the silks out,
But I'll do your body good 'cause you know I'm illed out.
I took an ill route, I might pull some krills out,
'Cause that cash and the weed, you know I'm still about.
Well, what you want baby, a description of me?
I'm frontin' with the ladies, having you picture me.
Well, I'm tattooed out, with a scroll of my fam,
And the long sliky hair with the bow-legged stands.
You in my V, in the rear, on the low from your man.
Yo, I do many things, but I ain't holdin' your hand.
Do you know how to scuba?
I got a house in Aruba.
But you keep it on low 'cause my spouse got a Ruger.
Yo, you see I ain't dumber, on me some type of tutor,
'Cause I been had the info, on the whores wit' the hooters.

Get out my house, 'cause I will shoota.
Federica, I will step to her.
Senorita know how I maneuver.
Mamasita sip margarita.
Messin' with Cam you get punched in your mouth.
Only key you ever had was the one to your house.
F a spouse me single, I'm one of the ones.
You think Cam's nice?  He's a son of a gun.
'Cause I have heaters before them sneakers;
When Run had Adidas, and reefer was cheeba.
Although I'm an entity,
All those crooked crooks down town remember me.

You remind me of your daddy.

Why you hittin' me? Stop.

But they a pain in my balls 
Got to train'em like dogs 
From how they, walk and they talk and when they sit on the couch 
To how they, lick in they mouth and never shit in the house 
But I make, babies with babies 
Let the street drive'em crazy 
They say ""Cam, good you saved me"" 
Now I pimp'em and they pay me 
They feelin' it like Jay-Z 
Or Suger Hill like AZ 
When Party Time like plainly

Oh baby they have you stressed, nigga 
Mad depressed 
I want they mind... Muthafucka, you could have the rest 
'Cause I gas'em up, I tell them I'm more than just the lover 
I want to be your friend, father, confidant and brother 
See my, nine-inch slugger now she, chose her devotion 
With messing with my money, girl you messing with my emotion

Condoms when I grab them hips 
Kiss and mix you wrap them lips 
And if she act (Smack the bitch) 
If she whack (Smack the bitch) 
Sad to see the way it had to be 
Smack the bitch the bitch don't smack me 
Cupid's snap me but so are mine on my lines 
Yo, my rhymes got a concubine 
'Cause I control they mind 
Avoid the crew 
'Void the groove 
Got more doe, than the feud 
Got more hoes, than the few 
If I die they wouldn't know what to do 
Whatcha think all they do is cry? 
Tell you this between you and I 
Forty slit wrists outta the forty nine suicide

And now I'm drunk off the Henny now 
Went off the Remmy now

Range Rover, Rolls Royce even got a Rocky Rolly
See more ice than a hockey goalie

Now I live it out
Cars got to whip it out

Why I be long gone
Where maybe Hong Kong
Girls with their thong on
I'm playing Don Juan
Drinking Char Don
Where the trauma
You smoke weed what you think girl uh huh
Start the car up
Take her on a long ride
Yo she think my steering wheel on the wrong side

Yo I ask her if she miss it
Then I tell her to kiss it

But it's true about Duke from the hoop to the five
And I'm right behind him in a coup that we drive

If you want to scrap 
We can
But I feel like Jackie Chan
Exactly man

Murder thoughts like John Woo
I'm here for Bi
Not to con you

Yo, I would hate to have to bust her
That's petty black
Matter of fact get out the way
I know where that maschetti at
Give me that

That's when the chink goes flip
Then grabs me like Spock

And in a puddle of blood
Is where that bitch laid

Now everything is set up

Yo, I'm the same cat that you see in all places
Got a mil in hundreds and it's all small faces
Old school money, uh huh, we got access
What you get a year, we spend that on taxes
We don't talk to niggas, we just wait for faxes
End up wit the cash, you bent up in the trash
Leave you wet, we set, in a net, in the dash

Nigga like me been a vet since the past
Who out here don't feel I'm lockin' it yet
Video time, no props on the set
If you see a car that's my drop on the set
If you see jewels that's the rocks on my neck
And if a club scene really pop to be wet
We just bought a chopper, you coppin' Bigets
If you feel different, I'm stoppin' the bet
You rockin' a vet while we hop on a jet

[Chorus]

Hey pretty mama come wit me
If you think your a nasty girl
Your man had you livin' in a fantasy
But it's really Cam'Ron's world
Meet me at the door about a quarter to four
And bring four more girls (bring 'em all)
My mans outside in the parking lot
With the six chromed out in pearl

And yo, you know my style when we creepin' too
Yo, who that boo, your man beepin' you
Well say your wit Lexis, with the Lexus
God damn yo, I just missed the exit
I''m kinda tipsy, I don't want to wreck shit
And don't think ma, that I'm on some next shit
Just wanna know if we can get breakfast
Then go to the telly for some sex shit

Cam'ron,"Yo, turn me up some be
I'm about to lace ya'll, check it out
I'm not a muthafuckin' joke be
Whoever think I'm not nice
This is for ya'll punk muthafuckas
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

See the drug game was always the man's sport
That's what Cam thought so everyday
I had a hundred grams bought
On the transport kept it inside the Jansport

A real hooty game, we ain't care who we blame
Shit was all the same until Guili' came with a moody aim
You know the mayor nigga, a fight crime approach
Acting like a kind host but gettin' time for a roach

A little indo, that's when yo, I said
""I'm messin' with these bimbos""
It's easier to pimp hoes, nowadays they simp hoe
It don't take much to make her

Just take her to a place where it's nice
Show her the ice and might give her a fake fur
'Cause girls I control them classy
Old and sassy, old and nasty

I ain't gonna front that nigga Gold, he gassed me
But now I'm flowin' fastly, rollin' jazzy
Just a while ago, I was rollin' badly
We was on the low wit Aggie but now what have we

Range Ro' and Navy life size
My girl yo she slices pies
A Benz is what my wife drives
You know Qeet' nigga, executive thug

But she respects me and loves
Don't let your head meet her slug
Until she sprayed out and laid out
Ineffections of blood

A lil' thick chick that'll click quick
Do anything for the dick dick
You know what else that puzzles me?
I find this shit a riddle

How come when you got a lot?
People say you got a little
Like they say you act a little funny
'Cause you got a litte money
And you did a little song and made a little money

Oh, you know my favorite
Oh, you think you a little star
'Cause you got a little fans
And you drive a little car

I prove they all are liars
Saying that they got a fire
Hang 'em up on a barber wire
Yo, you think you got attire
To the point like Stoudamire

Yeah, I'm a harsh nigga that drink hard liquor
A six Benz car getter, you know Digga
He ain't rich, he's a star figure
Platinum deep, hangs with Jews
Chills up at their barmitzfah's

He loves the hooligans
Now we eat at houlihans's
Seen Ed Lover and Doctor Dre
We told them niggas who the man
Pulled the toast out on these niggas one time

And even Cuda ran, you know that I'm a skitzo
Who listens to calypso but I'm quick though
And old school like hungry, hungry hippo
Ask my Queens niggaz how I get dough kiko

Now I beat up clicks, eat up chicks
Ask my man how I beat up shit
And when I'm out of work, I got to re-up quick
Every six the same pies, drink from Cris' to St. Ides
Every hit my bank rise and no bitch I ain't high

I've been hotter since
I was in pampers hittin' pinatas
You win nada, come on I got put on
By Mase and Big Poppa

So I'm glad you sat down
I ain't want Uncle Un to bring the gats down
He spat rounds, I heard that nigga clap towns
But me I never back down

My mother, she can sign that
I know you're thinkin' that It's 'bout that time
Nigga I wanna rewind that
So go ahead and rewind it faggot

Ay Yo you got ta undastand

Plus your cool wit my girl
Now I don't really understand how dat cat he be stressin you
I don't understand that you grown but yet he question you
Guessin that you love him but you in it for tha pay
But he know where you at every minute of tha day
But since we learned to creep
Is like we yearn for sleep
And my girls in my face when i don't return tha beep
Its like a sin or a crime
you in tha benz all tha time
But ya man know you ain't wit ya friends all tha time
Ill be selfish
Sayin chancin tha long
Dats why I hang up when he answer tha phone
And Ill be callin from tha house in tha paul lobby
Plus I know him he too cheap for caller ID
And my girl in my face jus stressin me child
But Ill dial anotha number if she press redial

[Chorus]
Ay yo me and you creep right now its all fun
But you ever really think about tha long run
When tha nights over and its all done
Were tha wrong ones were tha wrong ones
Ay yo me and you creep right now its all fun
But you ever really think about tha long run
When tha nights over and its all done
Were tha wrong ones were tha wrong ones

[Cam]
I feel bad but good uh huh
When I'm sexin you
But undastand its more than jus tha sex with you
Its ya otha side you show me your intellectual
The way you handle tha things
Minds a professional
But a real freak behind close doors
And you have me open tha way you throw yours
What tha hell you think why I bout those drawz
And when you go down how you move those jawz
Oh Lord
For you Ill be out on a search
Damn you look good in ya blouse and ya skirts
But we got to be careful when we out doin dirt
This ain't about us its about who we hurt
But ?mom? i love ya technique
Tha way you make tha bed squeak
Ya man can't get it up
Maybe girl he deat meat
So lets creep
In a lex jeep
At a secret location do it again next week

[Chorus]

[Cam]
Now that I sit here I lay distraught
Tha feelings get involved when you play tha sport
Cause when I'm wit my girl you even stay in thought
And that dates back to my days in court
Sayin you admired tha way I fought
you ain't even listen when my airplay was short
Me for you girl yo I feel we deserve it
But you ever really think about is it worth it
When tha nights over and tha cris' is gone
You got kids and a man playin mr. mom
Your man and my wife will be gone in tha smoke
'cause tha last time we did it tha condom broke

[Cam'Ron]
Aye yo I just walk wit' y'all I don't want to rhyme 
I just need talk wit' y'all 
Mamasita senorita 
I'm lookin' for my wifey 
Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me 
They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels icy 
Tryin' to settle down Ma, stop actin' all feisty 
Cause 'I don't want to be a playa no more' 
Know it's soft, but I came with a core 
For the love of Money, Charli, whoa It Ain't My Fault 
Like Silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it 
The whole Squad is Terrorin', cats is No Limit 
And I'm a diplomat, I'm a diplomat 
Where my honies at? Where my money at? 
That's why we act like that 
Clak clak clak, pat pat pat! 
So all you girls bring your thongs and shit 
Don't front, cause you know what song this is 
Just don't know

Ya don't know what we're going through 
Ya don't know the things that Cam is showing you 
What we're about to do

You and your family through

Yo, yo 
All the mommy's know me, the Spanish kid wit' the goat-ti 
And fixes the land, I be a mothafuckin' O.G. 
Ya my taste, thick in the waist, pretty in the face 
Dominican race, like my Twin Triple says 
Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in 
Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick 
Reppin' Uptown to Harlem World, where we at 
I'm up coughin' in the ambulance 
From way downtown, they got the Horses and the Carriages 
For forty bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on 
Another twenty, puff lye and get ya crush on 
It's all love, just like the Bud when ya hit it 
Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it 
So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark 
And most importantly, stay away from Central Park 
Cause cops live, just to put away a thug 
But not today, cause me and my baby in the Cabaret of Love 

[Chorus]

[Charli Baltimore]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uhh 
I thought I already barked on cats about Russ Hadden 
It ain't work, gotta Scream on cats like Wes Craven 
Oww! They ain't know I had it in me 
Like Lil' Kim, didn't know they had it in me 
Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show 
Cam and chrome bag the hos, in Prada bags all the dough 
And caked out, break out, uh 
Horse & Carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats 
And they ain't know, passin' that down 
Where I come from 
Ask Jane, that's my dun-dun 
How we handle them dumb dumb's 
And we like, Siskel and Ebert 
We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right 
And down if they new jack's 
You might see Charli, in a Benz or Ferrari 
Hennesey or Pacardi, gettin' bent at a party 
But I flip, be the new face, cover of Trace 
This the muthafuckin' remix, we ain't need no Mase

[Silkk The Shocker]
I live life like a thug, cause time's is rough 
Convicted felon 
Now I'm like, rhyme for bucks 
Ball till I fall, should I say, my time is up 
And I cop you diamonds, never diamond cut 
Forget the money, cause I could ball with or without the shipment 
And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick 
Silkk the Shocker, Cam'Ron, now how you gonna doubt us a hit 
(Must be a car), Miss I could pull you, with or without the six 
Now I ain't the C-E-O, but I ain't far from it 
So if I ain't far from C-E-O 
That mean I ain't far from havin' C-E-O money 
Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much 
Like Mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust 
So many styles 
Drop a beat, I'ma drop a hit 
Rap game stop for the dope game 
And cop a brick 
No Limit Soldier baby, so watch the talk 
Get lost like, Oh It Ain't My Fault! 
I'm from the N-O, L-I, M-I to the T 
Tru my click, Silkk, the Shocker, yeah that's me 
Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it 
Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like 
Ooh I love Silkk, and then, ooh I hate him! 
Cause they can't have me, but I don't look 
I can't afford to live average 
So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage 
Now I don't want to settle down, but we can do it like we married

Cam'ron,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??

Ayo my niggas can't take music
Everybody rap to us, so we hate music
Now we make the hate music
We 'bout to rape music, straight up degrate music
You ain't 18, shit, don't even play music
Killin is another high
I hope your girl get AIDS, your brother crash and dash
Or your mother die, and your sister is a topless dancer
No answer, glaucoma, and your pops got cancer

Yo I'm a motherfucking nightmare, y'all can either love me or hate me
Know alotta niggas wanna slug me and waste me
That's why I never keep the gun on safety
When I get this money, y'all gon hate me
Y'all act like Harlem ain't that shit, go 'head and play dumb
Like y'all don't know where AlPo and Rich bought the caine from
Sugarhill cocaine slums, get it correct
Real niggas spit at your chest, look at your death
Y'all cop Playstations, play Live 2000
I'ma cop guns, try to survive 2000
Nigga like me be on the block every day
While you think your moms look rocked every day

Keep the thang close, ready to pop every day

I got the gun and clip, runnin shit
I run chains, run rings, run in your block, make you run
Then I run things
Piss in a cup, come on, fuck a drug test
I'm on my block, knockout kings, slugfest
A few beers cold, come through here bold
A few of us blew our goals when fuckin two years old
Off to the lobby, all to the body, then auction a shottie
Go to Boston and party hardy with Walter McCardy
Drunk, smackin bitches off the Bacardi
Hustle often as robbery, so guns, coppin double
Fuck around with me, I'ma pop your bubble
Put up my own yellow tape, save the cops the trouble
If you wanna see my true portions, screw bossin
Kill you like Mike pop for new Jordans
Come through flossin, jail ain't nothin for me
I got cake baby, bail ain't nothin for me
I'm that same son of a be, gun in the V
Coke, guns, hookers, I'm the one that you see
Cats still talkin fly, put his tongue in a tree
If we nice, then we'll let him keep his lung for a G

How we pull up in whips the minors stop and stare
And when it comes to girls they behind us everywhere

I mean when I hang up on 'em they pressin' redial
I mean what the fuck is it why you stressin' me child
It'd be one thing if you were finessin' my style
But when I go to court, you know the dress of the trial

You not my wife, so if I ask head I be fowl
You better be down, the only question better be, how
Threaten me now, bet me a thou, no dirl deadin' me now
In the SC we're gone, are you sexy in thongs

Uh, you don't know what that is
That's when I say, ""They don't know who gat this is""

And you don't know yo' guns is hand me downs
And you don't know we'll put you where you can't be found
And you don't know you better toughin' up
'Cause you don't know nigga will fuck you up

And you don't know baby, we don't need you
And when it comes to Jimmy, my name's, 'Me too'
'Cause when he got cash, I was like, 'Me too'
And when he got ass I said, ""Me too""

And when he got the drop I was like 'Me too'
And when he almost got shot I said, ""Me too""

Just show me my room nigga, and get my bags

I guess he was shocked when I touched her ass
It really wasn't nothin' she was peedy aight
""Does that say Harlem World?"" Yeah you readin' it right

And we havin' a party, later tonight
Like Phil Collins said in, ""The Heat Of The Night""
'Cause Cam rocks the party all night long
'Til when? 'Til the early morn'

Six feet deep being crushed my the earth
Bury me wit rings so when I'm plucked from the earth
Every motherfucker see how much it was worth
Oh you stressin' my best misjudgin' of my worst
And all my life put in nothin' but work
Y'all talk about how I was such a big flirt

And I never slowed down 'cause I was fuckin' with skirts
I mean since the early days I was cuttin' from church
Y'all talk about things I've done to my life
You talk about things that I've done to my wife
I know where I'm going so I can come in a crisis
I do this for my niggas, who never get no cheddar
For my niggas up state, that'll never get a letter

For my vitally sick, that would never get no better
For my niggas in the cold, that would never get a sweater
For the life I lead and things I done
A nigga went to school I had to bring my gun
A nigga had to hustle I had to slung them drums
As the man of the house I had to bring income

Stand on this motherfuckin' block again?
Almost get shot again see alotta men get shot up bad
Back up hobbilin', sista out gossipin' so I don't rhyme
For executives, it's imparitive do it for my jail berg consecutive
Get my messages, hell no or my block nigga never live

One room 7 kid, screamin' mother overhead two plates
One fork sour milk and a loaf of bread but I shook it off
Smiled of course kid, my girl wild out on some child support
Shit I'm out exhausted obsolete y'all but girls will flip like

Just here to reach y'all if I do my life over, I repeat all

Since rich and poor, you don't know, get to know
Ain't takin shit to left, Jimmy Jones likes my cock
Right back to the block and cock, it ain't hop and scotch
It's pop and scotch, in a bar they go shot for shot,
Matter of fact, outside the bar they go shot for shot 
Me and my codie on a O-Z, we go rock for rock,
Me and my codie on a role we go rock for rock,
You souped up, think I'm easy to touch,
Then you been watchin' a little bit of TV, too much,
Lots of rhymes, so you see my ass lots of times
On the corner still, like I ain't got a dime
Autographs not the kind to be signin' the crap,
Here's a CD, slash here's a dime of that crack

Shoot at yo feet, make you jump like double dutch,

Not to mention Jada Pinkett over parkin' the range
(Yo that's Will Smith girl) naw she's part of my chain
Pardon my game, car gettin washed in the rain
Runnin yo trap, that'll get you one in yo back
The hood that I had, had to take the good with the bad
Like Joe on the run, put his fuckin P O it's done
Low on his funds, had to get the coke or the guns
Word to the wise, killa Cam, I heard of them guys
Diplomat, crisp black, yo convertible fives
Rims on the wheel, to drive down shows in the South
Rap ain't that great neither, I got coke to give out
Stroke to give out, motherfuckin smoke to give out
Hoes to give out, naw we ain't over this route
Back on the street, Jimmy get the crack on the street
Tour over motherfucka let's get back on our feet

Leased his first beamer now y'all tussle

I was slangin, but wasn't a kingpin, a slow case n', verdict probation
Tried to fuck my P.O., she ignored that
Said, ""Know what Cam your found with more crack""

Cam'ron,"I'm not going to sit here and watch this go on any longer
You know they put my food in the dark
And then expect me to look for my plate on some Mr. Magoo shit
Fuck, I look like, I'm not going to watch this go on any longer

I'm on y'all
Harlem, who else is going to hold us down
Bloodshed niggas
Let's get it right this time around, understand, killer

Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip Daqueri's
Like it's all good down at the hit factory
Be on fifty-fourth, whole clique backing me
All that click clackery, take your wrist wrappery

I ain't no rapper, be, I skeet oozies
And I can't act, turned down three movies
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast

My rude ass, carry three weapons
And I'll give your face a see section and keep stepping
Who else in a hurry to mirk
We kill girls, rape 'em, bury their skirts

Imagine me wake up 7:30 for work, what?
I'd rather run the streets 7:30 with work
But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order
Came and asked me, stop pitching to his daughter

Said me, it's the man, can't be
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties
Got her damn handy
How you going to ever ask, stop carrying candy

I'm a sell to anybody in your damn family
Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy
Your right hand man, Randy, understand me
In Antlanta, I got an outlandish land piece
And a matching land, Desert Calasandi

You know the one with the whips, that's me
The one with the chips and the chips, that's me
The one with the toast, pants baggy, yelling out get at me
Get at me, nigga, that's me

The one that be running and dodging, you
The one that be sucking mad dick, you
The one that's scared of some yay yo
Always wanna lay low 'cause your girl say so, you, biatch

I could show you some ice
Throw you a bite
You not that good dog, who told you you're nice
Your crew, switch siders

When I come through, hey, Cam
Dick riders
But I only mess with Navigators five twenty-eight
Six drivers, big buyers, where you live, we live liver

Come through, stick your suppliers
Mack so many hoes, dick in saliva
Gash her up, ma, put it on you mouth
Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out

And I don't got beef, I don't play those games
If I did though, believe me, I would say y'all names
Go to your house, red dot, scope your crib
Smack your earth, snatch your seeds, choke your wiz

My crew split, it was my mistake
But to my nigga, Duke, we all make mistakes
I'm a get shit right if I spend my cake
Jimmy, I'm a get you up out of 5 H

This is for my niggas that load the pipe
Saying I'm the best, just not promoted right
You know my life
Drink, smoke, roll some dice

Control the hiest
Know I'm a patrol your schiest
We all get schiest
Ma, keep all your rice

Wedding ring, hell no
I like all my ice
Niggas tried to make Killa Cam all polite
Turn on the set now, bitch, I'm like poltergiest

You the type talk about everything you got now
I interrupt you like, ""Not now, you hot owl""
My rings like a dog, all rock wild
When I flash it, everybody shocked, ""Wow!""

I see y'all concerned about me
You ain't got to go to school to learn about me

Yo, the one with mad guns, that's me
The one with the yay for twenty-three, that's me
The one with the ice, sliced, coke half price
Yoke that's nice, that's me

The one that's scared of a scuffle, you
The one that say, ""Baby girl, I love you"" you
The one that talk about hustling, never seen a oven
You all about nothing, you biatch

Told you I got us this time around niggas
Feeling me some, huh
Harlem, I got us nigga

Santana, Freaky Zeeky, Jim Jones, Salty
Feshon, run with us or run from us or get run the fuck over

Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check

I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt some more something and you nothing check
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well
And Government, fuck Government, niggas politic themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, god strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto

I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this

Moving 
Shut the fuck up 

Ay Yo Ay yo Regardless of rain or snow sleet or hail 
I kick street tales choking niggas like I'm sprewell 
Golden state holding your fate in the palm of my hand 
Blow you away like its part of the plan 
I gotta call it like I see it talk it like I be it 
Walkin my walk thugged out orthopedic 
Cause I'm soon to be up, give me room watch me heat up 
Niggas try to stick me like abdul lerima, follow the leader 
Make me go extra hard, yo nore should I hold back or show the repirtore 
Quit at 16 or throw in extra bars just for the non-believers 
I show them why its so hard to reach us 
I get pussy with my fathers features 
Puff heavenly, see me at 6'1"" weigh a buck 70 
Catch me in spots y'all niggas never be 
Packed in like green bay 
Harlem week to queens day 
Performing acapella, no dj 
98 live, no replays 
Make it seem easy, so tell a friend to tell a friend 
That its them again, nature noreaga, wild gremlins 

Yo, yo, champagne on the rocks 
Pour on the fort knox lazura 
Shark salad with cabbage 
Pork chops and applesauce 
Twin connection, disrespect watch your body cave in 
Pump the shotty guagin, hit the shorty while he potty training 
I ain't playing, I'm truly the worst 
Simply the first to get his whole body fully reversed 
Uzi it hurts, leave you double-dead 
I'ma a bubble-head, I never listen to nothing my mother said 
Ay yo I hold niggas ransom for money 
Like Johnny handsome 
Been sonning niggas for so long 
I think I got a grandson 
My passion is money, a stash and a honey 
That won't ask questions but will blast anybody 
That's my kind of girl, kinda of world I want to live in 
Not a cell or a prison or in hell's armageddon 
Just a little ghetto 
Where my niggas control the middle 
We know the riddles of life where others know only a little 

Yo, yo been in rich places, sick places 
Seen my story on six thousand six hundred and sixty six pages 
Wages, I wrote six aces 
And at the same dice games, I caught six cases 
All over big faces, now it's tipped laces 
Ready to dig faces, but the bang it ain't 
Bitch spaces, niggas loading up they rib cages 
Cats like to rip places 
Bloody lip tastes, but the Cam is in big races? 
But I stay in import the pig places 
But the world know the girl though 
I fuck her off a furlough 
She'll be up, hook me up 
All your sales could be luck 
Only question for these ducks is 
Baby girl can we fuck 
You the type that need a wife 
Thought L-o-x told y'all the key to life 
Asshole, yo I don't play around 
I lay it down 
Fuck around, I spray around 
Flick a biscuit, nigga risk it 
My ass, you can kick or kiss it 

Ain't no niggas in the world more thorough than this 
(bust off) and sit the hot barrel dead on your lips 
Like 2 thirds of a brick (penaro and kiss) 
And kiss the crystal white fluffy part in the back of a whip 
See the plan is to stash all, and cash y'all 
The weed so strong, they gotta put it glass jars 
Niggas try to smoke me out, mope me out 
'cause the rims on my new joint be poking out 
I'm about to have no feelings 
Shit is deep, do they dance with the devil when they sleep 
I wake up gripping the air, wishing the hit 
Shit that they kick in ya ear 
When your soul be drifting in air 
My gift is half-rotten when I spit it tears 
That shit'll drop down my eye, I'm too tired to cry 
And I ain't never seen a nigga that too live to die 
They say you get what you ask for, so get it 'cause you asked for it 
If a nigga ain't a thief, then he better have the cash for it 
And we gonna be around til ya body rott 
And if the feds bring us in we get the same time gotti got 

What!what! what! what! 

Yo,yo! ay yo, there's two ways into the hood, one plain 
The other smoke chronic like straight to the brain 
Ay yo lets get loose, Hennesey straight, with tomato juice 
Queens stallion, my guns, fully Italian 
Now y'all niggas recognize medallions 
I play the best hood, o-t with Tim Westwood 
Used to be on section 8, now my section is good 
Thugged out niggas, we eat as much as we could 
And I don't give a fuck what! yo I save my shit 
And I don't give a fuck what! you can save your shit 
Y'all niggas like extra skin on my dick 
Listen to Bob Marley, you funny niggas like Steve Harvey 
Frontin' live with a weak army 
I play the nice guy too, I'll smoke with you 
But the realness, I ain't got no love for you 
That's why I never do a song with you 
Not even if your babies mom fucked the crew 
And promised to give us head and swallow too

I know f***in' with a crook is whack
I lied cheated still took me back
What I do, turn around, ask you to cook me crack
Boost my work with a jerk and tell the truth it hurts
Cause you even ask me to come through to church
What I do, act second rate
I stole ten dollars out of the collection plate
But I'm ready to change
You got my heart, plus you smart
And the sex is great
And you hate rap
I like that girl
I argue with Keisha, I ain't like that girl
You jumped, right out the car, to fight that girl
You be that (?) you ain't have to bite that girl
And my baby got the best thighs
And my whip she ain't never got to test drive
Copped here up, at five
You paid attention when no one acknowledge me
This is my public apology, Holla be

Baby, can we
We can get the drop top or come through on the bike
We could go where you want we could do what you like tonight

I want to be what he wants, when he wants it
Whenever he needs it
When your lonesome and feeling love start I'll be there to feed it
Loving him a little bit more each day
Fears are at hold when I hear him say

You helped me work when we was twelve and a half
You said Cam, what the f*** dog, we twelve and a half
That house cost millions, twelve and a half
But I still got them (?), twelve in the stash
You can't even get mad
Say what the hell just laugh
Standin' there beautiful like what I'm gon do with you
You wanted me to go to school and just play ball
What I do, go to school with that (?)-ball
Here come the (?), here come the (?)
Yeah I dealt that, I'm a hustla though
I can't help that
You was there when I flipped my first birds
Now we gon see my son take his first words
And um, absurd, I ain't want to be no singer ma
I just wanted eight carrots on your finger ma
Since were young, you thug me I thugged you
You hug me, I hugged you
You love me, I love you

Little faggot motherfucker like (*Mike Lightly*)

Getting robbed dog, is not my game
My nigga hopped out the van real quick, cocked that thang
Reversed the situation, popped his chain
Be happy we ain't pop his brain
Aiyoo, I treat that show money, Mike..
Like it's coke money, aight?
So you better have it, consequence could be a casket

It's gettin' hard to dodge the women
But I'm still pitching hard white balls

Ya know the kid with the O's

When it comes to sellin' trees
I'm as large as Timberland
My lawyer got my charges slimmin'
He said the only way I am goin upstate
If it's in larger swimmin'
Pull out the garage like gremlins
Anarge with trimmins
System in it that have the projects tremblin'
Ya know nothin' about lettin' a few strays go off
Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off
Shots'll fly by your head
Your toup blow off
I ain't crip I'm just a blue gray show off
Ghetto fab I more than rap for my bucks
Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs
The word I'm ballin' be flowin' to the fed Jakes
And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes
Nigga I walk around with the grams you stackin'

With Kanye on the track of the Dream Team
I'm fin' to be the shit no matter which way you put it
They blessed a nigga in, now I'm fin' to go into a zone
Takin it to some motherfuckers domes
Cause it's on, I will rock until I'm gone
Fillin my body with lead, clutchin' chrome
Take it to your gut, take it to your chest

And we gettin' stronger hope you got a vest
Already got them macs, already got them techs
Served a few dimes, Beans got pearls

How could you haters think we can be done
Hold it down because we got champions!!

And we'll keep on fighting, to the end

We built this city (turn bricks to whips)
We built this city on rock and roll (on rock)
We built this city (in the midst of the struggle)
We built this city on rock (on rock)
We built this city (from bottom to top)
We built this city (through the agony and pain, diplomatic will reign)

Ay yo, my dipset Taliban
We on these streets like the wars on them streets of Afghanistan
Better yet of Pakistan
To America, Harlem's our cater
Any problems I spray her that can startle the mayor
But in this 50-block radius let's get the rock and shave the shit
or get the glock and blaze the shit
Bitches get the cock and savor it
They say Jim Jones the capo my favorite
Cause some of this shit my city wasn't built up over
Drugs and money, some shit you get killed up over
Slumped on your wheel, straight tilt it over
Trust me dogs, I seen it in peril
Niggaz wasted and painted and seen on the mural
(That's Harlem) In this apple of mine is rhyme
Clap up your shines, pop shots that will crack up your minds
And cop rocks and cook that crack up to dimes
New York City, the capital of crime

Now once again it's Santana the Great
I built this city on hammers and weight
Gasoline, rope, bandanas and tape
Lots of fiends, lots of coke being handed away

Shut em down, set up show, how we usually do
Cut em down, hit the block man, we movin through
Diplomats is the strongest force
On and off the court we ballers more than sports
We built this city from ground zero
To spittin the pound zero, brown pistol
At ya get down kicka
Yeah this is from the ground up nigga
So get your weight and your pounds up nigga
Cause when it's beef my homies mound up quicker
Fit the pound much quicker, lay you down much quicker
You never been approached by Golden Eagles
Vultures that will scope and feed you, no court just leave you
Shit you know

It's like what I wouldn't do for a buck
My enemies can't rest in peace Jones, you see they funerals up
New gangstas in the city bitch, ring the alarm
All y'all hoes bow down, kiss the ring of a don
It's about to get real big playa, humongous
Stacked money so long til it grew fungus
We was gon' let you live til you threw punches
Now we got to get critical and we got to get rid of you
And we the most talked about, the most popular
We live by the codes, we the Dipset mafia
You never know who's watchin ya
You never know who's plottin to pop at ya

Child if you style or wild splurge
Stay away OK, Mr Giles'll hurt you

I ain't go to school, stayed the hell at home
In the real estate dog I seen hell at homes
You was selling out I was selling homes
Selling dreams to the phone, I can sell the tone

In the science lab I mix me chemicals
In silicone fella in the vanilla cone
The school even play the recorder
Now days he work for F-E-D-S
And plays his recorder

You think he placing he taping his order
Marking the bills they read, 
Tasting the waterf***ed up
We duct-taping his daughter
That's the taping they taught us

Is to put the is in all

That's a homie right right true

I fell that is only right
That I live the life of rally
I done did knives in alleys, pipes, in rallies
What you do now?
Now I catch flights to Cali
Looking for a wife to spouse I pipe her proudly
She understands my life gets rowdy
I'm the same say
Prane day I'm icy outey

Yo, now I done been on both sides of the fence
Now I done been on both sides of the gate 
Survived and escaped
Look at me now man I'm driving away
Thinking about my old teacher who said I rot and decay
(Never)
I go back and beep the horn at them
Blowing that cheech and chong at them
Yelling, screaming the boy is platinum

It all happens so fast
They all imagine I crash
But I did straight through I'm bad
Like Michael was see what the cycle does
360 spin around, I'm the new kid in town

Yeah it's coming soldier, 
April the month it's over
Yeah your run is over
The album is done I told you
What a classic I made, I look up see Cam
See the game what a path that he made
A beautiful mind trapped in the shade
Cracking codes for the man
Who only stand in the back of my brain
At last I done came up in the proper way
True author like the great doctor J was

You can't respect the amount jewels in this new wide movement
If you don't respect the amount of dudes in this too live movement
Me and Killa, we like them,
Those two guys moving I-95 south dirty
With them two pies moving, moving
Trying to crease out the lightning
Trying to keep out the excitement
But it's hard in this bulls***, in this game
'Cause the secret indictments
And you coke experimenters
And you coke experiencers

Be easy on the phone dog,
'Cause you know the hearing us
You styling them b****es
Cause you know they serious
Just picturing, it's so easy to draw
Stop and freeze at them whores
Then we speed off in cars
Then we breezing the law
Blowing that weed from my jaw

G's up hoe's down
East Side to by dog 
(East Side)
All the time man
Thanks for even asking
Or we be seen in Aspen
In that pool house, that hot tub with that steam relaxing
And we be seen in action

Keep them fiends collapsing
And they thirsty and they nodding and the be ?
They see me my actions
I cruise by in a Beemer just laughing
I let that rock and roll

I coping poppy's load
It was like coping gold, 
I shut down poppy's load
I hit the strip dog

What? Is what's really good? That's the question

Suicide sickness, child negligence
Homicide fingerprints, wild evidence, but what?
But thou shall, respect me bloa, bloa
Clap, clap, pow, pow, bow down, nigga

Be in Columbus never seen Bow Wow, nope
We big dogs, all on the chow down
Chow and Mr. Giles lay back
Santana locked up, get 'em out asap

Aight, now boy, not tonight
I where a bomb to the court like it's a icey white
I'm real icey right, still in the hood
But the question for y'all is what's really good?

Nothing, see me on fifty five, black scooped it up
A K activated, act stupid, one did act stupid
Mac had to move it, from the hood like
What's really good?

I had to lay 'em down, clip him up, sprayed around
Split him up, he played the ground, leave, nine stayed around
Outlaw on the street, shot four from the three
Southpaw Portuguese, what's really good?

Hello, Diplomats are coming to your hood
And we wanna know, what's really good?

All my niggaz, block for block
Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

Okay I admit, I mean they said I was trippin' had to re-edit the spin
Forty four lead when I'm spitting shots to the head of my victims
Big deserts we grippin' to dry out, you in the desert is slippin'

They go through extreme measures to get 'em
Them chains and them treasures the glistening
You got three hideouts, a bed in the system
My brethren I miss them, so please tell me y'all what's really good?

Top of the drop when it's missing
My block when it's clickin'
These rocks when they glistening
What's really good?

One forty fifth on this crunk, big forty fifth in my trunk
Big gouty wrists on you chumps, what's really good?
Mostly me and sometimes them
But mostly me, oh shit man, that's one time them

Squally, so through your set up please
Let me know if you're really good
And let me know if you really hood

Rock for rock, top for top
Top a top, stash your clocks under the hood
And niggaz wanna know, what's really good?

I like this beat, drums and bells
Remind of bullets, bodies, guns and shells
I don't talk the verse, Polly wanna cracker
When she on the stand, you probably wanna smack her

Probably wanna clap her, end your day properly
Air the shit out like the end of State Property
No run away robber, gunner stay half of me
The end I see prophecy, what's really good?

I'm in the buggy mon', with the rugby on
Air Force Ones, looking like you Lucky Charms
Lotta dudes, yelling out fuck me, uh?
I'll blow this bitch dog, what the fuck we on

It's Santana, I'm straight out the box homey
Straight to the stoop, straight to the booth
When I stepped out the box homey
I still got the sun of the box on me
Grimy clothes, funky arms, my socks dirty

I told you I can count on my boy
I'm in trouble, needed bail money, dialed on my boy
Shit and just when I thought it was getting worst
I was bailed out scot-free, spittin' this verse, uh-huh

You don't sit in the dirt, clips'll disperse
What's really good? Me motherfucker
Don't play with this, I'm so great at this

Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
Shit, we live life to the fullest
Three hundred and sixty five nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Shit, and uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, but the morning's much colder
I've seen summers get cold
And niggaz do it up until the point they done and the fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten, up north sitting, just like some fucking lost kittens
They get locked up for carrying boy
Doing time underground up in Marion, boy
Shit, I respect you
You do your time like Gotti, and come home like that Marion boy

You caught a bid? Do it, You got kids? Love 'em, hug 'em

I gotta keep striving, I gotta keep moving, I gotta keep grinding
If this was the road, and I was a trucker, then shit man, I gotta keep driving
Through the lies and deception, had to ride through neglection
I'm an insomniac, up all night, pops and moms was an addict, shit
My puffing scums is a habit
I need me a contingency plan, my pops with the syringe in his hand
He was leaning and nodding
Uncle Ricky your mission is like Afeni was Robin
Shit, you should've seen the apartment
All I ever wanted was franks and beans I was starving
Crack fiends on the carpet, shit
But if it wasn't for grandma
I swear I'm in love with my grandma
That's why I only does it for grandma
That's when I roll in the street
I pray she covers me from the crown of my head, to the sole of my feet

Or a vest can't protect you when I hit you in your chest, duck
The big heads done pushed me

I bring the hammers to the gunfight
One night stand, only standing for one night

Jump back from the coroner, I have you jump in that bag

Oh, come on, fuck with your boy
It's Santana, Heatmakers, where we at?
Let me see you through this
Killa, Jones, Freakay
Yeah man, I'm back at it

Today's a new day, got the boo-lay up in the suitcase
Go uptown to Harlem, tell 'em that I sent ya
Tell 'em it's August, I'm ""Gon' Til' November""
I need a couple birds, get a broad, have 'em sent up
Call my bird, get my broad have her sent up (Please)
Call my niggaz, call my squad, have 'em sent up (Please)
I see a town I'm likin'
See some niggas getting money in a town I like it
I run up on them with the pound and light it
Like it's my block now, all right kid?
He understood me quite clear
Then that thing banged out, ranged out the side of his right ear
And I got back to my business, back to my bitches
Back to the kitchen, that pyrex vision
Pop, I let that white stuff sit in
Get hard, get rock, get to the block and pitchin'
Yeah I'm sorry but this is how I'm livin
And this is how I'm getting, fuck how I get it
Hey!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles
Listening to gangsta music
I stood at home hand on a chrome, with a zone, flippin' the channels
Watching how the gangstas do it
I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math

[Juelz Santana]
Now I see death around the corner
Gotta stay high, will I survive in the city where the skinny niggas die?
Nope, it's the city where the skinny niggas ride
.45 semi on the side, twisting when they drive, yeah
Lick a shot for Big Pop and 'Pac, yeah
One more for Shyne locked inside, yeah
Two more for Cam, for taking over the Roc
Yeah, yeah, it's my year
So, okay, okay, okay, y'all can't fuck with me, no way
Jose or Hector Camacho
Tech blows and watch yo' chest close and tacos
Motherfucker I'm the best, I told y'all before
I should y'all before, ey!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles

I stood alone, getting dome, from a thick chick in sandles
Watching Shaft, clocking math

I'm on the westside of Chicago, lookin' for a bust down
And make me put my two arms up, Touchdown!
You stay in touch now, but when I tough down
I'm like Buckshot shorty, you better ""Duck Down""
Yeah I must clown, I'm from Harlem, Uptown
Where we flash money, take your bitch and ask you, what now?
Birds flip a dozen, chicks is dicks they suckin'
Swallow my kids, go and kiss they cousin
Yes, they kissing cousins, toys kissing muppets
Worst then that, they go home and kiss they husband
That shit's disgusting
Keep the chickens clucking, keep the pigeons buggin'
This on my wrist is nothing
To me it's just yellow hearts and pink diamonds
Where I get the money for this? Don't think rhymin'
You fucking with Pablo, Bravo, Mario Via Bolo ho, Ta-to

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
I stood alone watching the wall, in the zone, hand on my handles

[Verse]
Aiyoo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tuned with
The moon and the stars, some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught, pissy clubs, saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds, run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge: Cam'Ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, aiyyoo
Go get that ya-yo, ya-yo

Now I'm the type of dude, post up sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties, you want it, I got it
You see it, you like it, we count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a menace to the public society
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it I'm driving, I'm puffing high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving, I'm bugging my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers for all they milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
Uh, you niggaz follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

[Chorus]

[Cam'Ron]
Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me, and still a little nigga
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done, steak and chicken, for they friends
And they kids fly, I ain't open friend, on the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes, barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam, for some coke again

[Jim Jones]
Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image, it's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people, why, because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people

Yo, yo I speak pain, I spit power, talk courage, breathe flowers

Don't get caught up when the street showers
When the guns rain, the clips pour, the soldiers grip fours, then begin war
Come on, it's Santana the Great
Tie 'em up, bandana his face, hammer his face, fucker
I'm trying to get my act together, in the booth now trying to get my rap together
You know, I got to fire to heat the street up
Abuse the track, and beat the beat up you know?
You already know what I'm about homie
 I'm young I'm focused I'm just coming out homie
You can go by what you hear through word of mouth homie
Or step out of line, Cam betting the house on me
You know I ain't stopping yet
You know my album ain't done, it ain't dropping yet
I'm in the mist of a bidding war
And we need two milli more just to move in the door, shit

Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it
So line em up, shoot em down

Killa, yo, these girls told you I'm the man right? (right?)
Well listen to lover
When I beef, visions are gutter
Kids clapping, kidnappings, heard her missing a brother
I'm hitting your sister, you kissing your mother
The shit is disguster
Underground with people, lethal, trapped in the desert, surrounded by evil
Yeah, I see your bitch is impressed, my kicks is all fresh
This shit on my chest, by Mitchell and S.
I got her opened, hoping she's not, I'd have her crack in her tits, coke in her twat
Have her crack up the strip, coke up the block
She'd get cracked up and hit, keep soaping your cycle mami
My girls lay up in suites, a half of cake of week, and masturbate like Tweet
Killa, I be popping the oozies, copping them Coogis, eyes on the drop real droopy
Mair is snoopy, look at your hooptie, rocking the rubies
Hop in the hoochie, popping her coochie
Chill while I'm chasing millions
I'm a baller that would merk you like Jason Williams (uh Huh)
Don't play with villas', vacate the building
Or the eights will come and rape your children
Yeah, it's a kilo to a milligram
I'm still the man, word to Killa Cam (Killa Cam)

Yes the boys are back at it
Come holler at us, the boys are back at it
So line em up, shoot em down

Makin' crucial trips through the night (highways)
And Prince Juelz, I told you ever since Juelz
If them faggets even flinch Juelz (bluuuuatttt)
My dogs are gonna it 'em alive
Forty-fours, the pleading, deleting they lives (come on)
And Killa wallys leading the movement, for realla we wouldn't be in this movement
Over him I might kill ya (kill ya)
Be in a tomb, just facing my time
Loyal on side, outside spoiler on rides, system bumping, bumping ?oh boy? in the ride
Oh boy I done slide, shit, he done came got his boy, he's ashamed at his boy
Had to flame at a boy, over the name we employed
Which is none other than Dip Set, for ya'll dumb motherfuckers (holla)

People say my theories is backwards
I tell them, sincerly, it's clearly, you hearing me backwrds
I tell 'em I'm great, but still I need practice
I tell them to wait, go and comeback quick, they don't understand me
It's not logic, I'm not logic, I got problems
I worship the late prophet, the great Muhammad Ali
For the words that he spoke, that stung like a bee
Soaked into me, you niggaz will see but
I'm still insane, I'm Rodman, dealing my brain
I'm grinding sharing my pain, fuck, where is the fame
Niggaz, they still rhyming, still in the game
They still dealing the cane, still cock shit in your brain, homie
I still smell the rotten people that lay
There in ground zero, forgotten, left in for days
Probably left there to stay, left in decay
Broken pieces of towers, left in their graves
I pray they be saved, until then, that's just a suggestion I made
Follow me homie, listen, I subjected my ways nigga
Weapons that spray, at your fucking face nigga
It's Santana the great, in the place niggaz, stay away nigga
Cause I'm headed straight to the top, niggaz

I seen it time, business and friendship
Friendships ended, business attended, clips get extended
Lawyers get called, accountants get faxed
That was my man, well I wish that he meant it
It's been a long time, hereing the mobsters
This ain't overnight, it's years in the process
Shed a tear in the process, now process is over
All my niggaz get prepared for the Oscars
Back to the block, sharing a lobster
Morris Malone, Sam Malone, preparing the vodka, holla
Hallejulah, no hum-do-allah, but respecting my Aki
He held me down, when it was getting real rocky
Hustling, isn't a hobby
I sit in the lobby, look at my ovie, have visions of Gotti
Visions of lotties, pictures of Blood, scenes of L
I want to see my son, piss in that potty
Jimmy, I'm going to make sure your wrist is real rocky
See my plans are for long term like Mr. Miyagi
Wax on, wax off, put our wax on, take that wack off
Over some nights, I had fights over the white
The roads to the lows, I knows what it's like
Now, career over like Mike: anyone

Yes she made the quota, cause I'm like Ray Liotta

Exotic sexy kittens, sippin' hypnotic
Spotted you shakin' it fast, earthquakin' that ass in denim
And from the beginnin' wanted to taste your venom

Tell my niggaz chill but they wanna heat the streets
Or do it on record check it we spit heat to beats

Everybody welcomin' this, welcomin' that
He wasn't welcome in the first place, how we welcome him back?
Gimme that Mack, let me work him wit that
Tell Mr.Rogers I'll leave his brain on the trolley track, now prolly that

Listen, y'all stop it, I know you appalled dot it
But this my call by the false Prophet, all Prophet
Harlem hustle, I can't at all knock it
But you hard when you go in the Lords pocket

What you offerin' put it right in offerin'
They take it all, cash, credit, silver down the porcelain
Look at the Porche he's in and give a portionin'
No handicap, Annie you're orphan friend, friend

Get Cha Kirk Franklin on, word, so get ya Ben Franklin on

Watch it boy they'll show you how that shorty bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

I'm the most incredible, to ever do what you cats'll never do, or be able to
I'm ahead of you, 'cause I spit like I never ate
And if I did then I'm just never full
Stop the hoe jokes, I'm not a homo, better believe I'll cock the 4-4
I ain't Mexican, but I'll stretch your man, yes I am a fuckin' vato loco

I went from the pot with cocoa to the block with cocoa
To gettin' locked, catchin' a charge dealin' wit the cops with cocoa
Now I'm just hot like cocoa
You can catch me on the block, being watched, in a drop
The same color as chocolate cocoa

I don't walked in the street, with so much raw in my sneaks
God dam, got home and had corns on my feet
I see the Lord when I sleep and often He speaks
He says Juelz you better than all of these creeps

So I got all my shit light, got on my shit right
Not a lot of thems this nice, but the games funny so I gotta do shit right
So to the ball drop and the world blow up, I'm a twirl shit up
Until my peeps come home, Zeke come home
Better believe I'm a keep on beastin' on

Where should I began our pompous, a thousand wins accomplished
Known throughout the atlas, honest been accomplished
You'll be abolished, men, women, children astonished
The don is the one, jewelry way beyond it

Chunky blessed on the chest, funky S when I dress
Thunder storm damn, monkey wrenching' her fresh
But I cope wit the rain, mad I can't float with my dame
Down to the coastal wit Caine, Maine, my boat is a plane

I land on the water, here I go boastin' again
I keep toast, give a toast, inhale smoke for the pain
Girls gone wild, nope, they goin' insane
All doped off the fame, jump rope with my chain

Now that's off the chain, ma take off your chain
I'm 40 will off your brain, kids will be lost and claimed
'Cause of Walton James, now in the orphan game
Whether adoption or foster it's all the same

Jim's the rider of riders, J are's the writer of writers
Juelz you know him well, hell he the fire of fire
I'm the supplier, baffled that's the hustler
Trifle got a knife for that apple inside your jugular

The big apple, I tackle all the customers
Put it on the apple at the castle, come and fuck with us
And further more, got the birds of raw, I deserve a tour
Hey, hey holla' back, swallow that, that's murda' whore

In a Persian turban, swervin', that suburban mergein'
Curvin', herb in the air, yeah, yeah I'm hurtin' y'all
See I crash and cop it, mash and mop it, blast a rocket
Natural born hustler, yeah crack I stocked it

Now my drugs are legal, so just pass the profit
Three months alone sizzurp will smash the notic
We them be boys in one year a quarter billion
Here come the clothin' line, I got your order children
And that's more than illin', long as the Lord is willin'
I'm a pour in millions, so applaud a villain, killa

In any way homeboy, you a grown ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchlines
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time

If they find that stash box, just one time?
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the trunk
Side of the road, holding you up, cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine

A Manhattan whore or a Brooklyn whore
A Bronx biatch that'll let me look and explore
Up front but beat around the bush for sure

'Til the tush is sore, hit it doggy style
Get it doggy style, you know your doggy's style

But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me 'cause she ain't like all them other chicks
Let you hit then she split, that's why I got a honey dip

From the club to the telly you know how it is
Most of the chicks I never tell 'em where a nigga live
Tryna reach me at my mansion or my mother crib
Hit my cell, hit my two, now I'm at my honey dips

Yo we talked about 8, said I was comin' through to hit
Now it's wee hours in the mornin' and I'm drunker than a bitch
Stumblin' and shit, I jumped up in the whip
Flipped open the horn like where's my honey dip

And bitch fuck ya man tonite, you know my steelo
Sizzurp wit the Cristal, the corners playin' cello
You see me well you jus smile you know we on the lelow
I'm whippin' through the town like we ballin' up a key load

I'm tryna dip up in the tele
Dip up in the room, then dip up in her belly
Dip off on Pirelli's, Dip-Sets Fonzarelli
My white T-shirt, lookin' dip up in my pelle

Smokin' weed up in the range, full speed left lane
It's me against the world, MOB up in my vein
Wit another nigga girl, gettin' low to give me brain
If the bitch about the 'cause you ain't gotta spit no game

But I'm no dummy, most these bunnies
Are money hungry and lookin' for a money clip
So after the brother hit, I'll tell a honey dip

She won't see a contact, address nor buddy list
I ain't on some hubby shit, that lovey dovey shit
It's nuttin' trick I'm suttin' slick
You couldn't get enough of it

How a slugger jus slide up through the check in
Wit that linin' on the Wesson
Hundred diamonds on my neck and wrist shit
I'm rich bitch, rhyming's my profession

Watch how I do this stupid grindin' and perfectin'
Who's flyer when I step in got 'em spyin' every second
'Cause that 06 charger remind 'em of a 7
Yes man, I'm so fresh the pro mess wit bread honey

My jean's 800, these are called Red Munkey
The flossin' is gone, come talk to a Don
Fly enough to belong on a catwalk in Milan, holla

I got 'em all but my favorite one is my honey dip
She get drunk wit me, roll the piff up wit me
Throw singles at other hoes in the strip club wit me

She do anything for jus one quicky
She a nympho chick for this slow dick
She give no lip, she jus go get
The paper I ask her for, my bitch so quick

Plus she know every Santana song
And she don't mind puttin' the damn bandanna on
Slap her ass tell her dance in this thong
She do it all for daddy, she move it all for daddy

She get a brick and she boof it all for daddy
Hit the road shake the State Troopers off for daddy
And she bring all that paper back
No short paper back, she sure don't play wit that

When I'm dippin' on the grind I get my money quick
But sometimes I wanna lay up wit my honey dip
She be wit me 'cause she ain't like all them other chicks

Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever)

Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
When I speak of diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin' about the ones that be glowin'
I'm talkin' about Roc-a-Fella, my home
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they Jacob? Don't lie to me, man
See, a part of me sayin' ""Keep shining""
How? When I know what a blood diamond is
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connects to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus-piece was so harmless
Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life trying to get that ice
Bought a Polo rugby, it looks so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight

(Diamonds are forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(Forever)

People asking me ""Is I'm gon' give my chain back?""
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog, ""Yo where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back
""What's up with you and Jay, man?
Are y'all okay man?""

Yup, I got it from here 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gonna crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep
I sold kilos of coke, I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man!
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere
Oh yeah, he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money, last 3 lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear saying exactly
What I've been saying practically my whole career
A diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time

And tryin' to help his momma with the fact that her child gone

Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda' gone wrong
Now they askin' Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta' gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin' money mighta' gone to the feds
So I ain't goin' to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin' he was gone with my bread
And with that bein' said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin' back now shoulda' gone to the crib
And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin' me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin' time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

I ran up on 'em, pussy ain't have his hammer on him
Pulled the cannon on 'em, blammed it on 'em, 'til I jammed it on 'em
I got some a-rab's hitting me with coke
And when we on the phone we be speaking in some codes
A camel is an ounce, a kufi is a brick
Tell him I need five kufis, and meet me on the strip
Yeah I know ""stafalla"", but I'm tryna cop some cars
Run up in the club that's popping and cop the bar
And everything I hear is garbage to me
You know where I be fagot, bring the drama to me
I'm presidential nigga, Bush'll pay homage to me
I'm putting in a lot of work man acknowledge a g 
Yes, yes, a g I am, holla if you need some grams
I'm poppin' off by myself I don't need no cam

I don't care if they small or some stocky niggas
I just grace 'em then erase 'em, I forgot these niggas 
What they name again? What they claim again?

Cam'ron,"Bird gang Club Banger
Tryin' to holla at you shorty
One focus, one focus only
Tryin' to hit that thang, let's go

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

It goes yes, yes yo, fresh to death balla
You can play hard, under pressure I'm stoned
We playin' tight D, I'm in the paint like a G
Some say they gangstas but they ain't like me

Came from an environment, came I was firin'
Then hit the dealers see the range I was buyin'
Don't test drive like a whole whip like you should
Shoving up pies, a whole whip that you should

Then take the proceeds, waist about four G's
Bottles in the club tryin' to get the home and skeez
I'm tryin' to get the dame to breeze
But she putting up a fight like Layla Ali

I told the lady I'll be doin' the turnpike 80 in the fly V
Middle name 40 on the wrist
Last name you can't afford me bitch
Get a camcorder bitch

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

Cases of purée, rosé
Look like Picasso painted on the bottles
We throwin' money, we lookin' like lotto's
I could cover chicks with cheese like nachos

Fly out the cove, land in the heat where
New York to Miami bitch
Bitch, I'm in the life of a hood star, rock star without the guitar
Got em' all rubbin' they bitch bra

Got em' all shakin' their tush like
I'ma givin' 'em a taste of the good life
But I give 'em a taste of the good liquor, a taste of the good bud
Next thing you know she'll be tastin' my good

I get money be quiet, you talkin' to the jolly green giant
I see it, I like it, I buy it
Baby I'm flyer then a pilot
Flyin' at his highest, climb it

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly
But at the end of the day, we feelin' to play
I'm tryin' to pin the tail on the donkey

Where are my homies? Up to no good
Where are my homies? Yup I'm so hood
What up pimpin', pimpin', I'm exempt already
See my hoes are like my plates, temporary

Act nil you beat it, move on strategic
The marbles man, yup the floors are heated
Cam half pound a quart a kid better ask 'round
I'm sorta needed mack rounds you're deceited

In the 90's, Z3, BB's
Now in the crib the TVs watch TVs
Killen Killen, mo killen and then a kitty purrs
Fuck furs, his and hers, Bentley spurs

Gun talk, real talk, speak mack to mack
We like the Pistons, Bulls, you know back to back
Mazirattis back to back, come ride wit me
On 11 hundred, not the pipe, two five fifties

We make hits in the studio nightly
We out trying to get this money
We take trips in the winter in jet planes
To climates where it's sunny

We got mami on the dance floor
Grindin' to the beat, tipsy off the bubbly

And you're not from the regime and I'm popular with fiends
No gossip they cop it, crotched up in a lean

Seventy five, dropped it on a Beam

Let's start this shit off with my man 40 Cal

[40 Cal.]
Who am I? 40 Cal. motherfucker
Gat to your back, get down motherfucker
Clown motherfucker
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Let me try to explain
I shoot his truck up just to drive him insane
Give his Rover the new name, the firing range
When we see you yell fire and aim
Cause when I fire them thangs it's like
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
I gotta watch who wit me, watch who pretty
Drop two-fitty on a hot new Bentley
But when it come to drops say he cop too many like, damn
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Down with wonderful Cal. {they make Hummers in brown?}
Nah I just shitted on you, even haters lovin my style
I'm a role model, I make the hustlers proud
I make the customers smile
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Catch me in them thangs with Jennifer, BM's with Olivia
If it ain't Vivica or somebody sim-I-lar
Comin down the block the suspense is killin ya like, wow
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
That's Cal. we see him {we see him} we leavin {we leavin}
He schemin, he be beastin

[Verse 1]
Dial killa for murda once, no redial
Just see child, the O G style and how I used to be wild
This the story of Cam'ron and Zeke Giles one way road to the P now
Yea the whoscal, ohh child you wasn't there
Zeke snitched, if he did, I'd be doin a hundred years
Did the interstate, big cities, tiny ones
Took over niggaz towns, black ties, tiny bums
Handsome hoods, pretty thugs, but we grimy dun
Cars, cribs, money, had to find me some
Zeke right behind me dun dun, he play by all the rules
That's why the house is his, the cars, all the jewels
Ya'll niggaz all are fools, your regular married with children
Dawg, nine to five, office, pool
Couldn't live that life, I needa loft and pool
I had too much class, I ain't report to school
If they report to school, I caught the stool, extort the fool
Took off his jewels, thought he cool, gun to mouth, they often drool
Fuckin wit this wolf, this should be taught to you
Ya money don't matter, what you can't afford to do
Is fuck wit me dawg, that could be affordable
Hide ya mom, police protection, that's when I'm cordial
Cars convertible, TV's are portable
Fiends on line, coke lines, they come and snort a few
Killa!

[Chorus]
(KILLA!)
Guns, cars, bitches, and (KILLA!)
Weed, smoke, dope (KILLA!)
Glocks, ox ockin I'm cocked (KILLA!)
Cam, fam, damn, it's (KILLA!)
Season and the reason you breathin (KILLA!)
Who buy out the bar though? (KILLA!)
Who far from a star but they car is Gallardo? (KILLA!)

[Verse 2]
I was forced to eat, anything you lost I keep
Shot the fifth, and then like a Piston, toss the Heat (Bye)
Now round the corner, up the block, cross the street
Up fifty flights, iight where the bosses meet
And the Porsche is peach, felt like Boston George
Left Boston Market, did deals on Boston Beach
Now I bought the beach, all because they applaud my speech
One nigga crossed the chief I know you heard he lost his teeth, and it's
Killa!

That's the hustle, I'm old school you must page 'em'

Homie we made bodies drop (let 'em' know) skate like Tony Hawk (this skatin')
Over short paper, player old for very long (it's the principle)

Ayo, I never claimed to be hard, tough, no homo, gangsta none of the above
Just a kid from 145th and Lennox Ave
Harlem, USA trying to make his way in the world ya heard?
Ya know through the trial of tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
Ya know you can't expect everything from everybody
So get up get out and get somethin, that's what I did

[Verse 1 - Cam'Ron]

Before I had the hammer cocked
A Santana rock
Little Gerv, Grandpa Jerry, Grandma Doc (thats my fam)
Uncle Carl, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill,
Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill now
My Aunt Normy, I don't speak to my Aunt Deita
Or my Cousin Bashiba, love my Mother Fredricka
Neighbour Freida, daughter Raven and Nika
Down another doorbell was that nigga Warden Nell
He gave birth to the best emcee you never heard
Lever after lever and was clever with whatever word
Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C
He did damage, road managed my G.O.D
Aka Duke Da God, he was stupid hard
16, the bitch dream had stupid cars
Cut the ' 68, hooptie ' 75
Still drives some bullshit, I don't know why
I loved the nigga though, for him put cris in the air
First one that diss him in here, I swear I'll risk my career
That's a fact they ain't talking no rap shit
I'm talking that mack clip, niggas will backflip, act sick
My dude study the sabbath
No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish
He could have my house, he could keep my mauries
He could drive my cars, this a eastside story

(Thats why my dudes love me I let them do them.
You either gonna be rich or famous fuckin wit me, probably both.
If you happen to brush shoulders wit me by accident,
Play lotto, nine out of ten times you gonna win nigga.)

To play the game, sure to win

I sacrificed, I rolled the dice
I love the hood, I love my life

[Verse 2 - Cam'Ron]

See a boss I prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation I ain't scared of you I'm scared of me
I got a gun, you don't so it flares you'll see
After that a 5,000 volt chair for me
So I move carefully, niggas don't care for me
Who care I don't, you share I won't
Calm down (uhuh) breathe again
I don't do extortion unless I wanna receive an end
Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak (what she say)
That's word to me, told me I deserve to eat (what happened)
Moved to a killa ave, right from a murder street (what you did)
Rocked adida forms even though they hurt my feet (thats fucked up)
I don't look in the sky, never mind stars
You also find stars, right behind bars
Snazz, Black, Do' on house arrest
Zeke, shiek, won't even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass right alongside zeke
Turn myself in, nope play hide and go seek
I'm gone, put the clip in the chrome
Yeah I'm just like a fly, see the shit that I'm on
And, hour after hour I would chill at the afterhours
Where they flash the power, no bath or shower
In that same spot, realize math is power
So I pointed the mansion, that is ours

But don't get it twisted the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing Geronimo
Pull up in the C-L the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit I don't know
Like that Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no

From below you tumble get merked on the humble
And the gat on the belt on the hip
And I keep a Pharrell with the Clipse
Drive a hard bargain (bargain), I'm Harlem's only Gagarin

The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars stepping on blow doing the toe-tap
The dope return like I had it on Lo-Jack
It made its way home like a road map I fathered this
If I mislead any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like Saturday Night Fever
I kept in the crib it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper.
Way deeper than rap money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late all I can tell 'em is repent unh! (Mami you miss me don't you?)

Camargo & Luciano,"No meio da conversa, de um caso terminando
Um fala e o outro escuta e os olhos vão chorando
A lógica de tudo é o desamor que chega
Depois que um descobre que o outro não se entrega
Quem vai sair arruma as coisas põe na mala
Enquanto o outro fuma um cigarro na sala
E o coração palhaço começa a bater forte
Quem fica não deseja que o outro tenha sorte

E longe um do outro, a vida é toda errada
O homem não se importa com a roupa amarrotada
E a mulher em crise, quantas vezes chora
A dor de ter perdido um grande amor que foi embora

Mas quando vem a volta, o homem se arruma
Faz barba, lava o carro, se banha, se perfuma
E liga pro amigo que tanto lhe deu força
E jura nunca mais vai perder essa moça
E a mulher se abraça à mãe, diz obrigado
E põe aquela roupa que agrada o seu amado
E passa a tarde toda cuidando da beleza
Jantar à luz de velas e amor de sobremesa

E perto um do outro, a vida é diferente

Make sure the families in place and let the music unwind
I got men to take charge like major outlet
Ride around the country chillin' in my LA Express
On every street corner
The importance of having fun
If he bottle spill tobacco don't nobody carry guns
We keep our minds on fun and let the drums do the bangin'
On any given day like Mr. Cooper yo we hangin'
Under the blue sky the state laced the small
Belucchi quarter inched cables with all the sound that we brawl
Can't get enough so brother pass another cold one
Feel like a dad at a ball game mappin' with his son
Chuck D yo word up we buggin' over time
From the light to the lime original star time
It's the double crisis one
It camel brought the ammo so we can shoot
Game like thugs on your sport channel
Take off the do-rag replace it with a thinkin cap
If you didn't know tell the bro he should have known that
We here for one thing and that's to remain
What's the name...name...name...nigga

Yo L.A. hit me one time make it funky
Double down on my underground sound I'm feelin' lucky
For this jackpot I jacks pot to feelin' my crips
We lay back chillin' and feelin' the music relates
We on the to the two hangin' with my crew
Bullshittin' while we sittin' down drinkin' our Sabu
And to the afternoon turns to the moonlight
Funky tracks and nickle sacks freestylin' all night
Doin' it right no one with time music make it better
My crew banging two blocks like shots from my Berretta
Snub no's to the hoes who pose I suppose
Honey you gotta understand your mans got flows
And I'm leavin' you so by the time I get the phoenix
Underground ground hits are goin' to fiend this musical genius
Transglobal by the books
Like Barnes with noble hooks
Armed with overlooked talented guests of while bless crooks
Who still lose and keep this shit alive
Something for your truths to sit around and bye bye
For camel double invest to ease stress
We bout to hip hop so have fun and god bless

Tell me what you want boo, now it`s gettin' pretty confusing
Go on cry for all I care, ain't ish I'm losin'
I thought your friends warned you this bound to happen
And now they laughin' cause back then you was no rap fan
Until you read about me in the paper and the mags
And daily on the radio until you got the wax
Some mere infatuation, until you got to check me out in person
First sight of me causing exhilaration
You love the way I do my cap and how I move the crowd
The funny way I hold the mic it kind make you smile
So that the kid that got mo chickss than Kentucky ay
You tried your luck hoppin' it's one of your yer lucky days
Snuck to the backstage I said relax ay
No need to panic I'll sign anything you ask me babe
Flashed your thighs wouldn't settle for less
And left my crib the same night with autographs on your chest,for real

If you want to party baby know that I will be there by your side
Treat me like a lady I'll be yours tonight the felling's all so right
Leave your boo behind while you and I together we'll rock this fantasy
Baby tell me what you want from me

Forget the fool the situation lookin' pretty shady
Now chillin it daisy keep it proper

And when it comes to lovin' yo you know I ain't rookie
I love your style and profile, the way you dancin'
Now skoo the puppy love it's time real romancin'
I'll make breakfast in bed, I'll lift the toilet seat
Your man harassin' you, his gass and plus he gettin' beat up
Actin' all hostile, you don't need that love child
Press the speed dial, and holler at me on the mobile
And come to my crib and make it happen
Ain't no confusion, just chillli and relaxin'
My love ain't temporary, the type of story
We gon' be tellin' our children hen we forty...

I never thought of all the drama that it might bring

And kneelin' you beggin' for rendezvous ang stuff

Pas d’orage, pas de vent
Des couleurs trop souvent
Ordinaires
Mais dans mon cœur, avant
Y avait pas tes yeux clairs
Et j’ai peur
Parce que maintenant
Dans mon cœur, rien à faire
Le temps pleure

Mon amoureux, je pars, je pars
Le train s’en va déjà
Je cours, je cours, j’veux pas pleurer d’vant toi

Les portes se ferment
Mais tes ""je t’aime""
Résonnent encore",Je Pars,
Camélia Jordana,"Mon amour, tu me manques,
Ça fait un bout de temps que tu te planques.
Que j´ai pas vu à l´horizon se pointer ton minois mignon.
Mon amour, tu me manques,
J´ai même oublié ton nom.
Ton souvenir est une calanque,
Tout mon corps un chiffon.
Et quand l´amour ça manque,
Ça sert à rien de danser.
Sous la pluie, y´a moi qui me flanque
Au cœur de sacrés coups de fouets.
Je t´attend Nike aux pieds, commence à perdre la tête.
Et rien que pour un baiser je t´attendrai en chaussettes,
Mon amour, tu me manques,
Ce que sans toi c´est laid Paris.
Avec le journal d´Anne Franck j´irais peut-être à Saint-Denis
Pour être ta Lara Croft,
Toi mon beau, mon fort, mon shaft.
J´enfermerais dans un loft mon cœur en papier craft,
Je ferais ma vie en sitcom,
Comme un peu sur la croisette.
Arobase bonheur point com, même si le carton pâte ça pète
Pour qu´enfin tu me remarques,
Moi, la fille un peu bidon.
A vos marques, je débarque dans la ville de Cupidon,
Mon amour, tu me manques,
Ici, on est enfermés.
On doit danser le french canc´ pour pas être éliminés,
Mon amour, tu me manques,
J´ai comme l´envie de chialer.
Regarde moi en saltimbanque, en putain de la télé;
Ici, pas une planque pour s´asseoir et pour pleurer.
En travelling, au zapping,
Je serais pas belle à regarder,
Et puis toi, mon amour, tu viendras pas me chercher.
Avec ce rimel tout autour qu´en finit plus de dégueuler.
Mon amour, tu me manques,
Ça y est, le public a voté,
Une croix au stylo à encre juste au coin de la télé.
Mon amour, tu me manques, et sur le carton y´a marqué
Mademoiselle, vous êtes vivante, bravo.
Mais vous êtes virée.
Alors moi pour toujours peut-être que je vais en terminer,
Me faire un nœud de secours vu que les fenêtres sont condamnées,
Et puis toi, mon amour, t´as bien d´autres chats à fouetter.
Que de me jouer les feux de l´amour,
Moi qui suis bonne qu´à zapper",Lettera,

Habituées des tops tranquilles

À peau naît la peau
Concurrence demain partout
Surtout n'en fait pas trop
Prière différente de celle de demain

Tamponnée par de formes robotiques
Uniforme restant là, stoïque

I like the way she talks
She turns me on with a special concern

She's my rolling stones and my Ava Perone

I like it
The way she wears her hair
And I like it
Oh oh

And when you come to meet her, you'll never greet her, she'll be waving her skirt as a flag,
Like the cold in October she'll take you right over,
It's not mean to be facetious
And that look in her eye says your the guy she plans to spend this evening with

I'm here to make some waves
Hoping to convince you
Before you have a thing to say

Be it a car or expensive caviar
They go to your creditors
'Cause they know who you are

Don't leave your home
Without American Express
Never trust your friends
Without a very thorough credit check

Some people will pay you
With one eye on the clock
Others will have to pay
Through that friendly neighborhood loan shark

Fast, fierce and funny
The way people can play with your money

Now I tried to romance you
And I tried real hard
Everything was going good
Until they took my credit card

Now I'm not a flaky kind of guy you see
I've got plenty of money
But unfortunately not with me

Now you're my kind of girl
And you like nice things
I can tell by the clothes you wear
And the size of the diamond on your ring

As long as there's cash around
There's always hope
But once you see what your cash is worth
You'll deep six over and croak

Fast, fierce and funny
The way people can play with your money

Baby, check it out, there's no doubt
Use your head, save your bread
Baby, check it out
Baby, check it out

The Dow Jones average today hit an all time low
And sent the stock market crashing
Thousands panic in the effort to hold on to their assets
Washington has made an official statement
And we are about to take it live to Washington

Make that money, try to stay ahead
Make that money till ya drop dead
Make that money, now you're on your own
Now that bank won't give you a loan

Work your fingers to the bone
Makin' that money, gotta bring it home
Got no cash, gotta write a check
If they haven't closed my bank account yet

Got to realize that you're acting like fools

I'm thinking of you and your new lover
Playing it cool, even though you tore my heart apart
I start my day just like any other day
And when the phone rings on the other end you say
Now I realize that I made the wrong move
To take you back in my life girl I can't see it coming through

How we feel is not the issue girl

Let's talk about loneliness
You know sometimes it can fool you 
into believing you're on top of the world
No one can top you or stop you
And everything you've always wanted
Is right at your fingertips

But, as always
Reality steps in and shocks you
Right back into the present
And all you can do is ask yourself over and over
Why?

What happened to the love that brought us both 
so much joy and happiness?
Oh hey, I know things change
People change
But this hurts
I mean it really hurts

I guess it all boils down to the fact
That we never really knew each other anyway, huh?
Yeah, I know
Say, wait a minute, let me tell exactly how I feel, ok?

SINGING:

Today I'm just a lonely man
But tommorow I'll be a king
Blessing all my subjects
Cast afar in security

The whole wide world will watch me
As I walk up to my throne
Knights in shining armor
Stand around to heed my call

But wait a minute
I'm still lonely (I'm still lonely, I'm still lonely mmmmmm)
I guess anyone can dream
But when you lose someone it seems
So unimportant

Although every person changes
Different times and different ways
But never all the same

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Our love goes

Take your chances if you will, those looks can kill
It'll make you go round and around, you got to know it by now
That the truth is you just can't win, loves funny like that
It'll make you blow your cap, sacrifice everything and money

Love has no guarantee's and always will it be

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth

Take stabs dip and dab, forever tryin' to find your way
It's a sellers lament for all the love you spent
You must have thought it was a bottomless pit
You can't do it like that, love will show you where it's at

What you put up you'll surely get back
'Cause there's no other way, if you play you'll pay

Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth
Back & forth, back & forth, back & forth, back & forth

Gotta be wrong to get it right 'round here

You need to watch your back
You need to creep around
You need to slide real smooth
Don't make a sound
And if you want it, take it

Then ask yourself how long you think I'll remain patient
I'll throw him overboard and let him swim with killer sharks

Now, let's all just be smart
Although for you that must be hard
You'll get your wand

It's a do-or-die situation
If you don't give me back the king
I'll have no hesitation
I'll serve you right here
And I don't need a reservation
That way your whole pirate crew can have a demonstration
Release him now, and we can go our separate ways
Unless you wanna deal with me and the VKs

So that's your big speech, huh?
An empty ultimatum?

All it takes is one swing and I'll humiliate him
Matter of fact, make one wrong move and I'll debilitate him
And if he even starts to slip, I'll eliminate him
