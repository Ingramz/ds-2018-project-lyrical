Renaissance,"I thought it was over
I thought I was free of you
Then came deja vu 
I thought there's no problem
I saw you had feet of clay
That was yesterday
I find I'm running going nowhere
I find I'm searching every crowd I pass through
Looking for you

[Chorus:]
Deja vu can really haunt you
Follow and confuse you
Secrets coming back to taunt you
Find you and then lose you
Memories are all you walk through
Yester- deja vu
I thought I was OK
I thought I was in control
I was not involved
I thought there's no hassle
Then I heard our special song
Everything went wrong
I see you standing in the doorway
I walk towards you and I find just shadow
Where did you go?

[Chorus:]

I remember all the things we used to do together
In the past
Nothing ever seems to last
I wonder if there was some ... something neglected ...
Something left unsaid, hasty words instead
Anything that could go wrong
It seems nothing was ever right
I'm haunted by lost chances past
I call to you in dreams at night
I'm fettered by our yesterday
Tomorrow is a bird in flight
I run to turn another page
And there you are within but out of sight
Our love, a bird in flight

[Repeat chorus two times]",Deja Vu,1995
Renaissance,"I was secure in my mind
Nothing would sway my way
I closed my eyes your designs
Left me unmoved to doubt you
Don't talk to me of love songs
Melodies stray colour my day

Don't talk about ways - that we once loved, and once lived
Don't talk about days we were together
Don't think, I'll break down - your fingers soft on my skin
Don't talk about love - 'cause I won't let you in

I was so sure on my own
No-one could change my day
I could be happy alone
That's where I lived without you
You talk to me of love songs

Melodies weave making believe
Don't talk about ways we once laughed and made love
Don't talk about us, I've no defenses
You know I'll break down, your fingers soft on my skin
Don't talk about love - 'cause I just might let you in

Talk don't talk - talk
Talk don't talk - talk
Talk don't talk - talk
Talk don't talk - talk

Don't talk about ways - that we once loved, and once lived
Don't talk about days we were together
Don't think I'll break down - your fingers soft on my skin
Don't talk about love - 'cause I won't let you in

Don't talk about ways we once laughed and made love
Don't talk about us, I've no defenses
You know I'll break down - your fingers soft on my skin
Don't talk about love - 'cause I just might let you in

Don't talk about ways we that once loved and made thin ... together
Don't think I'll break down - your fingers soft on my skin
Don't talk about love - 'cause I just might let you in

Don't talk about ways we once laughed and made love

Don't talk about love - 'cause I just might let you in

Renaissance,"Some people knocking at the door your tell them come on in
Still they hesitate and they don't se the way to go
Some people don't see what they're worth you tell them everything
Still they stand and wait don't seem to know the things they know
They're on the outside looking in
You tell them come on in
You give them everything
Lock in on love locked in on loving you
It's so simple and so true
Lock in on love you'll find out what to do
And your love will see you through
Some people sitting on the fence you tell them come right down
Still they seem to wait they seem afraid to let it be
Some people don't know what to do they haven't looked around
So they hold on tight they miss the things there are to see
They're on the fence they're looking down
You show them where they're bound
You tell them come around
Lock in on love your love will make you free
You'll be all that you can be
Lock in on love 'cause love is good for you
You will see what you can do 
They're on the outside looking in
You tell them come on in
You give them everything
Lock in on love lock in on looking out
And you'll see what loves' about
Lock in on love you'll find your love can heal
And you'll know how much you feel

Lock in on love you'll find out what to do
And your love will see you through",Lock in on Love,1995
Renaissance,"I thought love so gentle so pure
I knew love so sweet and so secure
Turning with an open heart
With a touch we would never be apart
Flames of love now ash just drifts away
Here I am I'm lost and love's astray
I can never love again
For love lied and it died in the end
If I knew then what I know now
If I had known it all somehow
Always believing
Love deceiving
I could have held my shattered dream
Seen all the things I should have seen
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die
So much love now gone just slipped away
So much pain to see that love betrays
I will never love again
For love lies and it will die in the end
I thought I saw love in his eyes
But now I know that love just lies
Leaving me hollow
Nothing to follow
So I will never give me heart
And I will always stand apart
Now I know love lies
Now I know love is bound to die
And love was nothing but a need
Devoured by an empty greed
The ashes fill my empty heart
I will always stand apart
This from love's beguiling mask
The kiss the questions never asked
And now I know that love just lies
I know love is bound to die
Love lies love dies
Love lies love dies
Love lies love dies
Love lies love dies

Renaissance,"Love - may you be blessed
Live in the warmth of your caress
And, as you go on
May you be, never less than you can be
Love - may you hold strong
Stay, all the way where you belong
Then, as time goes by
May you be, the sweet song, you sing today
Love - may you be blessed
Every day
Every way ...

Renaissance,"The other woman
The other woman
I turn away, know you're lying
Hear you call her name, find myself crying
It's so absurd, I tell myself
He hasn't changed
Always wants somebody else, another game
Always thinking of himself
Another day andother year another name
Chorus:
I'll be how the other woman is
I'll be just who I am
I'm composing, my goodbye love
Find myself, and losing no more time
Be how I know I can
I'm supposing, you know why love
They flatter you, you send flowers
Say you'll be right home, they you're gone, hours
It's so absurd, the same old song
Why should he change?
So secure, cause he has me to fall back on
Who's to blame the other woman
No he'll stay the same until he finds me gone
Chorus
Will you send roses?
I have to say it feels so strange
So out of place
Insecure I see the flowers rearranged
How I changed, the other woman
And I'll stay the same, continue to be strong
Chorus
So absurd I have to say
Your roses came today
(You) sing the same old song
You only want me now because I've gone
Yes I've gone
I've gone
I've gone
I've gone
I've gone
",The Other Woman,1995
Renaissance,"Once I saw you leather and lace
Andy Warhol fixing some face
Your rock 'n' roll dreams
Were slowly going nowhere it seemed

Chasing rainbows, vagabond kings
Always want impossible things
You make up some time
I find out constantly on my mind

Chorus:

Quicksilver streams of light, shine in the darkest night
You leave my doubt in shadows, you cast a spell I can't help believing
Standing beside me, I feel you breathing near
But now you're far ahead, are you leaving
Will you still find me here?


You're still constant, future and past
Quick as silver every move fast
You're everything still
You move amongh moments at will

You hold such love, fragments of time
Lonely dreams so share them with mine
You're making me spin
I turn and find quicksilver within

Chorus

Reach out, touch me, let it be me
In your heart and your mind
And in all space and time
Reach out, touch me
And I'll set you free

Renaissance,"We were enchanged love would last for always
Taken for granted, them came the changes, unforeseen

I'm so in love with you who seem so blase
The problem now is, do you still want to stay with me?

You so blase, unconcerned, you're indifferent
You turn, inattentive in company
Should I ask you, don't leave me?

We were enchanted wrapped up in our one dream
Taken for granted, in crept the silence unforeseen

You seem OK though I burn stony silence
You turn, disinclined impassively
Can I keep you near to me?

Surely he can't really be so blase
Surely we will laugh another day
Surely we can hold it all together
Surely we will find another way

You seem OK though I burn stony silence
You turn, disinclined impassively
Can I keep you near to me?

Surely he can't really be so blase
Surely we will find another way
Surely we can hold it all together
Surely we will find another way
Surely he can't use my love forever
Surely he can love me like before
Surely we can hold it all together
Was it just illusion that we saw
Surely he can't really be so blase
Surely we will find another way
Surely we can hold it all together
Surely we will find another way",So Blasé,1995
Renaissance,"I know it's hard to get it out
Pick up the phone and put it down
You drink some wine and think about it
It's even hard to call a friend
You write a note that you won't send
With every thought you seem to doubt it
Feel all your hope is blown to dust and sorrow
You have no way to follow 
Chorus:
Throw it all away
Take another day
Everything is okay
Now it's out of sight
Hold on in the night
Everything is alright
Somewhere west of here
I wish you trusted me sometimes
Thoughts are going round and round
There is a way and you will find it
If I can help just call my name
I'll try to be there ease your pain
If there's a mountain we can climb it
Feel all your words are sounding hollow
You cannot find tomorrow
Chorus
You'll find peace somewhere west of here
When your hopes are grey like dust
You feel so helpless
When your dreams drift by like cloud
You see to feel less
This wilderness will lead you west",Somewhere West of Here,1995
Renaissance,"Travel the days of freedom
Roads leading everywhere
Come with me now
And show how you care

Follow the dying embers
Cross on the paths they lay
Breath of the past
The earth's yesterday

Clear your mind, maybe you will find
That the past is still turning
Circles sway, echo yesterday
Ashes burning, ashes burning

Colors are fading starlight
Silver the way to find
Walking the shadows
There in our mind

Changing the order slowly
Leaving the mist of time
Fingers are holding
Fragments of mine

Clear your mind, maybe you will find
That the past is still turning
Circles sway, echo yesterday
Ashes burning, ashes burning

Imagine the burning embers
They glow below and above
Your sins you won't remember
And all you'll find there is love

Ashes are burning brightly
The smoke can be seen from afar
So now you're seeing how far
Ashes are burning the way
Ashes are burning the way",Ashes Are Burning [Live],1997
Renaissance,"Morning people take the news
A paper window on a world
They live on undisturbed
Thoughts may fly like lonely birds
And lost behind the silent words
Voices are unheard

Put it down to city life
Oh, if I understood
Passing by so easily
I'd reach you if I could

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Fly like a song, fly while you're singing
A song without you is a bird without winging
Some city flights leave in the morning
Some city nights end without warning

Can you hear me call?

Evening people see the day
A silhouette on every face
A shadow on their eyes
Take my place within the crowd
We walk the dusty streets around
Encompassing our lives

Put it down to city times
Oh, if I understood
Passing by so casually
I'd reach you if I could

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Fly like a song, fly while you're singing
A song without you is a bird without winging
Some city flights leave in the morning
Some city nights end without warning

Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me call?

Calling to the sky
The thunder drowns my voice within the rain
And I know you're near me
And I call throughout the storm
I know that you don't hear me

I call your name
I call your name
I call your name

Can you hear me call your name?
Can you hear me call
Hear me call your name?

I call your name
I call your name
Can you hear me call your name?

Night time people find it hard
To hear themselves above the noise
The music holds its own
I recognized a place I'd known
I turned to find it carved in stone
A mirrored smile alone

Put it down to city nights
Oh, if I understood
Passing by so far from me
I'd reach you if I could

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

Fly like a song, fly while you're singing
A song without you is a bird without winging
Some city flights leave in the morning
Some city nights end without warning

Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me call?

You, winter and spring
Deepest emotion everything
You fill my empty life
Take my hand, hold me close
The storm is long, you
You, dreaming of me
One voice together
Eyes that see
You, crying in the night
Took my love, kept me warm
Till daybreak came, you
How my heart needs you
You, you

[Part 2] 
I walk in twilight
A tightrope stretches out in front of me
A skyline, a strange distortion of everything I see
You took my hand and left me reeling
If I talk to myself, I'm talking to you
You hold me in the balance of your love that's true
It's you
It's you
I need only you
You should have kept me
Words cannot express the way I feel
The void around me
An empty space that only you can fill
You took my mind and gave me healing
If I talk to myself I'm thinking of you
From the corners of their eyes, they're watching me too
It's you
It's you
I need only you
I feel it won't be long
Until you realize you were wrong
You will feel the need for me

From where we used to be together, loving
I wake to find us gone
From where we used to be together, laughing

A part of me I left with you
Reflects in all I do, I'm crying
Crying, over you

To lose you far away

I stay inside your heaven now

Renaissance,"There must have been a time when you weren't on my mind
The days before I knew your face
There must have been a night when I would miss your light
Beside me in that lonely space

There's no beginning and no end
The colours and the faces blend
Rain and the sunshine send, no beginning and no end
People and places blend, no beginning and no end

There must have been a day before you came my way
I saw the space you were to fill
I just can't find the change, the things love rearranged
I love you now, I always will

There's no beginning and no end
The music and the pictures blend
Echoes and voices said, no beginning and no end
Good and the sad times led, no beginning and no end

And as the sun will rise
And so the sun will set again
So we will turn and then
There's no beginning and no end

There's no beginning and no end
The colours and the faces blend

Rain and the sunshine send, no beginning and no end
People and places blend, no beginning and no end
Echoes and voices said, no beginning and no end
Good and the sad times led, no beginning and no end

No beginning, no end ...

I hold your photograph
It's simple black and white
You wear that smile that won my heart

The time we had was short
You had somewhere else to go
The drafty waiting room
The train pulls in, you go

[Chorus]
You ask me if it hurts when I think of you
It's only when I laugh
Time heals now I am cried out
A brief encounter deep in France
A table set for two
Hands held, I melt into you

I wrote some letters to old friends
The good old days
I didn't know you then
To mention you to them would be absurd
But then you mean so much

Ice that's on my window panes
Slowly starts to thaw
The image of my tears reflects on you
That's all

[Chorus]

My days will pass as years
Till you return to me

The reason that it hurts when I think of you
It's only when I laugh
Time heals and now I am cried out
A brief encounter deep in France
A table set for two
Hands held, I melt into you

Renaissance,"The first time ever she saw him,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
He passed on worried and warning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night,
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through.
The trees that whisper in the evening,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun,
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Four a.m. in the morning,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
I watched your vision forming,
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Stars roll slowly in a silvery night,
Far away on the other side.
Will you come to terms with me this night,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven far away.
I stay, I pray
See you in heaven one day.
Far away on the other side.
Caught in the middle of a hundred and five.
The night was heavy and the air was alive,
But she couldn't find how to push through.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.

Distant horizon
Melts in the sun
Turn and turn away
Feel the end of day
Hear the saddest call
The stars appear
I wonder how I'll be next year
The tide will bring anew
I hope there'll still be you
The moon in its sadness
Loose in the night
Glowing from above
Welcome joy and love
How can it be
That sun don't see
A simple truth
It seems to me
Clouds obscure the view
Sea awaits the view

I saw a sharp cat
With a 300 dollar suit on
And a 100 dollar hat

By a DynaFlow
When a voice within said,
""C'mon daddy, let's go.""

Une traversée de la Manche
Je compte les moutons qui s'y baignent
Me cogne au ding dong de Big Ben

Je passe encore une nuit blanche
Une heure sur le dos deux sur la tranche
J'essaie un rêve puis le rature
Passe par toutes les températures

Mes yeux ouverts cartographient
Grâce au diodes de la chaîne hi-fi
La moindre trace sur le mur
Que laissent les défauts de peinture

Et j'ai déjà pu répertorier
Une libellule deux fox-terriers
Un truc qui ressemble à la France
Il manque juste un bout de Provence

Et toi tu dors, conquistador
Dans ton Amérique, on s'endort si vite
J'aim'rais t'greffer les bras d'Morphée
Pour m'y blottir et enfin dormir

Je passe encore une nuit blanche
Et toi dans ta bulle tu scies des branches
C'n'est plus une bande dessinée
Mais c'est une forêt qu't'as décimée

J'ai tout fait pour percer ta bulle
Une quinte de toux que je simule
Mais pour t'empêcher de me fausser
Compagnie je peux me brosser

Et demain tu me feras l'affront
La marque d'oreiller sur le front
Tu diras, culot inouï
""J'n'ai pas fermé l'oeil de la nuit !""

A l'heure de mettre pied à terre
J'aurai sous les yeux deux cratères
Il faut croire que mon sommeil
Est en ch'ville avec le soleil

C'est étrange comme ils poussent mieux
Qu'ai-je bien pu donc enterrer là ?

Sur ma poitrine une lumière rouge

Renan Luce,"Tu m’demandes ce que j’veux vraiment 
Question vague, mais comme j’ai du temps 
Essayons d’faire l’inventaire 
Une liste rudimentaire 
Je lance comme ça c’qui me vient 
En essayant d’oublier rien 
J’aimerais un jour danser le tango 
Traverser l’atlantique sur un cargo 
Et le Nil sur une felouque 
Et les modes sans changer d’look 
Et la vie sans trop d’encombres 
Avant que la mort n’jette son ombre 
Elle viendra bien trop tôt m’agripper 
Damoclès, range-moi donc cette épée 
Tu vas t’blesser ou perdre un doigt
J’ai même pas de sparadrap 
Range ta lame dans son fourreau 
C’est pas c’qui manque les bourreaux 
J’aimerais constater depuis la lune 
Que la terre est bleue comme un agrume 
Faire une vraie baston d’saloon 
Un piano dans une backroom 
Viens un peu ici pour voir 
Et finir dans un abreuvoir 
J’aimerais bien connaître une garde-à-vue 
Désolé pour ceux qu’en ont connu 
Et puis tiens, tant qu’on y est 
Tourner une planche à billet 

Me payer une vie heureuse 
Pour retarder la faucheuse 
Qui viendra bien trop tôt m’agripper 
Damoclès, range-moi donc cette épée 
Tu vas t’blesser ou perdre un doigt
Si tu pleures, compte pas sur moi 
C’est pas c’qui manque les ennuis 
Range ta lame dans son étui 
J’aimerais être en tenant une clé de douze 
Celui qui est bon pour qu’on l’épouse 
Qu’un bonhomme sous mon crayon 
Soit plus qu’un cercle et cinq bâtons 
Selon la longueur des ch’veux 
Ça devient une femme si je veux 
J’aimerais bien surtout te rendre heureuse 
Et crois-moi, j’essaye, j’y pense, je creuse 
J’veux surtout rien oublier 
Chaque grain d’sable du sablier 
Tant qu’près de toi ils s’écoulent 
Avant qu’la camarde ne déboule 
Elle viendra bien trop tôt m’agripper 
Damoclès, range-moi donc cette épée 
Tu vas t’blesser ou perdre une main 
Si tu veux, reviens demain 
C’est pas c’qui manque les platanes 
Pour l’instant, range ta lame",Damoclès,2014
Renan Luce,"A ma porte j'entends qu'on frappait 
Trois coups timides 
Un homme que la vieillesse drapait
De jolies rides 
Comme on se retrouve face à face 
Je sens qu'il cherche 
Un truc à dire 
Mais un ange passe 
J'lui tends une perche 
""Vendriez vous quelque chose? 
Calendrier, chat qui pose 
Pour votre auspice, une tombola 
Mais il me glisse ""J'habitais là!"" 

Je n'ai pas su quoi lui répondre 
A part entrez 
Le temps que coule un café sombre 
Vous m'raconterez 
Ça a du changer j'imagine 
J'le sens paumé 
Américaine est la cuisine 
Cloisons gommées 
Il m'dit ""je cherche je sais même pas quoi"" 
Souvenirs de flèches et de carquois 
Mes soldats de plomb peuvent plus se battre 
Dans votre maison en placo-platre 

Mais quoi j'allais pas lui remonter des cloisons 
A l'entendre j'avais pillé sa maison
Mais la porte des souvenirs reste toujours entrebâillée 

Alors j'ai pris un bout de craie 
Et sur le sol 
J'ai dessiné quelques grands traits 
Pour qu'il recolle 
Ses souvenirs qui foutaient le camp 
Ensevelis 
Là bas le piano de maman 
Ici mon lit 
Cette nuit là le plancher craque 
Mon grand frère dort pas 
Remplit un sac 
Il me chuchote ""faut qu'tu t'rendormes"" 
Je vois qu'il porte un uniforme 

Je n'ai pas su quoi lui répondre 
Mais j'ai compris 
Ce qu'il y avait dans la pénombre 
Et qu'on lui a pris 
Une enfance qui s'évapore 
Et r'viendra pas 
Il murmura une fois encore 
""J'habitais là""",J’Habitais Là,2014

Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to Thee be all glory given;
Word of the Father,
Now in flesh appearing!

O come, all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem!
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels!
O come let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him,
O come let us adore Him,

Renata Zeiguer,"I slipped up, felt the echo of a memory
rise up and disappear from me
Fill my cup, now that I've had two or three,
I can get a little free
It feels good, to celebrate the loss of my independence
I’m in the mood, to let the rhythm push me out of my head

(You're the one)

I’m lit up, dancing in my room alone
I lock my door and turn off my phone
Fill my cup, now that I've had three or four,
I could use a couple more
It feels good, to tune out from the wrongs
of the world around me I’m in the mood,
to let the warm embrace of my cup surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

I’m fucked up, but I think I could have some more if
I could get myself off the floor
Spilled my cup, the room is tipping to and fro,
my mind is moving kinda slow
I know I should, break out of these walls
I have built around me
If only I could, face up to the world
let the truth surround me

(You're the one)

I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em
I forget my problems, you can wake me when you solve ‘em

Renate Knaup-Kroetenschwanz,"When the everywhere-eye
Asks you
Who is the emperor
Of the sky
Take the Archangel's Thunderbird

Go to Edgar Allen
In the tower of sleep
He'll tell you a story
Which makes you to creep
The echo of your cries
Is falling so deep

Rent a destroyer
And sail to Cape Cod
There lives a lion
They call him God
There is no elevator to Eden
But a hole in the sky

In shock-corridors
People are standing
With their eyes in their hands
But they don't understand
Why their confessional folding-chairs
Go into the narcotic flight of stairs

Baiting soldiers are sleeping
In the melting House of Wax
Why is the audience not taking
The insurrection-axe
Thousands of windows burst open
And the alarm bells are broken",Archangels Thunderbird,1999

Sua frieza quando está me beijando

Não faça assim meu bem que eu já estou tão magoado
Não há motivo pra me torturar assim
Não me conformo em saber que você nem sequer se lembrou
Das horas tristes e belas que juntos passamos
E que hoje acabou

I asked him what he did in Barcelona
In sunny Barcelona
And this is what he said

You are fortunate my friend
Of this there is no doubt
For everywhere I go the people shout

Hey torero make way for Don Jose the great torero
In Spain I am a famous Caballero
I fight the bravest bull in all the land
With the flip of the hip of the music of the band
I cha cha, the bull is so confused because I cha cha
I never kill him, only if he gets in my way

He bragged about the many senoritas
Who showered him with flowers
With big bouquets of flowers
He told me that in Holly wood
They want him to be like Marlon Brando

But as he left the bus he met two men in white
He shouted as they took him out of sight

Renato Russo,"In every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along

I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still feel I said too much
My silence is my self defense

And every time I've held a rose
It seems I only felt the thorns
And so it goes, and so it goes
And so will you soon I suppose

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break

And this is why my eyes are closed
It's just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make decisions too
And you can have this heart to break

Renato Russo,"Sing a song of sad young man
Glasses full of rye
All the news is bad again so
Kiss your dreams goodbye

All the sad young men sitting in the bars
Knowing neon nights missing all the stars
All the sad young men drifting through the town
Drinking up the night trying not to drown
All the sad young men singing in the cold
Trying to forget that they're growing old
All the sad young men choking on their worth
Trying to be brave, running from the truth
Autumm turns the leaves gold
Slowly dies the heart
Sad young men are growing old
And that's the cruelest part
All the sad young men seek a certain smile
Someone they can hold for a little while
Tired little girl does the best she can
Trying to be gay for her sad young man
While the grimy moon watches from above
All the sad young men play of making love
Misbegotten moon shine for sad young men
Let your gentle light guide them home tonight

Renato Russo,"I got the call today, I didn't want to hear
But I knew that it would come
An old, true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me and you lost you
What are those voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand,
All the things I thought I knew, I'm learning again
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
People filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive in such a graceless age?
Ah, the trust and self-assurance that lead to happiness
They're the very things we kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us, you know it doesn't keep me warm

I'm learning to live with out you now
But I miss you, baby
And the more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I'd figured out
I have to learn again
I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me anymore

There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they've hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you baby
'Cause life goes on
You keep carryin' that anger
It'll eat you  up inside baby

I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if, even if you don't love me

I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So, I'm thinkin' about forgiveness
Forgiveness
Even if , even if you don't love me

Even if, even if you don't love me

Renato Russo,"Sometimes late at night 
I lie awake and watch him sleeping 
He's lost in peaceful dreams 
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark 
And the thought crosses my mind 
If I never wake up in the morning 
Would he ever doubt the way I feel 
About him in my heart 

If tomorrow never comes 
Will he know how much I loved him 
Did I try in every way to show him every day 
That he's my only one 
And if my time on earth were through 
And he must face the world without me 
Is the love I gave him in the past 
Gonna be enough to last 
If tomorrow never comes 

'Cause I've lost loved ones in my life 
Who never knew how much I loved them 
Now I live with the regret 
That my true feelings for them 
Never were revealed 
So I made a promise to myself

And wonders at my taste in men 
And we wonder why I do it 

And the pain of getting through it 
And he laughs and says: ""You'll do it again !"" 
And we sit in a bar and talk till two 
'Bout life and love as old friends do 

And tell each other what we've been through 
How love is rare, life is strange 
Nothing lasts, people change 
And I ask him if his life is ever lonely 

And if he ever feels despair 
And he says he's learned to love it 
'Cause that's really a part of it 
And it helps him feel the good times when they're there 

And we wonder if I'll live with any lover 
Or spend my life alone 
And the bartender is dozing 
And it's getting time for closing 
So we figure that I'll make it on my own 

But we'll meet the year we're sixty-two

se con i tuoi non parli mai

Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà

Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via
Di certo il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai
Ha detto ""un giorno tu mi capirai""

Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,

I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

An airline ticket to romantic places

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart

One magic moment and my heart seemed to know that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I forgot the gloom of the past
One look and I had found my future at last
One look and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you

Renato Sellani,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2007
Renato Sellani Trio,"Love is funny or it's sad, 
Or it's quiet or it's mad,
It's a good thing or it's bad,
But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,
Renato Sellani Trio,"It's very clear, our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies and in time may go

But oh, my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay

In time the Rockies may crumble, Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay",Our Love Is Here to Stay,

Renato Teixeira,"Amigo é coisa pra se guardar
Debaixo de sete chaves
Dentro do coração
Assim falava canção
Que na América ouvi

Mas quem cantava chorou
Ao ver seu amigo partir

Mas quem ficou
No pensamento voou
Com seu canto que o outro lembrou
E quem voou
No pensamento ficou
Com a lembrança que o outro cantou

Amigo é coisa pra se guardar
Do lado esquerdo do peito
Mesmo que o tempo e a distância
Digam não
Mesmo esquecendo a canção
O que importa é ouvir
A voz que vem do coração

Pois seja o que vier
Venha o que vier
Qualquer dia amigo, eu volto a te encontrar
Qualquer dia amigo, a gente vai se encontrar

Pois seja o que vier (pois seja o que vier)
Venha o que vier
Qualquer dia amigo, eu volto a te encontrar

Que sai do chão
Enfeita por folhas e flores

Sempre tão singelas

O silencio aqui
Construiu seu ninho

Enfeita por folhas e flores

E elas são tão belas

Para enfeitar
Esse mundo lindo

Vai se construindo

De acordar pra ver
Sentir o vento
Que faz balançar no ar

Paisagem do jardim

Renato Teixeira,"Eu fiz promessa
Pra que Deus mandasse chuva
Pra crescer a minha roça
E vingar a criação

Pois veio a seca
E matou meu cafezal
Matou todo o meu arroz
Secou todo algodão

Nesta colheita
Meu carro ficou parado
Minha boiada carreira
Quase morre sem pastar

Eu fiz promessa
Que o primeiro pingo d'água
Eu molhava a flor da santa
Que estava em frente ao altar

Eu esperei uma semana
Um mês inteiro
A roça tava tão seca
Dava pena até de ver

Olhava o céu
E cada nuvem que passava
Eu da santa me lembrava
Pra promessa não esquecer

Em pouco tempo
A roça ficou viçosa
A criação já pastava
Floresceu meu cafezal

Fui na capela
E levei três pingos d'água
Um foi o pingo da chuva
E dois caíram do meu olhar",Pingo D'água,2015
Renato Teixeira,"Me dê licença compadre
Para entrar em sua casa
Vim rever um velho amigo
Que me dá gosto abraçar

Eu venho vindo por ali
Há tantos anos na estradas
A gerações escutando
Todos na mesma toada

Quantas vezes nos cruzamos
Das canções e nos tocamos
E nos fizemos irmãos
E já nos damos as mãos

Receba companheiro
A visita da canção

Vim trazer-lhe um abraço
De carinho e gratidão
Vim lhe trazer um abraço
De carinho e gratidão

As canções são como pássaros
Pois parecem voar
Quem leva a vida cantando
Tem que aprender a se dar

Para o carinho do povo
Que gosta de escutar
E o tempo vai levando
As melodias no ar

Tantos anos nesta vida
Tantos sonhos pra sonhar
Lembranças pra se viver
Coragem pra desejar

Quando eu toco o meu berrante
É pro Brasil se ajuntar

E se dizer brasileiro
Pro mundo todo escutar
E se dizer brasileiro
Pro mundo todo escutar

De Porto Alegre a Manaus
Do Rio Branco ao Cariri
Cantando moda bonita
Fazendo o povo feliz

A minha vida é um sonho
Que parece não ter fim
Quando eu saí de Santana

Meu pai me disse menino
É pra ir até o fim
Mil razões para cantar

Motivos pra viajar
O menino da porteira
É meu anjo querubim

Com ele eu vou tocando em frente
E ele rezando por mim
Com ele vou tocando em frente
E ele rezando por mim",A Visita da Canção,2015

O tempo passa veloz como um trem
No rádio a noticia, um amigo se foi
Atrás dos mistérios que sempre buscou
Mais uma pra estrada, mais um fim de show
Ao som das guitarras do bom rock n' roll

O tempo trás suas lições
E as grava em nossos corações
Contando a história assim como foi
Mostrando os caminhos que irão nos levar
Como se fosse o rio correndo pro mar
Como se fossem pedras no rio a rolar

Assim os dias passarão
Virão as novas gerações

Onde o trovão cria suas melodias
Onde o clarão da luz que alumia o dia

Na escuridão das noites fundas e frias
Sem pecado e sem poesia

Se houver ondas do mar e mais
Se houver paixão

Onde a razão natural das teorias
Irá trazer o poder e a energia

A lua passa clareando a morraria
E a gente vai pra onde o veste se cria
No colo da melodia

Che un drogato è soltanto un malato di nostalgia 
Che una madre si arrende ed un bambino non nascerà 
Che potremmo restare abbracciati all'eternità

Ti ritrovo qui

Ch'io viva il sogno che non osi vivere te

Se qualcuno sorride, tu non tradirlo mai

Un motivo in più

Insegneremo il perdono a chi dimenticare non sa

Essere buoni alla fine così male non è
Non così tanto indulgenti. Nemmeno giullari però
Buon compleanno col cuore migliore che ho

A chi è lì da sempre
Sotto la pioggia o col sole più aggressivo che c'è
Si vive bene così, senza troppe richieste
Buon compleanno, affabulatori, il mondo è con voi

Ciò che si ottiene soffrendo si gode di più
Tutti i furbi del mondo, che sprofondino giù
Padroni non sempre signori, forse schiavi dei vizi se vuoi
Così sotto tono che non si festeggiano mai

A chi la fatica non sente 
A chi vuole di più
A chi comunque vada è con la gente
Buon compleanno a chi il tempo lo accetta ogni volta com'è

Passano i giorni ma tu non li fermi
Potresti cambiarli, semmai colorarli di te
È bello buttarsi, bruciarsi, ferirsi
per poi riciclarsi
Nessuna paura però

Stanco e deluso non devi arrivarci così
Cerca di essere più convincente, ma sì
Che sia una favola crescere
un'avvincente scommessa sia
Alla tua festa non entri la malinconia

Cerca di essere tu il tuo infallibile custode
Festeggia il tuo cuore, che senza fiatare
fedele lui ti asseconderà
E che ogni giorno lui sia messaggero di felicità

Ils vont à New Orléans ou à New York City

On assassine Mozart, Beethoven et Chuck Berry
Avec le gros Lulu et sa guitare en bois

Dans les bouges de Lille et les bistrots de Tourcoing
Où la bière coule à flot sous des tonnes de frites
On fait danser le twist et le rock au copain
En jouant des vieux tubes de Johnny et d'Elvis
On a des blousons de cuir et des vieux mocassins

Laisse béton, j' démystifie.

Non, maintenant j'ai une Harley,
Une grosse qu'a un grand guidon, une grande fourche, une grande roue
Un grand trou dans mon budget.
Ma bécane, c'est comme un ch'val.
Ca tombe bien, j' suis conçu pour :
Elle est faite pour épouser la forme de mes jambes arquées.
Sans blague, t'avais pas r'marqué ?
Avec elle, j' suis un cow-boy,
J' suis shérif dans mon quartier.
Porte d'Orléans, j' fais la loi.
Par ici on y croit pas.
Dans l' quartier, on m' traite de goye.
C'était pour rimer avec cow-boy.
Et tous les apaches de Paris
Qu'y m' voient passé sur ma bête,
Y s' fendent la gueule, c'est pas gentil.
Laisse béton, j' démystifie.

J'ai laissé mon perfecto
Derrière, dans la coulisse,
Accrochée au portemanteau
Et pis j'ai eu peur qu'i' glisse
Entre les doigts du tôlier que
Bien qu' ce soit un brave mec,
Qu' aimerai bien m' le chouraver.
Alors j' viens sur scène avec.

Là, j'ai un insigne SS,
L'initiale de ma gonzesse,
Que c'est même pas ma gonzesse,
C'est la femme à mon copain,
Que c'est même pas mon copain.
Parce que moi j'ai pas d' copains,
Pas d'amis, pas d' parents, pas d' relations.
Ma famille c'est la prison,
Mon copain, c'est mon blouson, c'est mon surin.

Quoi?
Qui c'est qui dit qu' c'est pas vrai?
Toi?
Bah t'as raison mon pote.

Des copains j'en ai des tonnes
Toutes les nuits dans tous les rades,
Tous les paumés, tous les ivrognes,
Tous les fous, tous les malades,
Qui devant un perroquet, une Kanter ou un p'tit joint
S' déballonnent dans un hoquet,
Et r'font l' monde à leur image.
Tous ces mecs c'est mes copains.
Touche pas à mon copain.
"" Sort dehors si t'es un homme ! ""
Moi, euh, dans ces cas là, j' sors pas.
Dans ma tête, j' suis pas un homme,
Dans ma tête, j'ai quatorze ans ;
Dans les muscles aussi d'ailleurs.
J' parlais des muscles des bras.
""Eh, tu veux m' casser la tête ?
Bah qu'est-ce t'attends ? Vas-y ? ""
Laisse béton, j' démystifie.

Sur l' bras droit, j'ai un tatouage :
Y'a une fleur, y'a un oiseau, qui s'envolera plus jamais,
Pis y'a l' prénom d'une souris. Une souris qu'est tellement belle,
Qu'i' faudrait qu' j' m'appelle Verlaine pour trouver les mots pour la décrire un peu,
Mais j' vais essayer quand même.
Dans ces yeux, y'a tant d' soleil,
Que quand elle me regarde, je bronze.
Dans son sourire, y'a la mer,
Quand elle me parle, je plonge.
Quand j' serai grand, on s' mariera,
Pis on aura plein d'enfants,
Même que ce s'ra un garçon,
Même qu'i' s'appellera Pierrot.
""Eh !Laisse moi fermer les yeux, Ouais, laisse moi rêver un peu.""
Sur l' bras gauche y' en a un autre
Un poulbot qui a une gueule d'ange
Et qui joue d' l'accordéon.
Pis en d' sous y'a mon prénom.
Euh, y'en a qu' ça dérange ?
Dans l' dos, j' voulais faire tatouer un aigle,
Aux ailes déployées,
On m'a dit "" Y'a pas la place.
Nan, t'es pas assez carré, alors t'auras un moineau. ""
Eh, y'a des moineaux rapaces.
Ca fait marrer mes conneries?
Laisse béton, j' démystifie.

Bon c'est l'heure, moi j'ai fini,
J' vous voie tout à l'heure au bar,
J' vais m' jeter un petit Ricard,
Et ça, c'est pas des conneries.",Peau Aime [Live],1979

Une caravane et un clébard

Dans le vieux faubourg
Tout chargé d'amour,
Près du pont de la Villette
Un soir je flânais,
Un refrain traînait,
Un air de valse musette,
Comme un vieux copain
Me prenant la main
Il m'a dit ""viens""
Pourquoi le cacher
Ma foi j'ai marché
Et j'ai trouvé.

REFRAIN

Le p'tit bal du sam'di soir
Ou le coeur plein d'espoir
Dansent les midinettes,
Pas de frais pour la toilette,
Pour ça vous avez l'bonsoir,
Mais du bonheur dans les yeux
De tous les amoureux
Ça m'a touché, c'est bête,
Je suis entré dans la fête
L'air digne et le coeur joyeux,
D'ailleurs il ne manquait rien,
Y'avait tout c'qu'il convient,
Des moules et du vin rouge,
Au troisièm' flacon ça bouge,
Au quatrièm' ça va bien,
Alors il vaut mieux s'asseoir
Le patron vient vous voir,
Il vous dit : c'est la mienne,
Et c'est comm'ça tout's les s'maines
Au p'tit bal du sam'di soir.

Vous l'avez d'viné
J'y suis retourné
Maint'nant je connais tout l'monde,
Victor et Titi,
Fernand le tout p'tit,
Nénette et Mimi la blonde,
D'ailleurs des beaux yeux
Y'en a tant qu'on en veut,
Ils vont par deux,
Et blagu' dans les coins
On est aussi bien
Qu'au Tabarin.

Où le coeur plein d'espoir
Dansent les midinettes,
Pas de frais pour la toilette,
Pour ça vous avez l'bonsoir.
Mais du bonheur des aveux
Car tous les amoureux
Se montent un peu la tête
Quand l'accordéon s'arrête,
Ils vont s'asseoir deux par deux,
De temps en temps, un garçon
Pousse un' petit' chanson
Ça fait rêver les filles,
Dans l'noir y'a des yeux qui brillent,
On croirait des p'tits lampions,
Oui, les lampions merveilleux
Du carnaval joyeux,
D'une fête éternelle,
On serre un peu plus sa belle
Au p'tit bal des amoureux.

Un dimanche matin
Avec Baptistain
(C'est le patron d'la guinguette)
On s'est attablés
Et nous avons joué
Au ch'min d'fer en tête à tête,
Comme il perdait trop
Il a fait l'bistro,
J'ai dit banco,
J'ai gagné ma foi,
Et depuis trois mois
Il est à moi.

Un vrai de vrai, bien balancé
Mais je suis chipée pour la pomme
D'un avorton, complétement j'té
Ce n'est pas un Apollon, mon Jules
Il n'est pas taillé comme un Hercule
Malgré qu'il ai bien des défauts
C'est lui que j'ai dans la peau

Tel qu'il est, il me plait
Il me fait de l'effet
Et je l'aime
C'est un vrai gringalet
Aussi laid qu'un basset
Mais je l'aime
Il est bancal
Du coté cérébral
Mais ça m'est bien égal
Qu'il a l'air anormal

C'est complet, il est muet
Ses quinquets sont en biais
C'est un fait tel qu'il est
Il me plait

Il est carré mais ses épaules
Par du carton, sont rembourrées
Quand il est tout nu ça fait drôle
On n'en voit plus que la moitié
Il n'a pas un seul poil sur la tête
Mais il en a plein sur ses gambettes
Et celui qu'il a dans la main
C'est pas du poil c'est du crin

Tel qu'il est, il me plait
Il me fait de l'effet

Le travail, pour lui, c'est la chose
La plus sacrée, il y touche pas
Pour tenir le coup il se dose
De quintonine à tous les r'pas
Ce qui n'est pas marrant c'est qu'il ronfle
On dirait un pneu qui se dégonfle
Et quand il faut se bagarrer
Il est encore dégonflé

Il me fait de l'effet

Renaud,"Elle s'emmerdait Place Saint-Michel, avec des cons
Elle descendait place de l'Horloge, en Avignon
S'emmerder avec des vieux chnoques
De vingt-cinq berges
Qui reviennent des Indes ou du Maroc
Et qui se gobergent
Assis sur des sacs de couchage
Plutôt cradoques
Sous leurs pavés, c'est peut être la plage
Mais elle est moche!

Elle était un petit peu campeuse
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

Je l'ai prise en stop à la porte de Vanves, un soir de juin
L'est montée dans ma Ford Mustang, avec son chien
Un doberman complètement barge
Qu'avait très faim
Qu'a mis des poils et pi de la bave
Plein mes coussins
Elle a retiré ses charentaises
Bonjour l'odeur
Pour roupiller super à l'aise
Pendant trois heures!

Elle était un petit peu campeuse
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

En se réveillant l'avait la frite, elle m'a parlé
D'un pote à elle qu'est journaliste à V.S.D
Qu'écrit parfois dans Rock and Folk
Sous un faux nom
Pi qui serait pédé comme un phoque
Mais loin d'être con
Je lui ai dit, boucle-là, tu m'emmerdes
Avec tes salades
Pi tu m'enfumes avec ton herbe

Tiens, c'est pas dur, même le clébard
A tout gerbé!

Sans rien moufter
Elle était raide, comme par hasard

Quand je lui ai proposé la botte, sans trop y croire

Alors, pour détendre l'atmosphère
Très glauque, très punk
Je mets une cassette se Starshouter
Dans mon Blaupunkt

Elle me dit, je préfère le rock 'n' roll
C'est plus l'éclate
Je l'ai gerbé de ma bagnole
À grands coups de lattes

Elle était un petit peu campeuse
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

Elle s'est retrouvé sur le macadam avec ses gamelles
Son sac à dos, son doberman, bien fait pour elle
Terminé pour moi les campeuses
J'ai eu ma dose
Me parlez plus d'auto-stoppeuse
Ça me rend morose!
Je veux plus personne dans ma bagnole
Je suis mieux tout seul
Je conduit d'une main, de l'autre je picole

Fais le taire ce bâtard
Il arrête pas d'aboyer
Y nous les brise

Je dormirais bien une plombe
Avant d'arriver à Tarbes
J'ai les paupières qui tombent
Et les yeux qui se lézardent
Je suis vanné

Je voulais dire les mecs
Demain après le gala
Je me taperais bien un steak
Ras le bol des pizzerias
Terminé

Combien qu'y reste de bornes
A quelle heure on arrive
Et dans quel hôtel on borgne
On va poser nos valises
Nos valises

Y a Fredo qui roupille
Hier soir au Novotel
Y s'est tapé une fille
Pas bavarde et très belle
Sans complexe

L'avait draguée dans Lui
Dans les pages du milieu
On se l'était faite aussi
On était tous amoureux
Même le clebs

Amaury est fâché
Tout à l'heure en sortant de scènes
Je lui est dit qui s'était planté
Dans l'intro d'H.L.M.
Y m'en veut

Putain! Ces musicos
Y ils ont vraiment trop de talent
Et moins y sont craignos
Plus y sont gonflants
Ou teigneux

Combien qu'y reste de bornes
A quelle heure on arrive
Et dans quel hôtel on borgne
On va sécher nos chemises
Nos chemises

A l'Alhambra de Bordeaux
Hier soir y avait un monde
Au moins quinze cents pélots
Et d'un baston pas l'ombre
C'est bizarre

Y a pourtant des rockys
Qu'ont dû avoir les boules
En me voyant applaudi
Même par des babas cools
Quel panard

Vous en faites pas les mecs
Ce soir y seront des milliers
Enfoncés Supertramp
Trust et Lavilliers
Mais non je déconne!

Si y sont qu'une dizaine
On leur paiera l'apéro
On s'éclatera quand même
On fera le concert au bistrot

Renaud,"Tu sais que t'as un peu la gueule à James Dean
Celle qu'il aurait eu s'il avait pas été beau
T'es bâti comme une armoire de cuisine
Le cœur dans le tiroir, tout près du couteau
Lorsque je vois se pointer dans mon horizon
Ta carcasse immense de grand chien paumé
Je dis tiens voila Loulou, la fleur du baston
Voila la bête humaine, voila l'autre allumé
Je dis ""Salut Georges"", t'aime pas tellement ça
Tu veux qu'on appelle de ton surnom de voyou
Celui que t'as été quand t'étais moins gras
Un petit plus jeune, et moins con surtout

T'as pris des coups quand t'étais petit
T'en as donné aussi beaucoup
Maintenant tu prends surtout du bide
Tu prends des rides, Loulou

Avec ton nez cassé, tu frimes tous les mecs
Tu dis que t'as été boxeur, ça en jette
Moi je sais que ça te vient d'un accident de poussette
Je le tiens de ta petite sœur que je suis pote avec
M'a tout raconté, ta frangine Ginette
Ta vie, ta jeunesse, les conneries que t'as fait
Je connais ton casier, il est pas vraiment net
Mais c'est quand même pas celui d'un député
T'étais une petite frappe, t'as roulé ta bosse
Arrête-toi Loulou, c'était y a dix piges
Entre temps t'as ta femme et deux gosses
Allez bois une bière, et file-moi une tige

Aujourd'hui t'as plus ta gueule et elle est grande
Elle est plus aussi belle, mais ça tu t'en fous
Y a encore des mômes qui te croient chef de bande
Encore des gonzesses qu'aiment bien tes yeux de fou
Tu les baratines avec tellement de bagou
Que je te soupçonne de croire toi-même a tes conneries
Tu dis que t'as tout fait, que t'as été partout
Eh je t'ai même pas vu, et j'y étais aussi
Mais dis-moi Loulou, t'as encore grossi
Ah non, c'est du muscle, excuse-moi, j'oubliais
Que tu fais du body building avec ton pote Rocky
Pour garder la forme entre deux muflées

T'es le roi de la combine et des plans bidons
Allez raconte-moi ta prochaine embrouille
Est-ce-que t'as trouvé encore un pigeon
Un nouvelle galère pour te remplir les fouilles
Tu cherches un bâton, rien que ça, t'as le moral
Pour racheter un lot de blue jeans délavés
Que t'espère fourguer au plus à cent balles
Sois sympa Loulou, met-m'en un de côté
Bon je vois que tu commences à être allumé
Si tu veux j'arrête de me foutre de ta gueule
Tu sais je suis pas mieux que toi avec mes trente balais
Toi et moi ensemble, on est quand même seuls

T'as pris des coups quand t'étais petit
Moi j'en ai pas donné beaucoup
Maintenant tu prends surtout du bide
J'en prend aussi, Loulou",Loulou,1982
Renaud,"J'avais écrit un' chanson
Un vrai tube, un truc en or
Avec des paroles en béton
Une musique le genre Milord
C'était pas vraiment mon style
Je m'suis dit
J'vais la placer
Ça d'vrait pas être difficile
Y'a d'la d'mande dans c'métier (yé-yé)
J'ai rencontré Capdevielle
Au bar de l'Apocalypse
J'ui ai dit 
Ecoute ma vieille
Ça s'appelle ""Le Cataclysme""
Ça raconte l'histoire d'un ange
Qu'est marchand de certitudes
Et qui poignarde dans l'ciel étrange
Le fantôme des solitudes
Il est pote avec Mary
La vestiaire du crépuscule

Où tous les gardiens d'la nuit
Viennent jouer les funambules
Voilà ma chanson mon pote
Si t'en veux pas, pas d'malaise
Je la r'mets dans ma culotte
Mais tu sais pas c'que tu perds
Ma chanson lui a pas plu
N'en parlons plus

J'ai écrit une autre chanson
Un truc encore plus super
'Vec des paroles en béton
Avec une musique d'enfer
Mais elle correspondait pas trop
À mon image, mon créneau
Un peu comme si Dalida
Chantait Be-Bop-A-Lula
J'ai rencontré Lavilliers
Un soir à Geoffroi-Guichard
Dans l'enfert vert immaculé
J'ui ai raconté mon histoire
La chanson s'passe à New-York
Y'a Jimmy qui s'fait flinguer
Par un black, au coin d'un bloc
Par un flic très singulier
Mais il était pas vraiment mort
Il était blessé seul'ment
Jimmy, il est vach'ment fort
Il est dealer et on l'dit lent
Voilà ma chanson, mon pote
Si t'en veux pas, pas de problème
Je la r'mets dans ma culotte
Allez va, dis-moi qu'tu l'aimes!
Ma chanson lui a pas plu
N'en parlons plus

J'suis r'tourné à ma guitare
Et à mon dictionnaire de rimes
J'ai travaillé très, très tard
J'ai fait une chanson sublime
J'l'ai chantée à deux trois potes
Y m'ont dit, c'est pas pour toi
Sûr que ta chanson nous botte
Mais un conseil, oublie-la
'Lors j'ai rencontré Cabrel
Assis au bord d'l'autoroute
J'ui ai dit, ma chanson s'appelle
""Sur le chemin de la route""
Et c'est l'histoire d'une nonne
Amoureuse d'un caillou
Dans sa vie, y'a plus personne
Que les marchands et les fous
Elle veut retrouver sa terre
Et ses chèvres et ses brebis
Fuir le doute et la poussière
Et revoir sa Normandie
Voilà ma chanson, mon pote
Si t'en veux pas, pas d'lézard
Je la r'mets dans ma culotte
Ou au pire dans ma guitare
Ma chanson lui a pas plu
N'en parlons plus

Alors j'm'suis dit, basta!
J'fais plus qu'des chansons pour moi
J'm'en suis écrit une aussi sec
Qui raconte l'histoire d'un mec
Amoureux d'sa mobylette
Mais leur amour est impossible
Elle aime une clé à molette
Qu'est d'une jalousie terrible, horrible
A la fin le mec y meurt
En mangeant une canette de bière
La mobylette se suicide
En s'faisant couler une bielle
La clé à molette finit en taule
Elle qui s'croyait en acier
Et c'est sur cette fin pas drôle
Que s'termine ma chanson pas gaie
Pi si elle vous a pas plu
Vous savez où j'me la mets
T't'façon, elle s'ra pas foutue
Elle s'ra au chaud, bien logée
Parce que maint'nant, ma culotte

Sur le papier peint

Veut bouffer des fraises
Elle a des envies
Balaises
Moi, j' suis aux petits soins
J' me défonces en huit
Pour qu'elle manque de rien
Ma petite
C'est comme si j' pissais
Dans un violoncelle
Comme si j'existais
Plus pour elle
Je m' retrouve planté
Tout seul dans mon froc
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Le soir elle tricote
En buvant d' la verveine
Moi j' démêle ses pelotes
De laine
Elle use les miroirs
A s'regarder dedans
A s'trouver bizarre
Tout le temps
J' lui dit qu'elle est belle
Comme un fruit trop mûr
Elle croit qu' je m' fous d'elle
C'est sûr
Faut bien dire s' qu'y est
Moi aussi j' débloque
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Faut qu'j'retire mes grolles
Quand j'rentre dans la chambre
Du petit rossignol
Qu'elle couve
C'est qu' son petit bonhomme
Qu'arrive en Décembre

Elle le protège comme
Une louve
Même le chat pépère
Elle en dit du mal
Sous prétexte qu'il perd
Ses poils
Elle veut plus l'voir traîner
Autour du paddock
Depuis qu'elle est
En cloque

Quand j' promène mes mains
D' l'autre côté d' son dos
J' sens comme des coups de poings
Ça bouge
J' lui dis ""t'es un jardin""
""Une fleur, un ruisseau""
Alors elle devient
Toute rouge
Parfois c'qu'y m'désole
C' qu'y fait du chagrin
Quand j'regarde son ventre

C'est qu' même si j'devenais
Pédé comme un phoque

Renaud,"J'ai plaqué mon chêne comme un saligaud
Mon copain le chêne mon alter ego
On était do même bois, un peu rustique un peu brut
Don't on fait n'importe quoi, sauf naturellement les flûtes

J'ai maintenant des frênes, des arbres de Judée
Tous de bonne graine, de haute futaie
Mais toi, tu manque à l'appel, ma vieille branche de campagne
Mon seul arbre de Noël, mon mât de cocagne

Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux

Je suis un pauvre type, j'aurais plus de joie
J'ai jeté ma pipe, ma vieille pipe en bois
Qu'avait fumé sans s'fâcher, sans jamais m'brûler la lippe
L'tabac d'la vache enragée dans sa bonne vieille tête de pipe

J'ai des pipes d'écume ornées de fleurons
De ces pipes qu'on fume en levant le front
Mais j'retrouverai plus ma foi, dans mon coeur ni sur ma lippe
Le goût d'ma vieille pipe en bois, sacré nom d'une pipe

Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d'mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux

Le surnom d'infâme me va comme un gant
D'avecque ma femme, j'ai foutu le camp
Parce que depuis tant d'années see'était pas une sinécure
De lui voir tout l'temps le nez au milieu de la figure

Je bas la campagne pour dénicher la
Nouvelle compagne valant celle-là
Qui, bien sûr, laissait beaucoup trop de pierres dans les lentilles
Mais se pendait à mon cou quand j'perdais mes billes

Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d' mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux

J'avais une mansarde pour tout logement
Avec des lézardes sur le firmament
Je l'savais par coeur depuis et pour un baiser la course
J'emmenais mes belle-de-nuit faire un tour sur la grande ourse

J'habite plus d' mansarde, il peut désormais
Tomber des hallebardes, je m'en bats l'oeil mais
Mais si quelqu'un monte aux cieux, moins que moi j'why paie des prunes
Why a cent sept ans qui dit mieux, que j'ai pas vu la lune

Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû m'éloigner d' mon arbre
Auprès de mon arbre je vivais heureux
J'aurais jamais dû le quitter des yeux

Trouvant dans l’herbe un petit chat
Qui venait de perdre sa mère
L’adopta
Elle entrouvre sa collerette
Et le couche contre son sein
C’était tout ce qu’elle avait, pauvrette
Comme coussin
Le chat, la prenant pour sa mère,
Se mit à téter tout de go
Émue Margot le laissa faire
Brave Margot!
Un croquant, passant à la ronde,
Trouvant le tableau peu commun,
S’en alla le dire à tout le monde,
Et le lendemain

Quand Margot dégrafait son corsage
Pour donner la gougoutte à son chat
Tous les gars, tous les gars du village
Étaient là, la la la la la
Étaient là, la la la la
Et Margot qu’était simple et très sage,
Présumais que c’était pour voir son chat
Que tous les gars, que tous les gars du village
Étaient là, la la la la la
Étaient là, la la la la

Le maître d’école et ses potaches
Le maire, le bedeau, le bougnat
Négligeaient carrément leur tâche
Pour voir ça
Le facteur, d’ordinaire si preste
Pour voir ça ne distribuait plus
Les lettres que personne au reste
N’aurait lues
Pour voir ça (Dieu le leur pardonne!)
Les enfant de chœur, au milieu
Du saint sacrifice abandonnent
Le saint lieu
Les gendarmes, même les gendarmes,
Qui sont par nature si ballots
Se laissaient toucher par le charme

Privées de leurs époux, de leurs galants
Accumulèrent la rancune
Patiemment

Elles s’armèrent de bâtons

Pour se consoler prit un mari
Et ne dévoila plus ses charmes
Que pour lui
Le temps passa sur les mémoires
On oublia l’événement
Seuls des vieux racontent encore
A leurs petits enfants

Quand Margot dégrafait son corsage
Pour donner la gougoutte à son chat
Tous les gars, tous les gars du village
Étaient là, la la la la la
Étaient là, la la la la
Et Margot qu’était simple et très sage,
Présumais que c’était pour voir son chat
Que tous les gars, que tous les gars du village
Étaient là, la la la la la
Étaient là, la la la la",Brave Margot,1996
Renaud,"Un bon petit diable à la fleur de l’âge
La jambe légère et l’œil polisson,
Et la bouche pleine de joyeux ramages
Allait à la chasse aux papillons.

Comme il atteignait l’orée du village
Filant sa quenouille, il vit Cendrillon ,
Il lui dit "" Bonjour, que Dieu te ménage,
Je t’emmène à la chasse aux papillons ""

Cendrillon, ravie de quitter sa cage,
Met sa robe neuve et ses bottillons ;
Et bras dessus bras dessous vers les frais bocages
Ils vont à la chasse aux papillons.

Ils ne savaient pas que sous les ombrages,
Se cachait l’amour et son aiguillon,
Et qu’il transperçait les cœurs de leur âge,
Les cœurs des chasseurs de papillons.

Quand il se fit tendre, elle lui dit
""Je présage que c’est pas dans les plis de mon cotillon,
Ni dans l’échancrure de mon corsage
Qu’on va-t-à la chasse aux papillons ""

Sur sa bouche en feu qui criait ""Sois sage!""
Il posa sa bouche en guise de bâillon,
Et ce fut le plus charmant des remue-ménage
Qu’on ait vu de mémoire de papillon.

Un volcan dans l’âme, y revinrent au village,
En se promettant d’aller des millions,
Des milliards de fois, et même davantage,
Ensemble à la chasse aux papillons.

Mais tant qu’ils s’aimeront, tant que les nuages
Porteurs de chagrins, les épargneront,
Y fera bon voler dans les frais bocages,
Y feront pas la chasse aux papillons
Pas la chasse aux papillons",La Chasse aux Papillons,1996

Renaud,"Gaztibelza, l'homme à la carabine
Chantait ainsi:
Quelqu’un a-t-il connu doña Sabine
Quelqu’un d’ici?
Chantez, dansez, villageois! La nuit gagne
Le Mont Falu
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Quelqu’un a-t-il connu Sabine
Ma señora?
Sa mère était la vieille maugrabine
D’Antequera
Qui chaque nuit criait dans la tour Magne
Comme un hibou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Vraiment, la reine eût près d’elle été laide
Quand vers le soir
Elle passait sur le pont de Tolède
En corset noir
Un chapelet du temps de Charlemagne
Ornait son cou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Le roi disait, en la voyant si belle
A son neveu:
Pour un baiser pour un sourire d’elle
Pour un cheveu
Infant don Ruy, je donnerais l’Espagne
Et le Pérou!
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Je ne sais pas si j’aimais cette dame
Mais je sais bien
Que pour avoir un regard de son âme
Moi pauvre chien
J’aurais gaiement passé dix ans au bagne
Sous les verrous
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Quand je voyais cette enfant, moi le pâtre
De ce canton
Je croyais voir la belle Cléopâtre
Qui, nous dit-on
Menait César, empereur d’Allemagne
Par le licou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
Me rendra fou

Dansez, chantez, villageois, la nuit tombe
Sabine un jour
A tout vendu, sa beauté de colombe
Tout son amour
Pour l’anneau d’or du comte de Saldagne
Pour un bijou
Le vent qui vient à travers la montagne
M’a rendu fou",Gastibelza,1996
Renaud,"C’est à travers de larges grilles,
Que les femelles du canton
Contemplaient un puissant gorille,
Sans souci du qu’en-dira-t-on
Avec impudeur, ces commères
Lorgnaient même un endroit précis
Que rigoureusement ma mère
M’a défendu de nommer ici.
Gare au gorille!

Tout à coup, la prison bien close,
Où vivait le bel animal,
S’ouvre on ne sait pourquoi 
(Je suppose qu’on avait dû la fermer mal)
Le singe, en sortant de sa cage,
Dit ""C’est aujourd’hui que je le perds!""
Il parlait de son pucelage,
Vous aviez deviné, j’espère!
Gare au gorille!

Le patron de la ménagerie
Criait éperdu ""Nom de nom!
C’est assommant car le gorille
N’a jamais connu de guenon!""
Dès que la féminine engeance
Sut que le singe était puceau
Au lieu de profiter de la chance
Elle fit feu des deux fuseaux!
Gare au gorille

Celles-là même qui naguère
Le couvaient d’un œil décidé
Fuirent, prouvant qu’elles n’avaient guère
De la suite dans les idées
D’autant plus vaine était leur crainte
Que le gorille est un luron
Supérieur à l’homme dans l’étreinte,
Bien des femmes vous le diront!
Gare au gorille!

Tout le monde se précipite
Hors d’atteinte du singe en rut,
Sauf une vieille décrépite
Et un jeune juge en bois brut.
Voyant que toutes se dérobent,
Le quadrumane accéléra
Son dandinement vers les robes
De la vieille et du magistrat!
Gare au gorille!

""Bah! Soupirait la centenaire,
Qu’on pût encore me désirer
Ce serait extraordinaire,
Et, pour tout dire, inespéré!""
Le juge pensait, impassible
""Qu’on me prenne pour une guenon,
C’est complètement impossible""
La suite lui prouva que non!
Gare au gorille!

Supposez qu’un de vous puisse être
Comme le singe, obligé de
Violer un juge ou une ancêtre,
Lequel choisirait-il des deux?
Qu’une alternative pareille,
Un de ces quatre jours m’échoie
C’est, j’en suis convaincu, la vieille
Qui fera l’objet de mon choix !
Gare au gorille !

Mais par malheur, si le gorille
Aux jeux de l’amour vaut son prix,
On sait qu’en revanche il ne brille
Ni par le goût ni par l’esprit.
Lors, au lieu d’opter pour la vieille
Comme aurait fait n’importe qui,
Il saisit le juge à l’oreille
Et l’entraîna dans un maquis!
Gare au gorille

La suite serait délectable,
Malheureusement je ne peux
Pas la dire et c’est regrettable,
Ça nous aurait fait rire un peu
Car le juge, au moment suprême,
Criait ""Maman!"" pleurait beaucoup,
Comme l’homme auquel le jour même
Il avait fait trancher le cou.
Gare au gorille!",Le Gorille,1996
Renaud,"Au marché de Brive-la-Gaillarde,
A propos de bottes d’oignons,
Quelques douzaines de gaillardes
Se crêpaient un jour le chignon.
A pied, à cheval, en voiture
Les gendarmes mal inspirés,
Vinrent pour tenter l’aventure
D’interrompre l’échauffourée

Or, sous tous les cieux sans vergogne,
C’est un usage bien établi,
Dès qu’il s’agit de rosser les cognes
Tout le monde se réconcilie
Ces furies, perdant toute mesure,
Se ruèrent sur les guignols,
Et donnèrent, je vous l’assure,
Un spectacle assez croquignole.

En voyant ces braves pandores
Être à deux doigts de succomber,
Moi je bichais car je les adore
Sous la forme de macchabées
De la mansarde où je réside,
J’excitais les farouches bras
Des mégères gendarmicides
En criant ""Hip, hip, hip, hourra""

Frénétique, l’une d’elle attache
Le vieux maréchal des logis
Et lui fait crier "" Mort aux vaches!
Mort aux lois! Vive l’anarchie!""
Une autre fourre avec rudesse
Le crâne d’un de ces lourdauds
Entre ses gigantesques fesses
Qu’elle serre comme un étau.

La plus grasse de ces femelles,
Ouvrant son corsage dilaté
Matraque à grands coups de mamelles
Ceux qui passent à sa portée
Ils tombent, tombent, tombent, tombent
Et selon les avis compétents
Il paraît que cette hécatombe
Fut la plus belle de tous les temps

Jugeant enfin que leurs victimes
Avaient eu leur content de gnons
Ces furies, comme outrage ultime,
En retournant à leurs oignons,
Ces furies, à peine si j’ose

Par bonheur ils n’en avaient pas !

Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il est des filles à Grenade
Il en est à Séville aussi
Qui, pour la moindre sérénade
A l'amour demandent merci
Il en est que parfois embrassent
Le soir, de hardis cavaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Ce n'est pas sur ce ton frivole
Qu'il faut parler de Padilla
Car jamais prunelle espagnole
D'un feu plus chaste ne brilla
Elle fuyait ceux qui pourchassent
Les filles sous les peupliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Elle prit le voile à Tolède
Au grand soupir des gens du lieu
Comme si, quand on n'est pas laide
On avait droit d'épouser Dieu
Peu s'en fallut que ne pleurassent
Les soudards et les écoliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or, la belle à peine cloîtrée
Amour en son cœur s'installa
Un fier brigand de la contrée
Vint alors et dit : ""Me voilà!""
Quelquefois les brigands surpassent
En audace les chevaliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Il était laid : les traits austères
La main plus rude que le gant
Mais l'amour a bien des mystères
Et la nonne aima le brigand
On voit des biches qui remplacent
Leurs beaux cerfs par des sangliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

La nonne osa, dit la chronique
Au brigand par l'enfer conduit
Aux pieds de Sainte Véronique
Donner un rendez-vous la nuit
A l'heure où les corbeaux croassent
Volant dans l'ombre par milliers
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Or quand, dans la nef descendue
La nonne appela le bandit
Au lieu de la voix attendue
C'est la foudre qui répondit
Dieu voulu que ses coups frappassent
Les amants par Satan liés
Enfants, voici des bœufs qui passent
Cachez vos rouges tabliers

Cette histoire de la novice
Saint Ildefonse, abbé, voulut
Qu'afin de préserver du vice

Car le plus bel amour qui m’fut donné sur terre
Je l’dois au mauvais temps, je le dois à Jupiter
Il me tomba d’un ciel d’orage

Par un soir de novembre, à cheval sur les toits
Un vrai tonnerre de Brest, avec des cris de putois,
Allumait ses feux d’artifice
Bondissant de sa couche en costume de nuit
Ma voisine affolée, vint cogner à mon huis
En réclamant mes bons offices.

"" Je suis seule et j’ai peur, ouvrez-moi par pitié
Mon époux vient de partir faire son dur métier
Pauvre malheureux mercenaire
Contraint de coucher dehors quand il fait mauvais temps
Pour la bonne raison qu’il est représentant
D’une maison de paratonnerres ""

En bénissant le nom de Benjamin Franklin
Je l’ai mise en lieu sûr entre mes bras câlins
Et puis l’amour a fait le reste
Toi qui sèmes des paratonnerres à foison
Que n’en as-tu planté sur ta propre maison ?
Erreur on ne peut plus funeste.

Quand Jupiter alla se faire entendre ailleurs
La belle ayant enfin conjuré sa frayeur
Et recouvré tout son courage
Rentra dans ses foyers, faire sécher son mari
En me donnant rendez-vous les jours d’intempéries
Rendez-vous au prochain orage

A partir de ce jour, je n’ai plus baissé les yeux
J’ai consacré mon temps à contempler les cieux,
A regarder passer les nues
A guetter les stratus, à lorgner les nimbus
A faire les yeux doux au moindre cumulus
Mais elle n’est pas revenue

Son bonhomme de mari avait tant fait d’affaires
Tant vendu ce soir-là de petits bouts de fer
Qu’il était devenu millionnaire
Et l’avait emmenée vers des cieux toujours bleus
Des pays imbéciles où jamais il ne pleut
Où l’on ne sait rien du tonnerre

Dieu fasse que ma complainte aille, tambour battant
Lui parler de la pluie, lui parler du gros temps
Auxquels on a tenu tête ensemble
Lui conter qu’un certain coup de foudre assassin
Dans le mille de mon cœur a laissé le dessin
D’une petite fleur qui lui ressemble.",L' orage,1996

Quinze ans de malheur
Mon vieux Léon
Que tu es parti
Au paradis
De l’accordéon
Parti bon train
Voir si l’bastrin-
Gue et la java
Avait gardé
Droit de cité
Chez Jéhovah
Quinze ans bientôt
Que musique au dos
Tu t’en allais
Mener le bal
A l’amicale
Des feux follets
En cet asile
Par sainte Cécile
Pardonne-nous
De n’avoir pas
Su faire cas
De ton biniou

C’est une erreur
Mais les joueurs
D’accordéon
Au grand jamais
On ne les met
Au Panthéon
Mon vieux tu as dû
Te contenter du
Champ de navets,
Sans grandes pompes
Et sans pompons
Et sans ave
Mais les copains
Suivaient le sapin
Le cœur serré
En rigolant
Pour faire semblant
De ne pas pleurer
Et dans nos cœurs
Pauvre joueur
D’accordéon
Il fait ma foi
Beaucoup moins froid
Qu’au Panthéon.

Depuis mon vieux
Qu’au fond des cieux
Tu as fait ton trou
Il a coulé
De l’eau sous les
Ponts de chez nous.
Les bons enfants
De la rue de Vanves
A la Gaîté
L’un comme l’autre
Au gré des flots
Furent emportés
Mais aucun d’eux
N’a fait fi de
Son temps jadis
Tous sont restés
Du parti des
Myosotis
Tous ces pierrots
Ont le cœur gros
Mon vieux Léon
En entendant
Le moindre chant
D’accordéon

Quel temps fait-il
Chez les gentils
De l’au-delà
Les musiciens
Ont-ils enfin
Trouvé le la
Et le petit bleu
Est-ce que ça ne le
Rend pas meilleur
D’être servi
Au seins des vignes
Du Seigneur
Si de temps en temps
Une dame d’antan
Se laisse embrasser
Sûrement papa
Que tu regrettes pas
D’être passé
Et si le Bon Dieu
Aime tant soit peu
L’accordéon
Au firmament
Tu te plais sûrement

Renaud,"Salut Michel ça fait une paye
Que je lai pas vu traîner dans mes ruelles

Parait que toi tu marches sur un drôle de chemin
T'as les joues creuses les mains calleuses
Et la démarche un petit peu chaloupeuse
Vraiment tu me terrasses bonjour l'angoisse
Paraît que t'es tombé dans une drôle de crevasse
Paraît que c'est pas tous les jours dimanche

Tu bois quelque chose non t'as pas soif
Y te faut ta dose t'as pas de tune t'es en carafe
Allez prends une bière ça peut pas te faire de mal
C'est en vente libre profites-en c'est pas cher
Au fait tu me dois cent sacs j'en fais pas un sac
Mais tes petites arnaques ras le bol j'en ai ma claque
Pour décrocher tu m'as taxé
Pour descendre sur la côte te refaire une santé
Est-ce qu'elle coûte moins cher à Ville-franche
La blanche

Paraît que ta gonzesse s'est barrée avec ta caisse
Paraît que tu bandais plus pour sa gueule pour ses fesses
Tu veux que je te dise t'étais trop bien pour elle
Comment ça j'ironise mais non je suis pas cruel
Eh ben ma gueule te voilà tout seul
T'as le regard triste comme celui d'un épagneul
T'es vachement speech mais t'as plus rien dans le bide
T'as que la poudre aux yeux et les yeux bien livides
Y a vraiment plus qu'une seule chose qui te branche
C'est la blanche

T'as peut-être raison je te parle comme un vieux con
Mais je suis un vieux con vivant j'ai la gaule je suis content
Toi t'as les boules moi j'ai la frite
C'est pas do Bashung non mon pote c'est do Nietzsche
Toi tu te fais une ligne moi je bois une bibine
Pendant que tu te dopes je fume mes deux paquets le clopes
Chacun son trip chacun son filp
Toi c'est pas souvent que t'as des parties gratuites
Je préfère te laisser tout seul sur ta branche

Allez salut Michel à la prochaine
On se téléphone on se fait une bouffe ça baigne
Eh pi je vais te dire si tu me fais un sourire
Tout ce que je t'ai dit ben je te jure que je le retire
Mais si je croise ton dealer j'y fous dans le cœur
Un coup de surin de la part d'un copain

Renaud,"Ils s'embrassent au mois de janvier
Car une nouvelle année commence
Mais depuis des éternités
L'a pas tellement changé la France
Passent les jours et les semaines
Y'a que le décor qui évolue
La mentalité est la même
Tous des tocards, tous des faux culs

Ils sont pas lourds, en février
À se souvenir de Charonne
Des matraqueurs assermentés
Qui fignolèrent leur besogne
La France est un pays de flics
À tous les coins du rue y'en a cent
Pour faire régner l'ordre public
Ils assassinent impunément

Quand on exécute au mois de mars
De l'autre côté des Pyrénées
Un anarchiste du Pays basque
Pour lui apprendre à se révolter
Ils crient, ils pleurent et ils s'indignent
De cette immonde mise à mort
Mais ils oublient que la guillotine
Chez nous aussi fonctionne encore

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone
C'est pas ce qu'on fait de mieux en ce moment
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône
Je parierai pas qu'il est allemand

On leur a dit, au mois d'avril
À la télé, dans les journaux
De pas se découvrir d'un fil
Que le printemps c'était pour bientôt
Les vieux principes du seizième siècle
Et les vieilles traditions débiles
Ils les appliquent tous à la lettre
Y me font pitié ces imbéciles

Ils se souviennent, au mois de mai
D'un sang qui coula rouge et noir
D'une révolution manquée
Qui faillit renverser l'Histoire
Je me souviens surtout de ces moutons
Effrayés par la Liberté
S'en allant voter par millions
Pour l'ordre et la sécurité

Ils commémorent au mois de juin
Un débarquement de Normandie
Ils pensent au brave soldat ricain
Qu'est venu se faire tuer loin de chez lui
Ils oublient qu'à l'abri des bombes
Les Français criaient ""Vive Pétain""
Qu'ils étaient bien planqués à Londres
Que y'avait pas beaucoup de Jean Moulin

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone
C'est pas la gloire, en vérité
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône
Me dites pas qu'il est portugais

Ils font la fête au mois de juillet
En souvenir d'une révolution
Qui n'a jamais éliminé
La misère et l'exploitation
Ils s'abreuvent de bals populaires
Du feux d'artifice et de flonflons
Ils pensent oublier dans la bière
Qu'ils sont gouvernés comme des pions

Au mois d'août c'est la liberté
Après une longue année d'usine
Ils crient ""Vive les congés payés""
Ils oublient un peu la machine
En Espagne, en Grèce ou en France
Ils vont polluer toutes les plages
Et par leur unique présence
Abîmer tous les paysages

Lorsqu'en septembre on assassine
Un peuple et une liberté
Au cœur de l'Amérique latine
Ils sont pas nombreux à gueuler
Un ambassadeur se ramène
Bras ouverts il est accueilli
Le fascisme c'est la gangrène
À Santiago comme à Paris

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone
C'est vraiment pas une sinécure
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône
Il est français, ça j'en suis sûr

Finies les vendanges en octobre
Le raisin fermente en tonneaux
Ils sont très fiers de leurs vignobles
Leurs ""Côtes-du-Rhône"" et leurs ""Bordeaux""
Ils exportent le sang de la terre
Un peu partout à l'étranger
Leur pinard et leur camembert
C'est leur seule gloire à ces tarés

En Novembre, au salon de l'auto
Ils vont admirer par milliers
Le dernier modèle de chez Peugeot
Qu'ils pourront jamais se payer
La bagnole, la télé, le tiercé
C'est l'opium du peuple de France
Lui supprimer c'est le tuer
C'est une drogue à accoutumance

En décembre c'est l'apothéose
La grande bouffe et les petits cadeaux
Ils sont toujours aussi moroses
Mais y'a de la joie dans les ghettos
La Terre peut s'arrêter de tourner
Ils rateront pas leur réveillon
Moi je voudrais tous les voir crever
Étouffés de dinde aux marrons

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone
On peut pas dire que ça soit bandant
Si le roi des cons perdait son trône
Y'aurait cinquante millions de prétendants",Hexagone,1997
Renaud,"When I have rencontred you
You was a jeune fille au pair
And I put a spell on you
And you roule a pelle to me

Together we go partout
On my mob it was super
It was Friday on my mind
It was a story d'amour

It is not because you are
I love you because I do
C'est pas parce que you are me que I am you

You was really beautiful
In the middle of the foule
Don't let me misunderstood
Don't let me sinon I boude

You are belle and I are beau
You give me all what you have
I say thank you, you are bien brave

It is not because you are
I love you because I do
C'est pas parce que you are me qu'I am you

I wanted marry with you
And make love very beaucoup
To have a max of children
Just like Stone and Charden

But one day that must arrive
Together we disputed
For a stupid story of fric
We decide to divorced

It is not because you are
I love you because I do
C'est pas parce que you are me qu'I am you

You chialed comme une madeleine
Not me, I have my dignité
You tell me, ""You are a sale mec!""
I tell you, ""Poil to the bec!""

That's comme ça that you thank me
To have learning you English?
Eh! That's not you qui m'a appris

Renaud,"Malgré le blouson clouté
Sur mes épaules de velours
J'aimerais bien parfois chanter
Autre chose que la zone

Ma gonzesse, celle que je suis avec
Ma princesse, celle que je suis son mec
Oh oh oh

Faut dire qu'elle mérite bien
Que j'y consacre une chanson

Un peu comme dans les films
Ou y a tous pleins de violons
Quand le héros y meure
Dans les bras d'une infirmière
Qu'est très belle et qui pleure

Et pis elle est balancée
Un peu comme un Mayol
Tu sais bien les statues
Du jardin des Tuileries
Qui hiver comme été
Exhibent leur guibolles
Et se gèlent le cul
Et le reste aussi

Ma gonzesse, celle que je suis avec
Ma princesse, celle que je suis son mec
Oh oh oh

Pis faut dire qu'elle a les yeux
Tellement qui sont beaux
On dirait bien qu'ils sont bleus
On dirait des calots
Parfois quand elle me regarde
J'imagine des tas de choses
Que je réalise plus tard
Quand on se retrouve tout seul

Si tu dis qu'elle est moche
Tu y manques de respect
Je t'allonge une avoine
Ce sera pas du cinoche
Mais si tu dis qu'elle est belle
Comme je suis très jaloux
Je t'éclate la cervelle
Faut rien dire du tout

Ma princesse, celle que je suis son mec
Oh oh oh

J'aimerais bien un c'est jour
Y collé un marmot
Ouais un vrai qui chiale et tout
Et qu'a tout le temps les crocs
Elle aussi elle aimerais ça
Mais c'est pas possible

Y dis qu'on est trop jeune

Alors cessez de rire charmante Elvire
Y a un espèce de chien un vieux loup solitaire
Qui se dirige vers Paris son nom, Gérard Lambert

Lambert c'est un héros alors y peut pas mourir
Avec lui c'est le retour de la grande aventure
Celle qui fait hurler celle qui fait frémir
Dans la nuit dans le vent et dans la froidure

Il est tranquille peinard au volant de sa bagnole
Y s'écoute Capdevielle sur son autoradio
Musicalement il adore surtout les paroles
Quoique des fois y trouve que c'est pas assez intello

A travers l'essuie-glace y en a qu'un qui fonctionne
Y' voit la pluie qui tombe sur le périphérique
L'a raté la sortie le voilà dans le bois du Boulogne
L'est complètement paumé dans ce lieu maléfique

Commence à paniquer et surtout y s'énerve
Il avait un rencart à Paris avec une meuf'
S'il arrive à la bourre il a perdu l'affaire
Y manquerait plus qu'y se fasse arrêter par les keufs

Ça fait maintenant une plombe qu'il se perd dans la nuit
Voilà le brouillard qui tombe c'est normal c'est l'hiver

Enfin un être humain se dit-il en lui même
Je vais demander mon chemin à cette âme en déroute

L'arrête sa Simca mille auprès d'un arbre en bois
Et à pieds dans la nuit sous la pluie qui ne cesse
S'enfonce dans la forêt poursuivant la gonzesse
Car c'en est une c'est sûr son instinct ne le trompe pas

Elle est jeune elle est belle toute vêtue de rouge
Les cheveux ruisselants sur son visage d'ange
Bon sang ce dit Lambert le petit chaperon rouge
Je suis un loup solitaire qu'est que je fais je me la mange

Il imagine déjà dans le panier de la donzelle
Le petit pot de beurre pour grand mère et la galette
Manque de bol elle avait dans son panier de dentelles
Deux pauvres petites madeleines et une demi-baguette

OK tu viens chéri pour toi ça sera dix sacs

Il éclata la tête de cette créature
Et s'en fut dans la nuit vers d'autres aventure",Le Retour de Gérard Lambert,1997

Renaud,"Énervé par la colère
Un beau soir, après la guerre
Je ai balancé ma télé par la fenêtre
Comme je suis un garçon primaire
Je me suis dit ""un militaire
Avec un peu de bol
Se la mange en pleine tête""

Libérés, enfin, mes yeux
On regardé le scaphandrier de l'aquarium
Qui cherche un trésor planqué
Sous les cailloux bariolés

Ont écouté le poisson rouge de l'aquarium
Que était content d'être tout seul
Qui faisait juste un peu la gueule
Ou tout comme

Énervé par un Bon Dieu
Que je trouvais bien trop dangereux
J'ai balancé ma vieille Bible par la fenêtre
Comme je suis un garçon normal
Je me suis dit: ""un cardinal
Avec un peu de bol
Se la mange en pleine tête""

Libéré, enfin, mon âme
Est allée se nicher au fond de l'aquarium
Dans une eau limpide et claire
Loin des centrales nucléaires
Loin des hommes

Énervé par ces gauchos
Devenus des patrons bien gros
J'ai balancé mon journal par la fenêtre
Comme je suis un garçon réglo
J'ai visé le caniveau

A rejoint le scaphandrier de l'aquarium

La loi, pas les bandits?
Pourquoi son vieux l'a déshérité

Feront péter la planète

A inventé la haine, le racisme et la guerre
Et le pouvoir maudit qui corrompt les plus purs
Et amène le sage à cracher sur son frère

Quand la moitié du monde en assassine un tiers

Massacré les baleines, et bâillonné la vie
Exterminé les loups, mis des colliers aux chiens

La liste est bien trop longue de tout ce qui m’écœure
Depuis l'horreur banale du moindre fait divers
Il n'y a plus assez de place dans mon cœur
Pour loger la révolte, le dégoût, la colère

Fatigué, fatigué
Fatigué d'espérer et fatigué de croire
A ces idées brandies comme des étendards
Et pour lesquelles tant d'hommes ont connu l'abattoir
Fatigué, fatigué

Je voudrais être un arbre, boire à l'eau des orages
Pour nourrir la terre, être ami des oiseaux
Et puis avoir la tête si haut dans les nuages
Pour qu'aucun homme ne puisse y planter un drapeau
Je voudrais être un arbre et plonger mes racines
Au cœur de cette terre que j'aime tellement
Et que ces putains d'hommes chaque jour assassinent
Je voudrais le silence enfin et puis le vent

Fatigué, fatigué
Fatigué de haïr et fatigué d'aimer
Surtout ne plus rien dire, ne plus jamais crier
Fatigué des discours, des paroles sacrées

Fatigué, fatigué
Fatigué de sourire, fatigué de pleurer
Fatigué de chercher quelques traces d'amour
Dans l'océan de boue où sombre la pensée

Fatigué, fatigué",Fatigue,1997
Renaud,"Ci-gît au fond de mon cœur une histoire ancienne,
Un fantôme, un souvenir d'une que j'aimais
Le temps, à grands coups de faux, peut faire des siennes,
Mon bel amour dure encore, et c'est à jamais

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En trouvant Margot,
Princesse vêtue de laine,
Déesse en sabots
Si les fleurs, le long des routes,
Se mettaient à marcher,
C'est à la Margot, sans doute,
Qu'elles feraient songer
Je lui ai dit "" De la Madone,
Tu es le portrait !""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne,
C'était un peu vrai
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou.

La mignonne allait aux vêpres
Se mettre à genoux,
Alors j'ai mordu ses lèvres
Pour savoir leur goût
Elle m'a dit, d'un ton sévère
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire,
Les filles c'est comme ça
Je lui ai dit : "" Par la madone,
Reste auprès de moi!""
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
Mais chacun pour soi
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou.

C'était une fille sage,
A ""bouch', que veux tu?""
J'ai croqué dans son corsage
Les fruits défendus
Elle m'a dit d'un ton sévère
""Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?""
Mais elle m'a laissé faire,
Les filles c'est comme ça
Puis j'ai déchiré sa robe,
Sans l'avoir voulu
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
Je n'y tenais plus
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou.

J'ai perdu la tramontane
En perdant Margot,
Qui épousa, contre son âme,
Un triste bigot
Elle doit avoir à l'heure,
A l'heure qu'il est,
Deux ou trois marmots qui pleurent
Pour avoir leur lait
Et, moi, j'ai tété leur mère
Longtemps avant eux
Le Bon Dieu me le pardonne
J'étais amoureux!
Qu'il me le pardonne ou non,
D'ailleurs, je m'en fous,
J'ai déjà mon âme en peine
Je suis un voyou.",Je Suis un Voyou,1997

Font du mal partout

Pourquoi les enfants d'Belfast 
Et d'tous les ghettos
Quand y balancent un caillasse 
On leur fait la peau
J'croyais qu'David et Goliath

Qu'les plus p'tits pouvaient s'débattre 
Sans être les plus morts

Qu'j'veux en donner tout plein

J'veux partager mon Mac-do 
Avec ceux qui ont faim
J'veux donner d'l'amour bien chaud 
À ceux qu'ont plus rien
Est-ce que c'est ça être coco 
Ou être un vrai chrétien
Moi j'me fous de tous ces mots 
J'veux être un vrai humain

Dis, Papa, tous ces discours 
Me font mal aux oreilles
Même ceux qui sont plein d'amour 
C'est kif-kif-pareil
Ça m'fait comme des trous dans la tête 
Ça m'pollue la vie et tout
Ça fait qu'je vois sur ma planète 
Des intifada partout

Renaud,"Elle avait la taille faite au tour,

Une débutante

L'avait le génie,
Mais, sans technique, un don n'est rien

C'est du moins ce qu'on prêche, en latin,
A la Sorbonne

Me sentant rempli de pitié
Pour la donzelle,
Je lui enseignai, de son métier,
Les petites ficelles
Je lui enseignai le moyen du bientôt

En bougeant l'endroit où le dos
Ressemble à la lune

Car, dans l'art de faire le trottoir,
Je le confesse,
Le difficile est du bien savoir

De la même manière,
Pour un droguiste, un sacristain,
Un fonctionnaire

Mes bons offices,

Manœuvres douteuses,

Elle' tomba victime d'une
Maladie honteuse

En fille probe,
Elle me passa la moitié
De ses microbes

Après des injections aiguës
D'antiseptique,
J'abandonnai le métier d'cocu
Systématique
Elle eut beau pousser des sanglots,
Braire à tu'-tête,
Comme je n'étais qu'un salaud,
Je me fis honnête

Sitôt privée de ma tutelle,

Que Guy Bedos avait repris quatre fois
De la viande

Je lui ai dit que moi je fréquentais plus
Les salons
Que j'avais connu Charles Hernu
En prison
Que j'avais bouffé une fois dans un
Ministère
Qu'objectivement c'était meilleur
Chez ma mère

Elle était socialiste
Se méfiait des écologistes
Détestait les communistes
Et les dentistes

Je lui ai dit, Ginette, faut plus me parler
De politique
On va finir par s'engueuler
C'est classique
Comment veux-tu que je sois d'accord
Avec toi
J'ai déjà du mal à être d'accord
Avec moi

Elle m'a dit, je m'appelle pas Ginette
De toutes façons
Je m'appelle Simone, si ça te fait rien
J'ai dit Bon
Pis faut que je m'en aille, faut que je retourne

Renaud,"Il a refermé la porte doucement
Pour pas réveiller ""maman""
Il a jeté l'Huma
Sur le canapé près du chat
S'est assis dans un coin
La tête dans ses mains

Cinquante balais c'est pas vieux
Qu'est-ce qu'y va faire de son bleu?
De sa gamelle, de sa gapette
C'est toute sa vie qu'était dans sa musette?

Y revoit toutes ses années au chagrin
Et tout le cambouis sur ses mains
Y repense à son gars
Qui vouler faire péter tout ça
Ça a pété sans lui
Sans douleur et sans cris

Où c'est que t'as vu un bon Dieu
Qu'est-ce qu'y va faire de son bleu?
De ses bras de travailleur
C'est toute sa vie qu'était dans sa sueur

Pourquoi y repense aujourd'hui au petit
Voilà dix ans qu'il est parti
""Salut pauvre cave
Tu seras toujours un esclave""
Eh ben, tu vois gamin
Aujourd'hui je suis plus rien

Pas fini de se faire des cheveux
Qu'est-ce qu'y va faire de son bleu?
De son drapeau rouge, de son Lénine
C'est toute sa vie qu'était dans sa machine

Y va réveiller ""Maman"" peut-être

Renaud,"L'était bâti comme un moineau
Qu'aurait été malade
À la bouche, derrière son mégot
Y'avait des gros mots en cascades
L'était pas bien gros ce te asticot
Mais c'était une vrai boule de haine
On lui filait plein de noms d'oiseaux
Même ceux qui le connaissaient qu'à peine
L'appelaient la teigne

Il avait pas connu ses vieux
Il était de l'Assistance
Ce genre d'école, pour rendre joyeux
C'est pas vraiment Byzance
D'ailleurs on lisait dans ses yeux
Que pour qu'y soit bien fallait qu'on le craigne
Si tu rentrais pas dans son jeux
Putain! Ce que tu recevais comme beignes
C'était une teigne

Avec les gonzesses, les michetons
L'était encore plus vache
Je te pique tes sous, je te fous des gnons
Tu tombes amoureuses et je m'arrache
Pour sa petite gueule, ses poings de béton
Plus d'une se serait jetée à la Seine
Elles lui parlaient d'amour, de passion
Y répondait pas des châtaignes
C'était une teigne

L'avait pas fêté ses vingt berges
Quand, une nuit de novembre
On l'a retrouvé raide comme un cierge
Pendu au beau milieu de sa chambre
Si y'a un bon Dieu, une Sainte Vierge
Faut qu'ils l'accueillent à leur enseigne
Parce qu'avant d' passer sur l'autre berge
Y m'avait dit personne ne m'aime
Je suis qu'une pauvre teigne

Mais moi qui l'ai connu un peu
Quand parfois j'y repense
Putain! Ce qu'il était malheureux
Putain! Ce qu'y cachait comme souffrance
Sous la pâle blondeur de se frange
Dans ses yeux tristes, dans sa dégaine
Mais je suis sûr qu'au ciel c'est un ange
Et quand je pense à lui mon cœur saigne
Adieu la teigne",La Teigne,1997
Renaud,"Quatorze Avril 77
Dans la banlieue où qui fait nuit
La petite route est déserte
Gérard Lambert rentre chez lui
Dans le lointain les mobylettes poussent des cris
Ca y' est j'ai planté le décor
Créé l' climat de ma chanson
Ca sent la peur ça pue la mort
J'aime bien c' t' ambiance pas vous? ah bon
Voici l'histoire proprement dite
Voici l'intrigue de ma chanson
Gérard Lambert roule très vite
Le vent s'engouffre dans son blouson
Dans le lointain les bourgeois dorment comme des cons
Lorsque soudain survient le drame
Juste à la sortie d'un virage
Y'a plus d'essence dans la bécane
Gérard Lambert est fou de rage

T'aurais pas dû Gérard Lambert
Aller ce soir là à Rungis
T'aurais dû rester chez ta mère
Comme un bon fils

Il met sa mob sur la béquille
S'assied par terre et réfléchit
Dans cette banlieue de bidonvilles
Y'a pas un pompe ouverte la nuit
Dans le lointain y'a une sirène qui s'évanouit
Qu'est ce que j'vais faire bordel de dieu?
J'vais quand même pas rentrer à pied
Plus y s'angoisse moins ça va mieux
Quand soudain lui surgit une idée
J'vais siphonner un litre ou deux
Dans l'réservoir de cette bagnole
Et pis après j'y crève les pneus
Comme ça gratuitement par plaisir
Faut bien que j'me défoule un peu
J'suis énervé
Une fois son forfait accompli
Gérard Lambert va repartir
La mobylette veut rien savoir
C'est le bon Dieu qui l'a puni!

T'aurais pas dû Gérard Lambert
Aller ce soir là à Rungis
T'aurais dû rester chez ta mère
Comme un bon fils

Alors pendant une demi heure
Dans son moteur il tripatouille
Il est crevé il est en sueur
Il a du cambouis jusqu'aux coudes
Dans le lointain le jour se lève
Comme d'habitude
A c'moment là un mec arrive
Un p'tit loubard aux cheveux blonds
Et qui lui dit comme dans les livres
""S'te plaît dessine moi un mouton
Une femme à poil ou un calibre
Un cran d'arrêt une mobylette
Tout c'que tu veux mon pote t'es libre
Mais dessine moi quequ'chose de chouette!
Dans le lointain y s'passe plus rien
Du moins il me semble

Alors d'un coup d'clé à molette
Bien placé entre les deux yeux
Gérard Lambert éclate la tête
Du Petit Prince de mes deux !
Faut pas gonfler Gérard Lambert
Quand y répare sa mobylette
C'est la morale de ma chanson
Moi j'la trouve chouette
Pas vous? ah bon",Les Aventures de Gerard Lambert,2000

Elle a cinquante-cinq ans
Quatre gosses qu'ont mis les bouts
Plus de mari pas d'amant
Et pi quoi des bijoux?
Y'a bien que son poisson rouge
Qui lui cause pas de souci
Encore que y'a des nuits
Quand elle l'entend qui bouge
Elle se lève pour aller le voir

Elle travaille tous les jours
Elle a un super boulot
Sur le parking de Carrefour
Elle ramasse les chariots
Le week-end c'est l'enfer
Quand tous ces parigots
Viennent remplir le coffre arrière
De leur 504 Peugeot
De quinze tonnes de lessive
De monceaux de bidoche
En cas du guerre en cas de crise
Ou du victoire de la gauche
Ce spectacle l’écœure
Alors elle pense à ces gars
Qui sont devenus voleurs
Elle comprend mieux pourquoi

Elle habite quelque part
Dans une banlieue rouge
Mais elle vit nulle part
Y'a jamais rien qui bouge
Y'a que le bleu des mobs qui l'emmène en vacances
Ses histoires d'amour elle les vit dans Confidence

Elle a bien ses petites joie
A défaut du bonheur
Quand elle nourrit ses chats
Quand elle parle à ses fleurs
Chaque semaine au loto
Elle mise dix ou vingt balles
Elle joue son numéro
De sécurité sociale
C'est pas dure c'est pas chère
Mais ça rapporte que dalle
Pi elle écoute la radio
Surtout Michel Drucker
Parce qu'elle le trouve très beau
Et pas du tout vulgaire

Elle habite quelque part
Dans une banlieue rouge
Mais elle vit nulle part
Y'a jamais rien qui bouge
Entre le chien en plâtre sur la télévision
Et les castagnettes sur le mur du salon

Chez elle c'est du lino
Mais faut mettre les patins
Dehors ça tassez crado
Faut que dedans ça soit bien
Ca pue la pisse de chat
Mais ça on y peut rien
Quand t'aime les animaux
Tu t'arrêtes pas à ça

Le braquage a foiré

J'ai une balle dans le ventre
Une autre dans le poumon

Je crève aux Champs Élysées

Je vois la France entière du fond de mes ténèbres
Les charognards sont là la mort ne vient pas seule
J'ai la connerie humaine comme oraison funèbre
Le regard des curieux comme unique linceul

C'est bien fait pour ta gueule
Tu n'es qu'un petit salaud
On ne portera pas le deuil
C'est bien fait pour ta peau

Le boulanger du coin a quitté ses fourneaux
Pour s'en venir cracher sur mon corps déjà froid
Il dit, je suis pas raciste mais quand même les bicots
Chaque fois qu'y a un sale coups ben y faut qu'y z'en soient

Moi Monsieur je vous signale que j'ai fait l'Indo-Chine
Dit un ancien para à quelques arrivistes
Ces mecs c'est de la racaille c'est pire que les vietmines

Tu n'es qu'un petit salaud
On ne portera pas le deuil

Les zonards qui sont là vont se faire lyncher sûrement
Si y continuent à dire que les flics assassinent
Qu'on est un être humain même si on est truand
Et que ma mise à mort n'a rien de légitime

Et s'ils prenaient ta mère comme otage ou ton frère

Et si c'était ton fils qu'était couché par terre

Tu n'es qu'un petit salaud
On ne portera pas le deuil

Et Monsieur blanc cassis continue son délire
Convaincu que déjà mon âme est chez le diable
Que ma mort fût trop douce que je méritais pire
J'espère bien qu'en Enfer je retrouverai ces minables

Je ne suis pas un héros j'ai eu ce que je méritais
Je ne suis pas à plaindre j'ai presque de la chance
Quand je pense à mon pote qui lui n'est que blessé
Y va finir ses jours à l'ombre d'une potence

C'est bien fait pour sa gueule
Ce n'est qu'un petit salaud
On ne portera pas le deuil
C'est bien fait pour sa peau

Elle n'a pas dix-sept ans cette fille qui pleure
En pensant qu'à ses pieds il y a un homme mort
Qu'il soit flic ou truand elle s'en fout sa pudeur
Comme ses quelques larmes me réchauffent le corps

T'as des bottes, mon pote
Elles me bottent

Qu'on crache à la gueule du greffier

Hé, dis-moi Lucien
Où c'est qu'elle est ta bande
Maintenant qu'est-ce que tu glandes
Sans tes copains

Et Pierrot le fou de la bécane
Qu'a eut les deux jambes écrasées
Y l'aurait mieux fait d'y passer
C'est vraiment trop con les platanes
Il bosse toujours à l'atelier
Assis sur un fauteuil roulant
Tu me dis qu'il chiale de temps en temps
Tu vois je m'en serait un peu douté

Hé, dis-moi Lucien
Où c'est qu'elle est ta bande
Maintenant qu'est-ce que tu glandes
Sans tes copains

Je pense pas que t'ai oublié Riton
Qui s'est fait descendre au bistrot
Une balle dans le ventre ah les salauds
Parce qu'il avait cogné le patron
T'as plus nouvelles de Marilyne
Celle qu'est partie pour Ibiza
Doit être en train de crever là-bas
Avec sa petite sister Morphine

Hé, dis-moi Lucien
Où c'est qu'elle est ta bande
Maintenant qu'est-ce que tu glandes
Sans tes copains

Eh toi mon vieux, mon pote Lucien
C'est vrai que t’habite chez ta belle doche
Que t'es marié, que t'as des mioches
Tu travailles pour qu'ils aient du pain
Tu sais j'ai une idée super
On va former une nouvelle bande
Si tu veux c'est toi qui commande
Si vous plaît patron encore une bière

Hé, dis-moi Lucien

Renaud,"Les poings serrés au fond des poches de son blouson
Angelo flippe à mort, il est encore plombé
Il accuse le bon Dieu de la fatalité
Mais, au fond de sa caboche, y se fait pas d'illusions
A force de cartonner, dans tous les azimuts
Des gonzesses qu'on t le cœur planté en haut des cuisses
La rouquine do pressing, des minettes ou des putes
Sûr qu'il a pas fini de s'en choper des choses tristes
Y rêvait d'une gonzesse qu'aurait été qu'à lui
Belle comme un tatouage mais quand même intelligente
Qu'il aurait pu aimer un peu comme un ami
L'a une envie de crever qui lui remonte do bas-ventre

Alors ce soir, à la foire
Avec deux trois lascars
Il ira au baston
Comme le prolo va au charbon
Il ira au baston, au baston
Filera des coups, prendra des gnons
C'est peut-être con, mais tout est con

Les poings serrés au fond des poches de son blouson
Angelo flippe à mort, il est encore viré
C'est le quatrième boulot depuis le début de l'année
Toute façon y serait barré, mais où il est marron
C'est que y s'était promis, avant de décaniller
De se faire le coffre fort dans le bureau do premier
Et la;peau do petit chef qu'a jamais pu le saquer
Passe que y rangeait sa mobe devant le box do patron
Y rêvait d'un travail où faudrait pas pointer
Où tu pourrais aller que quand t'en a envie
Que tu ferais par plaisir, pas pour gagner do blé
Y paraît que ça existe dans la philosophie

Alors ce soir, à la foire
Avec deux trois lascars
Il ira au baston
Comme le prolo va au charbon
Il ira au baston, au baston
Filera des coups, prendra des gnons
C'est peut-être con, mais tout est con

Les poings serrés au fond des poches de son blouson
Angelo flippe à mort en découvrant le chantier
Dans la tourne glacée en haut do pavillon
Où ses parents s'engueulent à longueur de journée
Y trouve plus sous son pieu sa colece de Play-Boy
Sa mère a bazardé sa rouleuse et son herbe
Son connard de petit frère est venu jouer aux cow-boy
Dans sa piaule, c'est le boxon et ça lui fout la gerbe
Y rêvait d'une famille que y faudrait pas subir
Des parents qui seraient pas des flics ou des curés
Pour pas de venir comme eux y voudrait pas vieillir
Et pour jamais vieillir y sait que y doit crever

Alors ce soir au baloche
Avec son manche de pioche
Il ira au baston, au baston
Comme le prolo va au charbon
Il ira au baston, au baston
Filera des coups, prendra des gnons
C'est peut-être con, mais tout est con",Baston !,2001
Renaud,"Elle habitait, Germaine
Une chambre de bonne
Quelque part dans le cinquième
A coté de la Sorbonne
Les WC sur le pallier
Une fenêtre sur la cour
En haut d'un escalier
Qu'avait jamais vu le jour
Et sur les murs sans joie
De ce pauvre boui-boui
Y'avait Che Guevara
Les Pink Floyd et Johnny
Sur le vieille électrophone
Trop souvent détraqué
Elle écoutait les Stones
Et Maxime le Forestier

Germaine, Germaine
Une java ou un tango
C'est du pareil au même
Pour te dire que je t'aime
Qu'importe le tempo
Germaine, Germaine
Un rock 'n' roll ou un slow
C'est du pareil au même
Pour te dire que je t'aime
Et que je t'ai dans la peau

Ça sentait bon chez elle
L'herbe et le patchoulis
Le parfum des poubelles
Au petit matin gris
On buvait de la bière
Et du thé au jasmin
Assis en rond parterre
Sur un tapis indien
Les voisins du dessous
Étaient bien sympathiques
Quand on fesait trop les fous
Ils se plaignaient qu'aux flics
Enfin bref chez Germaine
C'était vraiment Byzance
Tous les jours de la semaine
On était en vacances

Germaine, Germaine
Une java ou un tango
C'est du pareil au même
Pour te dire que je t'aime
Qu'importe le tempo (oh oh)
Germaine, Germaine
Un rock 'n' roll ou un slow
C'est du pareil au même
Pour te dire que je t'aime
Et que je t'ai dans la peau (poil au dos)

Mais quand elle est partie
Un jour pour Katmandou
Moi je vous jure les amis
Ça m'a fichu un coup
Sur la place Saint Michel
Où elle traînait parfois
On parle encore d'elle
Des sanglots dans la voix
Moi j'ai repris sa piaule
Mais c'est plus comme avant
C'est même plus vraiment
Drôle elle me manque souvent
Mais son électrophone
Elle me l'a laissée
Comme ses disques des Stones
Et de Maxime le Forestier

Germaine, Germaine
Une java ou un tango
C'est du pareil au même
Pour te dire que je t'aime
Et que j'aime la Kanterbraü

Renaud,"C'était un gringalet
Pas vraiment laid
Mais il était
Né à Paname
Tous ceux qui le connaissaient
Y disaient
Qu'y savait
Causer aux dames

C'était pas un tocard
Un ringuard
Un traîne-boulevard
On l'appelait l'Saint-Bernard
Le Mozart
Du pont des Arts

C'était pas un dragueur
Un flambeur
De fin de semaine
Il amenait nos petites sœurs
Un quart d'heure
Sur le bord de la Seine

Il avait pas eu de père
Pas eu de mère
Ni d'anniversaire
Il était né un soir
Rue Rochechouart
Près d'une poubelle

Il avait pas eu de chance
Ni de vacances
Dans son enfance
Mais quand fallait de l'ambiance
Sa seule présence
C'était Byzance

C'était un bon copain
Y méritait bien
Cette chansonnette
Car il est mort de faim
Un beau matin
Rue de la Roquette

Cette chanson se termine
Ça me déprime
C'est pas humain
Moi j'aime pas les chansons
Où les héros
Y meurent à la fin",Le Gringalet,2001
Renaud,"Ça f'sait douze bières que j'menfilais
Faut dire qu'on était samedi soir
J'étais tranquillement écroulé
D'vant ma télé sur mon plumard
Y'avait Jean-Pierre El Kavada

Et la Pologne et le Liban
Le Salvador y connaît pas

T'en as pas marre de ces marioles
T'en as pas marre d'leurs tronches de rats
J'lui réponds j'en ai rien à foutre
Mais j'veux pas rater télé-foot

Cette soirée s'annonçait super
J'me suis enfilé une bibine
Pour l'numéro un Mick Jagger
Avec Dylan et Bruce Springsteen
J'avais pas bien lu manque de bol
C'est l'numéro un Becassine
Avec une turlutte à Guignol
Une main au cul à Colombine
Si ça fait marrer vos lardons
Moi ça m'a carrement gonflé
S'en est fallu d'peu nom de nom
Qu'j'balance ma bière dans la télé

T'en as pas marre d'leurs tronches de rats
J'lui réponds j'en ai rien à foutre
Mais j'veux pas rater télé-foot

Après j'me suis r'gardé Dallas
Ce feuilleton pourri dégueulasse
Ça fait frémir le populo
De voir tous ces enfants d'salauds
Ces ricains véreux pleins aux as
Faire l'apologie du pognon
De l'ordurerie et de la crasse
Y nous prennent vraiment pour des cons
Eh maint'nant qu'on est socialistes
Fini les feuilletons américains
On veut des feuilletons soviétiques
Et même des belges y en a des biens
Y'en a un c'est l'histoire d'une frite
Qu'est amoureuse d'un communiste

V'la ma gonzesse qu'entre dans ma piaule

Alors elle m'dit au lieu d't'aliéner
Avec cette télé à la con
T'entends pas qu'ta gosse s'est réveillé
Va lui faire chauffer son biberon
Pi si c'est pas trop te d'mander
Faudra qu'tu changes la caisse du chat
Grouille-toi sinon tu vas rater
Pierre Cangioni et Stopyra
En arrivant dans la cuisine
J'me suis dit tiens un p'tit Ricard
Mais après mes quatorze bibines
J'étais un p'tit peu dans l'coltard
J'ai bu un grand verre de Blédine
J'me suis vautré dans la caisse du chat

Et dans l'biberon d'ma gamine

Renaud,"Moi j'aime bien chanter la racaille
La mauvaise herbe des bas-quartiers
Les mauvais garçons, la canaille
Ceux qui sont nés sur le pavé

Mais celle que je vais vous raconter
Elle fait même pleurer ma guitare

Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
C'est la java d'un petit gars
Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
La java d'un petit gars qu'était sans foi ni loi

Sa mère l'avait eu un beau soir
Alors qu'elle s'y attendait pas
Il est né près des grands boulevards
Sur le pavé humide et froid
Il a jamais su le nom de son père
Puisque sa vieille vingt fois par jour
Pour dix sacs s'envoyait en l'air
Dans un boxon de la rue du Four

Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
C'est la java d'un petit gars
Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
La java d'un petit gars qu'était sans foi ni loi

Après avoir quitté l'école
Où qu'y s'est pas trop attardé
Il s'est mis dans la cambriole
Avec ses copains de Saint-Mandé
Il a voyouté quelque temps
Avec Dédé-le-Surineur
Avec Julot-d'Ménilmontant
Et toute la bande du Sacré-Cœur

Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
C'est la java d'un petit gars
Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
La java d'un petit gars qu'était sans foi ni loi

Il commençait à se faire un nom
Et dans les petits bals musette
Lorsque jouait l'accordéon
On voyait tourner sa casquette
Il butta son premier larron
Alors qu'il avait pas vingt ans
Le crime c'était sa vocation
L'arnaque c'était son tempérament

Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
C'est la java d'un petit gars
Écoutez-la, ma java sans joie
La java d'un petit gars qu'était sans foi ni loi

Dans le quartier où il fessait son beurre
Y a des gens qui l'appelaient Monsieur
Mais les flics ces petits fouineurs
Ne le quittaient jamais des yeux
Quand il a eu un peu trop de sang
Sur ses doigts couverts de bijoux
Ils l'ont ficelé sur du bois blanc
Et ils lui ont tranché le cou

Qui traînait jamais les bistrots

Celui qui nous rend vraiment fou

J'ai construit ta planète
Au fond de mon cerveau

Pierrot, mon gosse, mon frangin, mon poteau
Mon copain tu me tiens chaud
Pierrot

Depuis le temps que je te rêve
Depuis le temps que je t'invente
De pas te voir j'en crève
Et je te sens dans mon ventre
Le jour où tu ramène
J'arrête de boire: promis
Au moins toute une semaine
Ce sera dur, mais tant pis

Pierrot, mon gosse, mon frangin, mon poteau
Mon copain tu me tiens chaud
Pierrot

Que tu sois fils de princesse
Ou que tu sois fils de rien
Tu seras fils de tendresse
Tu seras pas pas orphelin
Mais je connais pas ta mère
Je la cherche en vain
Je connais que la misère
D'être tout seul sur le chemin

Pierrot, mon gosse, mon frangin, mon poteau
Mon copain tu me tiens chaud
Pierrot

Dans un coin de ma tête
Y'a déjà ton trousseau
Un jean, une mobylette
Une paire de Santiago
Tu iras pas à l'école
Je t'apprendrai les gros mots
On jouera au football
On ira au bistrot

Pierrot, mon gosse, mon frangin, mon poteau
Mon copain tu me tiens chaud
Pierrot

Tu te laveras pas les pognes
Avant de venir à table
Et tu me traiteras d'ivrogne
Quand je piquerai ton cartable
Je t'apprendrai des chansons
Tu les trouveras débiles
T'auras peut-être bien raison
Mais je serai vexé quand même

Pierrot, mon gosse, mon frangin, mon poteau
Mon copain tu me tiens chaud
Pierrot

Allez viens mon Pierrot
Tu seras le chef de ma bande
Je te refilerai mon couteau
Je t'apprendrai la truande
Allez viens mon copain
Je t'ai trouvé une maman
Tous les trois ça sera bien
Allez viens, je t'attends

Pierrot, mon gosse, mon frangin, mon poteau
Mon copain tu me tiens chaud

Renaud,"J'étais tranquille j'étais peinard
Accoudé au flipper
Le type est entré dans le bar
A commandé un jambon beurre
Et y s'est approché de moi
Et y m'a regardé comme ça

T'as des bottes, mon pote
Elles me bottent
Je parie que c'est des santiags
Viens faire un tour dans le terrain vague
Je vais t'apprendre un jeu rigolo
A grands coups de chaînes de vélo
Je te fais tes bottes à la baston

Moi je lui dis, laisse béton

Y m'a filé une beigne
Je lui ai filé une torgnole
Y m'a filé une châtaigne
Je lui ai filé mes grolles

J'étais tranquille j'étais pénard
Accoudé au comptoir
Le type est entré dans le bar
A commandé un café noir
Pis y m'a tapé sur l'épaule
Et m'a regardé d'un air drôle

T'as un blouson, mecton
L'est pas bidon
Moi je me les gèle sur mon scooter
Avec ça je serai un vrai rocker
Viens faire un tour dans la ruelle
Je te montrerai mon Opinel
Je te chouraverai ton blouson

Moi je lui dis, laisse béton

Y m'a filé une beigne
Je lui ai filé un marron
Y m'a filé une châtaigne
Je lui ai filé mon blouson

J'étais tranquille j'étais pénard
Je réparais ma mobylette
Le type a surgi sur le boulevard
Sur sa grosse moto super chouette
S'est arrêté le long du trottoir
Et m'a regardé d'un air bête

T'as le même blue jean que James Dean
T'arrêtes ta frime
Je parie que c'est un vrai Lévis Strauss
Il est carrément pas craignos
Viens faire un tour derrière l'église
Histoire que je te dévalise
A grands coups de ceinturon

Moi je lui dis, laisse béton

Y m'a filé une beigne
Je lui ai filé une mandale
Y m'a filé une châtaigne
Je lui ai filé mon futal

La morale de c'te pauvre histoire
C'est que quand t'es tranquille et peinard
Faut pas trop traîner dans les bars
A moins d'être fringuer en costard
Quand à la fin d'une chanson
Tu te retrouve à poil sans tes bottes
Faut avoir de l'imagination
Pour trouver une chute rigolote.",Laisse-Béton,2001
Renaud,"Y venait du pays où habite la pluie
Où quand y a du soleil c'est un mauvais présage
C'est qui va pleuvoir, c'est qui va faire gris
Il était chtimi jusqu'au bout des nuages

L'a connu l'école que jusqu'à treize ans
Après c'est la mine qui lui a fait la peau
Vingt au charbon, c'est un peu minant
Pour goûter de l'usine y s'est fait parigot

Dans son bleu de travail y me faisait rêver
Faut dire que j'étais jeune, je savais pas encore
Je pensais que le turbin c'était un bienfait
Bienfait pour ma gueule, surtout c'est la mort

L'avait fait 36, le Front populaire
Pis deux ou trois guerres, pis Mai 68
Li avait la haine pour les militaires
Je te raconte même ce qui pensait des flics

Il était marxiste tendance Pif le chien
Syndiqué à mort, inscrit au parti
Nous traitait de fainéant, moi et mes frangins
Parce qu'on était anars tendance patchouli

Il était balaise fort comme un grand frère
Les épaules plus larges que sa tête de lit
Moi qui suis musclé comme un serpillière
Ben, de ce coté-là je tiens pas beaucoup de lui

L'avait sur le bras gauche un super tatouage
Avec un croissant de lune et une fleur coupée
La couleur s'était barrée avec l'âge
Il avait le bleu pâle d'un jean délavé

Quand j'allais chez lui des fois de temps en temps
Je lui roulait ses clopes avec son tabac gris
Pis je restais des heures avec des yeux tout grands
À l'écouter me baratiner sa vie

Vers soixante-cinq ans, on lui a dit, bonhomme
T'as assez bossé, repose-toi enfin

L'a quitté Paname et la rue de Charonne
Pour une petite baraque avec un bout de jardin

L'a usé ses reins, a cassé la terre
Pour planter trois pauvres salades, trois carottes
Y regrettait ses potes du boulevard Voltaire
Le bistrot, l'apéro et les parties de belote

Il est pas parti, comme disent les poètes
Y s'est pas envolé, comme disent les curés
Un matin de décembre d'un cancer tout bête
L'a cassé sa pipe, il a calanché

Y venait du pays où habite la pluie
Où quand y a du soleil c'est un mauvais présage
C'est qui va pleuvoir, c'est qui va faire gris

Il était chtimi jusqu'au bout des nuages
Il était chtimi jusqu'au bout des nuages",Oscar,2001
Renaud,"J' veux qu' mes chansons soient des caresses,
Ou bien des coups d' poings dans la gueule.
A qui qu' ce soit que je m'agresse,
J' veux vous remuer dans vos fauteuils.
Alors écoutez moi un peu,
Les pousse-mégots et les nez-d'boeux,
Les ringards, les folkeux, les journaleux.
Depuis qu'y' a mon nom dans vos journaux,
Qu'on voit ma tronche à la télé,
Où j' vends ma soupe empoisonnée,
Vous m'avez un peu trop gonflé.
J' suis pas chanteur pour mes copains,
Et j' peux être teigneux comme un chien.
J' déclare pas, avec Aragon,
Qu' le poète a toujours raison.
La femme est l'avenir des cons,
Et l'homme n'est l'avenir de rien.

Moi, mon av'nir est sur zinc
D'un bistrot des plus cradingues,
Mais bordel, où c'est qu' j'ai mis mon flingue?

J' vais pas m' laisser emboucaner
Par les fachos, pas les gauchos,
Tous ces pauvr' mecs endoctrinés
Qui foutent ma révolte au tombeau.
Tous ceux qui m' traitent de démago
Dans leur torchons qu' j' lirais jamais
""Renaud, c'est mort, il est récupéré""
Tous ces p'tits bourgeois incurables
Qui parlent pas, qu'écrivent pas, qui bavent,
Qui vivront vieux leur vie d' minables,
Ont tous dans la bouche un cadavre.
Toute façon, je chante pas pour ces blaireaux,
Et j'ai pas dit mon dernier mot.
C'est sûr'ment pas un disque d'or,
Ou un Olympia à moi tout seul,
Qui me feront virer de bord,
Qui me feront fermer ma gueule.

Tant qu'y' aura d' al haine dans mes s'ringues,
Je ne chant'rai que pour les dingues,
Mais bordel, ! Où c'est qu' j'ai mis mon flingue?

Y'a pas qu' les mômes, dans la rue,
Qui m' collent au cul pour une photo,
Y'a même des flics qui me saluent,
Qui veulent que j' signe dans leurs calots.
Moi j' crache dedans, et j' cris bien haut
Qu' le bleu marine me fait gerber,
Qu' j'aime pas l' travail, la justice et l'armée.
C'est pas demain qu'on m' verra marcher
Avec les connards qui vont aux urnes,
Choisir celui qui les fera crever.
Moi, ces jours là, j' reste dans ma turne.
Rien à foutre de la lutte de crasse,
Tous les systèmes sont dégueulasses!
J' peux pas encaisser les drapeaux,
Quoi que le noir soir le plus beau.
La marseillaise, même en reggae,
Ça m'a toujours fait dégueuler.

Les marches militaires, ça m' déglingue
Et votre République, moi j' la tringle,
Mais bordel! Où c'est qu' j'ai mis mon flingue?

Depuis qu'on m'a tiré mon canif,
Un soir au métro Saint Michel,
J' fous plus les pieds dans une manif
Sans un nunchak' ou un cocktail
A Longwy comme à Saint Lazare,
Plus de slogans face aux flicards,
Mais des fusils, des pavés, des grenades!
Gueuler contre la répression
En défilant ""Bastille-Nation""
Quand mes frangins crèvent en prison
Ça donne une bonne conscience aux cons,
Aux nez-de boeux et aux pousse-mégots
Qui foutent ma révolte au tombeau.

Si un jour j' me retrouve par terre,
Sûr qu' ça sera d' la faute à Baader.
Si j' crève le nez dans le ruisseau,
Sûr qu' ça sera d' la faute à Bonnot.

Pour l'instant, ma gueule est sur le zinc
D'un bistrot des plus cradingues,
Mais faites gaffe!

J'ai marché sur bien des routes, j'ai connu bien des patelins
Partout on vit dans le doute, partout on attend la fin

J'ai connu l'absurdité de ta morale et de tes lois

J'ai chanté dix fois, cent fois
J'ai hurlé pendant des mois
J'ai crié sur tous les toits
Ce que je pensais de toi
Société, société
Tu m'auras pas

Demain, prends garde à ta peau, à ton fric, à ton boulot
Car la vérité vaincra, La Commune refleurira
Mais en attendant, je chante et je te crache à la gueule
Cette petite chanson méchante que t'écoutes dans ton fauteuil

Renaud,"J'ai voulu planter un oranger
Là où la chanson n'en verra jamais
Là où les arbres n'ont jamais donné
Que des grenades dégoupillées

Sur mon bateau j'ai navigué
J'ai dit aux hommes qui se battaient
Je viens planter un oranger

Et la musique nous ferons chanter

Et puis le temps qu'elle est pas niquée,
Elle rêve d'un grand amour exotique
Elle a pris un cache-col, un chandail,
Sa robe jaune un petit peu déchirée
Un poisson surgelé, des tenailles,
Sa valise en carton va craquer
Elle est quand même heureuse d'être contente

Elle a pris une leçon d' planche à voile,

Et tout le pétrole du Finistère
A fini dans ses grands cheveux mous
Elle est allée s' doucher au camping,
Pis elle a commencé à flipper
A cause des marques blanches sous son string
Pis du reste de sa peau toute brûlée
Elle est quand même furieuse d'être en colère,
Y a moins d' risque avec le nucléaire

Elle se oint, elle s'enduit, elle s' pommade
De monoï et de crème nivéa
Elle veut pas qu' son petit corps se dégrade
Car ce soir elle va au Macumba
Une giclée d'opium pour sentir bon
Sur la nuque et pis derrière les bras
Un coup d' brosse pour refaire son chignon,
Elle est prête à tomber Travolta
Elle hésite la robe jaune ou l'écossaise,
Les collants, les chaussettes ou les bas
Qu'est c' qui sera l' plus pratique si elle baise
Qu'est c' qui fera flipper les autres nanas
Elle est quand même étonnée d'être surprise
Devant la contenance de sa valise
Finalement elle se fringue en pépette,
En madone des machines agricoles
Au bout d' cinq heures elle est enfin prête
Mais la boite est fermée manque de bol
Alors elle va s' manger une pizza
Au jambon et au centre commercial
Et elle sanglote en pensant à moi,
Ce qui est complètement immoral
Un troufion qui arrosait la quille
Vient lui faire un compliment grotesque
Genre vous êtes belle comme quelque chose qui brille
Elle en tombe amoureuse aussi sec
Elle est quand même déçue d'être triste
D' pas tomber sur un parachutiste

Y se font dévorer par les moustiques
Toute la nuit sous la tente sur la plage
Au matin y' s' font un petit pique-nique
Un sandwich au fourmis et fromage
Alors avec un bâton en bois
Y s'écrivent leur prénom sur le sable
Elle dessine un cœur et lui un foie
Pis y regardent l'horizon lamentable
Elle va lui chercher des cigarettes
Au village dix bornes à pied c'est long
Quand elle revient lui il a fait baskets
En lui gaulant sa valise en carton
Dedans y' avait ses robes et ses sous,
Ses papiers, des tenailles, un poisson
Ses vacances sont foutues pour de bon,

Renaud,"Bon, d'accord, j'ai triché

Bon, d'accord, elle est bonne et je vois pas
Ce qu'elle te donne de plus que moi
Des semaines que tu me délaisses pour une histoire de fesses
Je te crois pas
Fait gaffe que l'amitié se laisse pas enterrer par cette peste
Qu'est jalouse comme un pou, qui me connaît pas du tout et qui me déteste

Mais si t'es mon pote t'avoues que c'est un peu la crainte
C'est pas franchement une femme, c'est pas Christine Okrent
Pis elle a l'intellect plutôt près de la moquette
Si t'es mon pote, tu jettes

Bon, d'accord, je suis taré
Frimeur comme une voiture de pompiers
C'est que j'ai été bercé
Un peu trop près du mur, tout bébé
Mais faut tout me pardonner parce que demain je peux crever, c'est la vie
Jamais tu t'en remettrais et qu'est ce qui te resterais comme ami
Mais si t'es mon pote, tu meurs un peu avant moi

Je te promets que toutes les semaines t'auras des chrysanthèmes
Mais tant que je suis là, n'oublie pas que je t'aime

Et les vrais roudoudous qui nous coupaient les lèvres
Et nous niquaient les dents

A m'asseoir sur un banc cinq minutes avec toi
Et regarder le soleil qui s'en va
Te parler du bon temps qui est mort et je m'en fou
Te dire que les méchants c'est pas nous
Que si moi je suis barge, ce n'est que de tes yeux
Car ils ont l'avantage d'être deux
Et entendre ton rire s'envoler aussi haut
Que s'envolent les cris des oiseaux

Sur le marbre du bénitier

Devant l'autel immaculé
Peur que je ne lève la patte
Quelque part dans les allées
Où siège cette foule ingrate
Qui nous parle d'humanité
Ils ont considéré peut-être
Que c'est un amour pas très catholique
Que celui d'un chien pour son maître
Alors, ils m'ont privé de cantiques

Un jour pourtant je le sais bien
Dieu reconnaîtra les chiens

Me voilà devant la chapelle
Sous cette pluie qui m'indiffère
Tenu en laisse par un fidèle
Allergique aux lieux de prières
Les gens parlent à côté de moi
Tu as de la chance toi au moins
La souffrance ne t'atteint pas
L'émotion c'est pour les humains
Et dire que ça se veut chrétien
Et ça ne comprend même pas
Que l'amour dans le cœur d'un chien
C'est le plus grand amour qu'il soit

Être bourré de coups de pieds
Manger beaucoup moins que mon dû

De temps en temps d'un bout de pain

Aimera un homme comme moi

Il a chanté
L'a battu pendant vingt ans
Pour un amour à présent
Envolé
Il a eu plus que d'aucuns
Du bonheur au quotidien

Il a pleuré en silence

En compagnie de ceux qui peuplent ma mémoire

Les jours de vague à l’âme ou les soirs de déprime
Près de quelques artistes amoureux de la rime
Je vide deux trois verres en parlant de peinture
D’amour, de chansonnettes et de littérature

Il y a là, bien sûr, des poètes, le Prince
Tirant sur sa bouffarde, l’ami Georges Brassens
Il y a Brel aussi et Léo l’anarchiste
Je revis, avec eux une célèbre affiche

Trenet vient nous chanter une Folle Complainte
Cependant que Verlaine et Rimbaud, à l’absinthe
Se ruinent doucement en évoquant Villon
Qui rôde près du bar et des mauvais garçons

L’ami René Fallet me parle de ses touches
Qui me font frissonner quand il pêche à la mouche
Et du vin et des femmes et surtout des copains
Qui font la vie plus belle, le désespoir plus loin

Il y a Boris Vian, Maupassant et Bruant
Écoutant les histoires d’un Coluche hilarant
Je m’assois avec eux pour quelques libations
Entouré de Desproges et Reiser et Tonton

Nous rigolons des cons avec Frédéric Dard
Souvenirs de prison avec le vieux Boudard
Audiard et puis Pagnol s’allument au Pernod
Je lève mon verre à Robert Doisneau

Gainsbourg est au piano, jouant sa Javanaise
Et nous chante l’amour qu’il appelle la baise
Dewaere est là aussi dans un coin, et il trinque
Avec Bernard Dimey, avec Bobby Lapointe

Assis autour du poêle il y a Jacques Rigaut
Franquin, Jean-Pierre Chabrol, Prévert et son mégot
Nous parlons de suicide Maurice Ronet arrive

Renaud,"Ben tu vois
Même moi
J'ai craqué
J'ai glissé
Quelquefois
Qu'est-ce tu crois?
Que je suis en bois?
Que ces pisseuses
Aguicheuses
Me laissent froid?
Même moi
Qu'est-ce tu crois?
Que je suis un ange?
Que ça me démange
Pas un peu?
Déteste-moi
Mon amour
J'aimerai ça
Pas toujours
Mais un peu

Mais me jette pas
Je suis consigné chez toi
Me jette pas
Ou jette-toi avec moi

Tu remarqueras
Que j'ai pas nié
Pris la main
Dans le panier
J'ai avoué
J'ai pas dit
C'est pas moi
Cette fille je la
Connais pas
Je la connais
Après tout
Tu t'en fous
Tu savais
Que la vie est
Dégueulasse
Que l'amour
Dure toujours
Et que c'est là
Qu'est parfois
L'angoisse

Mais me jette pas
N'existe pas sans moi
Me jette pas
Ou jette-toi avec moi

T'as raison
Les hommes sont
Des salauds
Des pas beaux
C'est pour ça
Que je préfère
Les nanas
Je les préfère
Un peu trop
Quelquefois
Tu me dis que toi
Ce que t'aimes pas
C'est le mensonge
Que ça te ronge
Et que tu meurs
Moi c'est la
Vérité
Que je trouve triste
À pleurer
Et je pleure

Mais me jette pas
Je me ferai tout petit, tout plat
Me jette pas
Ou jette-toi avec moi

Y'a pas d'ange
Sur cette terre
À part dans
Les cimetières
Les églises
Y'a que des types
Comme il faut
Avec leur bite
Leur couteau
Sous la chemise
Je suis qu'un mec
Fais avec
Mais fais pas
Comme moi
Mon amour
Où à peine
Pour te venger
Mais sans haine
Sans regret
Sans amour

Mais me jette pas
Moi non plus je m'aime pas
Me jette pas
Ou jette-toi avec moi",Me Jette Pas,2004
Renaud,"Femmes du monde ou bien putains qui, bien souvent, êtes les mêmes 
Femmes normales, stars ou boudins
Femelles en tout genre, je vous aime

Même à la dernière des connes
Je veux dédier ces quelques vers
Issus de mon dégoût des hommes
Et de leur morale guerrière

Car aucune femme sur la planète
Ne sera jamais plus con que son frère
Ni plus fière ni plus malhonnête
À part peut-être, Madame Thatcher

Femme je t'aime parce que
Lorsque le sport devient la guerre
Y'a pas de gonzesses, ou si peu
Dans les hordes des supporters

Ces fanatiques fous furieux
Abreuvés de haine et de bière
Défiant les crétins en bleu
Insultant les salauds en vert

Y'a pas de gonzesses hooligans
Imbéciles et meurtrières
Y'en a pas, même en Grande-Bretagne
À part, bien sûr, Madame Thatcher

Femme, je t'aime parce que
Une bagnole entre les pognes
Tu ne deviens pas aussi con qu'eux
Ces pauvres tarés qui se cognent

Pour un phare un peu amoché
Ou pour un doigt tendu bien haut
Y'en a qui vont jusqu'à flinguer
Pour sauver leur auto-radio

Le bras d'honneur de ces cons-là
Aucune femme n’est assez vulgaire
Pour l'employer à tour de bras
À part, peut-être, Madame Thatcher

Femme je t'aime parce que 
Tu vas pas mourir à la guerre
Parce que la vue d'une arme à feu
Fait pas frissonner tes ovaires

Parce que dans les ranges des chasseurs
Qui dégomment la tourterelle
Et occasionnellement les beurs
J’ai jamais vu une femelle

Pas une femme n'est assez minable
Pour astiquer un revolver
Et se sentir invulnérable
À part, bien sûr, Madame Thatcher

C'est pas un cerveau féminin
Qu'est sortie la bombe atomique
Et pas une femme n'a sur les mains
Le sang des Indiens d’Amérique

Palestiniens et Arméniens
Témoignent du fond de leurs tombeaux
Qu'un génocide c'est masculin
Comme un SS, un torero

Dans cette putain d'humanité
Les assassins sont tous des frères
Pas une femme pour rivaliser
À part peut-être, Madame Thatcher

Femme je t'aime, surtout, enfin pour ta faiblesse et pour tes yeux
Quand la force de l'homme ne tient
Que dans son flingue ou dans sa queue

Et quand viendra l'heure dernière
L'enfer sera peuplé de crétins
Jouant au foot ou à la guerre
À celui qui pisse le plus loin

Moi je me changerai en chien
Si je peux rester la Terre
Et comme réverbère quotidien
Je m'offrirai Madame Thatcher",Miss Maggie,2004
Renaud,"Question d'histoire d'abord
Où est la Palestine?
Sous quelle botte étoilée?
Derrière quels barbelés?
Sous quel champ de ruines?

Question d'histoire encore:
Combien de victimes
Combien de milliers d'enfants
Dans les décombres des camps
Deviendront combattants?

J'en sais rien, je donne ma langue au chagrin
Si tu sais, toi, souffle-moi

Question de géographie
Où est la Kanaky?
Combien de flics, de soldats
Pour tenir Nouméa
Pour flinguer Eloi?

Combien de petits blancs
De colons arrogants
Se partagent la terre?
Et combien de misère
Pour le peuple kanak?
Combien de coups de matraque?

J'en sais rien, je donne ma langue au chagrin
Si tu sais, toi, souffle-moi

Question de sport
Qui détiendra le record
Et restera vivant
Libre et innocent
Derrière les barreaux?
Vingt ans pour Otelo
Autant pour Mandela
Et combien de hors-la-loi
Chez ces petits juges en bois
Dont on fait les salauds

J'en sais rien, je donne ma langue ay chagrin
Si tu sais, toi, souffle-moi

Question science et nature
Où balancer ces ordures?
Allez, à la Vologne!
Ces chiens qui assassinent
Ces rats qui emprisonnent!

Question de littérature
Qui a écrit que les hommes
Naissaient libres, égaux?
Libres mais dans le troupeau
Égaux devant les bourreaux?

J'en sais rien, je donne ma langue au chagrin
Si tu sais, toi, souffle-moi

Renaud,"Nous étions trois jeunes matelots
Trois beaux marins grands et costauds
Embarqués un jour à Toulon
Sans uniformes et sans galons
Sur le porte-avions Clémenceau

Nous étions trois jeunes militaires
Pas trop amoureux de la guerre
Mais nous voulions bien nous faire tondre
En échange d'un tour du monde
Sur un joli bateau en fer

Le premier de ces matelots
Était Breton jusqu'au mégot
Mais il était con comme un manche
Comme un déjeuner du dimanche
Comme un article du Figaro

L'avait grandi au bord de l'eau
Mais n'en avait jamais bu trop
À quinze ans pour une donzelle
Il a déserté La Rochelle
Pour les remparts de Saint-Malo

Rue de la Soif on le vit beau
À écumer tous les tripots
Et lorsque s'en venait l'aurore
Roulait de babord à tribord
Et s'échouait dans le ruisseau

Voulut partir sur un bateau
Goûter un peu de sirocco
En pensant avec raison
Que l'océan rendait moins con
Mais pour lui y'avait du boulot

Dieu qu'elle est belle
L'histoire des trois matelots
Presque aussi belle
Que l'pont du Clémenceau

Le deuxième de ces matelots
Était corse dans toute sa peau
Il était méchant comme la tourmente
Vicieux comme une déferlante
Comme un article de Jean Cau

L'avait grandi au bord de l'eau
Mais n'en buvait que dans l'Pernod
À quinze ans par un légionnaire
S'est fait tailler une boutonnière
Près d'la citadelle d'Ajaccio

L'est devenu un vrai salaud
S'est fait tatouer les biscottos
Entre le prénom de sa mère
Des loups des serpents des panthères
Et le Christ au milieu du dos

Voulut partir sur un bateau
Pour ne jamais vivre comme un veau
Et pour faire voyager sa haine
De cette putain de race humaine
Peuplée de rats et de blaireaux

Dieu qu'elle est longue
L'histoire des trois matelots
Presque aussi longue
Que l'pont du Clémenceau

Le dernier de ces matelots
C'était moi, j'étais Parigot
J'étais bon comme la romaine
Rusé malin comme une hyène
Musclé comme un flan aux pruneaux

J'avais grandi très loin de l'eau
J'en buvais autant qu'un moineau
À quinze ans j'ai quitté Paname
Pour chasser d'mon cœur une femme
Qui voulait y faire son berceau

J'ai bourlingué comme un clodo
J'ai rencontré des écolos
Qui m'ont dit: va voir les baleines
Qui vivent dans les eaux lointaines
Tu verras que ce monde est beau

Voulus partir sur un bateau
Pour voir la terre d'un peu plus haut
Doubler l'Cap Horn dans les deux sens
Et voyager de Recouvrance
Jusqu'aux bordels de Macao

Dieu qu'elle est dure
L'histoire des trois matelots
Presque aussi dure
Que l'pont du Clémenceau

Le premier de ces matelots
Qui était con comme un drapeau
Il a fini plein de galons
Plein de sardines sur son veston
Et plein de merde sous son calot

Le deuxième de ces matelots
Qui était méchant comme un corbeau
Il a fini dans une vitrine
Au ministère de la Marine
Petit chef derrière un bureau

Le premier de ces matelots
S'est fait virer de son bateau
Pour avoir offert son pompon
À une trop jolie Ninon
Contre un baiser sucré et chaud

Si votre enfant est un salaud
Un vrai connard, une tête pleine d'eau
Faites-en donc un militaire
Alors il fera carrière
Sur un navire, dans un bureau

Mais s'il est bon, mais s'il est beau
Même s'il est un peu alcoolo
Qu'il fasse son tour de la terre
Tout seul sur un bateau en fer
Mais pas sur l'pont du Clémenceau

Simple soldat, brave matelot
Surtout ne m'en veuillez pas trop
Cette chanson je ne l'ai chantée
Que pour les planqués, les gradés

Non seulement pour pas un rond
Mais en plus pour finir chômeur!

L'essentiel à nous apprendre
C'est l'amour des livres qui fait
Que tu peux voyager de ta chambre
Autour de l'humanité
C'est l'amour de ton prochain

La haine ça n'apporte rien
Pis elle viendra bien assez tôt

Savoir me servir d'une perceuse
Savoir allumer un feu

Que ce vieux monde explose
Tant il se décompose

Il aimait Julie et la Julie donc
L'aimait en retour, elle qui jamais
N'avait pu conquir le cœur de quiconque
Accepta l'amour que le Hughes offrait

La jolie Julie avait elle aussi
Un problème grave, majeur et sérieux
Qui depuis petite lui causait souci
Elle puait des pieds - d'un seul ? non, des deux

Comme quelqu'un qu'aurait marché sur la tête
A Ducon-Pauwels ou à B.H.L.
Comme quelqu'un qu'aurait taillé ses chaussettes
Dans un vieux Libé aux pages culturelles

Ça schlinguait le vestiaire du Parc des Princes
Comme un chien mouillé mort depuis huit jours
Comme un barbecue dimanche en province
Comme un maillot jaune à l'arrivée du tour

Chanson dégueulasse mais chanson jolie
Chanson un peu crasse comme la vie

Tous les deux s'affairent le soir de leurs noces
A se nettoyer ratiches et arpions
Lui frotte ses dents avec un balai-brosse
Les rince au gas-oil, mange du savon

Elle s'est enfermée dans la salle de bains
Se nettoie les pieds au fer à souder
Y verse les plus doux parfums
Shalimar, Opium et Ajax W.C.

Arrivés au lit, malgré leurs efforts
L'odeur est immonde, prenante, torride
Suffocante en diable, débandante à mort
Leur premier amour risque d'être un bide

Il lui dit, ""Chérie, je dois t'avouer
Mon drame impossible, ma douleur secrète""
Elle lui dit, ""T'inquiète, je l'ai deviné
Mon amour, tu as bouffé mes chaussettes""

Peuple de Paris
Rouge-gorge est fier
D'être né ici
Quartier populaire
Bistrots et bougnats
Et marchés couverts
Rues des enfants rois

Son surnom bizarre
A sa jolie voix
Et à son foulard
Rouge son foulard
Autour de son cou
Rouge sa mémoire
A jamais debout

Le Temps des Cerises
Dans les rues vivantes
Lorsqu'un jour arrive
Le temps des noyaux
Et des bulldozers
Et des vrais salauds
En costumes clairs
Quelque sous-ministre
A attaché-case
Et mine sinistre

Ampoules au plafond
Bonjour la lumière
Des tristes néons
Chassés les prolos
Et chassée la vie

Ont bouffé Paris
Les petites gens
Sont des gens sérieux
Iront gentiment
Peupler les banlieues

Chante, Rouge-gorge
Les Temps des Cerises

Paraîtra moins grise
Chante aussi Paname
Que les assassins
Ont livré aux flammes
Sans brûler leurs mains
Chante la mémoire

D'avant qu'elle crève
Chante la bâtarde

Que Doisneau regarde
Et qui agonise",Rouge-Gorge,2004

Aux combines et à l'arnaque

Le soleil dans les yeux
Loin des cris de la plage
Où s'ébattent joyeux

Des enfants dérisoires
Des crétins boutonneux
Des lecteurs de France Soir
Et des chiens dangereux

On est bien tous les deux
Si bien que peu s'en faut
Qu'un aigri malheureux
Ne nous jette un seau d'eau

Allongés sous les vagues
S'appelle ma chanson
Plus c'est con, plus ça passe
A la télévision

Il faisait du soleil
Ou faisait du vélo
Moi je l'ai vue pareille
A Marylin Garbo

Sortie d'une aquarelle
Dans sa ch'mise à carreaux
Elle était plus que belle
Je n'étais pas que beau

Elle pédalait, volage
Dans les dunes, superbe
Parfumée d'Eau Sauvage
Et ça sent pas la merde

Dévorés par les nuages
S'appelle mon poème
Plus c'est con, plus ça passe
Sur les radios FM

Sur ma planche de surf
Moi je fendais l'écume
Je suais comme un bœuf
Mais bon, j'avais un rhume

J'étais musclé comme un
Copain d' Marlon Brando
Qu'est pas sur la photo
Mais qu'est musclé très bien

Quand elle m'a vu si beau
Comme une pierre elle est
Tombée de son vélo
Et s'est mise à rier

Poursuivis par les crabes
S'appelle ma ballade
Plus c'est con, plus ça passe
Dans les boîtes minables

Je lui ai dit : Mignonne
Viens me rejoindre à l'eau
Quand on y est, elle est bonne
Quel talent ! Quel culot !

Elle a mis dans la s'conde
Son string clouté Prisunic
Et a plongé dans l'onde
Et les sacs en plastique

Depuis nous nous aimons
Comme s'aiment les oiseaux
Les huîtres, les poissons
Et puis les pédalos

Devenus tes geôliers

Qui te citent Staline 
Ou te lisent Mao
À toi qui, j’imagine 
Préférerais Rimbaud

Peut-etre, comme moi 
Les croyais-tu, naguère 
Fils de Che Guevara
Et porteurs de lumière

Mais leur lutte finale 
Leur matin du grand soir 
C’est la haine et le mal
Et surtout les Dollars

Nous t’attendons Ingrid 
Et nous pensons à toi
Et nous ne serons libres 
Que lorsque tu le seras

Je n’connais pas le nom 

De tous ceux, comme toi 
Qui croupissent en prison 
Otages ici ou là

Anonymes, oubliés 
Victimes de conflits
Où, de chaque côté 
Sévit la barbarie

Des narcotrafiquants 
D’un pouvoir corrompu 
D’un indigne président 
Vous payez le tribut

’lors en chantant pour toi 
Ingrid, je veux aussi 
Rappeler que tu combats 
Contre un double ennemi

Nous t’attendons Ingrid 
Et nous pensons à toi
Et nous ne serons libres 
Que lorsque tu le seras

Trois années dans la jungle 
Ligotée, bâillonnée
Avec le vent qui cingle 
Dans tes cheveux défaits

Tu restes, malgré tout 
Sereine et élégante
Ta revanche sur ces fous 
Est de rester vivante

Pour tous ceux que tu aimes 
Et qui ne t’oublient pas
Qui veulent briser ces chaines 
Qui ne te briseront pas

Ton nom est synonyme 
Ingrid Bétancourt
Contre l’armée du crime
De courage et d’amour

Nous t’attendons Ingrid 
Et nous pensons à toi
Et nous ne serons libres 
Que lorsque tu le seras

Et nous ne serons libres 
Que lorsque tu le seras",Dans la Jungle,2006
Renaud,"Elles s'en vont toujours par deux
Avant le dîner, discrètes
Pour se recoiffer un peu
Pour s'échanger en cachette
Quelques potins, quelques aveux
Quelle est la raison secrète
De cet exil mystérieux
Qui les retient au petit coin?

Nos gonzesses
Devant les lavabos
Se repoudrent le bout du nez
Se font les lèvres cerise
Nos gonzesses
Sous les néons pas beaux
En dégrafant négligemment
Un bouton de leur chemise

Elles se retournent dans le miroir
Par-dessus leurs épaules
Pas très rassurées pour voir
Si par malheur ou par hasard
Leur joli cul n'aurait pas disparu
Puis innocentes mais la tête haute
Elles nous reviennent enfin
Parfumées comme pour un autre

Nos gonzesses
Devant les lavabos
Est-c'qu'elles parlent de moi, de nous?
Est-c'qu'elles disent des gros mots?
Nos gonzesses
Sous les néons pas beaux
Font semblant de se laver les mains
Qu'elles ont blanches comme du bon pain

Un beau jour elles disparaissent
Sans laisser d'adresse
A peine un petit mot
Sur le miroir du lavabo
De leur rouge à lèvres souvent
Elles écrivent en lettres de sang
Simplement ""Adieu salaud""
C'est vrai qu'il n'y a pas d'autres mots",Devant les Lavabos,2006
Renaud,"Boules de gommes et p'tits mystères
Je m'demande si y'a de quoi faire
Une chanson
Du parfum d'Amsterdamère
Qui sortait de la pipe en terre
Du tonton
De mes bobos sur les coudes
Du bruit de la machine à coudre
Dans le salon
Et du gros chagrin surtout
De ma p'tite frangine qui boude
Pour de bon

Mais la nostalgie, tu sais
Autour de quarante balais
Quand ça t'chope
Ça te donne envie de te retourner
Sur toutes ces journées ratées
Sans tes potes
Ça donne envie de retrouver
Et tes billes et tes cahiers
Et ta gomme
Et de pardonner à ta mère
D'avoir jamais bien su faire
La tarte aux pommes

Les dimanches à la con
De quand j'avais disons
Dix ans
Me reviennent souvent
Pas toujours mais mettons
Tout le temps

Avec les frangins on se cultait
On se balançait des coups de pieds
Sous la table
Pour avoir le blanc du poulet
Que la mère nous découpait
Équitable
Pis on f'sait dans nos assiettes
Avec la purée toute bête
Au milieu
Des p'tits volcans super chouettes
Qui mettaient dans nos p'tites têtes
Du ciel bleu

Boules de gomme et p'tits mystères
Je m'demande si y'a de quoi faire
Trois couplets
De ces journées sans lumière
Des gâteaux d'anniversaires
Partagés
De ces bouteilles de Clairette
Qu'on détestait en cachette
Et pis de l'angoisse
De ces heures devant la fenêtre
A regardé une bicyclette
Juste en face

Les dimanches à la con
De quand j'avais disons
Dix ans
Me reviennent souvent
Pas toujours mais mettons
Tout le temps

Les dimanches à la con
De mes automnes monotones
D'enfant
Faisaient de moi un santon
Sur le tapi du salon
Y'a cent ans

Dans cet ennui accepté
Des après-midis passés
En silence
Quand les lumières s'allumaient
C'est toute la nuit qui tombait
Sur l'enfance
Ca sentait déjà l'école
Le cartable le tube de colle
Du lendemain
On priait pour que coups de bol
On se réveille avec une rougeole
Au matin

Renaud,"T’as vu, Lolita, ta pote Marylou
Qu’a quinze ans comme toi, qu’j’ai connue bout d’chou
T’as vu comme elle a changé tout d’un coup?
Eh ben, ma Doudou, elle a vu le loup

J’vais pas lui r’procher, eh! C’est pas un crime
A peine un péché et des plus minimes
D’après sa copine qui l’a balancée
C’est à la mi-août qu’elle a vu le loup

C’est plus pour la frime que pour le frisson
Qu’un soir de déprime un gentil couillon
A eu l’grand bonheur de gagner l’pompon
De cueillir sa fleur avant la saison

Hormis la jouissance d’emmerder ses vieux
Y’avait pas urgence, y’avait pas le feu
D’autant qu’la romance a duré bien peu
Elle a vu le loup deux minutes en tout

Pour la performance et pis pour l’extase
La pauvre est, malchance, tombée sur un naze
Vilain comme un pou, maladroit comme tout
Elle a vu le loup, y vaut pas un clou

Elle a vu le loup, tant mieux ou tant pis
C’t’ait pas un bon coup ni un bon parti
J’lui jette pas la pierre, j’crée pas une émeute
Y paraît qu’sa mère a vu toute la meute

Quant à toi, ma douce, ma jolie pucelle
Suce encore ton pouce, joue à la marelle
C’qu’a fait Marylou eh ben tu t’en fous
Elle a vu le loup, c’était un voyou

Mais j’espère, ma fille, que quand viendra l’heure
De prendre cette Bastille sous ta robe à fleurs
Le loup aura l’heur de te plaire autant
Pour son joli coeur que pour ses talents

S’il est, ce beau jour, doux comme un agneau
Donne-lui ton amour en paquet cadeau
En plus du diamant que tu gardes encore
Mais combien de temps au creux de ton corps?",Elle a Vu le Loup,2006
Renaud,"Quand elle est montée sur ma mouche
Je l'ai ferrée comme un salaud
Mais je l'ai embrassée sur la bouche
Avant de la remettre à l'eau

Ma jolie farouche
Retourne vite te cacher
Sous un caillou
Sous une souche
Pour vivre libre vis planquée

Tu viens d'échapper à la mort
Te crois pas pour autant sauvée
Chaque fois que revient l'aurore
C’est la vie le vrai danger

C'est un jeu cruel
Mais c'est la vie ma jolie condamnée
C'est parce que tu es belle
Parce que je t'aime que je suis sans pitié

C'est un jeu cruel
Mais c'est la vie pour l'éternité
C'est parce que tu es belle
Parce que je t'aime qu'un jour je te tuerai

Quand tu t'es pendue à mon cou
Je t'ai ferrée comme un salaud
Je t'ai embrassée partout
Mais je t'ai gardée tout contre ma peau

Joli cœur et jolie bouche
Tu peux toujours te planquer
Sous un caillou sous une souche
Je t'ai pris ta liberté

C'est un jeu cruel
Mais c'est l'amour ma jolie ma sucrée
J’ai coupé tes ailes
Lorsque je t'ai prise dans mes filets

C’est parce que tu es belle
Parce que je t'aime que je t'aime enchaînée",Je Cruel,2006
Renaud,"Loin des projos, loin des télés
Et des animateurs blaireaux
Tous ces crétins dégénérés
Fringués, coiffés comme des proxos
Loin des journaux et des radios
Des interviews conformistes
Par des zombies mongolitos
Un peu nazes, souvent fumistes
Loin des questions parfois obscènes
Ridicules ou bien vicelardes
Des nullos de la bande FM
Rois de la musique ringarde

Pour vivre heureux, je vis caché
Au fond de mon bistrot peinard
Dans la lumière tamisée
Loin de ce monde de bavards

Loin des boîtes, des fêtes branchées
De la jet-set et du showbizz
Des pétasses cocaïnées
Et des bellâtres à la dérive
Loin des premières où tout Paris
Vient poser sans aucun scrupule
Pour quelques pauvres paparazzi
Qui aiment mitrailler les nuls
Loin des cocktails, dîners
Des mondanités imbéciles
Entre starlettes d'un seul été
Au QI frisant le débile

Pour vivre heureux, je vis caché
Au fond de mon bistrot peinard
Avec mes potes, des vrais de vrais
Loin de ce monde de fêtards

Loin des meetings, des réunions
Des manifestations de rues
J'écoute la colère qui fond
Sur nos dirigeants corrompus
Mais bouger mon cul, m'engager
C'est pas demain que vous m'y reprendrez
A part peut-être José Bové
Qui pourrais-je jamais aimer?
Je rêve d'un monde plus humain

Et je laisse parler ce bras
Les pétitions c'est plutôt bien
Mais vous n'y verrez plus mon blaze

Pour vivre heureux, je vis caché
Au fond de mon bistrot peinard
Taciturne, désabusé
Loin de ce monde de barbares

Loin des conversations minables
Sur les charmes surfabriqués
De quelques ados improbables
Dans un loft télévisé
Très loin des stars académiques
Et des popstars de mes deux
Qui sont un peu à la musique
Ce que le diable est au bon dieu
J'irai pas prendre quelques bâtons
Pour servir la soupe à ces branques
Les télés vous prennent pour des cons
J'irai pas chanter pour ces glands

Pour vivre heureux, je vis caché
Au fond de mon bistrot peinard
Dans la lumière tamisée
Loin de ce monde de ringards

Renaud,"Mon disque était terminé
Y m' restait trois-quatre chansons
Que je voulais pas mettre au panier
Qu'étaient vraiment trop canon
Alors je me suis dit ""rebelote""
Une fois de plus je vais essayer
De les refourguer à des potes
Des fois qu'eux y seraient plantés

Alors j'ai filé en banlieue
Voir un groupe de rap d'enfer
C'était ce qui se faisait de mieux
Ça plaisait même à ma mère
Pi au niveau des paroles
Ça plaisait même à mon chien!

Je dis au chanteur, hé Brother!
J'ai une chanson en béton!
Elle s'appelle "" on est tous frères
Sauf Hamid qu'est un sale con!""
C'est un mec y se sent exclu
D' cette société inhumaine
Alors un jour il en peut plus
Et il crie toute sa haine
En graffitant sur les murs
Son prénom un peu partout
Mais comme y' s'appelle Maurice
Ça fait pas joli du tout!

Qu'est ce t'en pense de ma chanson?
Tu la veux pas, ah bon?
C'est pas grave je vais aller voir
Un chanteur de rock, un noir!

Alors j'ai filé au Québec
Pour rencontrer Roch Voisine
J' l'ai trouvé tellement beau mec
Que j'ai pris trois aspirines
Ma maman avait raison
J'aurais dû me faire bûcheron!

Je lui ai dit avec un grand sourire
Écoute un peu ça, calice!
Ma chanson elle est pas pire
Elle s'appelle ""je l'aime en crisse""
C'est l'histoire un peu niaiseuse
D'un maudit bum de Montréal
Y rencontre une shampouineuse
Un soir sur le Mont Royal
Quand elle voit sa Camaro
Elle tombe vraiment en amour
Quand y voit ses gosses, le salaud
Il l'abandonne dans la neige!

Qu'est ce t'en pense de ma chanson?
Tu la veux pas, ah bon?
C'est pas grave je vais aller voir
Un chanteur de blues, un noir!

Alors j'ai filé un rencard
A Goldman dans un milk-bar
En train d' convaincre en esquimau
Qu'y faut aimer son bâton
Qu' la vie n'est qu'un long glaçon

Ma chanson est bonne bonne
Elle chante la différence
Entre la poire et la pomme
Entre le bol et la chance
C'est tout ce qui nous divise
Nous rapproche et nous éloigne
De tout ce que les gens disent
Et de tout ce que j'empoigne
Sur les miettes du balcon
Où je vois trimer la bonne
Quand sont passés les pigeons
Qui souillent mes géraniums

Qu'est ce t'en pense de ma chanson?
Tu la veux pas, ah bon?
C'est pas grave je vais aller voir
Un chanteur de jazz, un noir!

Manque de bol y m' restait plus
Qu'une chanson vraiment craignos
Je tombe sur un trou du cul
Qui revenait de Roland Garros
Une espèce de tête pleine d'eau
Robinet derrière la nuque!

Je lui ai dit, excuse-moi mecton
Tu voudrais pas faire chanteur?
T'es largement assez cons
Et t'es beau comme un docteur
J'ai une chanson qui s'appelle
""Elle fessait du vélo sans selle""
On l'enregistre dès ce soir
Et demain t'es un rock star
On a fait effectivement
Numéro Un tout l'été
Et c'était tellement navrant
Que Libé a adoré!

Observent la conquête

Et puis pour une fiotte, en balerines noires
Qui arrose bientôt le sable d'un sang bovin

Puis elles vont pieds nus dans leur fragile blouse
Par les ruelles chaudes quand la ville s'embrase
S'imaginent gitanes, provençales, andalouses
Toutes sont parisiennes, pire encore Niçoises

En se plaignant du froid
En assumant la honte

Petite conne tu leur en veux même pas,
Tu sais que ces charognes sont bien plus morts que toi

Tu fréquentais un monde,
D'imbéciles mondains

Se consomme au matin
Où le fric autorise
A se croire à l’abri

Et de notre mépris

Nous inspirait malin
En sirotant nos bières
Ou en fumant nos joins

Dans les backrooms du Marais
Dans ce ghetto un peu branché

À niquer plus que de raison

Qui a emporté tant de tes potes
Grâce à ce virus infernal
Ne sortez jamais sans capotes

Un moustachu ou un gentil
Alors tu te maqueras avec
Pour quelques jours ou pour la vie

Y en a plein les orphelinats
Sauf que pour vous papa-maman
C'est juste interdit par la loi

La vie c'est pas toujours le pied

Un vieux rhume qui dure

Renaud,"J'ai arrêté la mer, refourgué mon bateau
Vécu trop de galères dans des pays trop chauds
Je me suis échoué dans un bar à matelots
Rue de la Soif, aux remparts de Saint-Malo

Tout arrêter, terminé! Finie l'aventure et le vent salé
Le voyageur est fatigué
Mais jamais je n'arrêterai de t'aimer

J'ai arrêté la mob, le roller, le vélo
Au volant d'leurs bagnoles y'a bien trop de blaireaux
Suis redevenu piéton et mes pas, aussitôt
M'ont conduit sans encombre jusqu'au premier bistrot

Tout arrêter, terminé! Je quitte le chemin des écoliers
Le patineur est fatigué
Mais jamais je n'arrêterai de t'aimer

J'ai arrêté un jour d'exercer mon boulot
Renoncé à parler aux journaleux idiots
J'ai rangé ma guitare et coupé mon micro
Arrêté la musique et arrêté les mots

Tout arrêter, terminé! Finies les chansonnettes, ma voix enfumée
Le troubadour est fatigué
Mais jamais je n'arrêterai de t'aimer

J'ai arrêté de croire en tous les idéaux
Arrêté de donner mon obole aux Restos
Je n'ouvre plus mon cœur qu’à mes potes, au bistrot
Et à mon bel amour qui me quitte bientôt

Tout arrêter, terminé! Finis les utopies, les rêves brisés
Le cœur d'artichaut est fatigué
Mais jamais je n'arrêterai de t'aimer

Jamais je n'arrêterai de t'aimer
Jamais je n'arrêterai de t'aimer",Tout Arrêter,2006

Renaud,"Elle s'emmerdait Place Saint-Michel, avec des cons,
Elle descendait place de l'Horloge, en Avignon,
S'emmerder avec des vieux chnoques,
De vingt-cinq berges
Qui reviennent des Indes ou do Maroc
Et qui se gobergent,
Assis sur des sacs de couchage
Plutôt cradoques.
Sous leurs pavés, see'est peut-être la plage,
Mais elle est moche!

Elle était un petit peu campeuse,
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse,
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

Je l'ai prise en stop à la porte de Vanves, un soir de juin,
L'est montée dans ma Ford Mustang, avec son chien,
Un doberman complètement barge
Qu'avait très faim,
Qu'a mis des poils et pi de la bave
Plein mes coussins.
Elle a retiré ses charentaises,
Bonjour l'odeur,
Pour roupiller super à l'aise
Pendant trois heures!

Elle était un petit peu campeuse,
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse,
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

En se reveillant l'avait la frite, elle m'a parlé
D'un pote à elle qu'est journaliste à V.S.D,
Qu'écrit parfois dans Rock and Folk,
Sous un faux nom,
Pi qui serait pédé comme un phoque,
Mais loin d'être con.
Je lui ai dit: boucle-là, tu m'emmerdes
Avec tes salades,
Pi tu m'enfumes avec ton herbe
Ça me rend malade!

Elle était un petit peu campeuse,
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse,
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

On s'est arrêté pour bouffer après Moulins,
Et Jacques Borel nous a chanté son petit refrain:
Le plat pourri qui est le sien,
J'why ai pas touché,
Tiens, see'est pas dur, même le clébard
A tout gerbé!
Ma stoppeuse s'est rempli le tiroir
Sans rien moufter,
Elle était raide, comme par hasard,
J'ai tout casqué!

Elle était un petit peu campeuse,
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse,
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

Quand je lui ai proposé la botte, sans trop why croire,
Elle m'a dit: cause toujours, mon pote, t'est qu'un ringard!
Alors, pour détendre l'atmosphère,
Très glauque, très punk,
Je mets une cassette se Starshooter
Dans mon Blaupunkt.

Elle me dit: je préfère le rock'n'roll,
see'est plus l'éclate.
Je l'ai gerbé de ma bagnole
À grands coups de lattes.

Elle était un petit peu campeuse,
Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse,
Je l'aurais préférée vicieuse, voire allumeuse!

Elle s'est retrouvé sur le macadam avec ses gamelles,
Son sac à dos, son doberman, bien fait pour elle,
Terminé pour moi les campeuses,
J'ai eu ma dose,
Me parlez plus d'auto-stoppeuse
Ça me rend morose!
Je veux plus personne dans ma bagnole,
Je suis mieux tout seul,
Je conduit d'une main, de l'autre je picole
Je me fends la gueule!

Un petit peu auto-stoppeuse,

Renaud,"Au rez-d'-chaussée, dans mon HLM
Y'a une espèce de barbouze
Qui surveille les entrées
Qui tire sur tout c' qui bouge

Avec son Beretta

Des anciens d' soixante-huit
Y'en a un qu'est chômeur
Y'en a un qu'est instite
Y'en a une, c'est ma sœur
Y vivent comme ça, relax
Y'a des mat'lats par terre

Aux manifs de gonzesses

Pi y'a aussi, dans mon HLM
Un nouveau romantique
Un ancien combattant
Un loubard, et un flic
Qui s' balade en survêtement
Y fait chaque jour son jogging
Avec son berger allemand
De la cave au parking
C'est vachement enrichissant
Quand j'en ai marre d' ces braves gens
J' fais un saut au huitième
Pour construire un moment
Avec ma copine Germaine
Un monde rempli d'enfants
Et quand l' jour se lève
On s' quitte en y croyant

Renaud,"Y'a un mariole, il a au moins quatre ans
Y veut t' piquer ta pelle et ton seau
Ta couche culotte avec tes bonbecs dedans
Lolita, défend-toi, fous-y un coup d' râteau dans l' dos
Attend un peu avant de t' faire emmerder
Par ces petits machos qui pensent qu'à une chose
Jouer au docteur non conventionné
J'y ai joué aussi, je sais de quoi j' cause
J' les connais bien les play-boys des bacs à sable
J' draguais leurs mères avant d' connaître la tienne
Si tu les écoutes y t' feront porter leurs cartables
Heureusement qu' j' suis là, que j' te regarde et que j' t'aime

Lola
J' suis qu'un fantôme quand tu vas où j' suis pas
Tu sais ma môme
Que j' suis Morgane de toi

Comme j'en ai marre de m' faire tatouer des machins
Qui m' font comme une bande dessinée sur la peau
J'ai écrit ton nom avec des clous dorés
Un par un, plantés dans le cuir de mon blouson dans l' dos
T'es la seule gonzesse que j' peux tenir dans mes bras
Sans m' démettre une épaule, sans plier sous ton poids
Tu pèses moins lourd qu'un moineau qui mange pas

Déploie jamais tes ailes, Lolita t'envole pas
Avec tes miches de rat qu'on dirait des noisettes
Et ta peau plus sucrée qu'un pain au chocolat
Tu risques de donner faim a un tas de petits mecs
Quand t’ira à l'école, si jamais t'y vas

Qu'est-ce qu' tu m' racontes tu veux un petit frangin
Tu veux qu' j' t'achète un ami Pierrot
Eh les bébés ça s' trouve pas dans les magasins
Puis j' crois pas que ta mère voudra qu' j' lui fasse un petit dans l' dos
Ben quoi Lola on est pas bien ensemble
Tu crois pas qu'on est déjà bien assez nombreux
T'entends pas c' bruit, c'est le monde qui tremble
Sous les cris des enfants qui sont malheureux
Allez viens avec moi, j' t'embarque dans ma galère

Avant qu' ce monde devienne un grand cimetière
Faut profiter un peu du vent qu'on a dans l' dos",Morgane de Toi,2006
Renaud,"J' veux qu' mes chansons soient des caresses,
Ou bien des coups d' poings dans la gueule.
A qui qu' ce soit que je m'agresse,
J' veux vous remuer dans vos fauteuils.
Alors écoutez moi un peu,
Les pousse-mégots et les nez-d'boeux,
Les ringards, les folkeux, les journaleux.
Depuis qu'y' a mon nom dans vos journaux,
Qu'on voit ma tronche à la télé,
Où j' vends ma soupe empoisonnée,
Vous m'avez un peu trop gonflé.
J' suis pas chanteur pour mes copains,
Et j' peux être teigneux comme un chien.
J' déclare pas, avec Aragon,
Qu' le poète a toujours raison.
La femme est l'avenir des cons,
Et l'homme n'est l'avenir de rien.

Moi, mon av'nir est sur zinc
D'un bistrot des plus cradingues,
Mais bordel, où c'est qu' j'ai mis mon flingue?

J' vais pas m' laisser emboucaner
Par les fachos, pas les gauchos,
Tous ces pauvr' mecs endoctrinés
Qui foutent ma révolte au tombeau.
Tous ceux qui m' traitent de démago
Dans leur torchons qu' j' lirais jamais
""Renaud, c'est mort, il est récupéré""
Tous ces p'tits bourgeois incurables
Qui parlent pas, qu'écrivent pas, qui bavent,
Qui vivront vieux leur vie d' minables,
Ont tous dans la bouche un cadavre.
Toute façon, je chante pas pour ces blaireaux,
Et j'ai pas dit mon dernier mot.
C'est sûr'ment pas un disque d'or,
Ou un Olympia à moi tout seul,
Qui me feront virer de bord,
Qui me feront fermer ma gueule.

Tant qu'y' aura d' al haine dans mes s'ringues,
Je ne chant'rai que pour les dingues,
Mais bordel, ! Où c'est qu' j'ai mis mon flingue?

Y'a pas qu' les mômes, dans la rue,
Qui m' collent au cul pour une photo,
Y'a même des flics qui me saluent,
Qui veulent que j' signe dans leurs calots.
Moi j' crache dedans, et j' cris bien haut
Qu' le bleu marine me fait gerber,
Qu' j'aime pas l' travail, la justice et l'armée.
C'est pas demain qu'on m' verra marcher
Avec les connards qui vont aux urnes,
Choisir celui qui les fera crever.
Moi, ces jours là, j' reste dans ma turne.
Rien à foutre de la lutte de crasse,
Tous les systèmes sont dégueulasses!
J' peux pas encaisser les drapeaux,
Quoi que le noir soir le plus beau.
La marseillaise, même en reggae,
Ça m'a toujours fait dégueuler.

Les marches militaires, ça m' déglingue
Et votre République, moi j' la tringle,
Mais bordel! Où c'est qu' j'ai mis mon flingue?

Depuis qu'on m'a tiré mon canif,
Un soir au métro Saint Michel,
J' fous plus les pieds dans une manif
Sans un nunchak' ou un cocktail
A Longwy comme à Saint Lazare,
Plus de slogans face aux flicards,
Mais des fusils, des pavés, des grenades!
Gueuler contre la répression
En défilant ""Bastille-Nation""
Quand mes frangins crèvent en prison
Ça donne une bonne conscience aux cons,
Aux nez-de boeux et aux pousse-mégots
Qui foutent ma révolte au tombeau.

Si un jour j' me retrouve par terre,
Sûr qu' ça sera d' la faute à Baader.
Si j' crève le nez dans le ruisseau,
Sûr qu' ça sera d' la faute à Bonnot.

Renaud,"C’est bien à l’eau potable
Qu’on lave nos bagnoles
Qu’on nettoie nos salades
Nos chiens, nos culs, nos grolles,

Et l’eau potable encore
Coule dans nos toilettes
Irrigue nos récoltes
Et nous lave la tête

Elle arrose nos fleurs
Nos pelouses, nos parterres,
Nos lessives ont l’honneur
D’une eau limpide et claire

Elle coule en abondance
Aux fontaines Wallace
Mais laisse à ma conscience
Comme un goût dégueulasse
Comme un goût dégueulasse

Car à Pondichéry
Les enfants sont crasseux
Boivent à l’eau croupie
D’un marigot bourbeux

Et parc’qu’en Somalie
Des femmes meurent chaque jour
À tirer l’eau d’un puits
Asséché pour toujours
Asséché pour toujours

Combien dépensons-nous
Dans nos contrées prospères
Pour nourrir nos toutous
Compagnons de misère

Pour offrir à nos chats
Les plus belles litières
Les gaver de foie gras
En barquettes légères

Le prix d’un toilettage, 
Vaccin, vétérinaire
Nourrirait le village
D’une tribu berbère

J’aime aussi ces bestioles
Pas jusqu’au fanatisme
Mais parfois me révolte
Devant tant d’égoïsme
Devant tant d’égoïsme

Car à Pondichéry
L’enfant dort dans la rue
La décharge est pour lui
Quand nos chiens sont repus

Et parc’qu’en Somalie
L’âne reçoit des coups
Même s’il sauve des vies
En trimant plus que nous
En trimant plus que nous

Combien de cris, de plaintes
Dans nos pays nantis
Pour la moindre des atteintes
À notre train de vie

Travailler toujours moins
Toujours plus posséder
C’est le credo commun
Du bourge à l’ouvrier

Marxisme et capital
Corollaire l’un de l’autre
C’est la même lutte finale
Nos gueules avant les vôtres

Sellières ou Laguillier
Tous pauvres pour la seconde
Que des riches pour l’premier
Et quoi pour le tiers-monde
Et quoi pour le tiers-monde

Car à Pondichéry
L’urgence c’est de vivre
Le confort ou l’ennui
Ne sont que dans les livres

Et parc’qu’en Somalie
La liberté se gagne
Lorsque tombe la pluie
Sur le désert infâme


Car à Pondichéry
Ils ignorent ma chanson
Qui avoue nos folies
Et demande pardon

Et parc’qu’en Somalie
Où les mots n’peuvent rien
La misère et l’oubli
N’auront jamais de fin
N’auront jamais de fin",Pondichéry,2006

M’offrent douze cibiches et même du feu 
Z’ont vraiment aucune volonté

Soixante cigarettes dans la tronche 
Chaque jour et ce depuis quarante ans 
À côté d’la couleur d’mes bronches 
Un béret basque paraîtrait blanc

Trop jolie

Qui fument déjà comme des pompiers
J’les imagine dans vingt-cinq ans
À galérer pour arrêter

J’trouve héroïques et admirables
Ceux qui ont jamais eu besoin d’cette merde 
Qui ont rejeté cette fumée du diable
Qui chlingue comme une vieille gerbe

Qui s’enrichit sur mon cancer
Et qui me supplie dans l’même temps 
D’filer ma pièce à Schwartzenberg

Qu’faut pas fumer dans les bistrots

Renaud,"On les appelle bourgeois bohêmes 
Ou bien bobos pour les intimes 
Dans les chanson d'Vincent Delerm 
On les retrouve à chaque rime 
Ils sont une nouvelle classe 
Après les bourges et les prolos 
Pas loin des beaufs, quoique plus classe 
Je vais vous en dresser le tableau 
Sont un peu artistes c’est déjà ça 
Mais leur passion c'est leur boulot 
Dans l’informatique, les médias 
Sont fier d'payer beaucoup d'impôts 

Les bobos, les bobos 
Les bobos, les bobos 

Ils vivent dans les beaux quartiers 
ou en banlieue mais dans un loft 
Ateliers d’artistes branchés, 
Bien plus tendance que l'avenue Foch 
ont des enfants bien élevés, 
qui ont lu le Petit Prince à 6 ans 
Qui vont dans des écoles privées 
Privées de racaille, je me comprends 

ils fument un joint de temps en temps, 
font leurs courses dans les marchés bios 
Roulent en 4x4, mais l’plus souvent, 
préfèrent s’déplacer à vélo 

Les bobos, les bobos 
Les bobos, les bobos 

Ils lisent Houellebecq ou philippe Djian,les Inrocks et Télérama, 
Leur livre de chevet c’est surand 
Près du catalogue Ikea. 
Ils aiment les restos japonais et le cinéma coréen 
passent leurs vacances au cap Ferret 
La côte d'azur, franchement ça craint 
Ils regardent surtout ARTE 
Canal plus, c’est pour les blaireaux 
Sauf pour les matchs du PSG 
et d’temps en temps un p'tit porno 

Les bobos, les bobos 
Les bobos, les bobos 

Ils écoutent sur leur chaîne hi fi 
France-info toute la journée 
Alain Bashung Françoise Hardy 
Et forcement Gérard Manset 
Ils aiment Desproges sans même savoir 
que Desproges les détestait 
Bedos et Jean Marie Bigard, 
même s’ils ont honte de l’avouer 
Ils aiment Jack Lang et Sarkozy 
Mais votent toujours Ecolo 
Ils adorent le Maire de Paris, 
Ardisson et son pote Marco 

Les bobos, les bobos 
Les bobos, les bobos 

La femme se fringue chez Diesel 
Et l'homme a des prix chez Kenzo 
Pour leur cachemire toujours nickel 
Zadig & Voltaire je dis bravo 
Ils fréquentent beaucoup les musées, 
les galeries d'art, les vieux bistrots 
boivent de la manzana glacée en écoutant Manu chao 
Ma plume est un peu assassine 
Pour ces gens que je n'aime pas trop 
par certains côtés, j'imagine… 
Que j'fais aussi partie du lot

Quoi écouter?
L'eau qui rigole au caniveau
De mon quartier
Le vent qui vient tirer des plaintes
Aux peupliers
Et toujours la folle complainte
De Charles Trenet

A part à ta peau de sirène
A quoi toucher ?
A l'outil taillé dans le chêne
Ou l'olivier
Au crayon que l'enfant promène
Sur un cahier
Aux touches d'ivoire et d'ébène
D'un vieux clavier

A part à tes fruits défendus
A quoi goûter?
A l’impossible à l'imprévu
Et au danger
A ce bon verre de vieux vin rouge
Si parfumé
A tes lèvres que tu entrouvres
Sous mes baisers

A part la lumière de Doisneau
Quoi regarder?
La rivière au bord de l'eau
Au mois de mai
L’enfant qui joue du violon
Les Pyrénées
Ton joli cul tes seins bien ronds
Tes yeux fermés

A part les coquelicots de juin
Quoi respirer?
Le pain qu'on partage et le vin
Qu'on a tire,
A la santé d'un bon copain
A l’amitié
A l’amour que j'ai dans les mains

Renaud,"Elle revient de la fête de l'huma, elle est contente, elle a vu Johnny
Elle a rodé de ci de là, dans tous les stands du parti
Des posters de Che Guevara, l'en a eu sa dose aujourd'hui

Faut dire qu'elle serait plutôt de l'autre côté du drapeau
Plus CIA que KGB, plus Pinochet que Allende
Faut dire qu'elle est con comme un veau, elle est facho

Eh ouais les fêtes populaires, après tout c'est pour tout le monde
C'est pas écrit sur son imper qu'elle adore la bébête immonde
Vaux mieux car dans cet univers, elle pourrait bien se faire tondre

Ça serait dommage, car sa crinière de cheveux blonds elle en est fière
Aryenne jusqu'au fond des yeux, ça détonne dans sa banlieue
Elle aime aussi sa blanche peau, elle est facho

Elle voit partout des bolcheviques, elle imagine des complots
Contre l'ordre, contre les flics, contre l'église et le drapeau
Elle voue une haine chronique à la télé et aux journaux

Elle conchie les politiques, les jeunes qui vont à vau-l'eau
Et les mœurs pas très catholiques, et les pédés et les bicots
Elle rêve d'un ordre nouveau, elle est facho

Elle a surtout la nostalgie du sabre et du goupillon
De la nation, de la patrie, débarrassée de l'immigration
Dit que l'ancien temps était béni, comme disent la plupart des cons

Regrette le temps des colonies, la peine de mort légalisée
De l'avortement interdit, et maudit les jeunes filles voilées
Et elle lit National hebdo, elle est facho

Je lui souhaite qu'un jour si elle a un môme, y se retrouve à 18 balais
Plein d'éducation et de diplômes, d'idées rebelles, d'humanité
Et qu'il lui dise, tes vieux discours manquent singulièrement d'amour

Qu'il rajoute à la triste dame, reste donc le nez dans ta merde

Renaud,"Ma plume est une arme de poing 
Mes mots parfois sont des grenades 
Dans ce monde cruel et crétin
Ma guitare est en embuscade

Contre toutes les barbaries 
Contre les silences assassins
Le conformisme des nantis
Et l’ignorance des gens de rien

Car si jamais une chanson
N’a fait tomber un dictateur
Si la tyrannie, l’oppression 
Vivent toujours de belles heures

Je sais que j’écrirai toujours 
Comme un acte de résistance 
Outre quelques chansons d’amour 
À l’encre noire de la violence

C’est pas donné aux animaux
C’est la mission des baladins
De combattre avec des mots
De faire des couplets des coups d’poing

J’ai retrouvé mon flingue 
Il était dans mes rimes 
Attention je déglingue
Je dégomme, je décime

Au premier rang de mes colères 
L’Amérique du grand Capital 
George Bush et ses chiens de guerre 
Et son putain d’ordre moral

Son modèle de société
Mi décadente mi puritaine
Sa peine de mort légalisée
Par des Cours que l’on dit Suprêmes

Sa sous-culture qu’il voudrait bien 
Imposer à la terre entière
Coca, Mac Do, rappeurs crétins 
Disneyland et Schwarzenegger

Consommation et pollution
À chaque citoyen son flingue

Des Luther King par milliers

J’ai retrouvé mon flingue 
Il était dans mes rimes 
Attention je déglingue
Je dégomme, j’extermine

Autre fléau, autre danger
Ces putains d’églises à la con 
Les évangélistes timbrés 
Rabbins, Ayathollas, curetons

Combien de guerres, combien d’horreurs 
Ces imbéciles ont engendrées
Par leurs discours de malheur
Sur des masses de demeurés

Tous ceux-là considèrent la femme 
Comme une pute ou une sainte 
Promettent la damnation de l’âme 
À qui ne vit pas dans la crainte

Trouverai-je jamais les mots
Pour dire mon mépris profond
De tous les dieux, tous leurs dévots 
Et de toutes les religions

La mienne se résume en fait 
À l’amour et à l’amitié
À l’amour de cette planète 
Où vit l’homme et sa fiancée

J’ai retrouvé mon flingue 
Il était dans mes rimes 
Attention je déglingue
Je dégomme, j’élimine

Chaque jour ils sont des milliers 
Les enfants qui meurent sans bruit 
Quand des milliards sont dépensés 
Pour sur-armer tous les pays

On mise sur le nucléaire
On surconsomme, on surproduit 
Lorsque la moitié de la terre 
Crève de faim, de maladies

La charité a remplacé
La justice, et c’est l’Abbé Pierre
Qui doit chaque jour s’y coller
Pour que nos consciences soient claires

Pour faire du spectacle avec ça
Il y’a toujours un projecteur
Et toujours une caméra
Comme un vautour sur le malheur

Avec l’horreur ils font du fric
Et avec la mort de l’audience

L’info remplace la connaissance

J’ai retrouvé mon flingue

Je dégomme, j’assassine

S’attaquer aux moulins à vent
De l’injustice, de la misère
Comme je le fais de temps en temps 
Dans mes petites chansons colère

Ça relève de l’utopie
Mais y’a-t-il autre chose à faire 
Poser des bombes, prendre un fusil 
Ou suivre le troupeau pépère

Qui imagine changer l’histoire
En votant pour quelques gangsters 
En déléguant tous les pouvoirs
À des politiciens pervers

Vienne un jour ce monde impossible 
Où les enfants seront bénis
Où nulle femme ne s’ra la cible
De la violence ou du mépris

Où les hommes vivront d’amour 
Comme l’ont dit d’autres que moi 
Où plus personne ne sera sourd 
Aux cris de détresse ou d’effroi

Illuminant mes nuits, pareille à la Grande Ourse

De Charles Trenet

À part à ta peau de sirène
À quoi toucher?
À l’outil taillé dans le chene
Ou l’olivier
Au crayon que l’enfant promène 
Sur un cahier
Aux touches d’ivoire et d’ébène 
D’un vieux clavier
À part à tes fruits défendus
À quoi goûter?
À l’impossible, à l’imprévu
Et au danger

À ce bon verre de vieux vin rouge 
Si parfumé
À tes lèvres que tu entrouvres 
Sous mes baisers

À part la lumière de Doisneau 
Quoi regarder?
La rivière au bord de l’eau
Au mois de mai
L’enfant qui joue du violon
Les Pyrénées
Ton joli cul, tes seins bien ronds 
Tes yeux fermés
À part les coquelicots de juin 
Quoi respirer?
Le pain qu’on partage et le vin 
Qu’on a tiré
À la santé d’un bon copain
À l’amitié
À l’amour que j’ai dans les mains 
Que tu m’as donné
Que tu m’as donné",Les Cinq Sens,2006
Renaud,"Tres años en la selva 
Atada y sin luz 
Rodeada de locos 
Tres años en la cruz

Te secuestraron
Te hicieron rehén 
De guerras oscuras 
Sin mirar a quién

Clamaban justicia 
Pedían libertad 
Matando principios, 
La paz y tu verdad

Desprecian la vida 
Tu alma de mujer 
Y con sus fusiles 
Te quieren vencer

Te esperamos Ingrid 
Pensamos en ti
Y no seremos libres 
Hasta que estés aquí 

Tres años en la jungla 
Atada y sin luz
Con esos pistoleros 
Tres años en la cruz

Como ellos combates 
Contra la miseria
Tú con las palabras
Y ellos con la guerra

Los creíste taI vez
Como yo, equivocada 
Dignos portadores
De la voz del Che Guevara

Mas los « pueblos que se alzan 
En la lucha final »
Son sólo la excusa
Para poder matar

Te esperamos Ingrid 
Pensamos en ti
Y no seremos libres 
Hasta que estés aquí

No sé quiénes son
Los que como tú
Se pudren en prisiones 
Desde el Norte hasta el Sur

Pobres inocentes
Sin nombre, olvidados 
Que sufren la barbarie 
Por los dos costados

De narcotraficantes
De un poder corrupto
De un presidente indigno 
Pagas el tributo

Ingrid, también quiero 
Cuando canto contigo 
Recordar que combates 
Contra un doble enemigo

Te esperamos Ingrid 
Pensamos en ti
Y no seremos libres 
Hasta que estés aquí

Tres años en la selva 
Atada y sin luz 
Perdida en la noche 
Tres años en la cruz

Y sigues pese a todo 
Fuerte y erguida
Te vengas de esos locos 
Permaneciendo en vida

Ingrid Betancourt 
Coraje y valor
Tu nombre es un grito 
Y un canto de amor

Por todos los que amas 
Continúas serena
Por los que no te olvidan 
Romperás tus cadenas

Te esperamos Ingrid 
Pensamos en ti
Y no seremos libres 
Hasta que estés aquí

Te esperamos Ingrid 
Pensamos en ti
Y no seremos libres 
Hasta que estés aquí

Ils feraient aussi bien leur boulot tout en rose

Dans ce bar parisien au cœur de Montparnasse

J’ai mon coin réservé, j’ai ma petite place
Dans le calme, le silence ou bien le brouhaha
Et je noircis des pages de rimes et de prose 
À la Close, à la Close

Dans ce décor de cuir, de cuivre et d’acajou
Sous les lampes vieillottes, cette douce pénombre 
Je regarde passer les bourgeois, les voyous
Et puis les écrivains et les femmes du monde

Ce monde qui défile, qui s’abreuve et qui pose 
À la Close, à la Close

Sur les tables, gravés dans le laiton vieilli
Il y a les noms de ceux, plus célèbres que moi 
Qui vinrent fréquenter cet endroit inouï
Pour y boire l’Absinthe et la mélancolie

Hemingway, Aragon, Lénine et Machin-chose 
À la Close, à la Close

C’est dans ce bel endroit inconnu des blaireaux 
Que je t’ai rencontrée mon amour, ma beauté 
Pour toi j’ai retrouvé le joli goût de l’eau 
Renoncé pour toujours au poison anisé

Ont perdu la mémoire 
Pas un mot à la gloire
De ces nations Indiennes

Qui respectaient la vie 
Et la terre et ses fruits
Et prêtaient aux fourmis

Dans des réserves sordides 
Où vous crevez, tranquilles 
Alcool, drogues, suicides 
Loin du monde qui braille

Toi tu as pris ton fusil
Pour refuser l’oubli
Tu n’as pas leur folie
Tu as tiré en l’air

Et tu as pris perpette 
Trente ans que tu végètes 
À l’ombre des tempêtes 
Qui agitent la terre

Du fond de ta cellule 
Dis-leur qu’on les encule

Je vis très loin de toi 
Mais, tu sais, je suis là 
Tu entendras ma voix 
Un jour dans les nuages

Au pays de Voltaire 
Résonne la colère 
Contre ces tortionnaires 
Qui t’ont jeté en cage

Puisse un jour ma chanson 
Aux murs de ta prison 
Ouvrir un horizon 
D’amour et de lumière

Devenir un totem
Pour te dire « je t’aime »
L’innocent qu’on enchaîne 
Sera toujours mon frère

Que t'ignores tes pouvoirs
Mais tu l'as bien compris

Des fringues que tu veux pas

Tu peux r'garder la télé
Y'a Drucker

Réponds pas au téléphone
Sauf si on te téléphone
Pis surtout t'ouvres à personne

Elle a monté ses affaires
Ses lunettes et son cartable
Posé son gros dictionnaire 
Sur la table

Y'avait pas beaucoup d'images
La gamine a pas aimé, lui a arraché
Toutes les pages

S'il flaire le bon coup, s'il sent l'odeur des dollars
Alors, pour se rendre au rendez-vous il prendra la plus belle""

Mit sur sa poitrine une étoile, son chapeau de castor
Puis au volant d'une bagnole rutilante et costaud
Il fonça vers ce qu'il pensait être une affaire en or

Lorsqu'il arriva à la voie ferrée, il vit les insurgés
Il comprit alors qu'il avait été piégé comme un bleu

Quelque part au pays des vertes vallées ?
As-tu toujours vingt ans pour ce cœur si fidèle
Qui te pleure chaque jour et t'aimera à jamais ?
Ou bien n'es-tu plus qu'un très lointain souvenir
Qu'une photo jaunie, abîmée, oubliée
Accrochée dans un coin dans un vieux cadre en cuir
Recouvert de poussière depuis tant d'années ?

A-t-on joué du tambour
Du fifre, au petit jour
Comme marche funèbre
Lorsqu'ils t'ont mis en terre ?
Ont-ils joué ""The last post"" pour tes restes
Et puis les cornemuses ""Flowers of the forest""?

À présent le soleil se couche sur les prés
Et une douce brise fait se plier les fleurs
Les rouges coquelicots, rouges du sang versé
Envahissent les tombes en tapis de couleurs
Oubliés la mitraille, les gaz, les barbelés
Que des milliers de croix à perte d'horizon
Des milliers de nos frères décimés et damnés
Par la folie des hommes amoureux des canons

A-t-on joué du tambour
Du fifre, au petit jour
Comme marche funèbre

Je dois te quitter, mon vieux Willie McBride
Mais je voudrais encore te demander ceci
Pensais-tu vraiment que cette folle guerre
Mettrait fin pour toujours à toutes les guerres ?
Croyais-tu qu'elle serait la dernière de toutes ?
Savais-tu que les hommes en suivant cette route
Ont continué les tueries, la barbarie, la mort
Que le feu a tonné encore et encore ?

Renaud,"Ils s'embrassent au mois de Janvier,
Car une nouvelle année commence,
Mais depuis des éternités
L'a pas tellement changé la France.
Passent les jours et les semaines,
Y'a que le décor qui évolue,
La mentalité est la même
Tous des tocards, tous des faux culs.

Ils sont pas lourds, en février,
À se souvenir de Charonne,
Des matraqueurs assermentés
Qui fignolèrent leur besogne,
La France est un pays de flics,
À tous les coins du rue y'en a cent,
Pour faire régner l'ordre public
Ils assassinent impunément.

Quand on exécute au mois de mars,
De l'autre côté des Pyrénées,
Un anarchiste du Pays basque,
Pour lui apprendre à se révolter,
Ils crient, ils pleurent et ils s'indignent
De cette immonde mise à mort,
Mais ils oublient que la guillotine
Chez nous aussi fonctionne encore.

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone,
C'est pas ce qu'on fait de mieux en ce moment,
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône,
Je parierai pas qu'il est allemand.

On leur a dit, au mois d'avril,
À la télé, dans les journaux,
De pas se découvrir d'un fil,
Que le printemps c'était pour bientôt,
Les vieux principes du seizième siècle,
Et les vieilles traditions débiles,
Ils les appliquent tous à la lettre,
Y me font pitié ces imbéciles.

Ils se souviennent, au mois de mai,
D'un sang qui coula rouge et noir,
D'une révolution manquée
Qui faillit renverser l'Histoire,
Je me souviens surtout de ces moutons,
Effrayés par la Liberté,
S'en allant voter par millions
Pour l'ordre et la sécurité.

Ils commémorent au mois de juin
Un débarquement de Normandie,
Ils pensent au brave soldat ricain
Qu'est venu se faire tuer loin de chez lui,
Ils oublient qu'à l'abri des bombes,
Les Français criaient ""Vive Pétain"",
Qu'ils étaient bien planqués à Londres,
Que y'avait pas beaucoup de Jean Moulin.

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone,
C'est pas la gloire, en vérité,
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône,
Me dites pas qu'il est portugais.

Ils font la fête au mois de juillet,
En souvenir d'une révolution,
Qui n'a jamais éliminé
La misère et l'exploitation,
Ils s'abreuvent de bals populaires,
Du feux d'artifice et de flonflons,
Ils pensent oublier dans la bière
Qu'ils sont gouvernés comme des pions.

Au mois d'août c'est la liberté,
Après une longue année d'usine,
Ils crient ""Vive les congés payés"",
Ils oublient un peu la machine,
En Espagne, en Grèce ou en France,
Ils vont polluer toutes les plages,
Et par leur unique présence,
Abîmer tous les paysages.

Lorsqu'en septembre on assassine,
Un peuple et une liberté,
Au cœur de l'Amérique latine,
Ils sont pas nombreux à gueuler,
Un ambassadeur se ramène,
Bras ouverts il est accueilli,
Le fascisme c'est la gangrène
À Santiago comme à Paris.

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone,
C'est vraiment pas une sinécure,
Et le roi des cons, sur son trône,
Il est français, ça j'en suis sûr.

Finies les vendanges en octobre,
Le raisin fermente en tonneaux,
Ils sont très fiers de leurs vignobles,
Leurs ""Côtes-du-Rhône"" et leurs ""Bordeaux"",
Ils exportent le sang de la terre
Un peu partout à l'étranger,
Leur pinard et leur camembert
C'est leur seule gloire à ces tarés.

En Novembre, au salon de l'auto,
Ils vont admirer par milliers
Le dernier modèle de chez Peugeot,
Qu'ils pourront jamais se payer,
La bagnole, la télé, la tiercé,
C'est l'opium du peuple de France,
Lui supprimer c'est le tuer,
C'est une drogue à accoutumance.

En décembre c'est l'apothéose,
La grande bouffe et les petits cadeaux,
Ils sont toujours aussi moroses,
Mais y'a de la joie dans les ghettos,
La Terre peut s'arrêter de tourner,
Ils rateront pas leur réveillon
Moi je voudrais tous les voir crever,
Étouffés de dinde aux marrons.

Être né sous le signe de l'hexagone,
On peut pas dire que ça soit bandant
Si le roi des cons perdait son trône,
Y'aurait cinquante millions de prétendants.",Hexagone [Bobino 80],2011

Dans la banlieue où qui fait nuit
La petite route est déserte
Gérard Lambert rentre chez lui
Dans le lointain les mobylettes poussent des cris
Ca y' est j'ai planté le décor
Créé l' climat de ma chanson
Ca sent la peur ça pue la mort
J'aime bien c' t' ambiance pas vous ? ah bon
Voici l'histoire proprement dite
Voici l'intrigue de ma chanson
Gérard Lambert roule très vite
Le vent s'engouffre dans son blouson
Dans le lointain les bourgeois dorment comme des cons
Lorsque soudain survient le drame
Juste à la sortie d'un virage
Y'a plus d'essence dans la bécane
Gérard Lambert est fou de rage !

T'aurais pas dû Gérard Lambert
Aller ce soir là à Rungis
T'aurais dû rester chez ta mère
Comme un bon fils

Il met sa mob sur la béquille
S'assied par terre et réfléchit
Dans cette banlieue de bidonvilles
Y'a pas un pompe ouverte la nuit !
Dans le lointain y'a une sirène qui s'évanouit
Qu'est ce que j' vais faire bordel de dieu ?
J' vais quand même pas rentrer à pied !
Plus y s'angoisse moins ça va mieux
Quand soudain lui surgit une idée :
J' vais siphonner un litre ou deux
Dans l' réservoir de cette bagnole
Et pis après j'y crève les pneus
Comme ça gratuitement par plaisir
Faut bien que j' me défoule un peu
J' suis énervé
Une fois son forfait accompli
Gérard Lambert va repartir
La mobylette veut rien savoir
C'est le bon Dieu qui l'a puni!

T'aurais pas dû Gérard Lambert
Aller ce soir là à Rungis
T'aurais dû rester chez ta mère
Comme un bon fils

Alors pendant une demi heure
Dans son moteur il tripatouille
Il est crevé il est en sueur
Il a du cambouis jusqu'aux coudes
Dans le lointain le jour se lève
Comme d'habitude
A c' moment là un mec arrive
Un p'tit loubard aux cheveux blonds
Et qui lui dit comme dans les livres
""S'te plaît dessine moi un mouton
Une femme à poil ou un calibre
Un cran d'arrêt une mobylette
Tout c' que tu veux mon pote t'es libre
Mais dessine moi quequ' chose de chouette!
Dans le lointain y' s' passe plus rien
Du moins il me semble

Alors d'un coup d' clé à molette
Bien placé entre les deux yeux
Gérard Lambert éclate la tête
Du Petit Prince de mes deux !
Faut pas gonfler Gérard Lambert

Sur l' toit et sur l' capot l'avait les deux bandes blanches

Dédé l'avait fait r'peindre en bleu métallisé
Y disait qu'ça lui rapp'lait l' ciel de son pays
On a jamais bien su où qu' c'est qu'il était né
Vu qu'il était menteur comme tous ceux de sa race

Dans la tire à Dédé
J'en ai fait des virées
Quand j'y repense aujourd'hui
Sur ma mob je m'ennuie

Sur la lunette arrière y' avait l'autocollant
Avec allez les verts et sur la vitre avant
Y avait marqué en blanc sur un fond bleu d'azur
""Skiez à Val d'Isère et respirez l'air pur""
Elle pompait à peu près autant d' fuel aux cent bornes
Que Dédé buvait d' bière mais faut dire qu'y tenait bien
Quand on s' tapait l' Sébastopol à 220
Pour qu' les flics nous rattrapent il fallait qu'ils s' cramponnent

Dans la tire à Dédé
J'en ai fait des virées
Quand j'y repense aujourd'hui
Sur ma mob je m'ennuie

Quand Dédé en tenait un coup dans les naseaux
Bien qu' j'ai pas mon permis c'est moi qui conduisait
J' prenais qu' les sens uniques pour semer les perdreaux
Et j' bouclais ma ceinture parc' que j' suis pas givré
On embarquait des grosses qui rodaient en banlieue
Et qu'attendait que nous pour s'éclater un peu
""Allez monté les filles on s'arrache en vacances""
Dix bornes plus loin on leur f'sait l' coup d' la panne d'essence

Dans la tire à Dédé
J'en ai fait des virées
Quand j'y repense aujourd'hui
Sur ma mob je m'ennuie

Mais une nuit des voyous, des vrais enfants d' salauds
Pendant qu' Dédé pionçait z' y' ont fracturé son box
Z' y' ont tirés son klaxon et son autoradio
Ses cassettes de Mike Brant et ses jantes en inox
Dédé le lendemain en voyant le tableau
Lui qu'avait une santé d'académicien
S'est chopé l'infarctus dont nous cause les journaux
Et l'a cassé sa pipe tout seul au p'tit matin

Dans la tire à Dédé
J'en ai fait des virées
Quand j'y repense aujourd'hui
Sur ma mob je m'ennuie

Pauvre Dédé aujourd'hui, l'est au cimetière Pantin
Sur sa tombe on a peint deux bandes blanches c'est super
Sa bagnole crève doucement tout au fond du jardin
D'un pavillon d' banlieue prés d' la ligne de chemin d' fer
Les poules ont fait leur nid sur les sièges éventrés
La rouille a tout bouffé la peinture et les chromes
Le pare-brise et les phares dégommés par les mômes
Y reste bientôt plus rien d' la pauvre tire à Dédé

Renaud,"Dans l'eau de la Sorgue Fanny
Ne se baignera plus jamais
La rivière pleure dans son lit
Sa Fanny toute rhabillée
La belle n'ira plus dans l'eau
Depuis cent ans elle se cache
A l'ombre d'un joli tableau
Qu'un amant fit d'elle à la gouache
Et c'est au bistrot désormais
Qu'on peut voir dans l'angle d'un mur
Le cul de Fanny dévoilé
Promettant la bonne aventure.

Au bord de la Sorgue où Fanny
S'en allait se baigner jadis
Sous les platanes du Midi
Les boules de pétanque glissent
Que je pointe ou bien que je tire
Les miennes finissent dans l'herbe
J'pourrais mieux faire mais faut dire
Je triche un petit peu pour perdre
Pour pouvoir un jour dans ma vie
Honorer divines fesses
Un genou en terre pardi
Ainsi qu'on célèbre une messe
J'irai Fanny jusqu'à ramper.

Quel est le crétin misogyne
Qui décréta punition
Honteuse ridicule indigne
Cette noble communion
Cette intimité que je souhaite
De mes lèvres avec ce cul
Qui récompense la défaite
Qui ne brille que pour les vaincus
M'est avis que ce pauvre naze
Dut passer sa vie à prier
A genoux pour que sa bourgeoise
Lui offre pareil bienfait.

Au pays des Sorgues Fanny
Peut se vanter d'avoir fait mettre
Un genou à terre à celui
Qui pour aucun dieu ou maître
Nulle loi nulle discipline
Qui devant nulle autorité
N'aurait jamais courbé l'échine
Jamais n'aurait capitulé
Je me prosternerai encore
Bien plus et sans honte jamais

Renaud,"Petit Portoricain, bien intégré quasiment New-Yorkais
Dans mon building tout de verre et d’acier
Je prends mon job, un rail de coke, un café
Petite fille Afghane, de l’autre côté de la terre
Jamais entendu parler de Manhattan
Mon quotidien c’est la misère et la guerre

Deux étrangers au bout du monde, si différents
Deux inconnus, deux anonymes, mais pourtant
Pulvérisés, sur l’autel, de la violence éternelle

Un 747, s’est explosé dans mes fenêtres
Mon ciel si bleu est devenu orage
Lorsque les bombes ont rasé mon village

Deux étrangers au bout du monde, si différents
Deux inconnus, deux anonymes, mais pourtant
Pulvérisés, sur l’autel, de la violence éternelle

So long, adieu mon rêve Américain
Moi, plus jamais esclave des chiens
Ils t'imposaient l’Islam des tyrans
Ceux-là n'ont-ils jamais lu le Coran?

Suis redevenu poussière
Je serai pas maître de l’univers
Ce pays que j’aimais tellement serait-il
Finalement colosse aux pieds d’argile?

Les dieux, les religions
Les guerres de civilisation
Les armes, les drapeaux, les patries, les nations
Font toujours de nous de la chair à canon

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'This could be heaven or this could be Hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year) you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain
'Please bring me my wine
He said, ""we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty-nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say""

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said, 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

But you can never leave!",Hotel California,1980

How I love les poissons
Love to chop and to serve little fish
First I cut off their heads
Then I pull out their bones
Ah mais oui, ça c'est toujours delice

Les poissons, les poissons
Hee hee hee, haw haw haw
With a cleaver I hack them in two
I pull out what's inside
And I serve it up fried
God, I love little fishes, don't you?

Here's something for tempting the palette
Prepared in the classic technique
First you pound the fish flat with a mallet
Then you slash off their skin
Give their belly a slice
Then you rub some salt in
'Cause it makes it taste nice

Zut alors, I have missed one!

Sacre bleu, what is this?
How on earth could I miss
Such a sweet little succulent crab
Quel dommage, what a loss

Now some flour I think just a dab

Desde el día en que nos despedimos
Una brisa se llevo el vestido
De un amor que parecía eterno

Han pasado tantos años
Me pregunto si aun vistes de blanco
Si el domingo es tu día favorito
Y que hiciste pa' olvidar que te amo

Y si pudieras escribirme en una carta
Que hiciste pa' olvidarte de mi vida
Si pudieras hoy enviarme la esperanza
De llorar porque regresas algún día

Si pudiera enamorarme en otros ojos
No estaría cantando esta canción tan triste
Matarías las tristezas que mi alma
Se alimentan solo porque tu te fuiste

Y se que a mi vida ya no volverás
Yo te lastima el alma y no regresaras
Y se que otros amores te pretenderán
Porque aunque no me olvides no regresarás
ay, ay, ay
ay, ay, ay amor
Porque aunque no me olvides no regresaras

Arrolladora

Me han contado que el olvido
Es el cielo de los que no han muerto
Pero un día quedaron sin cariño
Y hoy luchan por empuñar el viento

Desde el día en que te fuiste
De verdad me siento desolado
Y hoy te escribo este canto tan triste
Por si un día llegas a escucharlo

Y si alguien llega a preguntarte que ha pasado
Con la segunda parte de mi vida
Dile que tu corazón deje en pedazos
Que hoy esta segunda parte esta vacía

Yo fui un tonto por jugar con tu cariño
En el tiempo en que mas me necesitaste
Te engañaba y me portaba como un niño
Y yo no tuve razones pa' engañarte

Y se que a mi vida ya no volverás
Yo te lastime el alma y no regresaras

Mientras tanto tú estas llena de amargura

Sobre todo te agradezco que me hayas enseñado

Rene Camacho,"Quieres pelear esta noche
Estas bromeando pesado
Tu sabes perfectamente
Que siempre te he valorado
Abusas por que te amo
Por que incapaz soy de irme
La confianza mato al gato
No me sigas provocando

Tus espinas me han causado heridas
Heridas que sangran
Que me están amargando la vida
Ya me he cansado
Ya he tolerado cada tontería
Y tu me destrozas
Diciendo que solo te amargo la vida
Que estoy enfadado
Que estoy convencido que no te hago falta
El aire se agota y solo una gota el vaso derrama

Si me olvidara que existe

Me has hecho tantos berrinches

Rene Camacho,"Ya dime la verdad
Te noto rara y distraída
Y la foto del buro
Porque la tienes escondida

Cuando te hablo y te acaricio
Te noto tan ausente
Dime que es lo que te pasa
Que te siento diferente

Ya nunca me despiertas
Con un beso en las mañanas
Ni miramos esa luna
Que se asoma en la ventana

Indudablemente pienso
Que tu amor se esta acabando
Quiero que duermas tranquila
Se que te estoy estorbando

Si tu piensas que te estoy
Haciendo daño con quererte
Hoy empaco mis maletas
Y me iré para no verte

Aunque sufra y me muera
Por no estar mas a tu lado
Puedo ver que de tu amor
Solo cenizas han quedado

Ya dime la verdad
Termina de una vez mi vida
Se esta desmoronando
Aquel amor que me tenias

Ya no me finjas mas
Termina de una vez conmigo

Y me dijiste que olvidar era tan fácil
Hoy te toca el turno
Te darás cuenta que
No se hace con palabras
Fuiste aquella piedra
Que tropezó en mi camino
Te enamoraste y me tiraste
Como basura al olvido
Sin importarte que yo te amaba
Simplemente me olvidaste

Tu la que decías que olvidar era tan fácil
La que apostaba en el amor y en el ganaba
Hoy pides sello en la moneda
Y que ha salido es una cara en la jugada
Hoy se han invertido simplemente los libretos
Hoy eres tu la que se muere por mis besos
Hoy eres tu la que ha escondido
Tanta risa y tanto orgullo en los bolsillos
Ya no te quiero, y ya no digas que mi vida
Se ha quedado condenada entre tus besos, ¡oh no!

Hoy tocas mi puerta
Aquella misma que una vez tu condenaste
Te olvidas? me pisoteaste y
Hasta las huellas de este amor un día borraste
Me queda solo el recuerdo de un
Amor que me hizo daño
Y aunque te extraño
Tu mal recuerdo me a causado tanto daño
Ya no te creo, no me convences
Con tus lagrimas forzadas

Tu la que vivías coqueteandole a la gente
Sin importarle que yo estuviera presente
No es nada mio tu decias, aunque
En el fondo sabias que te escuchaba

Hoy, tu gran sonrisa se ha perdido en el silencio
Hoy solo lloras y hablas de mi todo el tiempo
Y hasta de injusto me has tratado por no aceptarte
A mi lado que ironía

Se ha quedado condenada entre tus besos, ¡oh no!

René Coman,"My baby needs a shepherd
SheÂ´s lost out on the hill
Too late I tried to call her
When the night was cold and still
And I tell myself IÂ´ll find her
But I know I never will
My baby needs a shepherd
SheÂ´s lost out on the hill

My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly
SheÂ´ll not reach sanctuary
Just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her
But I didn't even try
My baby needs an angel
She never learned to fly

Oh I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer
Beating in a different band 
And somewhere on the highway
IÂ´let go of her hand
Now sheÂ´s gone forever
Like her footprints in the sand

Toora loora loora lo
First the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby

My baby needs a pilot
She has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters
Of the Rubicon
But in my soul I know sheÂ´ll
Have to go this one alone
After all that is only way sheÂ´s ever known

But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow
From the corners of my heart
I pray sheÂ´s ride a dolphin
But sheÂ´s swimming with the shark
Out where none can save her
Not even Noah and his ark

Toora loora loora lo
To the cradle comes the crow
Toora loora loora li
My kingdom for a lullaby

My baby needs a mother
To love her till the end
Up every rugged mountain
And down every road that bends
Sometimes I hear her cryin'
But I guess itÂ´s just the wind
My baby needs a mother
To love her till the end",My Baby Needs a Shepherd,2000

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

Rene Gonzalez,"Hace tanto tiempo yo compre una iglesia
A precio de sangre entre crudo dolor
Hace tanto tiempo que envie a mi hijo
Para rescatar lo que se perdió

Hace tanto tiempo que estoy deseando 
Esa humilde entrega, de un adorador
Que solo se postra ante mi presencia
Y no a las ofertas de una posición

Hace tanto tiempo que estoy deseando que 
Muestren mi imagen, que es la del amor
Que no se confunde entre tante gente 
Que sea distinta solo como yo 
Que no divida como suele aveces 
Entrando en contiendas, y en discusión
Buscando alcanzar ser mas grande que el otro
Si en el universo el grande soy yo
Yo quiero una iglesia que me de la gloria

Entre el bien y el mal

Rene Guillou,"Così ti scrivo
Perchè tu possa immaginarmi
Desiderarmi, senza mai sentirmi
Senza mai vedermi

Con un cuscino tutto rosso
E un nuvolare biondo
Freddo come una cascata

Che quel che resta di me
Voli fuori dalla stanza
Se l'aquila vola
C'è ancora qualche futuro
Un aeroporto su uno scoglio
Non è uno scalo sicuro oh 
Ma voglio crederci che
Il cuore è ancora vivo
E così ti scrivo
Che il tempo passa scarrozzando
E sale musica dal bar disotto
E sembra di essere sul jumbo, hm
Siamo schiavi di una vita sola
E come è difficile con la museruola
Morsicare un'altra bocca azzurra che non mi consola

più vicino ai marciapiedi

È solo un film in bianco e nero

E verso l'interno
Qualche nuvola
Dal cielo

Sabbia bagnata

Che il vento
Stà portando via
Punti invisibili
Rincorsi dai cani
Stanche parabole
Di vecchi gabbiani
E io che rimango
Qui solo
A cercare un caffè

Non considera

Si colorerà
La radio e I giornali
E una musica
Banale si diffonderà
Nuove avventure
Discoteche illuminate
Piene di bugie
Ma verso sera
Uno strano concerto
E un ombrellone
Che rimane aperto
Mi tuffo perplesso

Vissuti di già

E lo scaldavo al fuoco umano della gelosia

Per lui ero solo un pagliaccio

E poi mi diceva sempre
""Non vali che un po' più di niente""
Io mi vestivo di ricordi
Per affrontare il presente

E ripensavo ai primi tempi
Quando ero innocente
A quando avevo nei capelli
La luce rossa dei coralli

Quando ambiziosa come nessuna
Mi specchiavo nella luna
E lo obbligavo a dirmi sempre

""Sei bellissima, sei bellissima""

Tucks his napkin up under his chin
And that yellow cow-pie is so mellow it's ripe
But you needn't be ashamed of him
Every Friday he'll go fishing, down on his favorite lake
But he only hooks a perch or two, the whale got away
Looks like we warm the steak

Someday there'll be no more Old Folks
What a lonesome old town this will be
Children's voice at play, will be still for a day
The day they take the Old Folks away",Old Folks,1996

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And even the palms seem to be swaying

So sweet, cool and so fair

Rene Sopa,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,2003
René Thomas,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,

And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

And a rose that is fading
Roses whither away like the sunflower
I yearn to turn my face to the dawn
I am waiting for the day

Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone in the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory,2005

The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days, I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again

Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
And soon it will be morning

Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning

Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun if you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is

Look
A new day has begun",Memory [Original 1982 Recording],2005

Renée Albulario,"A bomb went off this morning raining bodies on TV
They are blaming the insurgents; they are blocking off the streets
And the smoke is rising slowly from the barrel of a gun
The solution to disruption: Order 1081

Now the sunsets are incredible across Manila Bay
You can hear the bombers landing at the U.S. Air Force base
And somewhere in the distance, out beyond the setting sun
They will sign a proclamation: Order 1081

Now, we live down by the water in a shack that's made of wood
And the bankers need to huddle so they need some extra room
We will find us somewhere better; there's enough for everyone
Got a perfect explanation: Order 1081

I thought I ordered coffee, but they gave me 7-Up
Got to clear away these shanties and these ugly nipa huts
So the seeds of our great future, they can grow here when we're done
And it's clearly all because of Order 1081

For thirty days the rain fell--we were nearly washed away
The radio fell silent; nothing left to do but pray
And the senator he told us the guerrillas are on the run
And the reason they are hiding? Order 1081

They are planting plastic flowers on the seaside esplanade
The Pope is speaking Spanish, but we can't hear what he says
Got to stop all this confusion, got to wipe away this scum
And the way to make it happen: Order 1081

It's amazing that the soldiers somehow all know how to dance
It's amazing how the soldiers keep the creases in their pants
Now it's safe to walk the streets at night; a new world has begun
Everybody's sleeping soundly thanks to 1081",Order 1081,2014
Renee Armand,"Ok, a song written by Emmylou Harris
Called 'Boulder to Birmingham'""

I don't want to hear a love song
I got on this airplane just to fly
And I know there's life below me
But all that you can show me 
Is the prairie and the sky

I don't want to hear your sad stories
About heartache and desire
The last time I felt like this
I was in the wilderness
And the canyon was on fire
And I stood on the mountain, in the night
And I watched it burn, I watched it burn
I watched it burn

And I'd rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I'd hold my life in his saving grace 
I'd walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham 
If I thought I could see, I could see your face

Well, you really got me this time 
And the hardest part is knowing I'll survive 
I've come to listen for the sound 
Of the trucks as they rolled on
Out on Highway 95
Pretending it's the ocean 
Coming down to wash me clean, to wash me clean 
You know what I mean

And I'd rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
I'd hold my life in his saving grace 
I'd walk all the way from Boulder to Birmingham

That it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again and even if I'm there
They'll all imply that I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last and I'm soaking
Through and through then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you, and even if my house falls
Down now, I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

I was born on the other side
Just always looking to you
I made it over the great divide

Your forces lined up in battle
Your soldiers and your machines

The darkest hour now you've ever seen

And I'm easy and I'm serious
They try and tear me down
You want me baby I dare you

Like Lazarus from the pit

To the Mexican army. After a 12-day siege, the
Troops of Santa Ana were victorious but too
Exhausted to hold on and the Texans won the
War. It's further from El Paso to Texarkana,
Then from New York to Chicago. And when it
Joined the Union, Texas was the biggest state.
Yeah, everything from Texas is big, larger than
Life and none bigger than little Marvin Aday. So
Big his daddy called him Meat Loaf. He grew
Into a big man, with a big voice. And he sings
Big songs and has big hits. You can try and
Tear him down.

Renee Diggs,"When the evening falls 
And the daylight is fading,
From within me calls
Could it be I am sleeping?
For a moment I stray, 
Then it holds me completely
Close to home - I cannot say
Close to home feeling so far away

As I walk the room there before me a shadow
From another world, where no other can follow
Carry me to my own, to where I can cross over
Close to home - I cannot say
Close to home feeling so far away

Forever searching; never right,
I am lost in oceans of night. 
Forever hoping I can find memories
Those memories I left behind

Even though I leave will I go on believing
That this time is real - am I lost in this feeling?
Like a child passing through, 
Never knowing the reason
I am home - I know the way
I am home - feeling oh, so far away

And the past is a blue note, inside me

Sweet kids in hunger slums

Firecrackers break and they cross
And they dust and they skate
And the night comes

You look like a city
But you feel like religion to me

Where God and the tendaberry rise

Where quakers and revolutionaries
Join for life, for precious years
Join for life, through silver tears

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Or I'll never fall in love
In a restless world like this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

When I give my heart it will be completely
Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
And the moment I can feel
That you feel the same way too
Is when I fall in love with you

On the light in your eyes when I surrender,

Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

You may ask yourself, ""What is that beautiful house?""
You may ask yourself, ""Where does that highway go to?""
You may ask yourself, ""Am I right, am I wrong?""
You may say to yourself, ""My God! What have I done?""

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground

Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, look where my hand was

Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, hey let's all twist our thumbs
Here comes the twister

Letting the days go by
Letting the days go by
Once in a lifetime
Let the water hold me down

Renee Spearman,"I want to start things out by giving testimony 
Cause one of my friends got ill seriously 
Now the doctor told him ain't no way you gone' live 
But he prayed his prayer in faith 
And a miracle appeared 

 Its already alright,Its already alright 
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down 
Just bow and pray And then give it all up 
And know everything's gonna be okay 
Just throw your hands up 
And then wave them left to right 
And now do your dance child 
Cause its alright already 
Always surrounded by negativity 
This might be where I live 
But it ain't gonna change me 
Gotta work on my mind 
And keep my actions pure 
And when I stumble, I know who has the cure 
So any time your feeling down 
Just lift your voice in praise 
It'll pick you right up 
And you can come to Him don't be afraid 
Anytime , day or night He can give you what you need 
And if you pray your prayer in faith 
And in your heart believe that 
 
When life's problems get you down 
Can't find no peace nowhere around 
Trust in the spirit you can't see 
Its bout to bring you your relief 
Go ahead and cry now , Its alright 
Cause now you're cryin tears of joy 
This life ain't hurting you no more 
Cause you know its already alright 

Its already alright,Its already alright 
And all you got to do is Just bow your head down 
Just bow and pray And then give it all up 
And know everything's gonna be okay

Renee Spearman,"I remember the first time, you laughed with me
And I remember the promises,
You would never leave my side
Now I'm standing with the news of a tragedy
Standing here with a fragile heart,
You see I never shed a tear
I stayed strong for them, oh yes I did
When everybody disappears
It's only you who keeps me strong
And I can't imagine going on
Without you in my life,
Going on with a fragile heart

When I think about,think about life
Lord I think of you
I forget about everything else, there's only you and I
And I can't think about ever giving up 
Can't give up the fight (no, no)
The only thing that matters Lord, is you

I ain't got no time to pretend
That I'm not missing you, oh no no no no
I know you're in good hands
Same hands that hold my heart
And I'll cherish every moment we spent
As a gift from God above
For he takes care of all the fragile hearts

When I think about, think about life
Lord I think of you, and I
Forget about everything else 
There's only you and I 
I can't think about, ever, ever, ever giving up
For the only thing that matters, when I'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you

You see my fragile heart's been broken
And you're the only one who can put it all together again   
So I'm trusting you Lord to see me through

There's only you and I
I can't think about ever giving
I can't give up(up a fight)
The only thing that matters
When I'm going through
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you 
When I think about my life
I,I,I,I forget about everything else
Only you and I
And I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up, No, no, no, no
The only thing that matters when I'm going through 
Is giving my fragile heart back to you.

When I think about my life, I forget about everything else
Only you and I
And I can't think about ever giving up
Can't give up, can't give up
For the only thing that matter's when I'm going through 
Is giving my fragile heart back to you.",Fragile Heart,2001
