Burt Bacharach,"I have to say that we should finish it now
Before we weaken 'cause we already know this is wrong
I could give in
Sometimes I think that I will
Despite the temptation I try to be very strong
If my reluctance seems a surprise
It's not 'cause I don't want you
But I just
Know I must
Hesitate
Because I still have that other girl in my head
I still have that other girl in my head
There may be ugly rumors that I have been lying
There may be angry tears but they're never worth the crying
That is why
Sometimes
I hesitate
Because I still have that other girl in my head
I still have that other girl in my head
I still have that other girl in my head",I Still Have That Other Girl [Live],1998
Burt Bacharach,"Such a picture of loveliness 
Didn't you notice the resemblance? 
Doesn't it look like she could speak? 
Those eyes I tried to capture 
They are lost to me now forever 
They smile for someone else 

Funny, how looks can be deceiving 
But she's not easily 
Painted from memory 

You'd think that I would know by now 
Those eyes I tried to capture 
They are lost to me now forever 
They smile for someone else 

And so this had to be 
Painted from memory 

She is gone, and I must accept it 
She is lost to me now 
But I can't look away just yet though 
She smiles for someone else 

And so this had to be 
Painted from memory 

Funny, now I can see 
How looks can be deceiving 

And so this had to be 
Painted from memory 

Funny, now I can see 
How looks can be deceiving",Painted from Memory [Live],1998
Burt Bacharach,"If you ever get out to Hasbrook Heights
And you're dying to see some sights
Don't be lonely
Just phone me
I'll come and get you
I'll show you a good time

Da bop bop

You won't need a motel in Hasbrook Heights
No one ever has a sleepless night
Now at my house it's your house
Go kick your shoes off
Start having a good time
Each day is like a week's vacation
Come rest up
Bring along your swim suit
That's how we get dressed up

You can get away from it all at Hasbrook Heights
If you're tired of neon lights
We've got sun beams 
And moon beams
And friendly people
They'll show you a good time

Throw some things in a grip
Take the early train
It's a beautiful trip
Don't forget the name

Burt Bacharach,"Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment we kissed the night of the hay ride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm while takin' a sleigh ride

Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The telephone call that tied up the line for hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve to send you some flowers

Magic moments, mem'ries we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

(The way that we cheered whenever our team was scoring a touchdown)
The time that the floor fell out of my car when I put the clutch down
(The penny arcade, the games that we played, the fun and the prizes)
The Halloween hop when everyone came in funny disguises

Magic moments filled with love",Magic Moments,1998
Burt Bacharach,"So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you
On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed, I believed in love
Now here I stand
I wonder why

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times
I know I could have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife, hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone

By myself
On my own, I've got to find where I belong again
On my own
I've got to learn how to be strong again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself by myself, by myself
I've got to find out what was mine again
On my own
My heart is saying that it's my time again
On my own
And I have faith that I will shine again
On my own
I (on my own) have faith (on my own) in me",On My Own,1998
Burt Bacharach,"If I were a tower of strength, I'd walk away
I'd look in your eyes and here's what I'd say
""I don't want you, I don't need you, I don't love you anymore""
And I'd walk out that door

You'd be down on your knees
You'd be calling to me
But a tower of a-strength is a-something 
I'll never be

If I were a tower of strength, I'd watch you cry
I'd laugh at your tears and tell you goodbye
""I don't want you, I don't need you, I don't love you anymore""

Burt Bacharach,"There goes the forgotten man
There goes the forgotten man
Walkin' alone
Walkin' all alone!

I used to be known as Jennie's guy
They point me out when I walk by
Oh, yes everyone noticed me
'Till one night a stranger came
And stole my love away
And now I hear people say

There goes the forgotten man
There goes the forgotten man
Walkin' alone
Walkin' all alone!

They turn away when I pass by
Guess they're afraid I'll start to cry

That I lost everything
That's why they are whispering

Blue on blue now that we are through
Blue on blue, heartache on heartache
And I find I can't get over losing you

I walk along the street we used to walk
Two by two, lovers pass
And as they're passing by, I could die
'Cause you're not here with me
Now the trees are bare
There's sadness in the air

Burt Bacharach,"Do you know the way to San Jose
I've been away so long
I may go wrong and lose my way
Do you know the way to San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star
Weeks turn into years
How quick they pass
And all the stars that never were
Are parking cars and pumping gas

You can really breathe in San Jose
They've got a lot of space
There'll be a place where I can stay
I was born and raised in San Jose
I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose

Fame and fortune is a magnet
It can pull you far away from home
With a dream in your heart you're never alone

Dreams turn into dust and blow away
And there you are without a friend
You pack your car and ride away

I've got lots of friends in San Jose
Do you know the way to San Jose?

L.A. is a great big freeway
Put a hundred down and buy a car
In a week, maybe two, they'll make you a star

Burt Bacharach,"When there's a moon above
It is something to see how the fellas follow the girls
They're all in search of love
There isn't a lover, who doesn't discover
That if it's made in Paris
You can bet that there is a girl for every boy

Burt Bacharach,"Dearest darling I had to write to say that I won't be home anymore
'Cause something happened to me while I was driving home
And I'm not the same anymore
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I saw a welcoming light and stopped to rest for the night

And that is when I saw her as I pulled in outside of the small motel she was there
And so I walked up to her, asked where I could get something to eat
And she showed me where
Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
She took me to the café, I asked her if she would stay, she said okay

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
The jukebox started to play and night time turned into day as we were dancing 
Closely, all of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms
And I caressed her, kissed her, told her I'd die 
Before I would let her out of my arms

Oh, I was only twenty four hours from Tulsa
Ah, only one day away from your arms
I hate to do this to you but I love somebody new, what can I do?
And I can never, never, never go home again",Twenty-Four Hours from Tulsa,1998
Burt Bacharach,"What's it all about, Alfie
Is it just for the moment we live
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie
Are we meant to take more than we give
Or are we meant to be kind
And if only fools are kind, Alfie
Then I guess it's wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more
Something even non-believers can believe in
I believe in love, Alfie
Without true love we just exist, Alfie
Until you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie
When you walk let your heart lead the way
And you'll find love any day, Alfie, Alfie",Alfie [From Alfie],1999
Burt Bacharach,"One less bell to answer
One less egg to fry

I should be happy
But all I do is cry

(Cry, cry, no more laughter) I should be happy
(Oh, why did he go) I only know that
Since he left my life's so empty

Though I try to forget it just can't be done

I don't know how in the world
To stop thinking of him
Cause I still love him so

Burt Bacharach,"What's her name today?
What's her name today?
She could be anyone
I might have known you'd leave her crying
What's her name again?
You should be ashamed
How could you treat her so unspeakably?
Or did you think she was a different girl?

For as the radio played in the bedroom wall
What was that name you called her?
Was she the one who took away your pride
And your reason?
Oh, why did you decide that
You'd punish any girl you meet
To try and make that feeling go away?

What's her name today?
What's her name today?
Is her hair hanging down?
Or maybe it's fixed with a ribbon

Are her eyes still blue?
Should she trust in you?
Because it's a lonely world
She wants to believe for a while in all the things you say

But as the radio played in the bedroom wall
What was that name you called her?
Isn't her smile reminiscent of someone else?
Well, is it or isn't it?
Oh, why did you decide that
You'd punish any girl you meet
To try and make that feeling go away?

What's her name today?
Is she going to stay
So you can ruin her?
And soon she'll be twisted in chiffon

Dress her like a doll
String her like a pearl
She hears peals of bells, but it's hard to tell
Now that she's hung up like a chandelier

She almost makes the day begin
I've grown accustomed to the tune she whistles night and noon

Are second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I was serenely independent and content before we met
Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to her looks, accustomed to her voice
Accustomed to her face

She's second nature to me now
Like breathing out and breathing in
I'm very grateful she's a woman and so easy to forget
Rather like a habit one can always break and yet

Burt Bacharach,"When Liberty Valance rode to town
The women folk would hide, they'd hide
When Liberty Valance walked around
The men would step aside
Cause the point of a gun was the only law
That Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good

From out of the East a stranger came,
A law book in his hand, a man
The kind of a man the west would need
To tame a troubled land;

That Liberty understood
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,

Just tryin' to build a peaceful live
Where love is free to grow;
But the point of a fun was the only law
That Liberty understood
When the final showdown came at last
A law book was no good

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, that night.
When nothing she said could keep her man
From going out to fight
From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other,
only one returns

Ah only one day away from your arms

I saw a welcoming light and stopped to rest for the night

As I pulled in outside of a small motel
She was there and so I walked up to her
Asked where I could get something to eat and she showed me where

She took me to a cafe I asked her if she would stay
She said okay

Oh the jukebox started to play

All of a sudden I lost control as I held her charms
And I caressed her, kissed her 
Told her I'd die before I let her out of my arms

'Cause yesterday's over and I've got to live for today
I'm goin' to a place and nothing can stand in my way

No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
I know my way now, I'll never look back from this day on
Yesterday is over, can't you see it's over
And I begin livin' today
I mean to borrow one day from tomorrow
And I'm gonna spend it on sunshine and things that I love
I'm gonna reach out and touch every star above

When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good.

From out of the east a stranger came,
A law book in his hand, a man.
The kind of a man the west would need
To tame a troubled land;
Cause the point of a gun was the only law
That liberty understood.
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good.
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good.

Many a man would face his gun
And many a man would fall,
The man who shot liberty valance,
He shot liberty valance,
He was the bravest of them all.

The love of a girl can make a man
Stay on when he should go, stay on.
Just tryin' to build a peaceful live
Where love is free to grow;
But the point of a fun was the only law
That liberty understood.
When the final showdown came at last
A law book was no good.

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, that night.
When nothing she said could keep her man
From going out to fight.
From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other,
Only one returns.

Everyone heard two shots ring out,
One shot made liberty fall
The man who shot liberty valance,
He shot liberty valance,
He was the bravest of them all.

Is it just for the moment we live?
What's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?

Or are we meant to be kind?

Then I guess it is wise to be cruel
And if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie
What will you lend on an old golden rule?
As sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie
I know there's something much more,
Something even non-believers can believe in

Turned toward the heavens on a dark and stormy winter afternoon

ev'ry second record on the radio seemed like our song
How we hurt each other; oh baby it was so wrong
something in the bottom of my heart will keep me holding on

'cause you saved my soul
you came along and took me out of the night time
Yeah you saved my soul
taught me to fly...and I gave my heart
and babe that's something that there's jut no returning
'cause if I have you now I'll never have to make it alone.

We were lovers for so long
every second record on the radio seemed like our song
even though we're older, things we're feeling can't be all wrong
something in the bottom of my heart will keep me holding on.

I told you baby, I'd beat it home so soon
But if you're really worryin' 'bout what I'm doin' in your backyard

Not a chance of gettin' off the ground
And I mighta lost some o' my marbles
So I'm checkin' with the lost and found

I'm only tryna stay ahead of danger
And the tickin' of the thin red hand
But in a half a second I got older
It's gettin' harder now to understand

Wo woh time keep runnin'
Gettin' my stopwatch wound
Wo woh moon or sunnin'
Day and night'll both be day
And night'll both be
Keepin' me above the ground

Been wakin' up with my nose in the eggs now
And I suppose that I could use a shower
But I'll never turn the other cheek now
I guess the ""Tude"" is gettin' dark and sour

I gotta man-up to what I been thinkin'
Not a crime to wanna kick it alone
But I have come to know what is a real crime
To mortify what you don't own
Wo woh, time keep runnin'

Gettin' my stopwatch wound
Wo woh, moon or sunnin'
Day and night'll both be day
And night'll both be
Keepin' me above the ground

Shoot for the ground
And you know what you'll find
You'll get the ground every time
Shoot for the moon
While your thoughts stay sublime
You'll get something in between

Don't have to see it in perpetual motion
Don't have to see it in the wind or in the stars

Said I knew some people at the top
Nice little singer took me up in the mountains
Got her started and she just wouldn't stop

I saw my hero in People magazine
Had a new liver and a walking cane
Last time I saw him he said I was trying too hard
Then they hauled him off to prison again
Yeah, they locked him up in prison again

Feelin' like a gambler on the streakiest day
Still got no regard for the odds
Times like that your judgment kinda wanders away
You're crazy if you mess with the gods

I saw my big guy doin' dead man's curve
He could barely keep it on the road
They got a law now that allows the gendarmes
To confiscate your humble abode
Well they went in and they took the whole load

I did some talkin' to a girl in Honolulu
Seems I was less than polite
Her island warrior showed my face where the ground was
Twenty-seven stitches that night
A lot of second-guessing that night

Feelin' like a gambler on the streakiest day
Still got no regard for the odds
Times like that your judgment kinda wanders away
You're crazy if you mess with the gods
Crazy if you mess with the gods, yeah

You saw it in a baby's smile
You saw it in your mother cryin' silver teardrops
Hey, I thought that stuff was invisible
And I said hey, I thought that stuff was invisible

You felt it in a heartbeat
You heard it in a sermon
You felt it at the race track
Saw it in the church goin' people
You heard it on the radio

You got it from behind the iron curtain
You felt it in a royal flush
Even had the damnedest dreams about it
Hey, I thought that stuff was invisible
And I said hey, I thought that stuff was invisible

Patience be, the mystery will unfold
Comfort me and hold me through my night time
Do that never again will my spirit feel this cold

I lay my money down

Burton Cummings,"I can feel the powers at play
I feel fear and I back away
From what they send me, from what they send me
Powers that thrive and powers so real
Some arcane and some genteel

They make me humble
They're here to rumble
The simple dark or the simple light
The simple wrong or the simple right
Will not save me, if they enslave me

Here sits Jim and there sits John
They call back from the great beyond
Can you not hear them? You must not fear them
Here one speaks in a garbled tongue
Lies are spoken while truths are sung

It's never ended
Beliefs extended
Poet sits with cursed hag
Martyrs gamble and saints will brag
While angels scorn them, and we will mourn them

What do you think you been doin' here
You think this is just some favor?
There ain't no waiters in the parlor now
And you don't pick the flavor

I had hours and I had days
I had living explain its ways
I had my loved ones, I had my loved ones
I felt solid and I felt whole
I had spirits wrapped round my soul

They were a treasure
Unbridled pleasure
The simple wrong or the simple right
The simple dark or the simple light
Will never be enough

Never be enough
They will never be enough
Never be enough

He started goofin', countin' all the grains of sand
About a thousand and thirty he was gettin' kinda dirty
And he looked at himself and he laughed

He had a revelation, had a revelation
He had some kinda knowledge comin'
In from somewhere else for free
He had a revelation, special information
And I'm hopin' they'll be catchin' it

Usin' clever phrases she would always hafta stop and explain
As each sentence ended all her guests were more offended
And she looked at herself and she laughed

Sometimes it's better if you just give in
Never use a hammer on a screw

Was convinced that someday humans would fly
He made some little paper aeroplanes
To show them what he had on his mind

Seen him burnin' like the devil
Or the witch they thought he was

So he kept his big mouth shut
And he didn't have to say goodbye

Hop a freight, grab a star, come back to me.
Catch a flame, catch a breeze, on your hand, on your knees,
Swim up high, only please come on back to me.
On a mule, in a jet, with your hair in a net,
In a shower wet, I don't care.
This is where you should be, from the hills to the shore,
By the wind to my door, raise the highway dust,
Break the law if you must, throw the world, only just
Come back to me.

Blast your hide, you recall, must I fight City hall
Here and now, damn it all, come on back to me,
Where on earth must I be, still I yell till I'm blue,
In control then when you come on back to me.
Have you gone to the moon, or the corner saloon
And to crack and to croon, oh my girl, where in hell can you be?
In a crate, in a trunk, on a horse, on a junk,
In a road or a van, wrapped in mink or saran,
Anyway that you can, came back to me,

You changed the course of me

But you took that right away
When you took you away

I know the choice wasn’t easy
But I don’t know what it took to choose
And I know that you’ll never believe me
But I know that I would have chosen you
Was he ever deserving
Of the finger(?) that we lived without
Did his choice turn out to be ugly
Or are you living with hollow doubts

And I still wonder, where did you go
I still don’t know how you can’t believe
What doors behind you bind you aloud (?)

With one another but without you

Just to push me through another day

But it's so damn hard
When the weight of the world
Is on your shoulders

Now who am I to express and complain
That this is killing me?
It never matters

I said it once and I'll say it all again
Keep screaming, keep waving
You're digging holes and I'm buried inside

No one can hear you
But if we give up now
Then at least we can say we tried

In a years worth of lies
Now I feel so damaged, so broken, so hollow
Now reach out for me touch these cracking ribs

Sometimes I feel you forget my face

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
and to show you around Imaginary Places
Putting many lumps on my bloody stump
Edible habits so I bit the perfect circle
Die in your sleep with the sky at your feet
I'll shoot you when your happy on the day that you will find peace
How did you do it? I don't know, I'm OK!
Every person I know is a secret sorta agent
'cause I'm accused of lewd conducts
All prove hard to rate the prompts(?)
Any kind of rumor for em, may they rest to put me in a loony bin
A funny farm a coo-coo but they need a villain

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
There is not a sicker person that can do it better
No need to skip it in my eco system
But in the audience of me being evil Christian
H.M. know how I hate him so
But he charged me for a halo
But I'm on a scavenger hunt for a map with a chunk
of a sky mirror I'll go crazy with a mud pie
I play dead songs on the sill screen
Iron my shirt it is a chill dream
It is on to lead away to the stair well till we gut him in it
straight up from the center finally fair-well

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
and to give your assault rifle a banana clip
Flow in the dark when I stroll in the park
giving everybody informative pamphlets
No sign of life for as far as I can see
Everybody's just charred meat up in the car seat
""Eat shit and die"" to the secret spy
'cause I have this funny feeling that I'm being watched
24-hour surveillance
Money or power or ailments
Why'd they send the medical that he shimmered me the hammer
it was way too much you coulda went and had 200?

I'm just here to hold your hand when you die
Psycho better cause trouble runnin for your soft spot
Late market closed, and the irk on her nose
Turned into a deadly gas flowin through the air ducts

You did it, you got it
You wowed the world
Of casting agents and cowgirls
Fess up you're dressed up to kill yourself

Girl, I'm a walking plane-crash to your moms and dads
Ostentatious and crass pulling the gauze
Off your scabs
Bitch, I negate the myth of the 'great black boyfriend'
In the Polaroid at the get-together
Wearing a corduroy vest-sweater
So don't get that engagement ring engraved
'Cause before we met you thought
That hoodrats laid eggs
And that rappers were just sky-pirates with peg legs
But I kick it with you simply for the shits and
Giggles, playful innuendo?s
You thought,
""He's just an uber-dred for the federal fiscal cap""
But after brunch, you'll need
2 Sudafed's and a disco nap
After I drain your insides with a crazy straw
You ain't my baby doll-
""'Cause Nigga you reek of coffee shop blend""
My body's a lollypop that caters to the
Miss polyglot?s whim
With addictive agents that outweigh oxycodones
And our phobias perfectly fit
It takes a quirky chick with curvy hips to petrify this
Working-stiff

You did it, you got it

It's like a bed-and-breakfast
I'm sending a text message on my key pad
Saying, ""I have no more to say
To me ex-manager(slash)sea hag divorcee
Except eat shit and die""
My daily commute ends with a fender-bender
'Cause no one acknowledges my ten-year tenure
I've got the know-how the thrill your scene
But they want someone lowbrow, a philistine
With iron-on irony for Viacom's white honkies
They'll send you a girl wearing
Tight thongs under nylon gi's
""Lets all hit!""
But I'm not for the gaudy gangbang
The thought of it turns my member to a soggy plantain
And shit, I get off on news leads
And you pet mouse meat,
Set and poised with sex toys
In your penthouse suite believing you're Lou Reed
I spit used reeds out the wet mouthpiece
Even when sex appeal is taboo,
Electric bills are past due
My head is clear of engineered, election year snafu

Wouldn't placate the functionaries
Too busy making playdates with buxom secretaries
But I hope that my homies don't laugh,
My choreographed dance steps
Are a little effeminate for a sociopath
We've been airbrushed so much we look like a claymation zoo
I'm a voice-over on your Playstation 2
But in my hey-day my ethical fiber
Would turn stages into firewood

I'm at my tittie signing at the Barnes Nobles
You brown-nose but your downloads only show marginal
growth
Why do you dress like a lesbian welder?
Only a middle-aged woman looks sexy in elk fur
You get injured at the hipster bar
I hit you with a ninja star and then I speed off in my
car
My life is like a day-to-day porn shoot
You'll mayday for more troops when I say ""Sorry

See that girl, she's a great lay with her scorched
roots
Plus she's got a grade-A horse caboose
That's my lady! I just squeeze her cheeks
While you sit and twitch like a Jesus freak
You're from Hollywood; you get your sphincter bleached
Sit your ass home and eat your quiche
I'm the dude that your girl would be pleased to meet
She'll want to suck me off with those beaver teeth
But I decline the offer. I drive a flying saucer
To perform on neighboring moons
And do the giddy-up with some iffy slut
Who's drinking pick-me-ups out of those Dixie cups
To the young boozer, and the drug user
But the syringe on the baking teaspoon
That means play this it'll spike your blood sugar
I'll have your soul mate tied to the sub woofer

Make 'em cry bleed, dry heave

We'll extract the bitch in you
Sorry fuckers
And dictate what you listen to

Give them face time with unloved lady's men
Eschewing life through a dumb 80's trend

With a litany of pop culture reference points
My tenor voice will make the women all wet and moist
You act gender bent
While I'm wrestling with women in boxers with leopard
print
And yes, that's me arching a pouring glass at the tee
off
Me getting the boarding pass at the kiosk
Me eating fish with French cream sauce
Be celebrated at the confetti toss
I'm waving from the Project Blowed parade float
Completely nude under my raincoat
While you're in your backpacker entrapments
Battle rapping with a series of gay jokes
You're welcomed to peep game
But when they start riding the jock they seldom deplane
A deceased cock, a pudding geyser
The hung dong's the swung baton of the womanizer
But for my bitches it's a springboard
To a place where dreams are forged
And I'll smack these geeky young twerps
Out of their medium shirts",Sorry Fuckers [*],2009

On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers
Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

Let her go Let her go
God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide
World over
She'll never find a sweeter
Man as me",St. James Infirmary,2002
Bush Ray,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2002
Bush Tetras,"Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
I love you
 
Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, I think you move me
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
You move me

Hunted me with his six gun

Bushido,"Du wurdest mit der Krankheit geboren
Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
die ganze Lust am Leben hast 
Du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
doch du kannst nichts dafür
nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt 
Und seine Hand dich berührt
und er stand vor der Tür
langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick 
Hatte sich langsam geschnürt
und du hörst auf zu zählen
wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, 
Sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, 
Du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
dir zu geben und zu nehmen 
Aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen
Du wirst alt du wirst krank
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb
Ich bin pausenlos gefickt, bitte lauf nicht in das Licht
Refrain

Herzlich willkommen! Oh!
Bushido! 
Yeah, DJ Destue! 
Sentino, hu!
Eine neue Zeit fängt an! Boom! 
Ha! Bara bam bam! 
Fickt euch!

Ich schreibe einen Hit für jeden Penner da draußen, 
Bin berühmter als die Rapper, die schon länger da draußen sind
Aus den Augen, aus dem Sinn, bye bye, geht Jungs
Wenn mein neues Album bald schon dein Scheiß Tape bumst 
1,2 Takes und die Bombe explodiert 
Du suchst Stress, okay, ich komme jetzt zu dir 
Du Idiot hast ein paar glückliche Fans 
Ich mach paar Model-Nutten glücklich vom Rücksitz vom Benz 
Denn es nützt nichts, denn du denkst, dass es dein Image rettet, 
wenn du nette Scheiße rappst als ob du beim Single chattest, ihr 
Kleinkinder hättet gern so viel Style, wie ich, 
Doch dein Flow hat mehr Lücken, als ein Polizei-Bericht 
Also hol die Mics, du Bitch, oder Soda mit Wasser 
Ich falle mit der Tür ins Haus, nenne mich Mohammed psst
Ab jetzt ist nun Berlin am Zug, das Ghetto im Regen 
Ich schlage zu, bis ich nächstes Jahr den Echo gewinne

Fick Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick
Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick

Lass uns wetten, wer als erstes im Benz hockt, 
Ich will grüne Scheine, dass mein Konto so aussieht, wie der Werder Bremen Fanblock
Ich bin Psycho, Psycho meine Ex hat Recht und 
ich mach Cash und du sitzt büß' im Büro 
Mir egal, mit welchen Tourbus du gekommen bist 
Warum ich jetzt zweimal im Bogen, wie das Logo von McDonald´s 
Ich wär' auf dem ganzen Globus was besonderes
wenn ich Fame bin und essen geh schieß' ein Foto von den Pommes 
Bei den Zeilen explodieren nun die Platten
Ich kann die Konkurrenz selber nicht sehen wie Tätowierungen im Nacken 
Bin nur hier, um es zu schaffen, der Rest kann gehen
Bring mir hundert MC´s her, bleiben sechs Mann stehen
Sechs von denen, werden nicht zum Problem falsch, schau mein Handgelenk an 
Es scheint noch greller, als das Licht im OP-Saal 
Also gebt mir ein Mic, gib's mir gleich, fick dir dein Weib
Sie schreit, gib's mir und weit, keiner sonst fickt sie so geil

Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch

Ihr habt die Skyline gesehen, den Bordstein gehört 
Nicht mehr lang, und dann trägt auch Torch meine Shirts 
Vor zwei Jahren, kannten sie noch nicht mal meinen Namen 
Heute lassen alle Spaßten hier das Licht an beim Schlafen 
Klick Licht aus euer Albtraum ist back 
Du kriegst Schüttelfrost und 'ne viertel, halb kaum Respekt, warum? 
Weil du feige bist du Spinner bleibst nichts mehr, 
Als ein alter Sack, der sich von Kindern ein Vichs wär' 
Will etwas von mir Kommt her, ihr Hip Hop Teufel 
Ich mache einen Song und definiere Hip Hop neu 
Denn ihr wohnt im Dorf X, macht auf Nelly am Bahnhof 
Und seht mich auf Viva täglich nach Nelly Furtado 
Ich war schon mit 14 beliebt bei Frauen 
Hatte Schlampen, so wie andre, einen Freestyle-Raum 
Ich leb' meinen Traum, du lebst nur die Illusion 
Ich will Millionen in einer deutschen Villa wohnen

Fick Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh
Deutschland, gib mir nur ein Song, ich schreib euch
Zehntausend Hits, geh raus und fick
Deutschland, gib mir ein Mic und ich zeig euch
Wo lang es geht, solang ich steh

Was für ein krasser Tag die Nachbarschaft verreckt
Ich scheiß auf jeden Vogel der über sein Ganja rappt
Das ist ein ganzer Track vergiss die Nutten und Frauen
Ich seh' die Fans wenn ich laufe wie sie gucken und staunen
Ich weiß woher ich komm ihr wisst woher er kommt
Ich stell mich hin und zieh die Knarre wenn der Mörder kommt

Geh meinem Schicksal entgegen, 
Mein Herz blutet mit Wörtern, meine Tränen sind der Regen, 
Schaurige Szenen die sich in mir niederlegen, 
Ich bin ein Kind der Trauer und vor meinen Augen stirbt der Segen, 
Bin von Einsamkeit und Angst umgeben, 
Und muss diese Zeilen mit den Fasern meines Herzens weben, 
Mich über den Winter meines Kummers erheben, 
Die traurigen Schlachten meiner Träume Gestalt geben 
Musste vieles in meinem Herzen aufgeben, 
Und träume im Dreck von kleinem Glück, so ist es eben, 
Die Sehnsucht hat mir den Lebensdurst gegeben, 
Schweigen, Wut und Trauer die sich heute in mir niederlegen, 
Ich muss die Dunkelheit Stück für Stück zerlegen, 
Meinen Finger in meine brennende, nicht heilende Wunde legen, 
Denn heute bekenn ich mich schuldig zu leben 
Und versuche kampfhaft dies leben zu vergeben Bitch!

Hab keine Angst, ich werd' mich nie in diese Welt verlieben, 
Die Welt in der wir nie wieder glücklich werden, 
Alles was ich will, ist einfach nur glücklich sterben, Mama
Erzähl mir, wie sieht ein Regenbogen aus? 
Wie sieht im Himmel, das Leben oben aus? 
Ich weiß nicht was mir der Schmerz verspricht, 
Ich weiß nur eins es tut weh wenn ein Herz zerbricht, Mama

Ich träum von dem Tag an dem die meinen hochkommen,

Ich leg mich in die Arme Gottes, kann nicht sehen, doch spüren wie er mich trägt, 
Die Familie ist mein Herz, 
Mein Blut ist mein Vers, 
Meine Tränen sind der Schmerz, Bruder 
Ich kann nicht lassen von dem Traum den ich hege, 
Mein Weg den ich gehe ist mein Traum den ich lebe, choya 
Meine Tochter ist mein Licht, 
Ich gehe durch die Hölle, flieg zum Himmel und hole einen Stern nur für dich, 
Allah ist meine Seele, 
Dein ist mein Leben, 
Sein Wort ist mein Weg den ich wähle,

Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke dir jetzt mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 
Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke dir jetzt mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 

Mein Engel es tut mir so Leid 
Es tut mir so Leid, dass ich das jetzt hier schreib 
Ich bring es jetzt kaum übers Herz 
Du bist nicht hier und ich schreib diesen Vers 
Schreib diesen Vers schreib ihn für dich 
Leider schreib ich diese Zeilen für dich 
Ich hoffe dass du mir verzeihst 
Wenn du das hier liest hoff' ich dass du nicht weinst 
Es fällt mir so unendlich schwer 
Ich wünschte dass unsere Zeit unendlich wäre 
Ich sitz' hier und riech' deinen Duft 
Mir kommen die Tränen und ich krieg keine Luft, doch
Ich muss weg ich lass dich jetzt hier 
Ich guck mich an und ich hass' mich dafür 
Ich würde dir so viel so gerne sagen 
Ich würde wenn ich könnte die Sterne fragen 
Wenn ich selber die Antwort nicht sehe 
Du bist der Frühling der Sommer der Schnee 
Ich hab so was wie dich nicht verdient 
Du hast so was wie mich nicht verdient 
Lass mich los ich bete für dich 
Auch wenn ich dann weg bin leb' ich für dich 
Guck was für ein grauer Tag 
Es macht alles Sinn wenn man die Trauer mag ah 

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 

Liebe an sich (An sich)
kennt kein Verzicht 
Zeit bringt uns Licht 
Ob deine Wahl richtig ist 

Ich spüre deinen Herzschlag 
Unter der kalten Oberfläche die uns getrennt hält 
Und egal was du jetzt sagst 
Ich fühl' die Angst vor der Schwäche in der du langsam zusammenfällst 
Und dennoch bin ich hier 
Gebe dir die liebe die draußen niemand für dich so zu bieten hat 
Ist dir klar was du riskierst 
Man vermisst nur das was man hergibt 
Und später nicht mehr für sich hat 

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt (Zuletzt, zuletzt, zuletzt)
Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 

Es kann schon sein doch ich 
Kann mich nicht anders entscheiden 
Lange vorbei sind die Sandkasten Zeiten 
Vielleicht mach ich jetzt alles falsch 
Ich spühr' diese Klumpen in meinem Hals 
Ich schluck' und rede nicht mehr 
Ich guck und seh' dich nicht mehr 
Ich lass nichts mehr an mich heran 
Schenk' dein Leben einem anderem Mann 
Steh' auf und geh ohne mich 
Ich frag irgendwann den Wind wo du bist 
Wenn du mich dann flüstern hörst 
Denk an mich und ich küss dein Herz 
Du warst immer mein Kerzenlicht 
Ich gehe wenn es am schwersten ist 
Sei nicht traurig du kannst nichts dafür 
Auch wenn es schwer ist die Angst ist die Tür 

Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt (Mich verletzt) 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz 
Denn meine Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt 
Ich kann dir nicht erklären 
Wie deine Ansicht mich verletzt (Verletzt) 
Ich schenke jetzt dir mein Herz

Und nicht in den Kindergarten
Wo alle Eltern draußen dann auf ihre Kinder warten
Wenn ich nicht raus kann wusste ich
Dass alle Kinder warten
Ich musste laufen lernen ich hatte keinen Kinderwagen

Alle Mädchen die ich kannte sahen Scheiße aus

Fängst du an ihnen zu glauben

Doch sie können nicht rhymen (Auf keinen Fall)

Mit dem Finger aufzuschreiben
Es draußen zu verteilen
Und einfach nur darauf warten dass die andren es vergeigen

Ist es so als wenn du mich anlächelst und die Wolken sich ausruhen
Glaub mir eins ich wird mich gerne bemühen
Denn ich lieb dich so sehr dass wir wie Sterne verglühen

Ich guck dich an als wärst du von 'nem anderen Stern
So wie wir beide sind wären die anderen gern
Du bist mein Schatz ich lieb dich wie mein eigenes Leben
Ich vergess' die ganze Welt und seh' nur uns zwei im Regen
Uns zwei wie wir nur noch uns zwei haben
Schenk' dir tausend weiße Tauben wenn wir uns heiraten

Doch ich wusste damals schon du bist mein Schmetterling

Wie eine Träne im Meer
Komm ich mir vor wenn ich dran denke
Was wär' wenn dein Segen nicht wär' denn ein Tag ohne dich
Wär' wie ein Ende ohne Anfang wie ein Tag ohne Licht
Und ich will nie mehr alleine raus in die Welt
Weil's mir schon lange nicht mehr draußen gefällt
Du hast dich so sehr um mich gesorgt
Und ich schulde dir so viel du hast hast mir so viel geborgt
Guck hier ich hab dir alles von mir anvertraut
Du bist die einzige Frau der man vertraut
Weil ich weiß was dein Lächeln bewirkt
Bete ich jeden Tag das dein Lächeln nicht stirbt, mein Schatz
Du bist und bleibst mein Schatz
Du hast tief in meinem Herzen bis zum Schluss dein Platz
Du nimmst mir die Angst weil du so wirklich bist
Du bist unendlich süß weil du mein Pfirsich bist

Als Kind wusste ich, ich wird kein Feuerwehrmann
Sondern reich, doch ich wusste nicht, dass sie Steuern verlangen
Jeder Schlussstrich ist ein Neuanfang
Bald ist dein Junge wieder da
Aber als Rapper statt als Bundesligastar
Wer ist unser Liga Star? Er ist Sentino
Der Rest ist noch nicht weit entwickelt, wie ein Embryo
Scheiß' auf die alte Schule, es ist 2004
Ich mach mal 1,5 dort, mal 2000 hier
Schenk' die Hälfte meiner Mutter, sie hat meist viele Sorgen und
Sie will es morgen und man weiß nie was morgen kommt
Ich wird es schaffen nur für sie
Nehm' es mir von euch, dann Deutschlands Plattenindustrie
Denn ich machte hin und wieder Fehler, ich hab's oft bereut
Glaubte ich scheiter', jeder von euch hofft es heut'
Hofft, das mein Körper nicht im Takt ist
Wenn eines meiner Wörter nicht im Takt sitzt, dann ist es Absicht
Spuck' Flammen bis dein Licht entfacht ist
Vers um Vers bis dann Schicht im Schacht ist
Ich brauch es, dass man mich beachtet, du Opfer
Ansonsten hol den Wodka in Teufelskreis

Und ich wusste nur aus Filmen wie man sich im Knast so haut
Ich hab's gesehen (Bei Freunden)
Guck ich hab's von denen
Ich kann's verstehen, es läuft so bei acht von zehn
Acht von zehn sitzen 10 harte Jahre ab
Von acht von den Typen haben schwarze Haare und
Auf einmal soll aus mir was anderes werden?
Niemand kommt zu mir und sagt  aus dir kann was werden, denn
Ich hab kein Vater, der mir was erzählt
Nur ein kleiner Junge der mit seinen Lastern lebt (Der was erlebt)
Sein Text ist nur was er lebt
Die Leute hören ihn und wollen, dass es krasser geht
Keiner fragt ihn warum bist du wieder so?
Bitte sag uns, warum schreibst du deine Lieder so? (Warum?) 
Sagt er sein Leben ist ein harter Weg?
(Vielleicht!) Weil ihm doch eigentlich sein Vater fehlt
Der Mann, der sein Sohn mit zum Angeln nimmt
Schon mit zwei Jahren war ich, wie kein anderes Kind
Ich bin ein guter Sohn, der seine Mutter liebt
Und wenn er reich wird, es alles seiner Mutter gibt, komm

Es ist ein Teufelskreis, ich komm nicht daraus

Kai Diekmann ist ein Hurensohn wie Kay

Was haben Kay, Fler und Charr für 'ne Gemeinsamkeit?

Es gibt keine heile Welt
Keine Gnade und man regelt diese Scheiße selbst
Deine Feinde machen Staub aus deinen Knochen
Das Braune in den Socken und Vertrauen wird gebrochen, und
Darum ist das Geld mein einziger Freund
Denn wenn du wieder Scheiße frisst, dann bleibt niemand treu
Die Straße macht dich groß und die Straße macht dich klein
Leider kannst du das Gewicht auf dieser Waage nicht verteil'n
Dir wird immer nur erzählt, dass du es raus schaffen kannst
Doch das Ghetto hat keinen Schalter, den du aus machen kannst
Es ist in dir drin, weil es dich verfolgt, wie ein Schatten
Die Straße interessiert sich nicht für goldene Platten
Es zählt hier, wer du bist, was du machst, wen du fickst
Weil du 'nen Haftbefehl, statt Auto, zum Achtzehnten kriegst
Wenn du am Boden liegst, dann fallen alle über dich wie Leichenschänder
und darum bin ich Einzelgänger

Hier im Ghetto gibt es 1000 Storys über dich
Menschen lügen, aber lila Scheine lügen nicht

Scheiß auf morgen, du weißt heute nicht mal, was es bringt
Denn wenn jeder, statt zu reden, eine Waffe nimmt
Bleibt dir nur noch, drauf zu achten, dass die Kasse stimmt
Ich hab die Straße in mir, hab die Straße studiert
Du wirst als Kind von den Gangs als Soldat rekrutiert
Es gibt keine Freunde hier, im Herzen von Berlin
Denn du bist hier draußen gerade so viel wert, wie du verdienst, yeah
und auch ohne Schulabschluss tankst du hier den AMG mit Super Plus
keiner ist dein Bruder nach 'nem Bruderkuss
Bester Freund, größter Feind lacht dir ins Gesicht
Nimmt dich in den Arm und verpasst dir einen Stich, yeah
Das ist das Leben, Junge, siehst du, wie die Krähen kreisen?
Weil dich Hyänen jagen, darfst du nicht stehen bleiben
Es gibt keine Freunde, keine Brüder, keine Kumpel
Es ist fressen und gefressen werden hier im Dschungel

Und bevor wir jetzt das machen, was wir machen werden
Er soll beten, dass er stirbt, bevor wir ihn wieder raus lassen, Alter, ohne Scheiß

Egal was do erzählst, ich bin in der Pubertät, 
Ihr seit nicht von Bedeutung für mich _ do bist kein Playboy, 
Es sind höchstens Boyzone und ich _ Junge, 
Es ist nicht ungewohnt, do bist ein Hundesohn, 
Guck mich an ich kann verreisen mit nem Stundenlohn, 
Wo bist do Rapper hin, ich fick deine Community, 
Do bist so dick und hässlich, wie die Schlampe Lumidee, 
Gewöhn dich dran das die Schelle zur Begrüßung dient, 
Ich bin erst 19 Jahre alt und do hast Hämorriden, 
Thema Wechsel bitte, ich bin ein Heckenschütze, 
Diese Hits schreib ich wenn ich auf Toilette sitze, 
Die ganzen kleine Flittchen weinen wenn mein Schweiß tropft, 
Ich bin so cool Homie, kalt wie ein Eisblock, 
Ich hab so viele Fans und ich danke Gott dafür, 
Mein Album wird sogar gehört an der Cote d?Azur,

Bushido,"Was ist mit uns passiert, du bist mir fremd geworden
Ich gucke dich an und fühle ich bin bei dir nicht geborgen
Wir beide wollten reden, jetzt streiten wir uns wieder
Wenn du ehrlich bist, weißt du, dass ich das nicht verdient hab'
Ich kriege so langsam Angst, dass du nicht mehr lieben kannst
Dass du Gefühle, die ich habe nicht erwidern kannst
Es macht mich krank, wenn du sagst, dass das nicht stimmt
Du redest vom großen Glück, doch verhältst dich wie ein Kind
Warum tust du mir das an, woher kommt der Hass in dir
Ich wollte nicht erkennen, dass ich meine Platz verlier'
Der Platz in deinem Herzen, bis tief in deine Seele
Jetzt sitzen deine Blicke wie ein Strick um meine Kehle
Du hörst mir nicht mehr zu, ich habe keine Bedeutung mehr
Meine Gedanken fliegen durch den Raum kreuz und quer
Du fürchtest dich, es ist okay, wenn du deswegen fliehst
Besser du gehst jetzt bevor du meine Tränen siehst

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Ich fahre nach Hause jetzt, ich habe sie losgelassen
Wäre ich ein Mädchen, würde ich diesen beiden Strophen hasse
Ich komme nicht klar mit ihr, ich komme nicht klar mit mir
Ich weiß noch wie ich sie gesehen habe in diesem Laden hier
Sie las die Zeitung und trank ihren Milchcafé
Ich wusste, dass ich jetzt die Mutter meiner Kinder seh'
Und als sie plötzlich lachte klang es wie Engelsstimmen
Es klang so bitter-süß, als ob die kleinen Engel singen
Denn es ist Fakt, dass diese Frau etwas Besonderes ist
Und wenn sie guckt ist es, als ob man dann die Sonne vergisst
Dieses Geschenk Gottes
Und man vermisst eine Person erst plötzlich dann, wenn der Moment fort ist
Wenn man den Anruf kriegt und sie im Koma liegt
Es holt dich runter, als ob man gar kein Koka zieht
Ich hau ein Loch in die Wand mit der blanken Faust
Ich hab Angst, Angst vor der Fahrt in's Krankenhaus

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Ich glaube du kannst mich hören, ich bin jetzt hier bei dir
Wir beide wissen zwischen uns beiden ist viel passiert
Wie du hier liegen musst und künstlich beatmet wirst
Egal was war, heute bleibe ich, bis dein Atem stirbt
Die Mediziner sagen heute wirst du von uns gehen
Ich höre dein schwaches Herz schlagen und mir kommen die Tränen
Ich wollte noch so viel sagen, ich wollte es in Ordnung bringen
Ich wollte, dass du merkst wie ernst mir diese Worte sind
Ich weiß, die Engel werden sich gut um deine Seele sorgen
Und auch ein Schmetterling wird kommen wie an jenem Morgen
Lass deine Ängste hier, nimm meine Hoffnung mit
Ich weiß für jeden Menschen ist der Tod ein Kompromiss
Ich würde mein Herz geben
Ich würde dich bis in den Himmel tragen, 
Dich dort schlafen legen und den Schmerz nehmen
Doch das ist deine Reise, ich kann dich nicht begleiten
Gott will, dass ich bei dieser reise nicht dabei bin

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg

Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt
Und es ist ganz egal, ob wir beide dagegen sind
Denn unser aller Schicksal, wir warten auf den Tag
Und der Verlust wird kommen, wie der Nagel in den Sarg",Augenblick,2006

Der sich schon lange nicht mehr freut auf einen Wochenanfang
Ich habe die Zeit vergessen, ich will mich einfach nicht erinnern
Also renne ich einfach weg vor meiner Frau und meinen Kindern
Ich ziehe den Gürtel um den Arm, bis ich die Venen seh'
Und bete, dass ich heute endlich aus dem Leben geh'
Mit diesem süßen Kuss
Mache ich mir selber Mut, damit ich loslassen kann und nichts mehr fühlen muss
Ich merke plötzlich wird es taub in meinem Unterkiefer
Und aus meinem Mund krabbelt so langsam schon das Ungeziefer
Es ist die Angst, die mich noch über meine Runden bringt
Wie ein kleines Mädchen, dass in einen Brunnen springt
Die letzte Melodie, die tief in meine Ohren dringt
Denn niemand schenkt mir meinen Stern, wenn ich gestorben bin
Weil eigentlich ist dieses Leben etwas Hässliches
Ich hasse es, also nehme ich und zerbreche ich es

(Got no money)
Und trotzdem bleibe ich stehen wie ein Mann
Und kämpfe weiter wie ein Löwe, wenn es sein muss mein Leben lang
Ich behalte meinen Stolz, als wäre er ein Diamant
Denn alles andere hab ich wie ein Blatt Papier verbrannt
Ich bin bereit zu sterben, wenn der Herr es sagt
Denn liegt hier unten meine Welt in Scherben, dann ist er nicht da
Und wird mir meine Last hier zu schwer
Dann nimmt der Teufel meine Asche und verstreut sie im Meer

Es kann kalt sein und so hässlich, ich würde gehen, wenn ich könnte
Hier rollt der Starlight-Express am direkten Weg in die Hölle
Gott hat die Augen zu gemacht und nahm mir Geld und die Freude
Und macht ne Menge meiner Freunde zum Geschenk an den Teufel
Und keiner kann die Kinder retten, hört weg, wenn sie schreien
Hier liegen viele steife Körper in den Betten aus Eis
Manchmal denke ich, ich bin wie ein Stern vom Himmel gefallen
Ein Kind des Alls liegt auf der Straße, ich bringe Licht auf den Asphalt
Hier ist der Ort an dem es endet und wohl kaum noch wer dagegen hält
Wo keiner rennt, wenn im November saurer Regen fällt
Von uns träumt keiner mehr vom Bizz, oder Kiffen am Abend
Wir tragen Spritzen in den Adern, anstatt Kinder in den Armen
Hier ist nichts Schönes mehr, kein Spaß und auch mein Lachen ist weg
Auf diesen Straßen ist der Phönix statt aus Asche aus Crack
Hier ist der Ruf nach etwas Gutem noch viel lauter als ein Beat
Guck meine Augen an, Jungs, hier draußen herrscht Krieg

Und trotzdem bleibe ich stehen wie ein Mann
Und kämpfe weiter wie ein Löwe, wenn es sein muss mein Leben lang

Ich bin bereit zu sterben, wenn der Herr es sagt
Denn liegt hier unten meine Welt in Scherben, dann ist er nicht da
Und wird mir meine Last hier zu schwer
Dann nimmt der Teufel meine Asche und verstreut sie im Meer

Guck mal, mein Haus, hier werde ich alt, es ist hier klasse zu leben
Nur wird die Pappe etwas schnell zu Matsch, wenn es regnet
Gott sagt Chakuza sei verflucht und lässt den Mann danach fallen
Und fass dein Gold nicht an, denn es wird dann zu blankem Metall
Ich kann nicht rennen, verdammt, und weg hier, um was Neues zu bekommen
Die Stadt der Engel ist gefangen, sie hat der Teufel eingenommen
Komm, hol mich raus und gib mir Schutz, ich suche Zuflucht bei dir
Bruder, bis jetzt war nur das Bier wie ein Mutter zu mir

Oh, ich schließe die Augen und höre einfach mit dem Atmen auf
Und zerstöre letzten Endes dieses Kartenhaus
Ich spucke das Leben aus, als wäre mein Mund voller Sand
Denn heute sind auch meine letzten Helden unter gegangen
Ich will dort hin, damit mir endlich meine Flügel wachsen
Ich fühle mich heute schon so alt, dann ich war früh erwachsen
Man kommt sich vor, als ob man plötzlich hundert Jahre fällt
Eine letzte Sache noch: Adieu, wunderbare Welt

[Saad]
Ich hab mir alles selber beigebracht
Mein bester Freund sitzt seit fünf Jahrn in Einzelhaft
Ich hab Glück gehabt denn ich konnte ihm vertraun
Guck mal da die Kinder wie sie ihre Zukunft verbaun
Ich wollte nie was werden was Eltern stolz macht
Hier gibt es keinen, der für seinen Kamin Holz hat
Hier platzen Träume, die Wände sind wie stumme Zeugen
Euer Ghetto lebt in allen diesen jungen Leuten
Die aus Langeweile alte Menschen überfallen
Ihr wollts nicht glauben doch sowas gibt es überall
Ich bin zufrieden, das bin ich und mein Werdegang
Wir greifen einmal nach den Sternen und sterben dann
Ich bin dankbar für alle Sorgen und Kummer
Auch wenn ich Abitur hätte, hätt ich morgen noch hunger
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper, ich wollte nie einer sein
Ich hab ne harte Schale, hier wird nie einer weinen

2x:
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper, ich hab für die Straßen gekämpft
Und Mama sieht heute mein Poster in dem Laden da hängen
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper, ich wollt niemals anständig sein
Ich hab Beton in meiner Brust, deswegen kann ich nicht weinen

Denn ich war nie ein Rapper, ich hab meine Schule geschwänzt
Und kann bis heute sagen ich war nie ein schwuler Student
Ich gebe hundert Prozent - auch wenn die Anderen sagen
Ich word niemals was erreichen dreh ich meine Runde I'm Benz
Doch weiß wohin es mich führt - das Leben ist ein Labyrinth
Doch vielleicht find ich die Tür - Ich würd gern sagen ""ich schaffs""
Doch ohne Job bist do in meiner Gegend schon mit siebzehn Jahren I'm Knast
Wir haben was besseres zu tun als von Träumen zu reden
In meiner Nachbarschaft gibt es keine Freude - nur Tränen
Hier gibt es keinen, der sich freut - ich bin ein Mann
Und hab als Junge schon gelernt dass man Fehler nicht bereut
Ich hab das Fühlen verlernt - ich hab mein Lachen verloren
Eine ganze Generation besteht aus Waffen und Zorn
Werden zum Hassen geboren - ich bin einer von denen
Die es wahrscheinlich niemals schaffen ihre Heimat zu sehn

Denn ich war nie ein Rapper, ich bin auf dem Boden geblieben
Ich bin ein Mann und bin bei meinen Hosen geblieben
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper ich trage nur Sachen, die passen
Ein echter Mann braucht keine Kette um den Harten zu machen
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper - weil ich keine kleinen Kiffer kenn
Wenn meine Freunde kommen müsst ihr kleinen Ficker rennen

Ich will nie anders werden - guck, ich bin immer noch ich
Denn ich war nie ein Rapper denn was ich werden wollte bin ich jetzt
Für zwanzig Euro kriegst do an der Ecke billig Sex
Doch an der Ecke sind die meisten Mädchen minderjährig
Und für die meisten von den Mädchen geht der Winter ewig
Doch was solls irgendwann kommt der Sommer her
Wenn wir dran glauben kommen wir alle unserer Sonnen näher
Peilst do jetzt warum hier keiner Rapper werden will
Weil keiner von uns beiden irgendwas verbergen will

Ihre mutter hängt sich immer an die falschen männer
An geldlose aggressive alte penner
So wie auch ihr stiefvater war
Aber janine glaubte selber nicht was diesmal geschah
Denn er sagt ihr, das er nicht mehr zu alt ist für sie
Und kurze zeit darauf vergewaltigt er sie
Es wird ihr alles zuviel
Weil er es immer wieder macht
Und genau wie jede nacht, kommt er auch in dieser nacht
Do musst mir geben, was mir mama nicht mehr geben kann
Und bald merkt sie das sie schwanger ist von diesem mann

So hört sich´s an, immer wenn ein Gangster weint!

Ich hoffe, dass ich irgendwann im Paradies lebe,
Und was du hier siehst ist keine Krokodils-Träne.
Ich bin ein Sündenbock, doch ich bin nicht schuld, Jungs
Der Gangsta weint und die Stimmung ist auf dem Nullpunkt!
Denn es gibt keinem dem der Gangsta vertraut,
Es ist Nachts, ich geh raus und senke mein Haupt,
Und schon wieder, wieder bin ich im Visier,
Und schon wieder, wieder werd' ich indiziert!
Früher schrieb ich meine Raps in der Pause,
Heute bin ich immer so weit weg von Zuhause,
Du sagst auf in den Kampf, doch ich kämpf' bereits,
So hört sich´s an, immer wenn ein Gangster weint!

Mama guck ich ertrage den Schmerz
Ihr glaubt es nicht doch auch Gangsta haben ein Herz
Von jetzt bis in die Unendlichkeit, so hört sich´s an
Immer wenn ein Gangster weint
Mama guck ich bin wahnsinnig müde
Ihr glaubt es nicht doch auch Gangsta haben Gefühle
Gott ist groß und ich bin längst bereit, so hört sich´s an
Immer wenn ein Gangster weint

Es ist schon OK, denn ich bin endlich reich, 
so hört sich´s an, immer wenn ein Gangster weint!
Und ich bin traurig jetzt nicht nur die Frau ist weg,
Und was mir bleibt ist nicht viel mehr als ein Haufen Dreck!
Mama sag was hab ich bloß gemacht?
Ich habe immer noch den Sound für den Hof im Knast,
Mama ich denke nach, wenn ich in der Zelle sitz',
Warum sagen alle draußen zu mir Terrorist?
All die Rapper warten draußen auf mein Feature,
Ich scheiß auf euch alle und ich rauche eine Shisha,
Das kann noch lange nicht das Ende sein,
So hört sich´s an, immer wenn ein Gangster weint!

Ich wusste immer schon, dass mich das nicht glücklich macht,
Und nur dumme Schlampen nehmen auf dem Rücksitz platz,
Eins kannst du dir merken, Gangsta sind einsam,
Manchmal seh' ich Leute an meinem Fenster vorbei fahren
Hier draußen ist es für den Teufel nicht schwer,
Dann nimmt er meine Asche und verstreut sie im Meer, yeah!
Ich bin der Typ der in der Cordon Sport träumt,
Manchmal weinen auch Gangsta, mein Sports-freund!
Ich denk an all diese Dinge, die passiert sind,
Man verurteilt mich, weil ich tätowiert bin,
Ich hoffe, dass mir meine Fans verzeihen,
So hört sich´s an, immer wenn ein Gangster weint!

Mama guck ich ertrage den Schmerz
Ihr glaubt es nicht doch auch Gangsta haben ein Herz
Von jetzt bis in die Unendlichkeit, so hört sich´s an

Ihr bleibt Familie deshalb fühlt sich euer Star geborgen.
Wir hatten gute Zeiten, es gab auch schlechte Zeiten,
Ihr seit treu geblieben, wolltet euch für Sonny Black entscheiden.
Wolltet keine andere Mucke Pumpem, außer meine,
8 Jahre Rap, über Mutter bumsen war das geilste.

Ihr könnt die ganzen Texte, ihr könnt sie mit-reimen, mit-schreien,
Mit trockenem Pullover geht ihr nicht Heim.
Meine Texte, meine Texte ja die kennt jeder,
Und ja sie schreien ""Hey, ich bin der
Das ist Adrenalin, jedes Konzert war krass,
Sie verstehen uns nicht, das ist der Grund dass ich bei Kerner quatsch.

Nach der Sendung bleib ich eh für's ZDF, ein Straßenhund
Schon okay, hör zu für Lehrer mach ich keine Tracks,
Ich schreib für meine Fans, das hier ist mein Respekt.
Sie wissen was ich mein, sie bleiben auch dankbar,
Sie wählen den Ghetto-Präsidenten in den Landtag.

Man die Familie verliert, vor lauter Angst einfach flieht
Ich komm mir vor, wie in ´nem roten Sarg

Hier ist ein Land, in dem ein kalter Wind weht
Ein kalter Boden, auf dem man schon als Kind lebt
Ich wache oft auf, weil ich träume schlecht
Ich habe Angst man nimmt mir meine Freunde weg
Ich durfte nicht oft auf den Spielplatz
Um so wie andere zu sein, spür´ ich zu viel Hass
Ich bin heute nur so, weil ich schon damals so war
Ich kannte damals viele Leute, heut´ ist keiner mehr da
Manchmal lag es an mir, doch dann lag's einfach an euch
Man kann's nicht sehen, aber einer meiner Hälften ist deutsch
Und plötzlich kommt dieser Tag, der Tag der nie wieder geht
Der eine Tag, an dem du merkst, dass sich die Welt nicht mehr dreht...

Es ist der Tag, nachdem keiner hier gerufen hat
Es ist der Tag, an dem keiner was zu suchen hat
Doch es passiert, weil Amerika mich nicht mag
Er ist verliebt in sich selbst und fühlt sich stark
Er will: Öl, Ruhm, Blut, Rauch...
Ich weiß genau, er hat dem Teufel seine Seele verkauft
Er nimmt sich einfach die Welt, so wie's ihm gefällt
Er baut sich Tempel aus Gold und gibt dem Moslems ein Zelt
Mir wird kalt, ich seh, dass meine Mutter weint
Weil sie weiss, dass für uns Kinder keine Sonne scheint
Es ist vorbei! Der Qualm steht am Firmament
Und jetz sind wir uns sicher, dass unsere Heimat brennt

Es kommt die Nacht in der man nichts mehr sieht
Man nur noch Bomben hört und weiß: ""Jetzt ist Krieg""

Man die Familie verliert, vor lauter Angst einfach flieht
Ich komm mir vor, wie in ´nem roten Sarg
Für viele sinds die letzten Worte an ´nem toten Tag

Jede Kugel die fliegt, trifft letzten Endes ihr Ziel
Er sitzt im ""Weissen Haus"" und redet als wär Krieg nur ein Spiel
Man bräuchte nur genügend Geld, um alles auf zu bauen
Wie viel Geld braucht man, um tote Kinder auf zu bauen?
Wie viele Väter haben Tränen vergossen?
Wie viele Mütter mussten flehen und hoffen?
Er sagt er schütze doch nur seine Nation
Mit seinen dreckigen Lügen und jede Menge Kanonen
Wie viele Kinder werden wieder ohne Brüder geboren?
Eins steht fest: Sähst du Hass dann erntest du Zorn
Du kannst nicht ändern
Du brauchst den ganzen Weg nicht zu rennen!

Jedes mal dasselbe ich komme an und grief' in deine Kasse 
Du Zigeuner das Ghetto hat kein Platz für dich 
Klau dir die Beats zusammen egal du weißt ich Kack auf dich 
Ich spann die Muskeln an ihr Keckos habt jetzt Angst vor mir 
Ruf deine Kumpel an doch trotzdem bleibt der Gangster hier 
Ich mach n Track und ändern tut sich nichts 
Ich steh' draußen auf der Straße und es ist der selbe Shit 
Jedes mal derselbe Stress er macht mich Steinhart wozu soll ich jetzt noch nett sein 
Ich hol mir deinen Arsch denn plötzlich ist jede Nutte interessiert an mir 
Du quatschst mich voll wie cool ich bin doch nichts passiert 
Was denkst du dir 
Denkst du Rap ist wie ein Boot 
Ticket kaufen einsteigen und wir fahren los 
Ich erzähl' die Sachen die du siehst in deinen Träumen

Wer will zuerst 
Ich burn dich mit einem Vers 
Ich muss es machen weil der Shit für euch zu schwer ist 
Erst seid ihr krass dann schreit ihr Peace man Ihr könnt rappen wie am Fließband 
Doch ich bleib der King Im Kiezpunk
Ich mach mein eigenes Ding 
Keiner steigt in meinen Ring 
Ihr seid keine Rapper sondern kleine Kids die heimlich singen

Es ist die Electrofaust, verdammt
Gib die Backspin, denn mein Klopapier ist ausgegangen
Guck, alle Rapper dieses Landes haben ihre Flows geballt
Doch ich ficke eure Mütter und ihr habt ein Klos im Hals
Sagt mir wer von euch ohne Kopf behindert guckt
Ich mache was ich will, Robocop is in the Hood

Erst war Carlo Cokxxx jetzt ist jeder hart und flowed
Du fickst nur mit deiner Freundin, warum ist dein Arsch so rot?
Deutscher Rap, er liegt am Boden, aber er will gerad' hoch
Weißt du was ich mache? Ich hol einen Stein und schlag in tot
Weil ich nicht brav bin kommt keiner auf den Pausenhof
Heul' dir deine Augen rot, ich hol mir jetzt dein Pausenbrot
Deutscher Rap steckt in 'nem Loch und versucht sich rauszuholen
Weißt du was ich mache? Ich hol einen Stein und hau ihn tot

Junge, ich bin schlecht gelaunt, besser keine Faxen heute
Jedes meiner Alben bumst jeden deiner 18 Freunde
Alphajacken-Kult, wie ich auf Beton steh
Ich bin tight, meine Fans tragen Lonsdale
Früher wart ihr Aggro, doch heute macht ihr Blackmusik
Ich zieh mir durch die Nase klein-gehacktes Extasy
Macht was ihr wollt, für euch Huren bleib ich King
Wenn ich euch seh' denk ich das ich Schwulen-feindlich bin
Du kannst nur am Mic gewinnen, dass hier soll 'ne Warnung sein
Steck' dir dein Süd-Berlin-T-Shirt in den Anus rein
Sag mir wer hat keine Angst, sag wer sich jetzt messen will
Doch ich bleibe dieser Junge, der euch jetzt beim Rappen killt
Ersguterjunge, guck, ich bin der Boss der Gang
Sieht es ein echte Rapper haben keinen Osla-Slang
Ihr geht alle statt zu Rappen, händchenhaltend auf der Wiese
Hoffe es macht euch nichts aus, wenn ich also auf euch Schieße

Wir sind genau diese Typen hier vor denen deine Eltern dich gewarnt haben
Dieser Abschaum der nicht nach vorne schaut
Und wir jagen dich bis zum Morgengrauen

Wir sind einfache Jungs, Jungs die von der Straße sind
In deiner bunten Welt sind wir leider Farbenblind
Komm und gebt mir einen triftigen Grund
Und ich ramm' dir meinen Stift in den Mund
Das ist Kommunikation, du und dein Streber-Verein
Öffnet die Haustür und der schwarze Nebel kommt rein
Und ich scheiß' auf deine saubere Welt
Ich hab Schläge hier im Angebot doch ich würde tauschen für Geld
Siehst du keiner von uns lacht,siehst du keiner von uns hat
Angst wir haben Scheiße durchgemacht

Und denkt bloß nicht ich nehm' euch ganze Ratten für voll

Wir knacken dafür keine Schlösser und das SEK tritt dafür keine Türen ein
Sag mir endlich wann kommt Ali aus dem Knast
Ich hoffe nur ich gib dir mit dem Lied ein bisschen kraft
Ich bin der der die Regeln bricht
Und du wirst angehalten, weil du als Kanake in nem AMG Mercedes sitzt

Und ich gib ihm jetzt 'ne Hilfe
Ich bin vorbestraft, asozial und tätowiert
Gut erkannt hier rappt der Junge übern Knast
Beim Echo fühlte ich mich wie ein unerwünschter Gast
Falsches Lachen denn sie hassen mich ich spür den krassen Neid
Ja ich bin der Typ der im Supermarkt den Kassen greift
Ihr wollt das echte leben, dann lasst mich aussprechen
Ich kann noch mehr als nur Autotüren aufbrechen
Kannst du sehen wie sich die Wolkendecke völlig schließt
Mein ganzer Lebensstil wird mich noch in die Hölle ziehen

Ein Haufen Opfer dass man grade frisch ausgekotzt hat
Scheiß egal wie viel Geld ich schon verdient hab
Ich bleib für immer dieser Junge der gedealt hat
Ich mach den Unterricht
Den Unterricht für die Unterschicht
Fresse es gibt keinen der mich unterbricht
Sie versuchen mir die Art zu rappen auszureden
Man dabei haben sie uns vor langer Zeit schon aufgegeben
Ihr könnt mich abführen
Hundert tausend Kriminelle die mein Album kaufen
Könnt ihr diese Macht spüren
Ihr könnt mich wegsperren
Ihr könnt mich observieren
Die Langeweile treibt mich dazu euch zu provozieren
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz
Und ich ficke eure Artgenossen
Ich bin jetzt zurück jetzt wird scharf geschossen

Hier bist du weg und keiner sieht's wenn es passiert
Und bist du frech kannst du statt Geld nur eine Kiezschelle kassieren
Es hat sich viel verändert hier es wirkt so endlos jeden Tag
Denn statt zu betteln um was Bares sagt man „Hände hoch du Arsch“
Es ist alles Frust und niemals Schluss mit diesem Dreck
Nur einen Schuss und du bist weg Junge russisches Roulette
Und statt lustig ist es hässlich und grau
Und zum Schluss kriegst du statt Essen nur ein Messer in den Bauch
Hört die Sachen und verbietet es
Ich bin froh ich brauche Kraft denn diese Straße war noch nie gerecht

Was für Skrupel unsre Jugend geht auf Lehrer los
Wo siehst du Kinder spielen? Ich seh' nur Kinder dealen
Und wenn schon Kinder dealen ist das echt ein Kinderspiel

Ich verklage Rapper jetzt schon international

Sie meinen, dass Kriminelle mich im Knast hören
Ich sag mit Stolz, dass die Brüder mich im Knast hören
Ich schreib das Album für die Jungs hier auf den Straßen

Der Smog ist wieder da, ihr dürft alle wieder atmen.
Das hier bleibt die Ansage, Mann auf der Anklagebank
Schreib ich dir ne Autogrammkarte, dann
Bist du Witzfigur glücklich
Ich geb' die Schelle schon im Voraus
Du schwule Missgeburt, Figg dich!
Ich geh nicht weg von hier
Ich bin mir treu geblieben
Hab mich nicht verändert

Sorry, doch ich musste noch mal wieder kommen

Siehst du diesen andern Jungen? Der sich wieder schlägt?
Widerstand, gegen diese Staatsgewalt widerstehen.
Kannst du sehen wie sie gerade diese Kasse öffnen?

Du fühlst dich alt und deswegen bist du gar nicht so wie all die andern Jugendlichen
Guck mal ein Außenseiter, nur weil sie schwarz liebt
Ihr Lehrer sagt dass man in ihr 'nen Psychopath sieht
Und auch die andern Mädchen schicken sie weg
Dass ist der Grund warum sie sich vor den Blicken versteckt

Alleine in der Klasse hockt
Und so geschminkt als ob sie eine Tote wär'
Und für ein kleines bisschen Spaß halten die Drogen her

Und schon seit langem frisst du diese Scheiße in dich rein
Sie wollten dir Mut machen, es wär' nicht endgültig vorbei
Nur 'ne räumliche Trennung für 'ne Zeit
Doch er glaubte seinen Eltern nicht
er war kein kleines Kind, doch für das was er fühlte waren beide blind
Er ging daran kaputt, also lief er von zu hause weg
Sein ganzes Leben war ein Haufen Dreck
Und dieses Leben war ihm nichts wert
Ja dieses Leben war zwar alles aber nicht fair

Er wollte nie wieder zurück

Um sein scheiß Heroin zu zahlen
Es wurde immer mehr, und auch die Schulden kamen
Er gehörte nicht zu diesen Männern die geduldig waren
Und was er dann verlangte konnte sie nicht verstehen
Er zwang sie nur für seine Sucht auf den Strich zu gehen
Ja sie hat es mitgemacht
Sie kam jede Nacht nach Hause
Hat gezittert, geweint ihr Gesicht war blass
Ihre Wunden werden nie wieder heilen
Nie wieder hat sie ihm verziehen, diesem Schwein
Sie hört Stimmen wenn sie schläft
Sie ist am durchdrehen
Sie guckt in den Spiegel und kann selbst durch sich durch sehen
Wo ist ihre Lust am Leben?
Heute ist ein guter Tag, um sich den Goldenen Schuss zu geben.

Bushido,"Ich war damals gerade 3, als du mich verlassen hast
Es war Mama, die es nicht verkraftet hat
Sie wollte sich scheiden lassen, hör auf zu lügen
Wie oft wurde sie von dir verprügelt?
Wie oft hast du sie grundlos angeschrien?
Ihre Arme waren blau, doch sie hörte niemals auf ihren Mann zu lieben
Vielleicht war es wegen mir
Sie ist stark geblieben, nur damit ich meinen Vater nicht verlier'
Und ich wusste nicht was los ist
Ich hab mich sogar mal gefragt ob du tot bist
Wieso traf es bloß mich?
Ich war im Kindergarten
Aber bist du mal gekommen um mich abzuholen?
Nein du hast dein Kind verraten
Du hast an mich gedacht
Warum kann ich dir nicht glauben?
Falls du es schaffst, dann schau mir in die Augen
Du hast mich im Stich gelassen
Ich guck die Bilder an und fang' an dein Gesicht zu hassen

Vater du verleugnest deinen Jungen
Ich möchte dir nichts beibringen
Und ich nenne dich nicht Feigling
Aber wegen dir war ich ein Heimkind
Sogar die Kerzen auf der Torte brannten ohne dich
Du bist ein Lügner wenn du sagst, dass du dein Sohn vermisst
Ich war gerade fünf
Und schon alleine auf dem Spielplatz
Wo war dieser Vater der mich lieb hat?
Wie kann man sein Kind so verachten?
Ja du bist mein Vater, aber bestimmt nicht erwachsen
So oft gedealt, ich hab so oft geklaut
Mama hat sich nicht getraut, ihren Sohn zu verhauen
Und ich sag es dir nicht gern

Du hast von meiner Jugend nichts erlebt

Mama sagte du wolltest gehen

Das erste Mal gesehen, habe ich dich zu spät
Ich war 26 Jahre alt, OK?
Du warst nicht der Vater, den ich mir erhofft habe
Deine scheiß Adresse fand ich auf 'ner Postkarte
Und ich habe dich in Düsseldorf gesucht
In Düsseldorf gefunden, und Düsseldorf verflucht
Ich saß in deiner Wohnung drin, ich hab dich angesehen
Du hast mir Leid getan, hör auf mich anzuflehen
Du hast gesagt Mama hätte sich von dir getrennt
Wenn du besoffen warst, warst du wie ein fremder Mensch
Und es tut dir jetzt bestimmt nicht Leid
Heute sag ich dir, es war für dein Kind nicht leicht
Und ich wünsche dir nichts Schlechtes
Einfach aus den Grund, weil kein Mensch auf Gottes Erden hier perfekt ist

Bushido,"1978, er kam ohne Schatten auf die Welt,
Seine Mutter musste putzen denn sie hatten noch kein Geld.
Andere sorgen als manche Leute die mit Geld gesegnet sind,
Eine starke Frau die in Problemen schwimmt.
Tränen sind,
Auf ihren Wangen zu erkennen wenn sie schlafen will,
Sie wollte nicht viel nur seinen Magen füllen.
Er hat sie im Stich gelassen,
Sie konnt' es nicht verkraften.
Es ist leicht, ein Kind zu machen,
Doch bring mal ein Kind zum lachen.
Auf sich allein gestellt hat sie ihn dann großgezogen,
Sie war für ihn da, sie hat auf ihren Tod geschworen.
Doch was dem Jungen einfach fehlte war 'ne harte Hand,
'Ne Mutter kann Sachen nicht rüberbringen so wies ein Vater kann.
Er hat gemacht worauf er Bock hatte,
Was er gerad' im Kopf hatte,
Wenn er diesen Umgang mit Gesocks hatte.
Dann brachten Bullen ihn zum ersten Mal nach Haus,
Mit 13 bewaffnet das erste Mal geklaut.

Eines Morgens bin ich aufgewacht,
Ich wusste schon sehr früh ich bin ein Teil von ihnen.
Ich wollte sein wie sie.
Kein Therapeut, Pädagoge konnte mich damals im Heim erziehen,
Ich wollte sein wie sie.
Ich hatte Koks, hatte Gras, hatte Trips.
Es war mein Gebiet,
Ich wollte sein wie sie.
Mama es tut mir Leid du weinst
Und ich weiß' du verziehst mir nie,
Doch ich wollte sein wie sie.

So sein wie sie, 2 Jahre Später,
15, Vorbestraft Streit mit dem Lehrer.
Mit 16 wurd' er rausgeschmissen,
Er fing an zu den falschen Leuten aufzublicken,
Er war jung drauf geschissen.
Wer entscheidet schon was falsch oder richtig ist,
Wichtig war ihm Geld und er vertickte Trips.
Langsam kamen die Großen auf ihn zu,
Er wurde ihr Kurier,
Also fick auf jeden Wichser der Studiert.
Das Motto auf die schnelle was verdienen,
Kriminelle Energien,
Hat er guten Stoff bestelle ich bei ihm.
Er sah die ganzen Älteren die alle schon ein Namen hatten,
Gangster die sich Namen machten
Und über die Strafe lachten.
Das hier ist Berlin.
Er hatte keinen Vater mehr,
Im Bezug auf seinen kleinen Bruder fühlt er sich als ob er Vater wär',
Räumte jeden Laden leer.
Er wollte wie die großen sein doch wie soll man so was diesem Staat erklären

Mama es tut mir Leid du weinst
Und ich weiß' du verziehst mir nie,
Doch ich wollte sein wie sie.

So sein wie sie und die Jahre vergingen,
Er bereut es heute, keine seine Taten als Kind.
Er geht auf die ende 20 zu.
Er sucht den inneren Frieden
Doch guck er kann nicht ruhen,
Weil ihn das verlangen ruft.
Es wurd' ihm beigebracht,
Das ganze Leben ist vergleichbar mit 'ner Einzelhaft,
Dreh nicht durch Beweis dir was.
Es ist ein Geistesblitz,
Er sieht die Älteren von damals,
Aber heute sitzen beide hier an einem Tisch.
Und trotzdem spürt er dieses böse Blut,
Sag was du in der Höhle eines Löwen suchst,
Wenn der Instinkt zum töten ruft.
Töten um zu überleben,
Wenn du vermögen hast nicht drüber reden.
Es gibt falsche Freunde die bei Brüdern stehlen.
Und deswegen bin ich nur noch im Café
Und deswegen werd' ich nur noch hier gesehen.
Das ist Al-Bustan.
Guck was im Ghetto so passiert,
Du kannst mich aus dem Ghetto holen,
Doch das Ghetto nicht aus mir.

Du ziehst 'ne Nummer und stehst dann bis der Schalter schließt,
Wir sind krank, sind die Sachen die wir sehen,
Trotzdem kriegt uns keiner von euch Pissern raus aus dem Milleu,
Und das einzige was zählt ist die Gesundheit,
Und wir beten jeden Tag dafür, dass jeder hier Gesund bleibt,

Bushido,"Er kommt nach Hause und findet diesen Brief
Der Gerichtsvollzieher brachte den Termin
Seine Kinder sind am lächeln
Doch er wirkt wie versteinert

Weil er nur drei Wochen Zeit hat
Seine Frau ist in der Küche und sie spült
Er dreht die Heizung runter und die Zimmer werden kühl
Er hat Angst seiner Frau etwas zu sagen
Er nimmt erstmal die Kinder und legt sie beide schlafen

Er zieht seinen Mantel an
Geht vor die Tür
Doch weiß grade nichts mit sich anzufangen
Zehn Jahre geschuftet wie ein Schwein

Mit Nebenjobs seine Frau wusste nicht bescheid
Wie soll er seinem Chef nur erklären
Dass er mehr Geld braucht
Um den Rest zu ernähren

Und er läuft jetzt zurück
Sein Haupt ist gesenkt
Er versucht den Scheiß zu verdrängen

Jeder Tag gleicht einem Kampf
Den man verwundet übersteht
Nach Außen zeigt man keinen Schmerz
Niemand soll die Wahrheit sehn

Und jede Stunde die man lebt
Muss man weiter aufrecht gehn
Egal wie tief die Wunden sind
Niemand soll die Wahrheit sehn

Am nächsten Morgen
Klingelt dann das Telefon
Es ist sein Chef
Jetzt komm' in die Probleme holn

Er wird gefeuert, die Firma ist bankrott
Verzweifelt fässt er sich an seinen Kopf
Kennst do das Gefühl wenn einem nichts
Außer seiner Würde bleibt

Willkommen in der Wirklichkeit
Sein Stolz zerbricht
Seine Augen werden wässrig
Seine Frau merkt was ihn beschäftigt

Er sagt es wird nie wieder normal
Sagt wie sollen sie die Miete bezahlen
Und die Familie muss raus
Er blickt jetzt in die Augen seiner Kinder

Wenn sie nur wüssten es wird noch ums tausendfache schlimmer
Er hat sich das nicht ausgesucht
Dieser Mann der so stark war
Ein Ehemann ein aufrechter Vater

Er schämte sich so sehr
So dass er keinem was erzählt hat
Weil in das Problem so gequält hat

Jeder Tag gleicht einem Kampf
Den man verwundet übersteht
Nach Außen zeigt man keinen Schmerz
Niemand soll die Wahrheit sehn

Und jede Stunde die man lebt
Muss man weiter aufrecht gehn
Egal wie tief die Wunden sind
Niemand soll die Wahrheit sehn

Sein Leben ging den Bach runter
Was für ein Trauerspiel
Wie ein kleines Kind
Das von einer Mauer fiel
Er hatte nichts mehr

Dieses Leben war ihm nichts wert
Und er gab auch sein Gesicht her
Eine Frau die ihn zu Hause jetzt hasst
Er verdrängte seine Trauer I'm Schnaps
Er verzockte die Ersparnisse

Nahm sogar Geld bei seiner Tochter aus der Sparbüchse
Was soll man tun wenn das Geld nicht reicht
In der Spielothek sitzt voller Selbstmitleid
Und sein Leben zog vorbei

Sein Inneres zerbrach
Ein blinder Mann auf Erden
Der den Himmel nicht mehr sah
Er erinnert sich zurück
An die Liebe und sein Glück

Er schließt die Augen
Denn er weiß was er verloren hat
Schluckt es einfach runter
Damit er keine Sorgen hat

Respektiere deinen Zeuger also guck mich an,
Du wolltest Beef und ich halt dich in 'nem Bus gefangen.
Du willst von Erfolg sprechen,
Ich lasse 6mal Gold sprechen,
Dass alleine wird deinen Stolz brechen.
Wo sind die Stars denn jetzt?
Deine Drecks-celebreties,
Ich spuck' auf jeden und zieh immer noch das Extasy.
Der Beat ist Gangsta, Fresse ich bin schlecht gelaunt!
Die Rapper haben sich am meinem Penis fest-gesaugt.
Samy geht in Rente wegen der Verkaufszahlen,
Was mit dem Rest passiert könnt ihr euch ja ausmalen.
Ich bin der Inbegriff für harten Rap du weißt schon,
Wovon ich gerade Spreche keiner steigt auf meinen Thron.

Ihr habt viel zu lange drauf gewartet,
Doch ich bin zurück und ich erlaub' euch wieder aus zu-atmen.
Ich bin back!
Das ganze Land hat drauf gewartet,
Ihr seit jetzt schon außer Atem.
Wer ich bin?
Kingbushido, Sonny Black.

Ich hab die ganze Scheiße mitverfolgt,
Ihr tauscht die Baggy für Picaldi,
Redet Slang sorry doch ich nehm' euch nicht für voll.
Ich scheiß auf deutschen Rap, komplett und das mein ich auch,
Ihr kennt mein Leben bloß weil es mir die Zeitung klaut.
Komm noch ein kleines Stück näher, ich such das Gespräch,
Ich hab ein Foto von Osama in den Pass geklebt.
Und jetzt wird scharf geschossen, du hast keinen funken Stolz,
Deine Eltern haben gelogen du warst ungewollt.
Hol deine krassen Freunde hol mir deine krasse Gang,
Ich bin ein Wasserfan deshalb wirst du im Fass ertränkt.
Sonny skrupellos ja ich ich war als erster da,
Ich geh direkt in dein Gehirn rein wie Nervengas.
Wer ist der Volksheld der deine Freunde krass besiegt,
Bind dir zwei Torpedos an die Füße es ist Apres Ski.
Jetzt wird dein Arm gebrochen und du kannst nichts dagegen tun,
Für mich bleibt ihr Wichser eben Schwul.

Ihr habt viel zu lange drauf gewartet,

Carlo Colucci ich trag' immer noch Berliner Style,
Und das Gesock ich ergreife jetzt für sie Partei.
Ich seh' dein Dorf und begreife das es nie so wird,
Nie so wird das ist Trainingshose und Bushido-shirt.
Keine Lust auf Unterhaltung,
Das hier ist der Sound der Straße,
Das hier ist das einmal im Jahrhundert Album.
Ich mach dem ganzen Land jetzt endlich klar was Rap bedeutet,
Für was soll ich mich schämen ich werde nie den Dreck verleugnen.
Ich fick dein Missgeburten-treff du bist hier nichts Wert,
Album Nr.7 jeder wartet auf die Wiederkehr.
Ich bin böser als zuvor bist du dem Hass gewachsen?
Scheiß egal ob sie jetzt bald diesen Mann verhaften.
Ich komm auf die Bühne Junge,
Sag mir siehst du diese Menschenmassen?
Kriminelle die euch reiche Menschen hassen.
Und ich sage euch jetzt eins und ihr könnt mir glauben,
Dieses Album öffnet euch die Augen.

Bushido,"Merkst du wo du hier gelandet bist
Zum ersten Mal siehst du Junkies verwahrlost
Von Angesicht zu Angesicht
Ja im Wannsee bist du gut dran
Red' nicht von Berlin
Du warst nur auf Klassenfahrt am Kurdamm
Hier gibt es Betonklötze
Wo über 1000 Menschen reinpassen
Wo sie ein wie dich nicht vorbeilassen
Du wirst hier nie reinpassen
Das ist Smog aus der Unterwelt
Bullen kommen und du hast dich dumm zu stellen
Hörst du die Hunde bellen
Sie suchen Rauschgift
Kinder wachsen auf zwischen Fußball und Blaulicht
Zufall? Ich glaub nicht!
Du kannst hier nicht mal eine Straße merken
Weil du mit 'nem Kuhstall vertraut bist
Merkst du wie die Himmeldecke schwarz wird
Der Ort wo ein kleines Mädchen angezündet wurde
Und im Park stirbt
Jeder Tag wird anders als bei dir sein
Doch ich weiß das ich in Berlin bleib'

Und wenn die Wolken sich zusammenziehen
Und du die Hand nicht mehr vor Augen siehst
Wenn man dich schon zwingt Schmuck auszuziehen
Wo man Brüder zur Begrüßung auf die Wange küsst

Wo deine Hoffnung wie 'ne Sandburg zusammenbricht
Scheiße auf die lange Sicht
Kokain!
Ich puste goldenen Staub raus
Guter Guss zwingt deine Fotzen in den Kaufrausch
Meine Freunde wurden abgeschoben
Denn meine Freunde haben dich mit Freude abgezogen
Warum machst du immer noch auf hart
In der Stadt die niemals schläft
Jeder zweite hat die Höfe aus dem Knast schon gesehen yeah
Ich schick dich back in deinen Bauernstall
Und vielleicht findest du in deiner Drecksscheune auch 'n Mauerfall
Für den Touristen
Die Nutten auf den Standstreifen
Und wenn die Kohle stimmt
Kannst du sie auch an-scheißen
Das ist die Stadt wo jetzt jeder drüber reden kann
Wo du nur als Berliner überleben kannst

Wenn du auf der Straße Jugendbanden triffst
Platzwunden wenn dich die Stange trifft
Für deine rosarote Brille gibt es kein Platz
Ich will 'ne Entschuldigung und scheiß drauf ob du Zeit hast
Du bist der nächste tote Mann der auf der Klippe rollt
Hab ich dir nicht gerad' gesagt das du dich verpissen sollst?
Das ist kein Szenetreff
Das ist der Mond der auf die Stadt scheint
Von Abgasen siehst du diese Nebel jetzt
Wir sind die Augen
Die aus dunklen Gassen schauen
Der Grund warum sich Eltern nicht auf die Terrassen trauen
Es sind die Straßen hier
Wir sind das Uhrgestein

Ich sehe den Angstschweiß
Weil du wie Dreck stinkst
Du bist ein Landei noch dazu ein Crackkind
Geh mir aus dem Augen ich bin der
Der das Berliner Wappen hält
„Herzlich Willkommen in der Schattenwelt“

Bushido,"Mir fließt das Ghetto durch die Pulsadern
Ich gebe Dir dafür die Schuld Vater
Dass bei uns damals die Bullen da waren
So wie ich ist diese halbe scheiß Nation
Wir sind den heißen Tropfen auf den kalten Steinen gewohnt
Lass doch mal die Lügen sein
Wir knacken dafür keine Schlösser
Und das SEK tritt dafür keine Türen ein
Sag mir endlich wann kommt Ali aus dem Knast
Ich hoffe nur ich gib Dir mit dem Lied ein bisschen kraft
Ich bin der der die Regeln bricht
Und du wirst angehalten
Weil du als Kanake in nem AMG Mercedes sitzt
Du bist für sie nur wie Dreck
Und sie schließen dich weg
Und dann wird mir gesagt ich handle nicht politisch korrekt
Wie gern würden mich die Wichser in die Zelle bringen
Weil in meiner Fangemeinde eh nur Kriminelle sind
Ihr seid nur unzufrieden
Deswegen wollt ihr mir den Mund verbieten
Ich hab keine Lust meinen Mund zu schließen

Kannst du das Ghetto sehen kannst du es sehen
Kannst du im Ghetto sehen wie alles verkommt

Kannst du die Tränen sehen kannst du sie sehen

Für deine Eltern jetzt der Albtraum in Person
Das ist Gangster Rap
Denn ich rappe für ein paar Millionen
Ja der Kritiker er spekuliert
Und ich gib ihm jetzt ne Hilfe
Ich bin vorbestraft, asozial und tätowiert
Gut erkannt hier rappt der Junge übern Knast
Beim Echo fühlte ich mich wie ein unerwünschter Gast
Falsches Lachen denn sie hassen mich ich spür den krassen Neid
Ja ich bin der Typ der im Supermarkt den Kassen greift
Ihr wollt das echte leben
Dann lasst mich aussprechen
Ich kann noch mehr als nur Autotüren aufbrechen
Kannst du sehen wie sich die Wolkendecke völlig schließt
Mein ganzer Lebensstil wird mich noch in die Hölle ziehen
Ihr könnt mir den Tod wünschen
Ich möchte einfach in den siebten Himmel
Doch ich werd' mich in den siebten Tod sünden
Das ist sieben,Junge
Das hier ist das siebte Album
Und ich bewahre immer noch die Haltung

Und mag der Weg auch wieder steinig werden 
Scheiß drauf ich geh die Strecke auch zu Fuß
Was wollt ihr mir nur erzählen
Ihr seid ein Haufen Opfer
Ein Haufen Opfer dass man grade frisch ausgekotzt hat
Scheiß egal wie viel Geld ich schon verdient hab
Ich bleib für immer dieser Junge der gedealt hat
Ich mach den Unterricht
Den Unterricht für die Unterschicht
Fresse es gibt keinen der mich unterbricht
Sie versuchen mir die Art zu rappen auszureden
Man dabei haben sie uns vor langer Zeit schon aufgegeben
Ihr könnt mich abführen
Hundert tausend Kriminelle die mein Album kaufen
Könnt ihr diese Macht spüren
Ihr könnt mich weg sperren
Ihr könnt mich observieren
Die Langeweile treibt mich dazu euch zu provozieren
Es gibt keine Konkurrenz
Und ich ficke eure Artgenossen
Ich bin jetzt zurück jetzt wird scharf geschossen

Und du gehst baden, Mann, wie ein zu nah am Fluss gebautes Haus
Halt die Schnauze!
Jeder, der mir sagt, es geht nach oben, hat gelogen
Denn in Wahrheit ist mein Schlafplatz noch am Boden
Ich muss nicht nach Hollywood und mit allen Stars Sekt saufen
Ich muss mit dem Bus noch zu Aldi fahren und Essen kaufen
Nur weil ich rappe, kann ich Essen kaufen
Auch wenn mein Geld längst nicht reicht, um hier endlich mal wegzulaufen
Ich schreibe Zeilen und ich pack sie auf meinen Beat
Während die Kleinen aus Verzweiflung auf der Straße stehen und dealen
Seht die Wahrheit, dass mein Partner in dem Lied
Kids der Straße widerspiegelt und ein Pate ist für sie
Denk' mal nach, was sie dir sagen, ist das echt oder der letzte Stuss?
Ja, Mann, ich laber Dreck, wenn ich den ganzen Tag Dreck fressen muss
Und ja, sie wollen weg und einen Entschluss ziehen und da raus
Doch wie es aussieht, Mann, verpassen sie den letzten Bus hier raus

Ich hör' den ganzen Tag, ich wär' für unsere Jugend zu schlimm
Weil ihr meint, dass meine Texte viel zu skrupellos sind
Wo sind die Kinder? Wo sind sie, wenn die Schule beginnt?
Du siehst sie sitzen draußen auf der Straße und sie suchen den Sinn
Es geht um Klauen und um Dealerei, jeder will ein Spieler sein
Heute ist es Gras ticken und morgen Autoschieberei
Okay, das gibt's in Dörfern nicht
Doch ich lebe in Berlin
Wo sich ein Junkie jede Scheiße in den Körper spritzt
Was kann ich dafür, dass so etwas passiert?
Denkt ihr, ich hab' durch Musik eure Kinder dazu animiert?
Ich denke manchmal echt, dass es keiner begreifen mag
Ich hab' eure Kinder so gemacht, das war leicht gesagt
Das Produkt meiner Umwelt
Ihr habt mich erschaffen und jetzt guckt, wie euer Weltbild umfällt
Sag', was die Scheiße soll, fünf mal einfach Gold

Und ist dein Vater zwar frei,) und das ist kein Witz
Dann hat er keine Arbeit und nachmittags schon einen sitzen

(Diese Männer ziehen durch's Land, machen Geld, als ob nichts wär')
Und beim Rest aus diesem Land bleibt der Teller immer leer
(Wir sind nicht schuld daran, dass Kinder nicht mehr reden und sich schlagen,)
Weil sie sehen, wie ihre Stars sind und sie leben, was wir sagen
(Und es ist nicht leicht, hoffnungsvoll zu beten und dann teilen,)
So 'ne Scheiße, Gott hat leider nicht für jeden von uns Zeit

Bushido,"Du wurdest mit der Krankheit geboren
Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
die ganze Lust am Leben hast 
Du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
doch du kannst nichts dafür
nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt 
Und seine Hand dich berührt
und er stand vor der Tür
langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick 
Hatte sich langsam geschnürt
und du hörst auf zu zählen
wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, 
Sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, 
Du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
dir zu geben und zu nehmen 
Aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen
Du wirst alt du wirst krank
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Ich fall jetzt auf meine Knie und den Schmerz den beweis ich mit Tränen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Sag warum betet man nur wenn's einem schlecht geht? Ich lass dich nicht gehen
(doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)
Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb
Ich bin pausenlos gefickt, bitte lauf nicht in das Licht
Refrain

Wenn dieses Schicksal dich trifft dann tuts weh doch ich werds nie verstehen

Mode-Praktikanten wurden Gangster
Baut mir ein Denkmal, ein Denkmal aus Chrom
Und in meiner Hand ein Spiegel mit erkennbarem Koks
Bin ein Fan von Kanonen
Du Stand-of-Mission, du willst Beef mit dem Gee und du hängst am Balkon
Letztendlich der Tod kann dich von der Therapie befreien
Adios Amigos, c'est la vie, good bye
Erinner dich an mich, Der Boss der junge Black
Ja und deine Eier sind nicht nur seit Ostern wieder weg
Diskutier nicht mit uns, es macht keinen Sinn, mach dein Ding, ja du Mastschwein stinkst
Die Koffer voll mit Cash, Oli Pocher gibt mir Recht,
wenn ich in den Dschungel flieg und Ross danach erstech
Ja ich box mich ins Geschäft, ich bleib schwer kriminell
Bleib ein Rolling Stone, Schnauze ich frag: ""Wer will paar Schellen?""

Und ich hab mein Buch draußen
Du willst von Playboy in die Juice laufen?
Wissen wies bei Aggro war? Ganz einfach: Buch kaufen
Sag wer ist so legendär wie ich?
Mein Rezept: einfach Stickle, rappen, fertig, Hit
Hab das gemacht worauf du neidisch bist
Und wenn schon, mein Auto ist so Luxus, schon allein die Lenkung
Ich hab ihn ins Rollen gebracht
Ja vom Dealer zu nem Rapstar
Ich bezahl mit Visa wenn ich Sex hab
Ich seh den Untergrund als Fluch

Ich war damals viel zu jung dafür man hatte noch kein Plan vom Business
Dachte ich mach jetzt mit Rap mein Geld weil sonst der Tag gefickt ist
Aggro Business, man damals gab's noch keine Aggro Bitches
Dacht' nur ich wär' Aggro wichtig fast wurd' ich brutal vernichtet
Mir wurd die Chance gegeben plus ich hab mein Wort gegeben
Trends gesetzt den nur durch mich war plötzlich Cordon Sport am Leben
Verdammt man nur durch mich war plötzlich auch der Block am Leben
Durch Bushido war im Rapgeschäfft dann auch Gesocks vertreten
Für euch war's selbstverständlich Halil ich hab's rausgefunden
Selbstverständlich Fler und mich für ein bisschen Patte auszunutzen
Wir waren so unerfahren 1000 scheiß Versprechen hier
2000 scheiß Versprechen da und wir wurden durch Rappen arm
Verdammt man Aggro hat uns gar nichts klar gemacht
Klar gemacht hat mir nur Mama mein Yamaha MD8
Danke Mama scheiß auf Aggro man ich schulde euch jetzt nichts
Ihr schuldet mir meine Zeit die Geduld ich nur den Strick
Man ihr Fotzen habt mich so verraten wir waren damals so geladen
Ich hätt' Lust euch totzuschlagen war's nicht schön mich los zu haben
Ich hab mich so sehr auf das selbe verlassen
Doch dann gemerkt ich muss das selbe verlassen ihr scheiß Verräter

Und wenn ich euch jagen würde jeder von euch bräucht' 'ne Pumpgun

Ein letztes Mal wollt ich dich sehen, man
Du warst meine Sonne, was fällt ihnen ein, mein Licht zu nehmen

Mir bleibt bloß die Erinnerung

Du warst meine Luft zum atmen
Und auf den Bus zu warten ist mir noch nie schwer gefallen
Ich riech' noch den Duft am Kragen
Es fällt mir so verdammt schwer, mir nichts anzutun
Schreib' mir nicht, mach mir kein' Mut, Du kennst dein' Mann zu gut
Und Ich zähl' die Tage, zähl diese verdammten Tage
Träum' von deinen braun' Augen und den schwarzen langen Haaren
Es macht mich so kaputt, Innerlich kaputt mein Schatz
Lass nicht reden, sag was hat am Telefon der Kuss gebracht
Hab ich nicht Schluss gemacht? Hör' jetzt auf, beend' das Leid!
Hab dich rein-geritten, Jetzt bereu' ich diesen Gangster-Scheiß
Nenn' mir den Preis, ich bezahl' ihn jetzt um dich zu sehn'
Dich zu sehen, wär' mein größter Wunsch, ich lass dich nicht mehr gehen'
Doch das Beste wär,wenn du nicht mehr vergisst , 
Weil ich bin ans Lebensende in der dunklen Zelle sitz'

Bis zum Ende gehen, Ich schwör's dir jetzt, du hältst nicht durch
Man hier im Knast gibt's nur Hass, Tränen, Kälte, Furcht
Schatz hier drehst und du völlig durch, 4 Wände jeden Tag
Ich werd' verrückt u dass ich hier ende geht nicht klar
Ich denk an Dich, Tag und Nacht
Durch wird die Nacht zum Tag
Ich kann nicht mehr
Dein Gesicht raubt mir so krass den Schlaf
Es wird zu viel, Wie gern würd' ich jeden Abend sterben?!
Ich wünsch' nicht mal meinem größtem Feind, so bestraft zu werden
Jeden Tag das gleiche hier
23 Stunden Zelle
Langeweile treibt mich, dass ich Möbel ohne Grund umstelle
Täglich grüßt das Murmeltier
Das hier ist der Gleiche Film
Hier wirst du gezwung', jeden Tag mit deinem Feind zu chillen
Es hat sich nicht gelohnt
Alles war ein Griff ins Klo
Ritz' dein' Namen in die Wände
Scheiße ich vermiss dich so
Glaub mir ich vermiss dich so
Denk an alte Zeiten
& Blick auf meine Uhren
Mir wird klar hier geht die Zeit nicht rum
Schatz, bitte hilf mir raus, ich werd noch gekillt im Bau
Bonny ich sprech' zu dir , weil Clyde jetzt deine Hilfe braucht
Denk an mich, denk an damals , bitte lass mich nicht häng'
Jetzt beweis mir mal, dass du um mich kämpfst

Bevor du davon erfahren hast kam dir das Leben langweilig vor
Ja so langweilig vor
Die ganze Lust am Leben hast du leider durch das Kranksein verloren
Doch du kannst nichts dafür
Nichts dafür wenn der Todesengel kommt und seine Hand dich berührt
Und er stand vor der Tür
Langsam fiel das Atmen schwer der Strick hatte sich langsam geschnürt
Und du hörst auf zu zählen
Wie viele Spritzen es schon waren, sag wann hörn sie auf deinen Körper zu quälen?
Diese Wörter tun weh,
Die Diagnose die der Arzt gibt, du sitzt da verstört unter Tränen
Und nichts scheint mehr fair, dein Gesicht bleibt so leer
Ich schreib in das Gedicht deinen Schmerz
Denn nur Gott hat dieses Recht,
Dir zu geben und zu nehmen aber bete denn die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt

Lieber Gott du darfst mir diesen Mensch einfach jetzt noch nicht nehmen
(Doch es kommt, doch es kommt, doch es kommt, wie es kommt)

Jetzt wächst der Tod in dir drin. Und er wächst, und er wächst,
Warum warn die Ärzte so was von blind? Wie konnt so was beginnen?
Und wie lang du lebst kann nur Gott und kein Notarzt bestimmen
Deine Tränen sagen mehr, viel mehr als Tausend Worte,
Worte die dein Leben grad erschweren. Und wir stehen da am Meer
Du willst fliegen wie ein Vogel doch du bist in einem Käfig eingesperrt
Ich warte hier bei dir
Auch wenn du deinen Verstand, den Glauben und die Haare jetzt verlierst
Ganz egal wie sehr du frierst, ich deck dich zu und pass auf dass du den Atem inhalierst
Ich halt deine Hand, deine Augen fallen zu, meine Faust guck sie ballt sich zusammen
Ballt sich zusammen, und es kommt wie es kommt, kein Entkommen

Du warst ein so guter Mensch
Zu jedem nett, hast gelacht, warum konnte Gott nicht so was erkennen?
Sag was hast du nur getan?
Was hast du schlimmes nur getan dass du grad mit deinem Leben hier bezahlst?
Und ich halt deine Hand. Zum dritten mal, vierten mal, fünften mal, sie wird kalt
schau mich an, schau mich an wenn du mich hörst,
verdammt gib mir jetzt ein Zeichen, bitte du musst bleiben
Unterdrücken fällt mir schwer, ich kann die Tränen nicht mehr halten
Komm zurück ich kann nicht mehr, komm zurück ich schwör ich sterb

Es ist wichtig dass auch das was die schweigende 
Mehrheit hier in Deutschland denkt gesagt wird, 
Wir müssen zur Kenntnis nehmen, dass die Hälfte aller Straftaten, 
Die körperliche Gewalt gegen andere beinhalten, 
Von Menschen unter 21 Jahren begangen werden, 
In Deutschland, und das die Hälfte der Täter, 
Täter mit einem Migrationshintergrund sind. (Sind, sind, sind)

Dieses Land hier hat mich großgezogen, 
Doch ich werd hier so behandelt, man
Als hätt' ich von Soldaten Munition gestohlen.
Nur weil du auf meinem Pass keinen Adler siehst,
Ich dachte, dass für eure Freiheit doch der Adler fliegt.
Es war doch Einigkeit, Recht und die Freiheit, 
Sag mir, hab ich nicht das Recht? Lass mich frei sein.
Frei sein, so wie der Vogel der fliegt,
Doch ihr schickt mich gerade weg, zu den Toten im Krieg.
Sag, was hab ich falsch gemacht?
Ich wollt nur glücklich sein.
Und der Gedanke zu Verschwinden, 
Erdrückt mich gleich.
Was wird aus meinen Freunden, die bald vor Sorge sterben?
Was wird aus mir, wer zieht ihn raus, 
Diesen Dorn im Herzen?
Hört auf mir vorzuwerfen, dass ich vorbestraft bin,

vielen Dank, es war so wunderschön, blau das Licht.
Es ist ein Augenblick, der dir das Leben nimmt,
sag kennst du das Gefühl wenn geradezu die Ehre sinkt?
Wenn ein Mann voller Würde schon in Tränen schwimmt.
Siehst du den Plattenbau? Ich hab da schon gelebt als Kind.
Siehst du den Fußballplatz? Damals war ich gerade 8,
und dieser Stürmer wurd' in diesem Block zum Star gemacht.
Wie waren hier Tag und Nacht, Tag und Nacht mit meinen Freunden,
man ich bin hier groß geworden, ihr verscheucht hier einen Deutschen!
Klar hab ich Mist gebaut, doch wer war als Kind schon reif?
Die deutsche Sprache gleich zu lernen, ist bestimmt nicht leicht.
Dann kommst du plötzlich in die Klasse und wirst schikaniert,
klar wirst du aggressiv, was wollt ihr Ficker hier?

Die Maschine steigt, Berlin wird immer kleiner,
die 2te Träne kommt, man, Berlin war meine Heimat.
Ich denk zurück, wie waren immer jung und froh,
und das Taschentuch beweist. 
Die Erinnerung kommt hoch.
Das Taschentuch beweist, dass ich einer war von euch,
ein Pass ist nur Papier, doch entscheidet wer ist deutsch.
Jetzt erklär' mir die Gerechtigkeit,
unsere Welt gehört nur Gott, und nicht dem Staat,
doch der Staat wird zu mächtig sein.
Ich sitz' im Flieger drin, ich flieg, 
Doch zerbreche gleich.
Und der Richter schweigt, weil das Gesetz schon reicht.
Ich hab die beste Zeit, die Jugend hab hier verbracht.
Ich bleib ein scheiß Kanake, den man so erniedrigt hat!

Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Du scheißt auf die, die sinnlos reden
Denn du bleibst ein Mann der Tat
Arbeitest grad hart
Den ganzen gottverdammten Tag
Du fühlst dich alt und schwach, du fühlst dich ausgelaugt
Und das Schwein von Chef lässt an dir die schlechte Laune raus
Was für ein Pausenclown, 10 Jahre Blut und Schweiß
Du guckst in den Spiegel, dieser Blick sagt „Genug, es reicht!“
Bei deiner Frau ist Funkstille, Trauer, geht sie fremd?
Hast du echt noch Kraft dem Hund aufzulauern?
Die Kinder ha’m dich auch belogen
Egal ob Rauchen, Party, Saufen, Drogen
So hast du dein Blut nicht aufgezogen
Jeder denkt an sich, doch wer denkt an dich?
Früher College-Jacken, jetzt der Anzug, du erkennst dich nicht!
Dieses Leben ist halt einfach kalt und schwer
Und jedes Jahr kommen jetzt ein paar Falten mehr
Sag wie gern würdest du jetzt frei wie ein Adler fliegen
Kein’ Gedanken mehr verschwenden, irgendwann im Sarg zu liegen

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer
Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Deine Eltern sind jetzt alt und krank
Und das ist wie ein schlechter Film
Und du betest jetzt zu Gott bitte halt ihn an
Es kommt dir vor wie gestern, du warst grade neun
Dein erstes Tor, man ist stolz wenn sich der Vater freut
Er war dein Trainer, ihr kickt vor dem Haus
Heute läuft der Mann gebeugt mit 'nem Krückstock ins Haus
Du wirst traurig, dieser Mann der täglich mit dir draußen war
Sitzt ganz allein am Küchentisch und hat jetzt Grauen Star
Er ist krank, krank weil ihm die Niere fehlt
Der Stock begleitet ihn wenn er heut' spazierengeht
Ihr geht es schlechter als ihm,
Aber keinen interessiert's der Arzt gibt ihr meist den letzten Termin
Wer kann die Zeit jedoch zurückdrehen
Wer gibt dir wieder diese Kraft, sie ist schwach
Guck mal sie kann nur gebückt gehen
Und dir bleibt nur deine Erinnerung
Alles ist vergänglich, doch wir wären gern für immer jung
Immer jung

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer

Wie gern würde ich jetzt sagen „Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt“
Was hab ich getan? Warum bestraft mich Gott mit diesem Pech?
Wann wird mir bewusst, dass nichts hier für immer ist?
Das alles irgendwann zerbricht und ich dann in den Trümmern sitz’
Genieß den Augenblick, wenn du mit deinen Freunden bist
Diesen Moment mit deiner Mutter, denn dann freut sie sich
Irgendwann wird sie geh’n, genieß den Augenblick
Den du grade mit ihr teilst, alles andere braucht sie nicht
Und diese scheiß Gewohnheit, jeder denkt an sich
Kinder stressen ihren Vater, bis er lediglich zerbricht
Bis er einfach nicht mehr kann
Und auch nicht mehr reden will
Weil er wieder jung sein möchte und auch leben will
Nichts ist für immer, wir wären gern für immer jung
Lass uns die Zeit, die bleibt, einfach nur verbringen und
Vergiss auch ein’ Tag den harten Job
Hol’ jetzt die Ray Ban, die Blue Jeans, sing für sie, Karel Gott!

Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Du musst dich an die schöne Zeit erinnern
Denn nichts ist für immer
Für immer jung, ein Leben lang für immer jung
Ich werde einfach immer alles geben
Ein Leben lang für immer jung
Ich werde einfach immer alles geben
Für immer im Leben
Für immer, für immer, für immer jung",Für Immer Jung,2008

Ich seh' wie gern du mich doch abservierst
Und du willst sehen wie ich mich krass blamier' 
Du würdest Lachen wenn jetzt Tränen runter kommen
Und bei schlechten dürft ich diesem Leben nicht entkommen
Und du würdest mich verkaufen
Bin Luft in deinen Augen 
Sag mir bitte wie oft musst ich schon dran glauben
Sag mir wie oft wurd' ich von dir jetzt schon ausgenutzt
Hab dir so oft verziehen trotzdem hast du drauf gespuckt
Du redest ziemlich gern und gern auch über mich
Und geht's mir gut seh' ich wie du meine Flügel brichst
Ich bin dir scheiß egal ich hab's kapiert OK
Du schleppst die Steine an und blockierst mir den Weg
Ja ich interessier' dich Null ich hab nur ärger man
Ich brauch einen echten Freund einen der mich stärkt verdammt
Zeit in diesem dunklen Loch die wirst du verbringen, 
Weil du mir im Leben nie was gutes wünscht

Und ich hoffe dir geht es gut,egal wo du gerad' auch bist
Den Frieden findest du bald,ich merke doch wie es dich fickt
Ich seh' doch wie du dich quälst,ich spüre doch diesen Schmerz
Man tuh' dir sowas nicht an,diese tränen bist du uns wert

Man tuh' dir sowas nicht an, diese tränen bist du uns wert

Ich weiß du siehst es gerne wenn ich am verzweifeln bin
Wenn alles was ich habe einfach geht und ich alleine bin
Auch wenn wir keine Feinde sind Freunde sind wir auch nichts mehr
Ich bin es Leid doch irgendwie gewohnt von dir enttäuscht zu werden
So viel Versprochen doch die Versprechen gebrochen
Unsere Freundschaft ist gebrochen mit den letzten Funken Hoffnung
Heute gehst du blind an mir vorbei ich weil du willst mich leiden sehen,
Weinen sehen,doch ich bleibe stehen und schreib mit meinen tränen
Du suchst nach gründen mich zu hassen ich gewöhnen mich dran
Es fühlt sich an als ob du nur allein mit blicken töten kannst
Und verdammt warum willst du sehen aufgebe,
Hinfalle,liegen bleibe und nie wieder aufstehe
Ich wollte dir nichts böses im Gegensatz zu dir
Mein Schädel platzt wegen dir ich hab es akzeptiert
Und auch wenn mich all der Hass und auch 
Die Wut zerreißt hoffe ich es geht dir gut dabei

Mein Leben lässt dich kalt
Ja und trotzdem wünscht du mir Probleme an den Hals
Du willst sehen das ich zitter, zitter und verlier'
Keine träne sogar wenn ich hinter Gittern mal krepier'
Und diese Kälte werd' ich nie verstehen
Warum willst du mich nur auf der Erde liegen sehen?
Und du trittst mich mit Füßen dein Hass er zerbricht nicht
Ich hoffe es macht dich jetzt Glücklich!

Es macht mich verrückt
Ich weiß du willst jetzt sehen wie ich Untergehe
Und ich nehm' es einfach hin auch wenn ich nicht den Grund verstehe
Warum bist du Grundlos böse,hier liegen nur Scherben rum
Selbst wenn ich sterben würde kämst du nicht zu der Beerdigung
Warum willst du mir nur alles nehmen was mir Freude macht
Ich will es nicht verstehen das ich die Zeit mit dir vergeudet hab
Und heute sag ich hier und jetzt für mich ist es erledigt 
Und ich hoffe nur der Herr ist mit dir gnädig!

Sie schmerzt, die Erinnerung,
Du hast mich genomm' wie ich bin, ich hab mir damals oft gewünscht wir bleiben immer jung
Ohne Sorgen, sehr viel Spaß gemacht und dumm gelacht,
Gras gehabt und rum-gemacht, du warst wie ein Kumpel, Schatz
Erinner' dich zurück, wie waren wie Topf und Deckel
Deine Mutter meinte ""Geh dich nie mit einem Moslem treffen""
Was kann ich dafür wenn deine Mom mich gleicht hasst
Weil meine Tätowierungen ins Familienbild nicht reinpasst
Leider war sie nur zu oft diesem Glück im Weg
Sie hat es kaputt gemacht, guck wie ich die Stückchen kleb'
Ich wurde aggressiv, ich fing' an aus-zurasten
Du hast es mitgemacht und ich hab's an dir ausgelassen

Ich war einfach jung, ich war dumm, ich hab drauf gekackt
Man wie gern würd' ich die Zeit jetzt zurückdrehen
Und ein klein Teil von meinem Glück nehmen

Siehst du wie ich innerlich zerbrech'
Spürst du diesen Schmerz, es tut weh
Und scheiße man ich werd's niemals verstehen
Sag wie konnt' ich dich bloß gehen lassen
Mir fällt es schwer etwas zu essen,
Wie konnt' ich so ein Fehler machen

Siehst du wie ich innerlich kaputt geh'
Siehst du jetzt mein Leid?
Es tut weh
Verdammt-nochmal ich werd's mir nie verzeihen.
Wie konnt' ich dich bloß gehen lassen,
Mir fällt es schwer normal zu schlafen.
Wie konnt' ich so ein Fehler machen

Gestern hat es mich komplett zerrissen
Ich hab' gemerkt wie du mir fehlst 
Und ich Idiot hab auch die letzten Fotos weggeschmissen
Ich bin's nicht wert ich hab zu viel zerstört
Ich hab gehört du hast ein Freund mein Herz wird nie wieder dir gehören
Es ist ein Stich im Herzen, ich schwör' ich bring' ihn um
Du bist gestorben, du lebst nur in der Erinnerung
Ich hoffe nur dass ich euch beide nie zusammen seh'
Sag hab ich nicht genug geblutet, Ich hör auf dich anzuflehen
Ich höre auf zu fragen ob du mir nochmal verzeihst
Ich werd' auch nie mehr fragen ""Jenny hast du heute Zeit""
Es ist ein Teufelskreis, ich hab das nicht verdient
Sag warum tust du das, hab ich dich nicht geliebt
Ich weiß dass deine Mutter voll auf so Gesocks spuckt
Deswegen hast du mich vergessen wie auf Knopfdruck
Und das tut tierisch weh, egal wie schwul das klingt,
Es ist nicht viel doch in mir steckt noch was gutes drin
Hast du vergessen was ich alles schon getan hab
Ja alles schon gemacht hab, wohin ich dich gefahren hab
Du denkst ich kämpf' um dich, jetzt beende ich's,
Alles liebe Schatz und denk an mich.

Siehst du wie ich innerlich zerbrech'

Warum tust du, so als würdest du uns nicht mehr kennen?

Guck wo du uns reingeritten hast,
Hab keine Kraft, ich bleib allein, ich kack' hier ab. (Kack' hier ab.)
Geht's dir gut? Geniest du's jetzt im Geld zu schwimmen?
Dann geb' es aus solang du kannst, dieses Geld hier stinkt.
Sag war's das wert, uns dafür im Knast zu sehen?
Man hätt' ich das geahnt, ich hätt' dir meinen Teil abgegeben.
Sag mir schläfst du wirklich gut, in deinem weichem Bett?
Ich schlaf' nicht wirklich gut, auf diesem weißem Brett.
Ich dachte gerade, wir drei könnten uns vertrauen,
denk zurück, man, wir schwänzen sogar Schule um zu Klauen.
Es ist schon traurig, wenn man wegen Geld vergisst,
merkst du gerade nicht, dass du dich selber fickst?

und ich lese schon 6mal das selbe Buch, schlag es zu, und verfluch's.
Boxen uns die Knöchel wund,
und das Blut läuft von der grauen Wand,
du legst uns Wörter in den Mund.
Erzähl ruhig weiter deine Lügen Spasst.
Doch der Tag kommt, an dem selbst du nicht mehr lügen kannst.
Sieh uns an, du siehst dann,
unsere Träume sind gefickt, in diesen Räumen ohne Licht,
von falschen Freunden gefickt.
Unsere Freude ist erstickt, wie die Kerze auf dem Tisch,
immer wieder treibt die Wut uns die Schmerzen ins Gesicht.
Und du warst wie Familie für mich, zu dieser Zeit
und wie früher, wird alles geteilt, doch nur durch 2.
Und ich hab's dir prophezeit, hab gesagt lass dir 'ne Woche Zeit,
bevor du das Geld jeder Fotze zeigst.
Doch du warst gierig, und uns zu ficken und dein Arsch zu retten, war nicht schwierig.
Du willst nicht kapieren? Dann kapier's nicht!
Du existierst nicht du interessierst mich nicht mehr,
und der Typ in deinem Spiegel respektiert dich nicht mehr.

Ich hoff so sehr dass du ihn dort oben liest,
Ich konnt mich nichtmal verabschieden, nein,
Deswegen stehn hier auf dem Blatt diese Zeiln',
Wir warn' nicht da, als es passiert ist,
Ich würd echt alles tun, dass du wieder hier bist,
Ich zünd 'ne Kerze an, und die ist nur für dich,
Wünsch mir so sehr, dass du 1 Mal noch zu mir sprichst,
Nur noch 1 Mal mit uns in der Runde sitzen,
Ein letztes Mal diskutieren, und die dummen Witze,
Der schwarze Regen fällt, und keiner lacht mehr,
Sehen keine Sonne hier, als ob es Nacht wär,
Es ist so krass schwer, wieder aufzustehn,
Und selbst wenn's hier einer schafft, laufen Tränen,
Dieser Dolch steckt im Herz, Zeit heilt keine Wunden,
Du gewöhnst dich nur an den Schmerz!

Diese Schmerzen, machen mein Tag nicht leicht,
Tausend Kerzen, man und dein Sarg war weiß,
All die Tränen, verdammt du fehlst mir so sehr,
Bitte lies diesen Brief Bruder, es ist so schwer!

Bruder, alles okay?
Ich bin jetzt ganz woanders, doch kann dich sehen,
Auf der Beerdigung, war ich schon wieder munter,
Doch mir lief es eiskalt den Rücken runter,
So viele Menschen, paar kannt ich von damals,
Man sogar mein Zahnarzt
Der alte Klassenlehrer, meine aller besten Freunde,
Sogar meine aller erste Freundin,
Meine Eltern, Brüder, Onkels, die Tanten,
Und keiner hat's verstanden,
Ihr macht euch Vorwürfe, ihr macht euch Sorgen,
Doch mir geht's gut, hier bin ich geborgen,
Ihr müsst jetzt wieder leben, ich möchte dass ihr lacht,
Und keine Angst, ich bin da, ich seh was ihr macht,
Küss die Jungs von mir, ich vermisse euch,
Wir sehen uns wieder, in Liebe, dein bester Freund!

Tausend Kerzen, ja und mein Sarg war weiß,
All die Tränen, ich vermiss dich noch mehr

Es ist so schwer, man ich seh's doch

Und wenn sie meinen du stehst nie wieder auf, dann lass sie reden junge
Zeig ihnen das ist dein traum, du wirst ihn leben
Und beweist diesen leuten die niemals an dich geglaubt haben
Das was sie haben, kannst du auch haben
Denn wenn sie meinen du hast hier nix verloren
Dann zeig es ihnen, zeig es allen, keiner hält dich mehr auf
Komm lass dich fallen, heb den kopf und blick einfach nach vorn

Bushido,"Ich war gerade dreiundzwanzig, sie war erst achtzehn
Wir waren beide frisch verliebt, es tut so krass weh
Erinner' mich zurück, ich wollt' die Welt sehen
Ich wollte Spaß haben, wollte Geld zählen
Hatte keinen Job, war noch so grün hinter den Ohren
Habe früh die Perspektive hier verloren
Immer draußen am Gammeln, nichts tun
Selbst meine Mutter fand' was ich tat nicht cool
Jeden Tag Sex, es war so schön, wir waren jung, frei
Und zugedröhnt
Jeden Tag nur Parties, Verantwortung gab's nicht
Doch ich wusste, das Schicksal bestraft mich
Es hat geklingelt an der Tür
Sie hat gesagt „Schatz mach auf, ich frier'“
Ich konnte an ihrem Blick erkenn' was passiert ist
Und in dem Augenblick wusste ich, ich verlier' dich

Es tut mir so leid, ja, es tut mir so leid
Und ich wünsche mir nichts, und ich wünsche mir nichts
Nur, dass dieser Brief, nur, dass dieser Brief
Dich irgendwann erreicht, dich irgendwann erreicht

Ja es tut mir so leid, ja, es tut mir so leid
Und ich wünsche mir nichts, nein ich wünsche mir nichts
Nur, dass du mir verzeihst, nur, dass du mir verzeihst
Und ich bete für dich, ja ich bete für dich

Deine Mutter hatte Angst, jetzt dachte sie,
Dass sie dir nicht das geben kann, was du verdienst
Sie hatte selber keine Lehre, keinen Abschluss
Und dieser Traum vom Glücklichsein war im Abfluss
Ihre Eltern hat es gar nicht interessiert,
Denn sie waren von uns eh nicht fasziniert
Kein Job, keine Wohnung, kein nichts
Sie hat gefleht, nein ich schaff's allein nicht
Ich hab gesagt, ich bin da, wir schaffen das
Ja und dann hab ich Grass vertickt in der Nachbarschaft
Ich hab geschworen, ja ich werde für uns da sein
Du warst noch nicht mal da, doch hattest ein Sparschwein
Eines Tages klingelt das Telefon,
Ich hör sie schluchzen, dann kommen die Tränen hoch
Sie hat gesagt „Es tut mir leid, Schatz, ich lieb' dich
Ich war in der Abtreibungsklinik“

Es ist nicht einfach zu verkraften
Ja, wir hatten gute Zeiten, und die schlechten Zeiten
Wenn du jetzt einschläfst, seh' ich dich im Bett hier Leiden
Es tut mir unfassbar Leid, doch was soll ich tun?
Es ist so geschrieben, die Beziehung sollte ruhn'
Und ich erinner' mich gern an die Tage die so schön warn
Glaubst du mir, dass ich dich schon immer wunderschön fand?
Ich war jeden Tag bei dir und du bei mir, jetzt bin ich weg
Doch ich bin immer noch bei dir, sag
Kannst du mich hör'n, mein Hass beginnt
Wenn ich dran denk, dass ein Typ mal meinen Platz einnimmt
Verdammt, ich brauch es nicht erklären
Ich brauch dich so sehr, ohne dich scheint die Welt
Da draußen so leer doch ich kann nichts dran ändern
Ich wär so gern bei dir
Ich muss lern' zu akzeptiern'

So schwer es mir auch fällt
Jetzt Abschied von dir zu nehmen
Ich lass dich gehen
Ich dank' dir für die schöne Zeit
Ich hoff dass wir uns wiedersehen

Mir fällt das Loslassen schwer, ich folg dir überall hin
Alles erinnert dich an mich, ich stecke überall drin
Ich seh dich nachts, wenn du träumst, wenn du aufstehst und frühstückst
Küss deine Stirn, wenn du schläfst, doch du fühlst nichts
Ich bemüh' mich da zu sein,
Es fällt mir schwer, dir jetzt nah zu sein
Ein Tag allein ein Tag mir dir,
Was würd' ich dafür geben schau dir nicht
Meine Fotos an, es würde dich nur quäln'
Und gib jetzt Gott nicht die Schuld, dass du allein bist
Gib Gott nicht die Schuld, wenn du verzweifelst
Du erreichst nichts mit dieser Trauer in dir
Tu was für dich, tu was gegen diese Mauer in dir
Und es zerreißt mich, wenn du dann vor mir kniest
Die Blumen niederlegst und die Antwort nicht kriegst
Denn jedes Jahr
An diesem Tag, fällt von dir eine Träne auf das Grab

So schwer es mir auch fällt
Jetzt Abschied von dir zu nehmen
Ich lass dich gehen
Ich dank' dir für die schöne Zeit
Ich hoff dass wir uns wiedersehen

So schwer es mir auch fällt
Jetzt Abschied von dir zu nehmen
Ich lass dich gehen
Ich dank' dir für die schöne Zeit
Ich hoff dass wir uns

Bushido,"Du stehst morgens auf, jeder ist am Stressen
Wolkendecke grau, Lehrer sind am Stressen
Man du fühlst dich hässlich, wem kannst du vertrau'n?
Warum Vertrauen schenken, wenn jeder es missbraucht
Jeden Tag nur down, du siehst die ganzen Scherben
Eigentlich möchtest du doch nur verstanden werden
Missverständnis hier, Missverständnis da
Du setzt ein Ziel doch es ist schwer die Richtung zu bewahr'n
Man redet dir auch ein, dir fehlt die Disziplin
Die Tage scheinen so lang, sie reden viel zu viel
Der Kopfschmerz steigt, du hättest gern Flügel
Damit du weit weg fliegen kannst, du bist müde
Müde von dem Stress, Müde von dem Ganzen
Die Last auf deinen Schultern, wie Riesenelefanten
Du fühlst dich selbst von der Familie nicht verstanden
Wer öffnet dir jetzt endlich diese Schranken?

Glaub mir immer wenn du denkst, es geht nicht mehr
Kommt von irgendwo ein Lichtlein her
Lass sie reden denn ich weiß wie du dich fühlst
Und denk jetzt nicht dass uns Welten trennen, ich hab in der Scheiße tief gewühlt
Immer wenn du denkst, es geht nicht mehr
Kommt von irgendwo ein Lichtlein her
Lass sie reden denn ich weiß wie du dich fühlst
Und denk jetzt nicht, dass uns Welten trennen, ich hab in der Scheiße tief gewühlt

Ich steh morgens auf, und jeder ist am Stressen
Die Sonne ist am Scheinen, ich lass mich nicht stressen
Ich fühl mich nicht mehr hässlich, eigentlich brauch
Ich keine scheiß Tipps, links rein und rechts raus
Ich weiß wie hart das ist, die Steine wegzuräum'n
Wenn alle nur noch lachen, und meinen 'Hör auf zu träumen'
Wenn sie die Hoffnung nehmen, an die du ja so glaubst
Du liegst am Boden, guck wie sie befriedigt auf dich schau'n
Wie unfair kann man sein? Du liegst schon tief im Loch
Und trotzdem wird noch reingetreten bis du kotzt
Der Schmerz geht vorbei, bei Narben wird es schwer
Aber glaub mir von irgendwo kommt ein Lichtlein her
Und dieses Lichtlein sorgt, dafür das du es schaffst
Wieder aufzustehen, egal wie du verkackst
Egal wie groß das Leid, oder dieser Schmerz doch ist
Das Leben ist zu kurz hör auf mich

Glaub mir immer wenn du denkst, es geht nicht mehr
Kommt von irgendwo ein Lichtlein her
Lass sie reden denn ich weiß wie du dich fühlst
Und denk jetzt nicht dass uns Welten trennen, ich hab in der Scheiße tief gewühlt
Immer wenn du denkst, es geht nicht mehr
Kommt von irgendwo ein Lichtlein her
Lass sie reden denn ich weiß wie du dich fühlst
Und denk jetzt nicht, dass uns Welten trennen, ich hab in der Scheiße tief gewühlt

Bitte glaub mir, egal wie schlecht es dir geht
Irgendwann kommt ein Lichtlein her
Ja und dann merkst du, wie schön es ist wieder zu lachen
Kopf hoch man das ist mein Ernst
Ich weiß es fällt dir,
Grade so schwer mir einfach mal Glauben zu schenken, doch ich meins nur gut
Du verlierst nichts, wisch die Tränen aus deinem Gesicht,
Ja und mach diesen einen Versuch

Ey, Selina das hier wird mein aller letzte Brief, 
Ja ich weiß, mein Verhalten war echt mies, 
Wir hatten beide diesen Traum, vereint-sein doch unterschieden
Hat uns leider unser Lifestyle, ich war ein Drecks-Kanake 
Der sein Geld gemacht hat und genau das Hatten deine Eltern 
Jetzt satt sie wollten kein' am Tisch 
Der mit Drogen dealt der Traum vom Schwiegersohn, 
Wie soll er sein, so wie sie, 
Und hier am Block guckt keiner auf die Tischmanieren 
Dei'm Vater war ich scheiß-egal 
Und deshalb wollt er mich blamieren, 
Ich vermiss dich so, vermiss die schöne Zeit, 
Vermiss das Kiffen Baby und auch die Vögelei 
Playstation und Ratten mehr konnt' ich dir nicht bieten, 
Deine Eltern war'n mit diesem Jungen nicht zufrieden 
Es ist traurig ich fühl' mich innerlich so leer, 
Schau' mich an es ist immer noch so schwer,

Lieber Gott kannst du mir sagen warum wollte sie nur gehen, 
Ich wart' so lang bis sich der Zeiger nicht mehr dreht, 
Ja warum wach ich nachts auf und schreibe Lieder, 
Es ist wegen Selina, bitte lieber Gott kannst du mir 
Sagen warum hab ich sie verloren 
Sag warum ist mein Herz schon wieder tief-gefroren 
Ja warum wach ich nachts auf und schreie wieder, 
Es ist wegen Selina (Selina)

Weißt du noch im Wohnzimmer auf diesem scheiß-teuren Teppich 
Der Sex, ich dachte er wird dreckig, 
Plötzlich ging die Türe auf und sie stand da, 
Uns war's scheiß-egal denn wir beide waren uns nah, 
Keiner konnte uns was mir fehlt die Zeit so sehr 
Öffne mein Herz und du siehst es ist einfach leer, 
Bin geschwächt und allein ich will nicht lächerlich scheinen, 
Ein echter Mann gibt doch zu das er mal nächtelang weint,
Schau' mich an siehst du was aus mir wird, was aus mir wird, 
Was der Hass jetzt bewirkt es tut weh wenn mich 
Deine Mutter einfach wegschickt seh' dich am Fenster, 
Und dein blick sagt vergess' mich, Trauer, Hass, Schmerz 
Und das leid, gib mir jedes mal ein can't 
Und ich wär' schon längst reich, 
Selina das hier wird mein aller letzter Brief 
Mein Herz du kannst es behalten, rest in peace

Warum ist mein Herz schon wieder tief-gefroren 
Ja warum wach ich nachts auf und schreie wieder,

Mit anzusehen wie wir langsam vor dem Schluss stehen, 
Mit anzusehen das hier alles Illusion war doch sie war so nah,

Ich werde warten und schweigen, aber bitte komm heim
Du kannst tun was du willst, du kannst widerlich sein
Aber du kannst da nicht liegen bleiben

ich hab die Schlacht gewonnen
Du hast gesagt der Krieg ist Gift für mich
Doch schau' mich an, das hier ist meins, hab mir geholt was mir gehört
Hätt' nie gedacht das dieser Druck in meinem Kopf so viel zerstört
Der Engel links, Teufel rechts, Engel schweigt, Teufel spricht
Mein Ziel verfolgt und dann gewonnen den Ehrgeiz den bereut man nicht
Doch wo bist du? Ich rufe dich, seh' dich nicht und suche dich
Die Krähen kreisen über mir sie lachen und verfluchen mich
Ich schrei' noch lauter, hörst du nicht?
Es ist vergleichbar mit 'ner Kerze die 
Im Wind im Herz erlischt als ob in mir mein Herz zerbricht
Seh' dich da liegen und ich wünscht das wär' ein Traum

Du warst so wie gemalt, guck, wie das Schicksal jetzt mein Bild zerreißt
Ich will nur eins, die Zeit zurück!
Ein kleines Stück vom alten Glück
Lass nie mehr los! Schau, ich hab dein Gesicht an meinen Hals gedrückt
Laufe weiter, auch wenn's schneit,
Durch den Wind und auf dem Eis
Ich spüre keine Kälte, halt für dich die Schmerzen aus
Doch bleib, bitte du kannst mich jetzt nicht alleine lassen
Wie soll ich das Leid verkraften? Wie soll ich es hier bloß nur alleine schaffen?
Ich bin so dumm! Was hab ich angestellt, nur für mein Ego?
Küss dich und sag ""Schatz, es tut mir leid!"" Doch du zeigst keine Regung!
Ich weiß nicht viel, doch ich weiß eins, dass ich dich brauch!
Ich fang' deinen letzten Atemzug, 
Ich blick zu Gott und sag hier bitte steh auf

Du warst so wunderbar
Versucht mir mein weg zu zeigen als es dunkel war
Mich vor der Welt beschützt, weil die Welt so schlecht ist
Hab ich´s dir nicht gesagt? Meine Welt ist hässlich
Trotzdem hatte ich Angst du würdest wieder gehen
Denn dieses Leben, dass ich leben das will niemand sehen
Und du hast aufgepasst, denn ich hab schlecht geträumt
Du hast für mich gekämpft damals wie ein echter Freund
Jedes mal wenn ich nachts depressiv war
Als sie meinten, warum ist der Spasst schwer-erziehbar
Warst du für mich da
Hast meine Tränen aufgefangen
Wir wussten es wir gehen auch erst dann
Wenn unser Herz nicht mehr schlägt
Sich diese Welt nicht mehr dreht
Weil alles dann mit wert nicht mehr zählt
Und ich warte noch auf dich
Bitte sag jetzt einfach nichts
Die Narben sind zu frisch

Ich kann vergeben, doch nicht vergessen.
Du warst mein Mädchen, ich war besessen,
Es sind die Tränen, die für sich sprechen.
Ich will endlich wieder leben, lass die Sonne in den Regen, glaub mir.!
Ich kann vergeben, doch nicht vergessen.
Du warst mein Mädchen, ich war besessen,
Es sind die Tränen, die für sich sprechen.
Ich will endlich wieder leben, lass die Sonne in den Regen, glaub mir.!

Von wegen Zeiten ändern sich, Zeiten ändern dich!
Es wurd' dir viel zu viel auf-einmal kam, ich kenn' das nicht.
Und dein Verständnis wurde plötzlich mein Gefängnis.
Ich wusste, dass mein Leben dir zu fremd ist.
Er ist verschwunden der Glanz in deinem Blick,
Auf einmal wolltest du nur anders sein als ich.
Dich aufgeben? Daran hätte ich nicht gedacht.
Hab so oft gesagt, ich besser mich mein Schatz (it was all a dream)
Ein Traum, ich versteh's einfach nicht,
Wie oft musste ich jetzt schon im Regen stehen für dich
Ich war blind, denn heute bist du nicht mehr, die von damals
Was soll der Scheiß du hast gewusst ich werd' kein Zahnarzt.
Auch wenn du nichts von mir hältst, ich trage dich
Noch immer tief in meinem Herzen, guck wie warm es ist.
Ich kann vergeben, doch du hast mich vergessen,
Du bist wie ein Fluch ich bin besessen.

Ich kann vergeben, doch nicht vergessen.

Bushido,"Ich hab um jeden Scheiß gekämpft,
Neid musst du dir erarbeiten,
Mitleid kriegst du geschenkt,
Ich wollt' Millionär werden,
Als Millionär sterben,
Und meine Kinder werden einmal Millionärserben,
Es war alles nur ein Tanz mit dem Teufel,
Ich wollt' meine Zeit mit keinem Schwanz hier vergeuden,
Geld machen,
Aus ungestrecktem Geld machen,
Wollt' es einfach in die teuersten Hotels schaffen,
Ich wollt' keine Stück,
Nein, ich wollt' den ganzen Kuchen,
Das ist der Grund, warum tausende den Mann verfluchen,
Das ist der Grund, warum Bullen diesen Mann hier suchen,
Ich bin ein Star,
Ich lieb' es wenn die Schlampen hupen,
Und die gesamte Jugend pumpt meinen Sound,
Denn ich kümmer' mich, einfach um meinen Traum,
Es ist über Nacht passiert und alles wegen eines Blatt Papiers

Und das alles verdank' ich bloß dem leeren Blatt Papier,
Dann kam der Text,
Alles war so krass verschmiert,
Echt unglaublich,
Mein Blut war die Tinte für den Stift,
Du kennst tausend Rapper,
Doch bestimmt keinen wie mich,

Gib' mir ein leeres Blatt Papier,
Ich mach' Gold daraus,

Yeah, mein Blut war die Tinte für den Stift,
Du kennst hunderttausend Rapper,

Es war 'ne scheiß harte Zeit, (Sercan weißt du noch?),
Denn das was ich erschaffen hab,
Hat vor mir noch kein Arsch erreicht,
Heute steh' ich hier und weiß ganz genau keiner kann mir was,
Außer Gott, denn er hat diesen Mann gemacht,
Mama danke, dass du mich nicht verlassen hast,
Du hast an mich geglaubt und ich hab's vollbracht,
Ja, ich hab's gemacht,
Tag und Nacht nur wach,
Das hier wird mein Königreich,
Also macht mir Platz,
Und ich mach' das Dachs(?) 'rein,
Geh' auf die Bühne,
Sehe die Hände, krieg von Hunderttausenden jetzt Liebe,
Sie steigen auf die Stühle,
Ich seh's auf der Tribüne,
Kein Blatt Papier kann beschreiben was ich gerade fühle,
Es ist unglaublich,
Zu wissen jemand braucht mich,
Dieser Mann, der niemals ihr Vertrauen bricht,

Bushido,"Yeah guck mal Zeiten ändern sich, dich und deine Sicht.
Und selbst den kleinen Jungen, der fast daran zerbricht
Dass seine Mutter auf den Knien, verprügelt wird von ihm
Weil der Alkohol ihn zwingt, die Zügel lang zu ziehen
Und es bessert sich nichts, wie ein Messer zersticht er die Familie 
Er lässt sie im Stich
Um ohne Vater aufzuwachsen musst du hart sein, Er war ein Kämpfer 
Und zwar seit Tag eins
Er wollt kein Mitleid, und auch kein Mitgefühl
Jetzt schau ihm in die Augen, denn nur ein Blick genügt
Und du siehst Hass, Schmerz und du siehst Leid pur
Und seine Jahre vergehen wie auf 'ner scheiß Uhr
Er scheißt auf Up and Downs, Es gab nur Tiefen keine Höhen
Sein Leben  War ungenießbar und nicht schön
Mein Leben, war ungenießbar und nicht schön
Aber scheiß' drauf ich hab mich längst an diesen Scheiß gewöhnt

Denn wenn jeder dir erzählt dass aus dir nichts wird
Kann passieren dass aus dir nichts wird
Ich wusst' schon von Klein auf 
Sie reden dann scheiß' drauf ein Stift, 
Ein Papier und ich nehm' diese Lines auf
Ein Mic und 'ne Mehrspur war das was ich hatte, 
Nach zwei Jahren hielt ich sie, krass meine Platte
Das was ich mache und das was ich getan hab war nötig, 
Wer kann mir erzählen man kann arm sein und fröhlich
Geld bestimmt dein Ich, Geld bestimmt dein Sitz, 
Wo du gerade bist, und wen du gerade fickst
Ich hab diese Welt geschaffen für mich, wie das geht? 
Schreib' einfach über Nacht einen Hit
Und verlasse dich nicht auf die Andern, sie kennen das nicht
Guck in den Spiegel, Zeiten ändern dich

Ich bin Jonas, ich wohn' in Frohnau mit meinen Eltern
In einem großen Haus, weil sie Geld ha'm
Hier hab' ich alles, aber irgendwas is' seltsam
Ich bin doch erst elf, doch es fühlt sich nich' wie elf an
Ich muss üben, ich weiß Papa wär' so stolz
Weil er mich dann immer liebt, will ich noch mehr Erfolg
Er macht sich halt'n Kopf, was aus mir werden soll
Oder hat er einfach nur ein Herz aus Holz?
Nein man, er liebt mich und Mama liebt mich auch
Ich mein' ich fühl' es, denn leider sagen sie's nich' laut
Und weil ich zu Hause nicht gut schlafe
Bin ich nachts lieber heimlich auf der Straße
Einfach mit der Bahn ein paar Runden fahrn'
Zum Bahnhof zu den Jungs mit den bunten Haar'n
Bier trinken, kiffen, ja, das sind meine Freunde
Kokain betäubt und es nimmt mir die Träume
Du fragst dich bestimmt auch, wo komm' die Drogen her?
Denn seitdem ich weg bin, gibt Papa mir keine Kohle mehr
Ich steh' jetzt an der Straße, alles in mir drin schreit ""Nein""
Doch ein Auto hält an und ich steig' ein

Und während dieser Film läuft, bete ich zu Gott
Denn es wird kein Happy-End geben, bitte drück auf Stopp

Das Schicksal trifft dich wie ein Schlag ins Gesicht
Und man wünscht sich, es wäre nie passiert
Du siehst deine heile Welt, wie sie gerade zerbricht
Und, dass du alles um dich herum verlierst

Du verlierst die Hoffnung, übrig bleiben Schmerzen
Und du wünscht dir, alles wäre nur ein Märchen
So mit ""Es war einmal"" auch mit Gewalt und Wut
Doch in 'nem Märchen wird am Ende alles gut

Ganz normal unter Menschen und kein Aufsehen erregen
Ganz normal ist seit Jahren nich' mal ein Arztbesuch
Weil der Doktor danach meint „Unterschreib mal das Buch“
Es sucht mich Heim wie ein Fluch, ich fühl' mich fast wie im Käfig
Und ja, auf meinen Schultern liegt die Last unerträglich
Fotos hier, Fotos da, sie fokussier'n diesen Star
Sie sind verliebt und vernarrt, sie wären mir gern so nah
Keine Privatsphäre und keinerlei Spur von Verständnis
Und bin ich im Hotel, sind sie im Flur und bedrängen mich
Ich will raus, doch es geht nicht, wie gern' würd' meine Mutter mal
Einen Tag draußen mit mir verbring', an nem Muttertag
Geld ist nich' alles, der Erfolg ist nich' alles
Doch was soll ich tun, ich hab' es so gewollt, also mach ich's
Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich will nicht meinen mir geht' schlecht
Ich zeig' euch nur die Schattenseiten am Geschäft

Ich hätte nie Gedacht
Dass ich jemals diese Schattenseiten seh'
Es raubt mir meine Kraft (Meine Kraft, meine Kraft)

Jetzt geht's los draußen warten dreitausend Fans
Versprochen, heut' wird dieses Treibhaus gesprengt
Wenn's brennt habt ihr was ihr wollt, aber euch reicht's nicht
Und deswegen ist mir mein Erfolg langsam schon peinlich
Dass ihr mich vergöttert und so, hab' ich nicht gewollt
Ich kann nichtmal einkaufen gehen ohne, dass ihr mich verfolgt
Ich hab die Schnauze voll
Ich glaub' ihr merkt's nicht, aber ja verdammt es nervt mich
Macht ein Foto und dann fertig, bitte strapaziert mein Herz nicht
Und nein, ich will mich nicht mit deiner Schwester treffen
Ich will mal im Park sitzen, kiffen und den Stress vergessen
Ich will raus, schon so lang' her, dass ich mal baden war
Keine Sonne, blasse Haut, Doreen nennt mich schon Dracula
Falls du dich fragst, warum aus meinem Tourbus rauch zieht
Weil alles nicht so lustig ist, wie's aussieht

Dass ich bis heute hier bleibe, hat keiner geglaubt
Und es ist lange nicht vorbei, nein, wir bleiben noch Stars
Guck mal, Bushido, da beißt schon wieder einer ins Gras
Er hat Hip Hop erfunden und war lange dabei
Ist ja alles schön und gut, aber langsam wird's Zeit
Weil er für seine Fans nur noch heißes Wasser in den Töpfen hat
Macht er's wie ein Junkie am Kotti, er gibt den Löffel ab
Ich flieg ins Paradies, einfach weg jetzt
Oder nach Wien und Paris, Jetset
Ich hoff' das klingt jetzt nicht überheblich
Aber immer wenn jemand geht denk ich „Endlich ist dieser Dreck weg!""
Na wo seid ihr jetzt, ich weiß ihr seid Pleite jetzt

Manchmal wird mir klar ich hab Böses in mir
Viel böses passiert, es war schön und gut
Doch warum wird aus Öl nur Blut
Warum sind wir stur gegenüber Leichen
Kinder werden geboren, hungern, verzweifeln
Die Reichen werden reicher und Arme bleiben arm
Ich stelle mir die Frage ""Was haben sie getan?""
Es bleibt wie es bleibt in uns steckt die Gier
Warum müssen wir uns im Dunkeln verlieren
Auf der Suche nach Licht aus Liebe wird Gift
Es fehlt die Moral man erschießt sich für nichts
Warum hat man Angst, Angst vor der Zukunft
Warum schlägt die Hilflosigkeit nur in Wut um?
Das sind wir Menschen voller Kummer und Sorgen
Doch Gott schenkt uns ein Morgen

Ich glaube es nicht, dass du es bist, 
Der diese Welt zerstört
Ich seh' in dein lächelndes Gesicht 
Und weiß wem mein Herz gehört

Warum schlagen wir Profit aus der Angst
Warum sind wir Menschen verliebt in den Kampf
Warum sind die Schwachen für uns eine Last
Allein und verloren in der dunkelsten Nacht
Die Erde sie bebt, der Himmel er weint
Trotzdem bittet keiner einen Fremden herein
Man schließt seine Augen, lebt vor sich hin
Warum suchen wir nur stets nach dem Sinn
Wir streben nach Glück, das Ziel es scheint so fern
Und so unerreichbar für uns, wie ein Stern
Warum sind wir müde, träge und kalt
Das Leben macht alt es fehlt uns der Halt
Und wir wissen nicht weiter, in diesem Nebel aus Zorn
Und es geht nicht nach vorn, das sind wir Menschen voller Kummer und Sorgen
Doch Gott schenkt uns ein' Morgen

Liebe wird zum Alltag du brauchtest nichts mehr sagen
Deine schönen braune Augen haben dich verraten
Ich habe die Chance ergriffen
Nein ich hab sofort begriffen
Du bist anders und ich wolltest wissen
Ich habe mir fest geschworen nie wieder so zu lieben
Wie bei meiner Ex wegen ihr war ich so am frieren
Ich bin kaputt gegangen
Ich hab das lieben verlernt
Ich wollt' zurück
Doch bei mir stand die Magie in den Sternen
Dann hab ich dich gesehen
Ich hab gewusst ich lass dich nicht mehr gehen
Ich war auf den sicheren weg
Wir haben gelacht und geweint
Klar gab es mal Hass und auch streit
Doch bei uns hat es gepasst
Denn wir 2 haben uns die liebe geschworen

Ich muss lernen zu warten und zu lieben
Ich hab bis heute nur den Schmerz erfahren
Du warst das größte Geschenk was ich bekam
Doch dein blick prophezeite das ende ist schon nah
Ich war dein größte Held hab auf dich aufgepasst
Und wie oft hab ich dich gefragt Engel brauchst du was
Hör doch auf mein Schatz
Wir machen uns was vor
Heute ist alles anders
Wir haben uns verloren
Wir machen uns kaputt
Nein du machst mich kaputt
Und selbst wenn ich damals recht hatte
Hab ich's geschluckt
Und ich weiß das du an mich denkst

Du Stück Scheiße bist bedauerlich
Gib mir nur 'nen Augenblick

Du hast kein Respekt

Fließt Gift durch deine Venen

Setz' dich hin, schnall' dich an, sei dabei

Sie machen alles um endlich den Erfolg zu sehen
Denkst du es ist besser wenn du mit dem Teufel gehst?
Warte lieber auf den Bus

Im Fernsehen auf der Leinwand
Im Radio und im Buchfachhandel!
Geb' mir diese Welt und ich bums sie
Rapper verdienen ein bisschen Geld seitdem es uns gibt
Doch keiner von ihnen kommt hier ran
Wenn es mal einer von zehn probiert
Dann macht er sich nur peinlich

Ich hoff' du lernst draus ernsthaft
Und noch ein guter Rat mein Freund: Sei frei!
Und mach es wie wir beide schrei, 2 3!
Du weißt schon diese beiden Typen aus dem Kino
Die vom Sägeblatt, Sido und Bushido!
Heb die Hände hoch!

Bushido,"Da ist er wieder, euer bester Feind
Über dem bei jeder Kleinigkeit die BILD-Zeitung schreibt
Angeblich Schwulenhasser, angeblich Frauenfeind
Zumindest ist es das, was man im TV zeigt
Das Meiste ist ja eh erstunken und erlogen
Deutschland, ich hab nur deine Kinder dir erzogen
Bitte sehr, heute willst du mit dem Finger auf mich zeigen
Und mir die Schuld geben für was immer sie auch treiben
Kein Ding, ich hab mich nie vor Verantwortung gedrückt
Stand pünktlich vor Gericht, mit Anzug und Schlips
Ich seh' das Wort zu oft, wenn ich die Zeitung aufschlage
Dass ich denke, „Rüpelrapper"" ist mein zweiter Name
Warum zeigen sie ständig mit dem Finger bloß auf mich
Das habt ihr nun davon, ich geh in die Politik
Aus den Slums in die Villa, ich bin Bambi-Gewinner
Doch sie reagieren auf mich anti, wie immer

Da ist er wieder, ich bin euer bester Feind
Habe mich verändert, auch wenn's so wie gestern scheint
Ich weiß ganz genau, dass ihr nur am Lästern seid
Ihr denkt in Schubladen, stellt mich mit Verbrechern gleich!
Da ist er wieder, ich bin euer bester Feind
Seh' euch in die Augen, ich seh' nur echten Neid
Ist das eure Vorstellung von Gerechtigkeit?
Was ihr über mich erzählt, ist der letzte Scheiß!

Da ist er wieder, euer bester Feind
In letzter Zeit gleicht es einer Hetzerei
Die Medien ignorieren, dass ich mich verändert hab
Und stempeln mich leider immer als den Gangster ab
Es ist ein Mädchen, ich bin jetzt Familienvater
An dieser Stelle schöne Grüße an Alice Schwarzer
Vielleicht schon bald Bürgermeister von Berlin
Also wer hatte jetzt Vorurteile, ich oder sie?
Deutschland, das ist bestimmt mein Job
Ich bin der Kinderschreck, ich bin der Sündenbock
Ich bin der Bad Boy für alle, kein Problem
Ich kann das aushalten, denn ich bin gemein wie 10
Allesamt wollen sich hier einmischen
Mir an den Karren fahren und mir ans Bein pissen
Ist OK, wisst ihr auch mal nicht weiter
Schreibt über mich, wenn's die Auflage steigert

Da ist er wieder, ich bin euer bester Feind
Habe mich verändert, auch wenn's so wie gestern scheint
Ich weiß ganz genau, dass ihr nur am Lästern seid

Seh' euch in die Augen, ich seh' nur echten Neid
Ist das eure Vorstellung von Gerechtigkeit?
Was ihr über mich erzählt, ist der letzte Scheiß!

Da ist er wieder, euer bester Feind
Der angeblich nicht mal seine Texte schreibt
Und alle Blogger hängen wieder am IPhone
Bevor ich's noch vergess', ein „Peace"" geht an Heino
Hätt ich 'nen Euro für jede Lüge, die sie sprechen
Wär ich so reich wie jetzt, ohne überhaupt zu rappen
Angeblich hätt' ich meine Beats geklaut
Angeblich könnte man mir nie vertrauen
Alles klar, ihr macht mich zum Buhmann
Doch ich bin Bu man, ich lass das nicht zu man
Meine Ex-Künstler wollen heute auspacken
Ohne mich würd' euch keiner kennen, ich kann drauf kacken
Denn wenn ich nicht wär' hättet ihr 'nen Dreck getan
Bohlen ist der Pop-, aber ich der Rap-Titan
Das ist das letzte Mal, dass ich mich verarschen lass
Weil's euch in den Kram passt, dass mir mal der Kragen platzt

Bushido,"Wie Ebbe und Flut, wir gehören zusammen
Wie Mond und Sterne, wie Sonne und Erde
Bergauf und bergab, durch Feuer wie Glut
Will ich mit dir gehen, denn du machst mich ganz
Und ich halte deine Hand
Für immer und ewig, für immer und ewig

Du bist der Mensch, für den sich mein Leben lohnt
Meine Liebe für dich ist grenzenlos
Kein Griff nach den Sternen gibt mir je zurück, wie viel du mir gibst
Du bist der Mensch, für den sich zu leben lohnt

Ich halt um deine Hand an, trage diesen Ring
Ich bleibe bei dir bis ich eines Tages nicht mehr bin
Egal wolang du gehst, ich frage nicht wohin
Ich folge dir und seh' jetzt all die Farben, ich war blind
Wir zwei am Strand, der Abend geht dahin
Ich nehm' dich in dem Arm, damit dir warm ist nach dem Schwimmen
Die Sonne schimmert rot, dein Nagellack ist pink
Auf diesen Abend habe ich gewartet schon als Kind
Vergessen all die Jahre, Jahre ohne Sinn
Ohne dich stand ich da wie eine Fahne ohne Wind
Bist du ganz allein, schickt dir Gott einen Mensch
Dieses Lied ist sowas wie ein Hochzeitsgeschenk
Der Ring besteht aus Weißgold mit rundem Steinzeichen der Verbundenheit
Wochen werden nur so wie ein paar Sekunden sein
Vergiss den Rest, es gibt bloß uns beide
Bis, dass der Tod uns scheidet

Du bist der Mensch, für den sich mein Leben lohnt
Meine Liebe für dich ist grenzenlos
Kein Griff nach den Sternen gibt mir je zurück, wie viel du mir gibst
Du bist der Mensch, für den sich zu leben lohnt

Du bist der Mensch, für den sich mein Leben lohnt

Bushido,"Die Engel kamen wieder zu spät,
ja der Teufel hat den Hass in meine Wiege gelegt.
Und er zwang mich seitdem, es in mir zu tragen,
deswegen hab ich mich als Kind auch geschlagen.
Er wurde immer größer, wenn einer stärker war, härter war,
oder auch bei Opas Herzinfarkt.
Er wurde größer, als ich Mama schufften sah,
den Boden putzen sah, Schulden kamen, wir mussten zahlen.
Und Bullen füttern ihn, sodass er wachsen kann,
nur wegen ihm bin ich öfters in den Knast gegangen.
Er macht dich hart, ja so hart, doch dein Herz erfriert,
er ist wie 'ne Droge, du vergisst deinen Schmerz in dir.
Auch wenn du mich bestrafst, guck her du fütterst ihn,
die Unruhe lässt in dir jetzt ein Gewitter ziehen.
Ich hab ihn nie rausbekommen, ich hab ihn reingefressen,
ich bin so von diesem Leid besessen.

Ich trage diesen Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass
Das Leid, den Schmerz, ich kann einfach nicht mehr.
Sag wir lang ist es schon her, dass wir einfach glücklich waren?
Man ich kann's mir nicht erklären

Denn ich trage diesen Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass
Die Wut, den Schmerz, ich kann einfach nicht mehr.
Sag wie lang ist schon her? Sag wann hatt' ich wirklich Glück?
Ja das ganze läuft verkehrt.

Was ein verrücktes Leben, Gott hat mal gesagt es werde Licht,
und anstatt Glück waren eben Schrott, Hass und Schmerzen da für mich.
Und wäre nicht Mum andauernd krank, perfekt und ohne Witz,
brauch ich kaum Schnaps als Zaubertrank wie'n Ghettoobelix.
Und er kriegt mich wieder einfach, echt er lässt nicht los,
Shit meine immer weiße Weste scheint jetzt rot.
Und er hat mir nicht verziehen, denn hilft man Engeln in der Not,
Muss er mit 'ner Waffe spielen und schießt den letzten Engel tot.
Oh Mensch was ist jetzt los, ich sah ja keine Gespenster,
an erster Stelle meint dann Paps: ""Dann den Feind deiner Schwester.""
Und selbst Weinen macht's nicht besser, mein Kopf bleibt ein Zellenblock,
verschlossen, denn als Held bin ich besoffener als Hankock.
Hass denk doch an mich und mach mich gnadenlos zum Ziel,
und ertränk mich aber lasse bloß die anderen aus dem Spiel.
Auf dem harten Boden knien, doch das kann ich nicht,
kann dir nicht mehr sagen: ""Hass, ich hasse dich.""
Von Angesicht zu Angesicht.

Ich trage diesen Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass
Das Leid, den Schmerz, ich kann einfach nicht mehr.
Sag wir lang ist es schon her, dass wir einfach glücklich waren?
Man ich kann's mir nicht erklären.

Denn ich trage diesen Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass
Die Wut, den Schmerz, ich kann einfach nicht mehr.
Sag wie lang ist schon her? Sag wann hatt' ich wirklich Glück?
Ja das ganze läuft verkehrt.

Ja das ganze läuft verkehrt, dieser Hass macht dich verrückt,
dieser Hass steigt dir zu Kopf, die Waffe bleibt gezückt.
Und du denkst auch nicht mehr nach, man du denkst auch nicht mehr nach,
denkst nicht nach was du tust und wer im Endeffekt bestraft.
Er raubt mir meinen Schlaf, raubt mir jeden Sinn, raubt mir Skrupel, 
Wenn ich jemand ausraub', es macht „Ching Ching""
Das Leben auf der Straße, skrupellos und krass,
zu krass denn du pflanzt hier deine Wut und erntest Hass.

Hass lass mich ziehen, es hilft kein Heulen und kein Flennen
wenn schon heute in den Menschen dieses Feuer nicht mehr brennt.
Und nur Enttäuschung bleibt am Ende und es scheiße ist verdammt,
erleichtert diesen Mann um ganze 21 Gramm.
Sag was denkst du eigentlich man wer du bist? Lass mich in Ruhe!
Hass, ist Chakuza verflucht oder sag mal warum tust du das?
Ich lasse das nicht zu, du kannst's nicht tun, es gibt hier kein verlieren,
da oben bist du groß, aber hier unten, das ist mein Revier.

Ich trage diesen Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass, Hass
Das Leid, den Schmerz, ich kann einfach nicht mehr.
Sag wir lang ist es schon her, dass wir einfach glücklich waren?
Man ich kann's mir nicht erklären.

Zwischen all dem Schmutz und dem Abschaum damals in Berlin
Gab es diesen Jungen
Es war seine Vision und kein Tagtraum, er wollt' es sich verdienen
Und zwar aus gutem Grund
Seine Mutter war alleinerziehend, sein Bruder viel kleiner als er
Und genau deswegen mussten diese Scheine jetzt her
Doch sein Label wollte ihn nicht mehr bezahlen
Also blieb ihm keine Wahl
Er fragte auf der Straße verzweifelt nach Beistand
Es wurde zu 'nem Wettlauf, der Junge vereinsamt
Die Schatten wurden größer und Lichtblicke rar
Der Raum wurde kalt, als Mephisto ihn sah
Er könnt' es für ihn klären, darauf gab er ihm sein Wort
„Denk an deine Zukunft, du willst weg von diesem Ort
Mach dich auf die Reise, dreh dich nicht mehr um
Hör nicht mehr auf andere, frag nicht mehr, warum
Du kannst haben, was du willst, gib mir einfach die Befehle
Ich will nicht viel von dir, nur am Ende deine Seele“
Der Junge überlegte, zu wenig sprach dagegen
Heute weiß er, damals trat der Teufel in sein Leben
Vergessen waren die Tränen, er fühlte sich geborgen
Auf einmal musste er sich um die Zukunft nicht mehr sorgen
Der neue Sound Electro, der Junge aus dem Ghetto
Er wurde zum Geschäftsmann, aus Brutto wurde Netto
In Deutschland herrschte Chaos, er machte sich zum Staatsfeind
Die Rolle seines Lebens – Joker, Dark Knight
Jeder wollt' ihm nah sein, die Wörter wurden Gold
Blut, Schweiß und Tränen, die Lawine kam ins Rollen
Die Seele war verkauft, der Junge stieg auf seinen Thron
Für viele ein Idol, doch seine Freiheit Illusion
Mephisto hatte Pläne, der König der Hyänen
Die Schlange, der Apfel im Garten von Eden
Die Kurve ging nach oben, die Wörter wurden Platin
Gewissensbisse gab's nicht, wer Faxen machte, schlag ihn
Die Geister, die er rief, sie forderten Tribut
In den Köpfen diese Stimmen, an den Händen dieses Blut
Die Nächte wurden länger, am Himmel keine Sterne
Egal, wohin er kommt, überall verbrannte Erde
Alles kalkuliert, denn am Ende war's kein Glück
Es ging von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück
Das Jahr 2007, am Ku'damm mein Plakat
Das ganze Land begriff jetzt, der Junge war am Start
Rekorde fallen und plötzlich war der Himmel seine Grenze
Ein Leben ohne Limit, bis der Typ kommt mit der Sense
Wie sagt man so schön, „Hochmut kommt meistens vor dem Fall“
Und irgendwie war's Karma auf einmal überall
Diese Dinge, die passierten, seine Mutter wurde krank
Vergessen waren die Preise, keine Freude, nur noch Angst
Mephisto kam's gelegen, denn Not macht einen verletzlich
Er gab sein Bestes, „Hör mal, mein Junge, komm und setz dich
Du kannst auf mich vertrauen, ich lieb' dich wie ein Vater den Sohn
Gemeinsam machen wir jetzt Abermillionen“
Er hörte, was er sagte, und tötete die Zweifel
Dem Teufel gegenüber, der Engel war zu leise
Mit jedem Tag verlor er sich selbst ein bisschen mehr
Denn nichts war so wie vorher, vergiftet war sein Herz
Betäubt und ohne Rücksicht, verzweifelt auf der Suche
Nicht leicht zu unterscheiden, das Böse von dem Guten
Er opferte fast alles fürs schnelle Leben, ASAP
Kettensägen Massaker, Heavy Metal Payback
Glaub mir, Zeiten ändern sich und plötzlich auch Mephisto
Verlockend war das Rampenlicht und langsam wurd' er schizo
Er wollte eine Bühne, seine Fratze auf der Leinwand
Riss die Zügel an sich, akzeptierte keinen Einwand
Ein Teufel und Diktator, nach außen immer höflich
Seine tausenden Gesichter zu durchschauen, war nicht möglich
Ein Meister der Intrigen, gespalten seine Zunge
Der Schlüssel des Erfolges war schon immer nur der Junge
Und viele Jahre lief es, drehten sich die Rädchen
Bis zum ersten Februar, der Junge traf ein Mädchen
Sie würde vieles ändern und irgendwie geschah es
Dass sie an seiner Seite blieb, endlich etwas Wahres
Zwischen all den Lügen und finsteren Gestalten
Der Junge wurde Vater und nichts blieb mehr beim Alten
Mephisto säte Zwietracht und zog alle Register
Auf einmal war er Anwalt, Kläger sowie Richter
Es brach einem das Herz, den Jungen traf das Schicksal
Als seine Mutter starb, nur noch trauernde Gesichter
Er floh vor der Familie, es schlug Mephistos Stunde
Und alles, was er liebte, ging allmählich vor die Hunde
Er fing sich an zu streiten, im Endeffekt für gar nix
Versetzte das Mädchen in regelrechte Panik
Sie erkannte ihn nicht wieder, was war bloß aus ihm geworden?
Das letzte bisschen Hoffnung zwischen ihnen war gestorben
Sie fiel auf ihre Knie, zu viel Last auf ihren Schultern
Sie weinte, denn sie wusste ganz genau, wer daran schuld war
Doch niemand hörte zu, als sie warnte und flehte
Ein Engel ohne Flügel sang klare Gebete
Mephisto, der Teufel, ein Lügner ohnegleichen
Für die Seele dieses Jungen ging er wieder über Leichen
Die Ehe lag in Scherben, er hatte, was er wollte
Und ließ ihn nicht mehr los wie ein Wolf seine Beute
Und so kam es, dass der Schatten ein Stück mehr von ihm Besitz nahm
Zimmer gab es viele, aber niemand macht das Licht an
Egal, was er versuchte, er versank in Depressionen
Seine ständigen Begleiter waren Geister und Dämonen
Er versagte sich dem Leben, weitermachen war nicht möglich
Die Frage, die ihn quälte, weshalb war er nur so töricht?
Ihm fehlten seine Kinder, sein Mädchen, seine Mama
Am Telefon erfuhr der Junge, sie war wieder schwanger
Er musste sie zurückgewinnen und wusste, was zu tun war
Der Einzige, der das nicht wollte, war sein falscher Bruder
Mephisto wurde zornig, als er davon erfuhr
Er wollte es verhindern, von Gewissen keine Spur
Die Waffen, die er nutzte, waren schrecklich egoistisch
Fassade noch zu wahren, war von jetzt an nicht mehr wichtig
Er ließ es darauf ankommen und sprengte seine Ketten
Er hob die Stimme jetzt, um die Familie zu retten
Das erste Mal seit Jahren bekam das Mädchen wirklich
Den gebührenden Respekt, denn wahre Liebe stirbt nicht
Die Narben saßen tief, doch der Feind war jetzt derselbe
Gemeinsam durch den Regen, den Sturm und auch die Kälte
Sie waren voller Zuversicht, mutig und entschlossen
Er gab ihr ein Versprechen und es wurde nicht gebrochen
Und da verlor Mephisto den Schrecken alter Tage
Krallen einer Ratte, schwarze Flügel wie ein Rabe
Seine Maske fiel, so sah man seine wahre Gestalt
Er war ein Monster aus Feuer, doch sein Atem war kalt
Es ging um Leben und Tod, der Junge zog in den Kampf
Des Teufels Pläne allesamt in den Boden gestampft

Fünfzehn Jahre später, der Junge fast vierzig
Fast alle seine Träume inzwischen verwirklicht
Kinder hat er fünf, Scheine hat er viele
Ehejahre sechs, geheiratet aus Liebe
Soloalben dreizehn, das Gold liegt im Keller
Talent bringt noch immer das Brot auf den Teller
Das Leben könnt' so schön sein, unbeschwert die Wege
Hätte nur Mephisto nicht noch immer seine Seele
Verschlossen und versenkt, verloren in den Tiefen des Ozeans
Er würde sogar mit dem Tod bezahlen
Denn er hat keine Angst, nur weil sein Gegner vorher nie am Boden lag
Genau wie damals, David gegen Goliath
Die Stimmen der Engel, sie singen im Chor
Ihre Seelen, sie stiegen zum Himmel empor
Und erzählen Geschichten vom Teufel vor Ort
Wie ein Junge aus Leichtsinn fast alles verlor
Denn es gab Zeiten, da folgte er Mephisto wie blind
Hörte die Lügen immer wieder wie das Flüstern im Wind
Wurde genauso wie er, gab den Widerstand auf
Jetzt muss er vieles graderücken, weil ihm niemand mehr glaubt
So viele Menschen erniedrigt, sich unfair verhalten
Auf dem Weg ihres Erfolges liegen hunderte Leichen
Man schrieb und suchte die Fehler, die sie machten
Unmöglich, die Dinge aus der Ferne zu betrachten
Doch heute hat der Junge die nötige Distanz
Das Bild in der Gesamtheit ungeschönt und ohne Glanz
Und heute sieht Mephisto, das Schicksal nimmt seinen Lauf
Auch er kann nichts dran ändern, kein Feuer ohne Rauch
Er hat gewütet und am Ende Schutt und Asche hinterlassen
Er gab dem Jungen mehr als einen Grund, um ihn zu hassen
Unterwarf ihn seinem Willen, ständige Kontrolle
Dass er daran erstickte, spielt am Ende keine Rolle
Abscheulich all die Dinge, die er billigend in Kauf nahm
Lebte von den Menschen, die wahrhaftig zu ihm aufsahen
Ein Blender, dem das Geld zu Kopf gestiegen ist
Der so viel hat, aber trotzdem nie zufrieden ist
Der niemals schläft, der Preis für seinen Frevel
Auf ewig soll er wandern durch Täler voller Schwefel
Zusammen mit seines Gleichen, auf dass sie nie mehr heimkehren
Nie mehr wieder wird er diesen Jungen nochmal einsperren
Das Ende einer Herrschaft, selbsternannter König
Die Welt wird ihn vergessen, nicht mehr außer-, nur gewöhnlich
Wer ist ihm noch geblieben? Seine Heerscharen fliehen
Gütig, barmherzig, er selbst war es nie
Die Angst war sein Hammer, die List war sein Meißel
Sein kranker Verstand war nicht zu begreifen
Unfassbar wie boshaft, seht euch sein Werk an
Hunderte Seelen, da unten in Kerkern, yeah
Jeder weiß, der Teufel hat sein eigenes Motiv
Das Leid, das er Menschen zufügt, ist sein Profit
Der Junge hätte lieber seine Finger davon lassen sollen
Doch stattdessen machte er Mephistos Taschen voll
Er hat genug bezahlt, blieb keinem etwas schuldig
Egal, wie sehr es weh tat, der Junge blieb geduldig
Von jetzt an keine Kompromisse mehr
Dissen ohne Namen nennen, glaub mir mal, sie wissen, wer
Die Seele dieses Jungen genommen hat aus Gier
Er muss akzeptieren, niemals wieder wir
Diese Zeilen kommen von Herzen an Mephisto addressiert
Er war nie ein wahrer Freund, nur ein rücksichtsloses Tier
Am Himmel kreisen Geier, eine Ära geht zu Ende
So wurde aus dem Jungen eine lebende Legende
Er nahm den Mut zusammen und stellte sich seinen Ängsten
Keine Maskerade, denn die Wahrheit währt am längsten
Er machte reinen Tisch, ein für alle Mal
Sein Herz weiß, man kann mit der Seele nicht bezahlen
Also holt er sie zurück, der Deal war hiermit nichtig
Damit am Ende dieses Tunnels endlich wieder Licht ist
Und siehe da, das Leben war wieder voller Farben
So viele neue Wege, die sich ihm nun offenbarten
Er blickt nicht mehr zurück, das Kapitel ist Geschichte
Von dem dann seine Enkelkinder irgendwann berichten
Man wird von ihm erzählen, „Er war ein guter Junge
Mit Wut in seiner Lunge und dem Herzen auf der Zunge
Die Fehler, die er machte, sind tief in ihm verankert
Für jeden Tag mit der Familie ist er dankbar“
Denn es geschehen Dinge, die meisten Leute zweifeln
Verständlich, dass viele von ihnen für die Wahrheit nicht bereit sind
Der größte Trick des Teufels, mal abseits seiner Pläne
War die Menschheit glauben lassen, dass es ihn nicht gäbe",Mephisto,2018

It needs to leave the turf 
Make it quick because its getting rather worse

Caw dem gun nuh join lodge, nor it don't join church

Bushwick Bill,"[ VERSE 1 ]
Money, money, money, muthafuckin green
Reach inside my pocket, I don't feel it, and I want to scream
Nigga, give it up, cause I want every penny in your pocket
And your ass is goin down if you tell me you ain't got it
I gotta make a profit in that Nickel Ward
Cause I ain't with bein broke and times are gettin hard
I pull the gat and hit the boulevard huntin for a victim
Catch him slippin, pop the clip in, and then I get him
When in mama's womb I was doomed, destined for poverty
And no nigga in the ghetto about to win a lottery
So what does it bother me to knock a nigga off?
I'm educated, in a robbery, bitch, I'm the boss
Mr. Lawman is quick to call this action a crime
Because they can't tax robbery, they don't get a dime
Everything'd be fine if I was working 9 to 5
But I can't get that kinda job, I ain't 5 ft. high
Since they don't realize that my size ain't shit
I'm gonna gaffle em and baffle em until my bank gets
To the maximum, I get the gat then i'm after them fast
Goin for bad, goin from copper to cash

	Some people will try to jack you
	Some people will even kill you
	So give it to em, y'all

[ VERSE 2 ]
When I started writin lyrics it was like a religion to me
Cause when I seen the mic, you're fuckin right, I was kickin it, gee
Knew that it was somethin that was gonna last a lifetime
When I pushed my homework aside so I could write rhymes
I sat in class hypnotized, my mind in a daze
Pretendin Bushwick Bill rippin up a stage
But back in the days Little Bill was soft as jello
And hard work pays, now I'm the hardest muthafucka in the ghetto
I assured I got the rhymes that was popular at times
But I hadn't got my name on the dotted line
I couldn't pay the dime, mama worked parttime
It made me so mad, I sat down and wrote hard rhymes
I ??? cause I couldn't pay the fee
Then my boy gave me a ki, in a week I made a g
Pretty soon I was laughin in a mansion makin profits
Puttin half in the bank, keepin half in my pockets
Cops were hopin, cops were hopin they could get me net
They be promoted to a captain for the big arrest
I wasn't slippin, I was givin the blues the blues
Cause I refused to lose, I grabbed the booze and cruised
Up the avenue, laughin at the people in school
Cause they broke as a muthafucka talkin bout a golden rule
You're sayin I'm a fool for droppin out
I'm makin millions, well daddy, what you're talkin bout?
I remember scrapin up pennies for the 4-double oz's
Now my refigerator's full of Olde E
I used to only rap on the schoolyard
Now I'm in the studio droppin lyrics too hard
I took the road to the riches in a dash
Left my competators at last, they run from copper to cash

	Some people will try to jack you
	Some people will even kill you
	So give it to em, y'all

[ VERSE 3 ]
A lotta people didn't think that it could happen
They all started laughin when I told em I'd be rappin
But now I'm cashin in big checks from the Rap-A-Lot
Bill's gettin paid, now it's my turn to laugh a lot
I live the life that a lotta niggas dream of
I sit back and smoke cess in a steam tub
I got bitches and bitches and bitches and bitches
And more bitches on my dick, they like the size of my pockets
But I ain't cuttin for a stinky piece of pearl tongue
She makes a move for my wallet, and the girl's hung
Cause when you're broke, you're a joke, but when you get cash
Them muthafuckin stink hoes want half
So all of you funky-ass hoes can kiss

Bushwick Bill,"See, most of my life I never had shit
I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit
Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth
Thinking was I really supposed to be on this planet earth
I take a deep breath, and then another follows
'cause hardship is kinda hard to swallow
See, it's rough bein a loner
Not knowin any given day and time I could wind up a goner
See, people got it bad from jump street
And bein short is just another strike against me
I used to get funny looks 'cause I was small
And tryin to make it was like runnin through a brick wall
Given the odds I was up against, bro
The average nigga woulda quit a long time ago
But now I've got a record out
I'm doin shows, people payin to see me turn it out
Now I'm the spice around town
It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around
I got friends and bitches on my dick
But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick
Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe
And every different day it's a different fuckin hoe
And now that my pockets are gettin bigger
I'm meetin hoes who only want to juice a nigga
They tell me that they love me and all that
But really they just wait for me to fall flat
So they can get me for my income
Take me for all I got, and then some
Like Trina, you dig
I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid
Knowin that she used the baby to use me
Took him out my life, mentally abusin me
But as the time went by I got another slimmy
And she was just like the first one screamin gimme
But not in the exact same way
She had a different type of game she liked to play
Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type
And for a little while shit seemed alright
But just like the first hoe, homie
When shit got hectic the bitch broke out on me
And it's gettin outta hand, gee
'cause nobody seems to understand me
Reminiscin got me feelin kinda low
I broke out the Ever-Clear and then I drunk some mo'
Until it was all gone
Now I'm lookin for somebody to take my pain out on
But not just anybody, gee
I'ma take that on to Mica 'cause she's the closest to me
Full of that Ever-Clear and high on that buddah
Get to the house all I'm thinkin bout is shootin her
'cause shootin her would be sweet
But you know what'd be sweeter? if I make her shootin me
Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinkin
I'm trippin from all that smokin weed and drinkin
But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her
Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her
She still wouldn't grab the gun
And at that time I wasn't thinkin about no one
Damn near crazy I went and grabbed the baby
Held him by the door and said i'ma throw his ass out, hoe
She went to cryin, somebody stop him
I said: you better grab the muthafuckin gun or i'ma drop him
She snatched the baby out of my hands
We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting
When we fell on the bed, check this shit
All kinds of crazy shit was goin through my head
So I ran and got the gun and came back to her
Loaded it up and handed the gat to her
I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle
She screamed stop and then we broke into another tussle
Yo, durin the fight the gun went off quick
Damn! aw shit, I'm hit
(Aw... my eye, I can't see
Why you shot me in the eye?
I woulda shot you in the body
Why you shot me in the eye?)
Ridin in the ambulance everything is hectic
I can't get a grip, I just can't check this
Everybody's cryin, could it be I'm dyin
Bullet in my head, in the bed was lyin
Where's Mica? I want to tell her I love her
With an [ ] in my arm I took a picture for an album cover
Goddamn, the shit's a trip, gee
Five different doctors with needles tryin to stick me
I hear my family hollerin he needs us
Durin the confusion, man, I seen jesus
My mom's on the phone long-distance from New York
Here comes the doctors again tryin to rip me apart
I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake it
I'm havin suicidal thoughts hopin that I don't make it
But I'ma make it 'cause something's steady urgin me
Five hours passed, I made it through surgery
And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night
But god told me everything is gonna be alright
And I'm glad that I'm here, gee
But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly

Aw man, I made it
I made it
And everyone gets to hear my story
I made it
But don't try this at your home

Straight outta nightmares, somewhere
A rare glimpse of Bushwick
I'm off on some sick shit
My mind still plays tricks
It is I says me, I agree with my inner self
Thinkin' and contemplate on all the pain that my enemies felt
At the hands of this madman
Catscans can't prove that I'm crazy
I want to chop bodies daily
Oh God save me, Dahmer was a minor case
Get a load of Chuckwick
Eye to eye, face to face
Evil thoughts hit me when I get distraught
Easily hidden, I'm never gettin' fuckin' caught fool

I know it's in this mind I'm sick

Haha, horrifyin', part of me's a big man
I went to Cypress Hill they learned how to kill a man
Menace Clan showed me who the devil was
Kicked it wit Dre, got that killin' off that chronic buzz
Just because, to show the world I ain't a punk
I got dead bodies rottin' in my Benz trunk
Trunk of funk, call it what you want to
Make sure I'm gone, and not behind you
Because in dreams, I'm breemin' Scotty dead bodies
Don't try to run, you can't escape this (????) dread
Yes I'm dead, and always stay a step ahead
And if I stay behind your ass is mines anyway
Play it wit shark, I like to kick body parts

Bushwick Bill,"[ Bushwick Bill ]
Yes
We're here to talk about those who
Are considered to be an elected official
Who said it was official that when they was elected
That everything that they dealt with had me in mind
As a human being, as a man
But not as a slave or three fifths human
I have the right to bear arms
What makes you think I respect you?

[ VERSE 1: 3D ]
Hello Mr. President, residents of the White House, excuse me
I'd like to know, have you ever enjoyed an old-time gangster movie?
With the white man ringin shots on blocks
With their clean shave and pin strip-suits
Bootleggin-whiskey-rapin-black-women-and-havin-a-fat-stack-of-loot
Undercover David Duke, isn't it true
The gangster movement started long before my time
Long before the hair rag, gangster sag
Finger signs and love for nines?
Damn, in your minds and in your hearts
Is the hate really that deep, what's truly goin on?
Knockin me for the words I write
For writin movie scripts by whites like Mr. Al Capone

[ Bushwick Bill ]
Yeah
America
A land that made Christopher Columbus
A historian for bringing madmen, white slaves, and rapists
Kennedy, his dad was a bootlegger for Al Capone
Became President
Isn't it evident
That those who sit in the residence
Are not president?

[ VERSE 2: 3D ]
Now why you want to try to knock me
Cause I'm black, got a gat
Twist my hat and all, listen to Mr. Scarface
Think about the way the government wants to hold us back
As a matter of fact
I believe the whole system is a huge crime scene
And everyday they're doin the dirty work
And layin it on us niggas, if you know what I mean
So don't corrupt your own minds foolin yourself
Tryin to lay it on the black man
I'm a young gee tryin to leave poverty
With a gat in my black hand
So white heathen, taken straight out of
The crate of a mouth of a babe
Yeah, a honkey can't stop what a honkey started
And the ghetto's what you honkeys made

[ Bushwick Bill ]
That's right, sittin up there in the White House
With your homosexual mentalities and female persuasions
Yeah, I'm talkin to all the J. Edgar Hoovers
That are still left in there
All the big brothers that are watching
I hope you're listenin
Cause the bad shit you put on criminals has made the citizens take control

Now Sergeant hit ya, get with ya
Let's get back to the issue, continue dissin
My way of livin, so a little nigga like me
Gots to go and dish ya this mission
Hopin that the message that I'm sendin
Gets through to you and your people
Devil, look at your own dirty past
Before you come to me with your blue-eyed evil
If I kill 30 innocent, would you write
A movie about me and spare
My life, or would you lock me up with triple life 
And strap me down in the electric chair?
See, it's not about the sign I throw up
Or where I roam, or what a nigga wear
See cracker, it's all about respect for your hood
Your clique, and all of those whose pain with you share

[ Bushwick Bill ]
That's right, pain
The pain that I feel
Is the pain from shame
The shame that you've caused me
For over 400 years of protection
The pain that I have within me
The rage that is flaming
Makes me want to say the things that I say
Do the things that I do
And let you know
That when you look at me
Or look down at me
Or look across from your side of the world to my side
That what you have failed to realize
Is that you've put me in projects
I realize it was an experiment
So when you put me in jail
I realize I just made it through the millions
I'm just another rat that made my cheese
And you couldn't stand it
But what can all the big cats do
When all the rats want to get fat
But try to cut down on the cheese
What you don't realize is that you're jerkin yourself
Killin your own existence
You're all walking dead men, and don't know it
With book sense and street sense
If you had street intelligence
You would really know
That you're one footstep between life and death
That the mouth is a open grave
And you've offered me the right to elect you to a bullet
Which is a straight shot to the top, right?
And what goes up must come down
That's why it's goin down right now
You can smell the smoke
See the flames
And see the bodies that are left on the ground
Because the flag
Red, white and blue
And the stars from all the years you've whupped me and mines
I still see",Mr. President,1995
Bushwick Bill,"(Verse 1):
Every now and then I stop to think about my life
Wonderin' if it´s even worth this stressin tryin' to strive
All I ever do is get high everyday
Even fuck my girl then I sleep the rest away
I rarely comes out before night I ain't employed
Why should I wake up early in the muthafuckin' morning
All Imma do is smoke a sack of green 
And throw 2 or 3 rocks at the penitentiary
No one seems concerned about my world beein'
It seems my life's already ended that's why I'm spendin'
So much time in the 5th ward high as a kite
It's too late for me to try to live my life right
Shit, if I should die today who would really care?
If I should die today who would come and stare?
If I should die today who would carry me?
On my last day above dirt and who would bury me?
Damn...!!

How will I die?
-Homie only God knows
How long will I live?
-Homie only God knows
How will I die?
-Homie only God knows
How long will I live?
Tell me...damn...!!

(Verse 2):
What is life and just how long will it last?
Will you be happy and satisfied when you've passed?
Will you die young or old and wise?
If you face your killer will there be tears in your eyes?
Will you holler and backscream and crawl?
Will you die like a bitch or stand tall through it all?
Will you fight if you're givin' the chance?
Or will you ball up like a baby and shit in your pants?
Damn..!
We'll never know until it's your time Loc
You'll never know what you gon do until that ass get smoked
So you can miss me with that tough man trash
Until you're layin' in the streets with hollow tips in that ass
Hot metal to the dome couldn't take me away
I'm talkin' point blank range and I'm still here today
Nobody knows the troubles I've seen
When I lay my head to rest now who could answer me?

How will I die?

How long will I live?
-Homie only God knows
How will I die?
-Homie only God knows
How long will I live?
Tell me...tell me...

(Verse 3):
I'm in so much pain it hurts my heart to wake up
I've done lost my sense of gain I feel about to brake up
Stress is eatin' and my mind is playin' tricks again
It's tellin' me that I ain't shit 
It's tellin' me to quit
In one's words: when I stop to think a kind of agree
Even with one good eye my future's hard to see
The end is rushin' at me homie shit I damned it down
I tries to duck I tries to hide but shit I just can't run
It's like I'm trapped inside this world of mines and just can't win
I'm overcomed by suicidal thoughts but damned that's sin
I need my momma cause she'd be always there by my side
To help me out when I ain't strong enough to make the right
If I die who would teach my sons right from wrong?
If I die who would teach my sons to stand strong?
If I die who would teach 'em nuthin comes for free?
I can't die cause won't nobody teach 'em shit but me

Put me in a room with four gats and four clips
Aimed at my dome and I bet I won't flinch
At least I get to know I'm going out in a blast
So either pull the trigger or you tricks better mash
Cause I ain't afraid to kill neither
I snatch your soul like the motherfuckin grim reaper
I be the, man that worries not about life
I'd rather piss in the wind than take a risk with eyes, yeah

Verse Two:

The world is on some old new-improved shit
They building bombs everyday but screaming peace
A piece of pussy nowaday could cost a nigga life
The condom ain't shit, the rubber breaks and that's your life

For some grown ass men, niggaz old as me and you
Think a nigga fuck a kid needs his motherfuckin dick chopped off
Cause youse a child molester, that ain't cool motherfucker
Mamas keeping sons from their daddies
What you sposed to teach him bitch?  You ain't no man, youse a hoe
Monkey see, monkey do
What you want my son to act like me or act like you, shit
I'm on the verge of suicide, so what's murder?
Another casuality, cause mentally I'm damaged G
So I ain't afraid, I ain't afraid to kill
And I ain't afraid to die, motherfucker

Verse Three:

A punk can be controlled by death threats
A man's not a man if he can't take a stand and umm
Confront your foes nigga everybody bleeds
So fuck bowing down to another nigga's needs
Curiousity, killed the cat
And anybody gettin curious with mines is gettin disciplined black
I lets the motherfuckin fo'-fo' click
And that's the end of that big bad nigga shit [see-ya!]
How can you be afraid of what's bound to happen
You can't run and try to hide from death
Death is univited, it's also at a shitty time
Things can creep and snatch your ass up out your prime, I lives my life
aggressively, successfully, I press to be
Demanding with myself and not profess to be
You can't impress me with no bullshit threats
I squabble any motherfucker out your set, motherfucker

Kryptonite got me blowed 'cause I hit it five times 
I got condom on my dick, but my mind is on scrilla 
Bitches just respect this nigga Chuck and I'ma killa 
Me and my nigga, four hoes, weed, and liquor 
Headed to the boat to freak these bitches on the river 
And since I'm from the south these hoes showin me love 
And be	 is from the west, he really don't give a fuck 
Twenty minutes later, all hell broke loose

Bushwick Bill,"Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recites kinda lethal
Niggas know, the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murdering niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks when I grip the mic and kick shit
Niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossing
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood when we up to no good
Slanging them things like a real O.G. should,
I'm stacking and macking and packing a ten so
When you're slipping, I slip the clip in
But ain't no set tripping
'Cause it's Death Row, rolling like the mafia
Think about whooping some ass, but what the fuck stopping ya
Ain't nothing but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumping slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this mention of sorts
You're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
Dr. Dre will kick the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX, cell block two

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on Death Row
And now I'm serving a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Laying lain with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm coming from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W taking, no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block eight

Ayo stepping through the fog
And creeping through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Busting raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shooting at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a grip from serving my rocks
And I'm still, serving for mines, peace
To my motherfucking homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbing with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothing but a black thing bay-bee
No I'm not flagging, but I'm just sagging
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfucking homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfucking DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfucking Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat em man
We gotta smoke em, then choke em
Like the motherfucking peter man
It's like three and to the two
And two and to the one
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done",Stranded on Death Row,2002
Bushwick Bill,"The car broke down and she was like ""Honey, get the flash light""
Still one in the dash right?
Only cause it's late at night
And who knows
What's out there
She was right tho
Ain't gonna help with a light tho
People dying tonight
Cause yo this maniac is, out there
I'm hanging like a possum
Murder tricks, I got some
Spot them
Look come around to the bottom
And slaughter them, out there
His boo was locked up in the car
On the phone and tripping hard
Screaming
Fuck that bitch was scurred
There's a killer out there
Cut that crying shit off
I cut
You die
I get off
I'm crawling up on the car
Trying to rip the moon roof lid off, out there
Bitch turned the wipers on
Hazard lights and blew the horn
I smashed with my axe, and pulled her to the lawn, out there
She kicked me hard, to the grill
With one of them, Doc Martin heels
Murderas, you know how that feels
Your lip be out there
Time to die
Close my eyes
Swung and felt a thump
I done spilt her head in half like a tree stump, out there

[Chorus]
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing

Lights on in the house
But it's dark outside
You can even close one eye
Look bitch, I'm out there
Camp fire lit
Boy Scout meeting's they talk of me
Even they leaders got memories of me, I'm out there
Forensic scientists try to finger me out
But I'm too quick for their Sheriff's stupid asses
I'm still out there
Pull up all your road blocks
I'm running them them's in my socks
Silently taken out all cops, one by one, I'm out there
Leave they bodies
In the street
Continue on my murder spree
They can believe all my heat
When I pull it out there
Break up into the Zoo
Dress up in a monkey suit
Sticking up families for they loot, my brain, is out there
Handy with an ice pick
Pull it out and use it good
In and out your temple
Blood is squirting all out there
I'm the urban legend you heard at your college dorm
Jump out and squeeze your vocal cords
When you out there

[Chorus]

Some where out there a remnance of Bushwick
My mind loads clips at your block
And leave you stuck bitch
A psychopath
With a clasp and a black ski mask
Leave you in body bags
For a news flash
I might be small
But I got big balls
Write my name on the wall
With bloodstains after the brawl
Evil thoughts run deep in my brain
I'm sick and deranged
So picture the pain
Flowing in my veins
Yeah I'm sick
I'm sicker then Hitler
My gat spit streak mothafucking forbidden scriptures
Niggas run from a gun, forgetting they can't
I drag a Mossberg, cause it won't fit in my pants
I run up in your ride, it's parked and
It's darken
Jump out your glove compartment, sparking
The shit that I do, make many faint
Dead saint
Turn your blood into candy paint

Bust,"The moon makes ribbons to surround you
Within the robe of dark around you
I see goodbye
A blade that cuts me from your eyes

I wonder why
It's time for honesty and answers
Love is the song- we are the dancers
A broken pair- we spin alone

And wonder where- the touch has gone
After all this time
After all we've been through
Is this all that we have

No- we still have time
To find each other- after all
I touch your face and feel you crying
Are all the words we've said been lies

We'll never leave- the place where hearts
Alone receive- what love believes After all this time
After all we've been through
Is this all that we have

No- we still have time
To find each other- after all
Within the deepest darkness
The seed of morning waits to grow

The sun will come- this much I know
After all this time
After all we've been through
If we hold on to love- just one more night

We'll find forever- after all
After all this time
After all we've been through
If we hold on to love- just one more night

We'll find forever- after all

Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?

1, 2, 3, and...

Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, Hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bentley door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coupe's up take the new Lame for a sec
12"" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer and a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzi

They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it 'cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth

Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Necks wanna move but's getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I mark with death, hard to kill like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?

[Chorus]

Ah, Yo
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dying
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors
All in your house nigga, our strategies is different from yours
Listen, you come you can do it while I continue to preach

Who fucking with Fox, who want it with I

Pull up the Phantom, show 'em how we switch
From the Bentley blinds spur kill 'em with the six
Bed-Stuy what up y'all, what up with your girl
How she leave dude broke tell them boys on work
I'm in the G5 Jedi, Brooklyn what's your chrome
'Cause that niggas lying home if the tutti with the dead-eye
My nigga Neck got hit up in his truck
And no Stranel ain't the same since Homo got touched
Nasty with the pistol, nasty with the clit
See I'm a beast with it, fucking 'til I'm crippled
Ill nuns squeezing the lhama
Bog roll dutty, Fox and Poppa

We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 

See you survived the worst but my life is glorious 
Betta know that I leaped every hurdle and I'm so victorious 
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now you can call me Morpheus 
As for securing the win, better believe I'm so notorious 
You know that I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now (yes) 
We use to live on the strip and even though we're a higher level tramping now 
Superceded everyone of my middle struggles and 
Failure never ever has been an option 
A paper long like we was on the trap and we bout ta take the hood shoppin' 
Get it! 

Together we made it (you see we did it did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!) 
And they told us we were never going to get it 
But we took it on the road (to the riches) 
On the road (to the ghetto) 
On the road (in the project to this bangin instrumental) 
On the road (ride with me) *yeah 
On the road (you come and get it) *yeah, yeah* 
On the road *yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!* 

When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected 
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected 
At best we were stressed and the worst they probably said we're pathetic 
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just no way to connect it 
And I was fighting through every rhyme tightening up every line 
Never resting the question if I was out of my mind 
And it finally came time to do it or let it die 
So we put the chips on the table and told 'em to let it ride 
Sing it! 

Together we made it (you see we did itit did it) 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall (come on) 
Forever we waited (haha!)

Look in case you misunderstand exactly what I'm building 
Things that I could leave for my children (children) children (children) 
Now I only wake up with a smile to see how far I've come 
Fighting for sales on a strip to get the hustle from 
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son 
To counting money like Dre and Jimmy or Russell Ross 
But now I live what I dream you see we finally did it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how you did it 
Sing it

and I'm a bring it back to the East (Let's Get it)
Since the Touch It remix put the face to the voice

Chose with my mouth closed they ain't have a choice
I came from the bottom but I Rose like Royce
Man these boys can't mess with me on my worst day (Nope)
So how the hell they gon mess with me on my birthday (Yeah!)
That's right, this is the day I was born
The music is my mama, I'm the son of song

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Papoose]
Who's that with the Red Monkey Jeans? My shirt was made by Gino Green (Nice shirt)
My jewels was made by David Bling (David) They call me the underground king
Chain bling bling I'm the mainstream dream (Yeah) The Nacirema Dream you lames ain't seen
I was in the club holdin my fifth tight, this dude keep grillin me I had to get right (What)
Shorty her face, her ass, and her hips tight (Oooh)
Took her to the Mariott had to get right
Cutie the bomb she live in the beauty salon
So her beauty is strong rockin like Louis Vuitton
Cause these dudes never wanna see the new kid signed (No)
They always wanna shine like the sun all the time
Fall back you passed your prime
Even the sun gotta go down so we could see the moon shine

Precise, become a poltergeist, stickin' knives inside of your head
What's the issue, on a roll, like a roll of toilet tissue ?
I continue to expose you niggas that's so superficial
I script you your obituary then blow like a missile
Once I blow the whistle, motherfuck may the forces be with you
Come with a style, I'm wildin', pile up my money so kosher,
Then call up the sofa fuckin' bitches in back of the rover
Then bounce with the coca, bag up bitches outside of the costa rica area level, 
My features and carry my posters

Unprecedented, I cemented, you changin' your flow up
While helpin' you grow up, niggas know you for soundin' so tore up
Challengin' niggas, better hold on to banister niggas
Fuck around I'll stuff your body parts into canisters niggas
Like you don't know the half, I'll bust' your motherfuckin' ass
Busta buss, cass, and papoose is fuckin psychopaths

[Chorus: x8]
Making niggas wanna get hype yea I'm psycho 

My nigga beside me with triggers and niggas get bodied
I lock a strip and chop a brick like I'm Mr. Miyagi
But this ain't karate, I been sick since I pissed in a potty
I probably been proper since my papa put dick in my mommy
I'm a cannon man
Holdin' the hamma man
For the loot niggas shoot niggas like a camera man
Snappin' a picture, you get stuck like the back of a sticker
I got bars like the factory manufacturing snickers
And I do crimes for the bread like croutons
With two nines I be layin' clowns down like foutons
With the bullets in the rocket, my pockets is full of cream
I'm blowin' steam keep the steel in my hands like wolverine

Poppin' the metal, you niggas is not on my level
I'm locking the kettle man, I'm hot like the pot and the kettle
On the mic I spaz, who get it hype as cass
And my nigga busta, we some motherfuckin' psychopaths

[Chorus: x8]

I'm an iceberg trapped in a fire I won't melt
I'm a fetus that survived an abortion, I won't be kilt (killed)
I'm the heart of Brooklyn, New York, I'm bedstuy
I'm a christian woman's hand on the bible I won't lie
I'm the code of silence in the gotti crew
I'm an empty mag right after a shootout, I just bodied you
Got something sup? shotgun pump, shot at you
Like kamakize through, your baby mom's feel the wop cock back
Cause she was sittin' on my lap
I stay with the oowap strap
I put your baby daddy in a body bag
When I squeeze and let the wop clap
I Baghdad like Iraq

This is my era, you niggas is losers
I'm the new era(error) like a mistake on your computer
Got the infrared dot, bustin' you gullible suckers too
But a dot on your ass like www

Diamonds that fit in Chanel Minks in the winter

Flooding the street, hoping niggas' swimming is moving gorillas
King Kongs, Godzillas when we roll up
Seat filling niggas, get up when we show up

Uh, shit
Please don't throw up
Hold your liquor, grow up
If you robbing niggas, we going to show you how to blow up
Thank your lucky stars, it's the Rap Czar, tuck your shit in

You never win, model thin, walking crack in your shin

Square up, bow down to the kings of the hall
We wade on, talk shit while we ball
So what's cracking with yall?

Made in New York, and the slick talking thieves of the order [?]
Call the reporter, stepping like the British walkers
Legendary swag flu and see the influence, see how we do it
Get them into it steadily. God, I'm stupid, so undisputed
Act fool, back tool, until they pop off
Police crowd up the street, blocking them off, locking them off
Got these niggas wilding while I signal my soldiers
Posting it up, maintaining composure, staying on the sofa
Thirty bottles, twenty waitresses, bring them over
See how we light up shit, nigga, call the promoter
And tell that nigga bring the bag, better hurry up with it
And count the money up proper, cause you can get it

Yeah
It feel good, don't it?
It feel good, don't it?
Hey, I want to let yall know
Hey, hey
I want to let yall know
This Yeezy
And you listening to Q-Tip

Set them up, stiletto up, saddle up and let's go
Good times, only difference, niggas making your dough
Chatter is up, peep the way we batter it up
On top of the mountain, folding the ladder up
You dead and done rip up your paper, cause your status is none
Transfixed on the strengths of the page, whether chopper or gauge [?]
You're just a single, cause you wouldn't engage
Turnt up with the script on the cup, you keep the goggles[?] with us

See how we push sometimes man forget cuff, beat him the head
Boop-be-de-de-boff, zippity-boof
Beat him in the head again, ""stop killing me, Wolf!""
Whop!
Beat a nigga till he drop, piggity-poof!
Oxy in me pulse
He don't want no problem with niggas
Fuck it, let's get to drinking, poison our livers
Dammit, we sinners when me and Abstract are together, see we deliver
She got me touching it, fucking on all my fingers, dammit we winners
Pillaging this rap shit, homie, they know
Kill everything until it's time for me to go
That's when I bomb it with a blow
And then I black and get a little bit dummy
The microphone is bleeding, you should take it from me!

Incredibly we do it, and it resonates the music
I tune it, YouTube it, it could never ever be refuted
It's gnarly for niggas and naughty for ninas
Bitches and ballerinas
Ballers and in-betweeners
Blatant non-believers and over-achievers
Kicking it in paisley[?] Adidas
Drink Aliz in liters
All of you must reconcile a leader
She's begging to eat us, and her man's attitude defeated
But never a scandal, because me and Busta came to handle, we gentlemen

Not to mention, we're veterans
Second, he need some medicine
Before I black[?] as he get off my premises
Better fly, you pelican, idiot ass niggas
But then again, you need a suit for your funeral measurements
See me doing it effortless?
It's never getting no better than this
Giving your shit to convince a better preference
Watch me turn them to skeletons
See how I come and bring out the betterness?
Time is with it and I rep the foreverness
Flying, United Emirates - sized private plane, that kind of etiquette
Purchasing diamonds, handle them delicate
Now you need you a better ref
You could peep us regulating, see we all in this bitch like we ain't never left",Thank You,

June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She 8 centimeters, my lil' man about to fall
Scuffing my Air Forces, running through the hospital hall
Deja Vu, like I been here before
I'm feeling reborn, like a Bed-Stuy brethren, my first born
Dre, I'm about to have a bad boy, family in the lobby
See my nigga Church, ""What Up,"" shit I left the camcorder in the truck
Running through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweating
I swear to God every minute's starting to feel like a second
I seen Hell staring down the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to Heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a little hash in it
Spread my wings, If only I could fly
Why fight to live homie?, If we only living to die

[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like Father, like Son
But in the end I hope you only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like Father, like Son
My little man, your day is coming, coming, your day is coming, I tell you
And when it comes, just keep it running, running, just keep it running, I tell you

[Verse 2: The Game]
They say every time somebody die a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screaming at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yelling for the doctor to come
All I could remember was Lamaze class, breathe baby
""One (one), two (two), three (three), four (four),"" I see the head
Doc busting through the door, he between the legs 
He see the head, it's my baby boy
11:46, the head out, she screaming, making crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach folding like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feeling like Mariah Carey, all these butterfly's
Voices singing to me, sound like Teena Marie
I'm calling niggas on tour, ""Jayo tell ? I just cut the umbilical cord""
11:57, a soldier is born, and he's flesh of my flesh, young ? ?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
I want to thank Dr. Dre and Nurse Theresa, for bringing my baby boy to life
You birthed a Caesar, And my baby Mama, Aliska
For pushing out a 10-pound, 4-ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose, ears, eyes, chin, just like your Daddy 
I die before you grow up and be just like your Daddy, or your Grandfather
Call Uncle Dre, tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm popping Cris with your Godfathers, Baron Davis and ""D-Mack"" Darius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71, with my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Aaron Wright, T'Yan and Lil' Pun
Lowriding, banging ""Ready to Die,"" track number 1
If I bust 5 times and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun, one

When I'm in motion, it's just like the flow of the ocean 
The weight of the words swerve and curve 
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas 
Quick as a Lamborghini, smooth as a Lexus 
I guess that makes me the top of the line 
Oh, yes, I'm the most prime of all time 
'Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin, and the lyrics just start 
To flowing, ahem-ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going 
On with the rapture, so that I can capture 
Your mind with state of the art music made to adapt to 
To knowledge, the God on the groove 
Because when my tongue moves, I just love that I'm smooth 
Do it with these and in times I leave reason
To give 'em a little of the flavor that please 
As I school in the who in pursuin', and doin', and reignin' again
And the gutter, and stutter, and killin', and chillin', collectin' the rent, and 
Jammin', and slammin', and, damn, it's 
Too much for one mind to comprehend 
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend 
And the way that I be doin' rappers in 
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men 
I play somethin' verbally, capable to murder the 
Average MC; the tough ones I'll burn third degree 
And if you're thinkin' that I'm takin' a beatin'
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin'

So get off the dills and step back, you little hawker 
Better yet, you hooker; you want to show, I book ya 
The highest way I took ya; is you's a good looker?
Queens is residential; I make the presidentials 
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals 
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square 
If you went in by yourself, it was a terror 
See, I could do that 'cause my crew is kinda phat 
Outside we had the toolies; out West you call 'em gats 
It's that, 'oh, thanks' chat; well, let me drop some more shit 
Bring your bats and balls, and please don't forfeit 
'Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank 
You can ride with me, G; I'm goin' to the bank 
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane 
You get the idea 'cause page times is near 
So, rappers, see, they bug 'cause they really can't handle

My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip 
Hey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude 
Whack, do ya on the stage gettin' booed 
This structure - it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors 
On a young raider chalk; well, that's my vocal fader 
Keep my volume on extra boom! 
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room

Know I'm sayin'? I let ya know how it is in my lifestyle everyday 

Lately yo, I been walkin' tightropes 
It's an adventure everyday as I walk down the block 
Quiet bald head is like a bad motherfucker 
All charged up from Madison Ave. 
I'm up on the stage if you read the front page 
Give me the ol' school mic with a cord 
I'll stand on the table, give a fuck about a label 
Now, we all can't brawl, we all can't brawl 
It'll be your downfall when you're goin' like this 
Is it the cash or the hash from my stash that compels you? 
Gas kids throw me but my crew bring me back 
They stay on my back so I don't act like all a dat

Late one night, fifty-fifth outpost 
Chicken head watchin' to see who she can catch 
She got a man, I can tell 'cause the action in her eyes 
Ain't nervous, a young sassy thing 
She call me a playa, standin' on the corner with her whole dime crew 
I'm ridin' down the block with her girlfriend 
In the next nigga's car, lookin' like a star 
Shades, blackness, packed his whole damn frame
Ya got to be down to starts about the booty 
'Cause Sonny Lamb packs the wham 
It's all good, yeah it's all good 
See it attracts kids that are sweater 
A nigga like me'll be the first to forget 
So now she all mad, bringin' drama to the crib 
Go ahead, chicken head, wit the funk 
You get played like trash if you act like you'd always have and you 
Always will

All these bitches carry on when they think they all a dat

Now my cheques jam and I waited all damn week 
And if I flip em the bad guy, you wonder why 
When the corner officers and nobody can call me back 
And everybody claims to know nothin' 
And these is the peoples that's down wit me 
Supposedly, lays on my side, yeah right 
They let a nigga die in the night if you let em 
You can get wild, flip, go grab the mask 
But it damn sure slow-up the cash 'cause I know 
Ya be a menace to society, still waitin' for the dough 
The thinkin' man is the one with the plan 
Plant his seeds first then be ready to burst 
It's like that, huh? My name is X from the hot blocks of Harlem 
Take it personally when you try to stop my stardom 
Use to be mild, find myself gettin' wild 
Got to slow down for my girl and my child 
'Cause I love life and I gots ta live it 
And every time I get on stage I'ma move somethin' 
And you can never say the X didn't hit ya 
Ayo, I put it on ya, but first I warn ya 
This ain't no average skit, this is a hit 
More than you hit, better than your best shit 
Better than your man's shit, better than his cousin's shit 
Better than your whole block, buck once and then ya come wit that nons

Aight, hey Buck, when you bring what you bring to the game and when I bring 
What I bring to the game, it's dangerous that I can't even call it. 
But we gonna end it off like this, 
Ya know I'm sayin'? 
On some Bronx town shit, check it out 

The big X has spoken, courtesy of Buck 
A Bronx hoe-down similar to the showdown 
Won't you place a bet on ya man 
You know my style and you know where I stand 
I'ma leave you on wit the real for right now 
Peace to Brand Nubian, Now Rule and Buckwild 
But right now, peep the master of the head nod 
Hit New York harder and smarter, thieves attack, now stay back

We have now taken over your radio

Goin' straight through the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, I'm comin' through
And if you don't want to move then I'm comin' right through you

It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, I'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who want to tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Insane like a runaway train I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The monstar again, I'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now I'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with official hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc the monstar funk

Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (uhh)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness (uhhh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money
Or in it for the love, M.J.
Twenty- three ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (uhh)
I'm twenty-eight light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like bob dole
Am I gettin' lyrical
Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow

We want it all (want it all)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before

And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

Yo, god bless
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' why'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be
They be the monsters

What are you talking about
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game we take you to war (war)

I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and

People always asking me, how your shit be selling
For making shit guaranteed to bust your fucking melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no telling, when I was striking had you swelling
Cruising in my Lands, watch the police how they be gelling
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smelling

Chicken head, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton

On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggas open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'

Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Every time I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggas look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breaking fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Hey yo, I see intruders on my scan
Singing at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland

[Chorus 1]",Abandon Ship,1996
Busta Rhymes,"It was a dark night, pitch black, May 20, 19
Approximately 11:30 p.m., a black child was born. 
Upon his arrival and rapid growth, 
Being exposed to the many casualties of the streets, 
He has now realized what must be done
He must bring the ruckus to all you motherfucka's
He must bring the ruckus to all you motherfucka's
He must bring the ruckus to all you motherfucka's! 

(Rampage the Last Boy Scout) And now for the moment all you
Mothefucka's been waitin' for
All my Flipmode niggas rise and awake for
The most powerful event to occur the coming! 
Once again you now rockin' wit the best. 
Flipmode is tha squad for tha year of 1996. 

Uh! Rampage the
Last Boy Scout is who I be, 
Here to take you on another ride of the Flipmode explosion. 
Street to street, land to land, 
Coverin' all burial grounds in your area. 
I'm here to bring on my physical, 
The 8th wonder of the world, 
Straight from the dungeon shot, 
The infamous, the infamous, Busta Rhymes! 

Boy Scout's who I be, Flipmode is still the squad
(Busta Rhymes) Yo, hey yo, yo, this joint right here, 
Is dedicated to all the motherfucka's who fell off 
And the motherfucka's whose about ta fall off,
Yo, keep fallin', keep fallin, hey, keep fallin, 
Yo, keep fallin', keep fallin, 
This is specifically for the motherfucka's who came out here
Claimin' to represent hip- hop 
But really didn't do shit to preserve the
Value of the fuckin'  artform, the way of life. 

Hip-hop is a way to live man,
It ain't no institutionalized religion or somethin'. 
It's a way to live, it's a culture, dog, you know what I mean? 
You know, so if you ain't really
Got nuthin beneficial to offer this hip-hop shit, 
Preserve the value of the art form, the music, 
The way of living, don't even fuck wit it! 
We don't need dead weight motherfucka's. 

This is where we at as it stands right now
In the current day of 1996. 
There's only 4 years left. 
This is dedicated to
All tha niggas who keep fallin, 
Keep fallin', so keep fallin',
Ah! Ha, so keep fallin', thanks a lot",The Coming (Intro),1996
Busta Rhymes,"[Chorus]
Watch me get down and just do my thing baby [Repeat: x8]

Who! Yes yes y'all

Open up your door, let me on in

Bend your frame like plexiglass
You motherfuckers, be actin like you, don't know the half
You and your whole staff, make me laugh

With your similar features like Olivia Newton-John
Damn, ho! I make the whole place warm, then

Now, stay tuned to every Busta Rhymes, coming soon
I will King Kong on niggaz like guerilla monsoon, soon

Let me do my thing!
Let let let me do my thing, hah!

When I step in the place you should keep your mouth closed
Take your fat finger out your nose
You should just pay attention, and watch how I wild on records
Make you sing, ""The Lord is my shepherd!""
In the process I do away with all nonsense
Hit you with magic like my name was Pocahontas
The dread, gon' make you party til you dead
Niggas quick to talk shit, Opos! Upside your head
Put your head to bed, let me do my thing, 'nough said
Shit so hot make your chickenhead do the spread
Tell me what you said, I said I never leave you misled
While you bullshit, I'd rather get the lucci instead
Flip until you fall
Whyling in your whip, til you crash into a brick wall
Through the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless
Always blowing up your spot, bringing more surprises
You, you know you really need to come clean
Let me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene
I will endanger your species like an ostrich
Hold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage
HAH! I be the number one chosen just to keep you open
Chill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen
Pay the prices made the needed sacrifices
To present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises

[Chorus]

Let me do my thing!
Let me do my thing, please!
Let me do my thing, Flipmode is the Squad y'all!
Let us do our thing, please, let us do our thing
Oh yes it's me, yes it's the Squad
Flipmode, we gon' do our thing

Let me do my thing for nine-five, nine-six, suck dick
Yes I got the bag full of brand new tricks
Dead in the face, yes I'm gon' hit you with hits

Hey! hey yo yo yo, yo! Let me fuck up your mind

It's busta rhymes giving you much more
So

Yo y'all (y'all) one more time I come
Knucklehead flow that make you act real dumb
Yo (yo), I burn your food like florence
Run up in your crib like my name was search warrants
Shut your mouth nigga don't you complain
Fix you up, mix you with cut like pro-caines
Ooh! Insane to your brain
Right on your subconscious, I leave my shit stain
I be the mostest with rhyme overdoses
Hot stepping over shit like ini kamoze's
Sick lyrics like multiple sclerosis
Focus, while I display flows ferocious
Weak niggaz just fall and keep tumbling
Distribute lyrics like I'm hand to hand herb hustling
Hardcore like quick draw mcgraw
Fuck what you heard you ain't heard this before

I make sure everything remains raw

Yo, when I step in the place I leave damages
Nuff bandages on pussy from miscarriages
Yo, watch me bring the newest recipe
Fuck you up quick and condemn you all with leprosy
Let me hit you with flows, that come various
Hahh, send you home and make you lie bout your alias
Ha-ha, niggaz can't see my routine
When I round up my flipmode niggaz and get cream
Hey, you! You know what the fuck I mean
Now I'm on the scene, stepping through like mean joe green
Now I'm making you feel the extreme
Till I black you out then turn on my real high beam
Oh shit, now I got your brains fried
Once you inhale smoke from my flow, carbon monoxide! 
Use your imagination, let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes, earth wind & fire
Yo, hit the dirt, get on the floor
I'm that outlaw nigga living right next door
You should just roll out the red carpet
All movin targets, I got you open like supermarkets
(Word up, word up) yo yo, there's only five years left
While niggaz is scared to death they breathe they last breath
Days of my life goes on, word is bond
I make you feel my proton, neutron, and electron
Yo, I be the number one icon
Word to the holy qu'ran, I rock on and on
On and on, hey, on and on and on

[Chorus: x2]
You can live true baby  you can live trife 
Whatever way you chose you got to leave your life 
Hey yo you're running out of time  and you bout to cross 
The finish line  the finish line 

And  yo! I can't afford to waste a second 
Stepping with my eyes on niggaz checking on my weapons 
Every millisecond, motherfuckers say they true to this 
But when they grab the microphone they shit sound like stupidness 
Haha, mad to pull another vicious scandal 
I know that you can't handle when I flip from other angles now 
Feel my hot wax, burning from my melting candles 
You can't take the heat, so you switch from boots to wearing sandals 
This is for example! Shit will make a nigga curse 
When worse comes to worse, you be the first to disperse now 
We don't believe your man was living like that 
Hoping to find that nigga see exactly where his heart was at 
It's a damn shame how Son know your style, know your name 
Watch how he pull your file, make you wish you never fucking came now!
Even the hardest motherfucker has his final day 
So kill that shit you talking, and be about your fucking way 

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, everyday I see you on the block smoking 
With a bunch of niggas scoping on how they can split you WIDE open 
You don't even know what's going on up in your circle 
Awful murder niggas itch to leave you black blue and purple 
Ah! Your man came to put you on and tried to make you bleed 
Hit you with some shit that left you flipping mad in disbelief 
You just can't believe that niggas that you smoke with is on it 
And the way they rass they really got to bust yo' shit! 
Thought your man was joking, paid no attention to the situation 
Got with your crew and just continued smoking 
Now your man sit and watch you panic 
In any other situation you'd be fronting like you gigantic 
I guess all that fronting is your main talent 
It's apparent, he can see right through you like you transparent 
Haha, hey yo you need to watch your back you running out of time 
Watch your step, 'cause you only inches from the finish line 

[Chorus: x2]

Now, there's about a million motherfuckers on your trail 
Quick to bust your shit for every single time your words failed 
I'm watching all the moves you making fuck the speculating
Super-bitch nigga you just be faking if I'm not mistaking 
Every move you fake you dig your grave a little deeper 
Come around me with that shit I'ma flip it to my brother's keeper 
Listen to this: overstress my emphasis 
I insist to fix and bring the noise as long as I exist 
Now you walk around the streets with all that shit you speak 
And step inside the club just to receive the illest ass beating 
Hoo! Take a look around you get no type of sympathy 
Impatiently, I sit and watch you die in your own iniquity 
Haha, now you out dead and stinking, and your eyes are no longer blinking 
Time caught up quick, with your little bitch way of thinking 
Ah, watch you diminish, while your niggas have to put a finish 
On your misleading false image 

[Chorus: x5]

Word is bond, bond is life 
You shall be willing to give your life 
Before your words shall fail 
All those who out there fronting, misleading they peoples 
Acting other than they really are 
It will catch up to you player, word is bond

Trying to act like they know what the fuck's going on",The Finish Line,1996
Busta Rhymes,"Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back

Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter

Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife


Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes

Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile
I'm great distance like AT&T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back

For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas

If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!

Complicate your vision and make the world look strange
Try to remain calm but yet you still feel perspiration

Bought yourself a piece you shit to try and avoid the confrontation
Fear me, it's in your bloodstream feel the circulation
Permenantly trife and affecting life like ammunisation

I love bring that shit right at you - door to door service

Now in my present life I'ma still bust your fucking ass
Yo, it's been predicted, ever since I was a child
Getting addicted to candy bars I was still wicked
Drop jewels on many fools while my niggas pack tools
In '89 when we signed this Leaders Of The New School
Four, lyrical Schwarzeneggers rolling like commanders
Wrecking shit, hit after hit, while we set the standards
Back then came leaders of the 'New  it was like a dream come true
You could scream on the mic and do what you gotta do
In the meantime I show improved and stick my lagoon theory
Scream at the top of my lungs until you fuckers hear me

Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munches
Bowed down the block eating food at Luigi's
Constipated, too much extra cheese
Well anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas, Lebanese
Let's begin with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend
She was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, AloeVeralese
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe, the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy braud, I mastered my Degree's and my Ph.D's

Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot, Blauw!
No we don't promote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends

Yo hey yo see Brown  see Brown where the fuck you at  dun 
Hey yo Milo  Milo and the dance  where the fuck you at  nigga 
Hey yo hey yo Dinco  where you at  son 
Where the fuck my Leaders niggas is at  man 
Fuck man  I'm ready to grab my niggas 
Them niggas need to go to blow or sometin 
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Runnin faster than the speed of a bullet)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
(Has more rhymes than any other DJ that has craps) 
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Able to leap sucker MC's in a single bound) 
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Look at the jam of the mic) 
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along (It's the L-the O-the N-the S) 

Three in this to grass it up like me 
Besides TNT, see an N and BG 
My visionary which is skipping on my D-O-G 
I guess it was a S-O-S from G-O-D 
Chaos has arisen interteller space souls (SOULS!) 
Cellular, good ridance, like keypads wit ol' bass 
Third planet states while the rest of the world waits (WAITS!) 
Joy to the world, meaning hell, snow and earthquakes 
Participates, modulates 
If comets were round plates, bitten names gates 
For only those that relates, case after case (CASE!) 
Dinco's on the next space 
Movin strategically in the Solar System's waste 
Size 25, the lymph still be in place 
Stretch and extending, for flexin is impending 
It's not mind-bending or refriending to keep remembering (hmm!) 
'Cause everybody's people gonna die, or believe 
We dispense necessity, to shout and receive 
Keep it moving along 
People in the party, are you really feeling 
We ain't seein eye-to-eye so you ain't really seeing (SEE!) 
I be hippin all type of niggas, sayin fuck that nigga Blow 
When they see me in the party, they better act like they know 
YO, we connecting dots that makes spots hot 
To the beat'cha (Y'ALL!), ah ya don't stop (STOP!)
Notice, how many groups can formulate then lose focus 
With a lot of hocus pocus, concepts that sound bogus 
I'm seeing the world and all its different kind of poses (WOO!) 
Crush you like roaches, that's keeping the crowd moving (Ha!) 
Mr and the dancers, who said ""Culture consuming"" 
Never face, he  and strength 
'Cause I can terminate, like a dirty hypodermic needle 
My vision's clearer than the sights on an eagle 
Stop them busting high, bring the head back to my table 
Don't front, circle circle, dot dot, you catch your speed, not 
Feel that, 'cause this type of vibe sounds done 
(Far from the, to the doe-run-run-run to the doe-run-run) 
(YES!) Yes to the beat-boys and your ass accepted 
Exclusive, L-O-N-S bringing the ruckus, wild aggressive 

Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin' 
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 

Now don't get me wrong, chill! 
Let me out, no question, no doubt 
God is a drought 
I've come to wet the party like a tropical depression 
Mixed with scherm for this musical session 
(STOP!) stressing, testing, second-guessing, who's 'fessin 
Life is a lesson in disguise like a blessing 
Blinking, kicking, better back up chickens 
The guns stun split, I keep it real, front worm (WORM!) 
'Cause I'm like a hands therapeutic 
Measurements, square, feet, and cubic 
We're all making pennies off a record, so who needs the paper (WHO) 
The man in Manhattan lamping in the skyscrapers 
How much can a nigga take before he break fool 
I tell ya cool, with the New School 
And the tool to examine my unorthodox pattern 

From Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn 
And don't forget Uranus, Neptune and Pluto 
Flow deeper than the lava inside a volcano, bro 
(Never snitch, never dominate 
I'll be wild, smokin drowsy) 
Fuckin up my economics, is it rather ironic 
Sippin gin, juice and tonic 
Like Shawn Kemp with some hemp, super sound and sonic 
Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp 
See-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant 
Yeah yeah, yeah (AHH!) 
My shit be so ginamic 
And I'ma take 4 steps and cross the whole Titanic 
Better believe I (KEEP!) movin (OVER!) people
You know my crew funk, bringin in full flaga' 
Bringin it back like I'm fresh out the box, pair of broke ass 69ers 
(IS THERE NUTTIN NEW) All in the house so open up your blinders 
Yo, I be the Moses takin poses 
When the wine flows so beautiful like a large bouquet of roses 

Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin' 

Keep it movin now 
No need to try to stop it, we gon' wreck shit anyhow 
Your, limitations is something I never will allow 
When we bake the cake, I be that nigga that brings the icing 
Disregard your whole identity and revoke your driver's licence 
You know I blast in your ass real fast 
Got your bladder burning, desperate for a bathroom pass 
My  like a Busta Rhymes statue made of grass 
C'mon, hypnotise some ass, shit so hot, better jump in the water, 
Nigga 
Breakin fools at parties like a ruckus sound class 
Make a philly down the back and mix the weed with more hash 
I will wash away your pain like Draino 
Erupting like the angriest volcano, or the wickedest whirlwind and 
Tornado 
We stay up in the streets, cruisin, me and my whole crew, gotta

Keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin' 
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin' 
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin' 
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along 
Keep it movin' 

This one goes out 
To the three brothers that I love the most, in memory of this song 
My man Ratto, my man Big Joe, my nigga Love 
Them niggas rest, most comfortable

Huh, who! Ice Capades all over beats son
While I smoke your Phillies all the way down to the last one
Yo watch me skyrocket 
Prop me for my flow then get your hand out my pocket
As the world keeps on turning
Killing microphones as the nigga most determined
Keeping biters fiending like this was they last serving
Stay away from fake motherfucks like Mark Fuhrman
Got your whole entire ""Little House on the Prarie"" burning
Stick me for my rhyme like you stuck me for my Sherlings

Keep my peoples moving like a U-Haul

Watch me knock you down
You'll be surprised how quick the fucking word will get around
A biter came up missing and the bitch was never found, yo
I come with shit, so sure, to hit
Hit you til your motherfucking dome split
Counterfeit niggas need to sit back up off of it
And if you don't listen you deserve whatever you get
Just a moment, let me take a breather
Got you niggas sweating coal, like you caught the fever
Just to know my every move you fuck a freak psychic reader
For those who bite my flows I got to always pack my heater
Yo, I was the one that (haha) made a nigga cough (huh)
Soft (hoo!) Wait quick to turn a nigga off
Yo, I'm quick to break a niggas spine
And any effort made by those who try to take mine

Cuz feds watch when I do shit, keep poppin' up new shit
Keep the whole Harlem World on some Clue shit
We crisp bub sippers, strip club niggas
Peace to the street team, ya'll get love niggas
Six years ago I was the have-not nigga
Hot nigga, represent for all my block niggas
Now I'm 6 drop niggas, baggette rock niggas
10 G's a show and I ain't even drop niggas
Shock niggas who thought I was a pop nigga
You go against Mase you get your wig rocked nigga!
Players like me'll leave your whole block bitter
Roll hard like when I see the bank stop nigga
Hustle is a hustle, so I never knock a nigga
Don't really fuck with Dame, but still I copped Jigga

Yo, if niggas wanna act we can act
You niggas wanna scrap, we could scrap
You niggas got gatts, we got gatts
You niggas wanna style, we style
If you get foul, we get foul
You get wild, we get wild

Yo, I do this everyday, why brag about the glory?
Tell you the whole truth, never half the story
You wasn't no hater, you'd probably be happy for me
Billboard first slot in every category
Niggas say they love me, they don't love me
I know deep down they wanna slug me
I feel the vibe when they hug me
Luckily I rock jewels that be chuckie
Over Iceberg Rhugby, pushin' a Benz buggey
For a better batch, roll fever for notes
And need I approach little niggas seated in coach
I mean, um, think it's smaller than the weed in my roach
The seed in my smoke, the niggas ain't cheap, they broke
Oh yeah, this my dough year
Jealousy and envy'll get you nowhere
You don't like me, bet against me
You right, got dough do whatever you like
I get front row seats on the night of the fight
My Roley too tight, how many link, loosen my ice
And 'for I scoop the dice, bet a grand I beat the duece twice
Niggas who don't make dough, I can affil'ate with 'em
I'm dyin' from a sickness known as Willie-ism

Um, yo, whatever you want
We can do
We can do it better
And you niggas wanna scrap? We can scrap
Niggas wanna wild? We wild
However niggas like it, you get it

Yo, the sun don't shine forever
But as long as it's here then we might as well shine together
Better now than never, business before pleasure
P. Diddy and the Fam, who you know do it better?

Yeah right, no matter what, we air tight
So when you hear somethin' make sure you hear it right
Don't make a ass outta yourself, by assumin'
Our music keeps you movin' what are you provin'?
You know that I'm two levels above you baby
Hug me baby, I'm a make you love me baby
Talkin' crazy, ain't gon' get you nothin' but choked
And that jealousy is only gonna leave you broke
So the only thing left now is God for these cats
And B.I.G. you know you too hard for these cats
I'm a win cause I'm too smart for these cats
While they makin' up facts (uh) you rakin' up plaques

In The Commission, you ask for permission to hit 'em
He don't like me, hit him while wifey was with him
You heard of us, the murderous, most shady
Been on the low lately, the feds hate me
The son of Satan, they say my killing's too blatant
You hesitatin' I'm in your mama crib waitin'
Duct tapin' your fam' destiny
lays in my hands, gat lays in my waist
Francis, M to the iz-H phenomenal
Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, brawl nights, I perform like Mike
Anyone, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
action, pack guns, ridiculous
And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch
Two auto-matos, used to call me fatso
Now you call me Castro, my rap flows
militant, y'all faggots ain't killin' shit
Oops Crystal keep spillin' shit, you overdid it homes
You in the danger zone, you shouldn't be alone
Hold hands and say it like me

Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'ma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
to make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The girl-boy killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit, Mac tight, brass knuckles and flashlights
The heaters in the two-seaters, with two Midas
Senoritas, kiss rings when you meet us
P. Diddy run the city, show no pity
I'm the witty one, Frank's the crook from the Brook'
Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Venice took the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Luc'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin' him
Niggas step up, with just Mase and 'em
Placin' them in funerals, criminals turned aroused
The Brick City, nobody come off like P.Diddy
Business wise, I play men
Hide money on the Island Cayman, y'all just betray men
You screamin, I position, competition

And taking the time out of your busy day to day living,
to do the knowledge take in and observe and absorb and listen
and feel the all emotional roller coaster of this lp,
thoroughly put together by Missy and Timbaland.

The official banging shit hip-hop music, soul music, R&B music.
Y'all motherfuckers don't know this is that official full-fledged shit
and until the next time? Chicken niggas they say?",Busta's Outro,1997
Busta Rhymes,"See when we get on shit we like to make you
Shake your ass, move your hips
So we gonna do a little something like this
Flipmode, Bad Boy
Check this out

Tell me how it feels, is it hot is not
Does it drop cash like a slot
Does it stay streeted go pop
Checkin' out what Flipmode got, mad hip-hop
Chartin' number one, drinks in the sun
Eighty times so we can get sponged, shake it hon
All a brother know is make the hit get the dough
Makin' grandmas hit the floor, really though
It's my thang my slang
Rich motherfuckers scoopin' chicks at the Rucker
Bringin' my team to the joint wit Allen Iverson runnin' the point
Don't smoke a spliff on the joint
And when they see me they all point
'Cause I, I be that nigga wit the million dollar figures
Gettin' all up in they bitches
Leavin' they pussy in stitches, uh

Aiyyo I'm on to the next level
I'm gettin' rich, friends said I switch
I got me a bad chick, live up in the hills
Pay my mom's bills, recoup a half a mil
Still got my deal, pop the 700 Benz-o
You never seen, cash money fiend
A lot of cats wanna dream
Pack a shorty black or Phillipian
The way I eat my shrimp with steam
I'm the man with the gangsta lean, what, what
Yo I split your whole spleen if you know what I mean
Call me little rapcash, I get you for your stash
VIP pass, save all the gas, I make it last

To my people in the front if you ready to bump a say
""Don't stop the body rock""
To my people in the back if your not a wack a say

To my people in the right wanna party tonight just say
""Don't stop the body rock""

Since Mase refuse to lose, we makes numeral moves
'Cause I'm smoother than them dudes and them two thousand dollar shoes
When I move to new Jerus, cause I like the cruise
And my six double-o, blast weed, love the dough
I'm that Goodfell-ay, what the hella they can tell me
Smoke my la la out in LA, who's ready
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy
See Angelettie when a nigga need his chedd-ay
'Cause I'm rawer than a broad way
With all A's and platinum
There been many things we touch
Never had a partner so I never had to deduct shit 1.8
And every week I have to re-up
So what, so what

Ay yo, check out the way me and my niggas always be rippin' shit
The way that I display new flavor and do it so intricate
Pitter and patter, patter and pitter all over this shit
Uh uh uh oh, y'all niggas be yappin' till I be sick of it
Hit you with shit that y'all niggas will never ever forget
Fuckin' with my niggas is like you playin' Russian Roulette
Ooh me and my whole platoon coming soon
Nigga make room, we diesel like a bunch of baboons
Hey yo yo, think you can manage all of my niggas damage?
Tryin' to alter our lavish livin' niggas will turn savage
Yo, Flipmode and Bad Boy collabo
Makin' sure all of you niggas all say, “Hoooo!”

Don't like it? Go grab your gat and lets brawl at hall, nigga
Straight fallin', when we use to chill up on park benches
My twenty block radius, think we need some barb wire fences
Stop bitch niggas, like you from easily trespassing
Nickel-nine, shine on your eye, then you see fire blastin'
Get off my premises, aye yo, Lord, is you a friend of his?
Mouth him back to John and show this nigga, just who the winner is
The presence of a small town, I diminish and blemishes
I’m'a play yo' ass out like a game on my little Sega Genesis, ha
This inappropriate, fuck is we talkin' for when we ain't even associates?
Ass lyrical beatings, straight trick or treating
What ya eatin
I ain't got no words for you
Fuck speakin, ain't part of my crew
Face look too brand new, who?
Niggas ain't even aloud to send my pass through
Can't chill on my corner, can’t go up in my Bodega
Chill before I call Dinco to grab the quatro-cinco
We don't give a fuck right now
We be hi caliber shit
Ya'll corny niggas must bow
We do unforgivable shit
We blow the spot any how, move

Cradle a stainless for strangers
Vigilante, trigga stampedes
On the bulletproof hooded crews
That laid this nigga that can't breath
Move you off the block
The unorthodox general
Flash flood when a crowd
Patrol jakes for the intrepid style and wreck more kids than pedophiles
Niggaaaaaaa, for ever trapped in danger
Emaciate when I take my razor
Sharp words that scare herds
Niggaaaaa, I'm from the wicked city
When chickens twist trees and dick tease
Breast feed, Betsy's with asthmatic chest wheeze
Lord Have, cardiac arrest freeze
Please, bastard handicap crews that stay soft
It's mayor, Adolf
School your army, ya squad weak
Remove four camps when I say
Pumpin arms like nor plants
I conquer and hold
Home sweet home down with monster control
Still they in the cut like Ron and Nicole
And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Blind feelin nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
Con scrimmage, woke up Allah's children
Dirty-ass Vietnam village
I finish and outsuns
Then fold, like Minister Malcolm at the venetian blinds
By all means necessary I reach for mine and
Lift golden showers from roof tops
And give orders, rugged pound acre
Drown violators in buckets of piss water

Being the foundation, you can come home and watch the babies too
(The one way we agree on how to follow tradition)
This one family come in thirds, play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
(From all the struggle) that I see, that's why my love is for you

You always hold it down for me, so I'ma hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food to come through

Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole livin' condition (true indeed)
I know you symbolize the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities

Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go 'round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours
Movin' in the same direction, just for one common cause

Flipmode is the squad, a unit made of many crews
Give me the whole entire wheel of fortune
Making a sacrifice no matter what the shit be costing
And while you coughing I be flossing like a fuckin dolphin
A lot of bitch rich niggas experience extortion
Since I was born when I perform, I drop a mil-li-on
And one stony rocks on niggas like a fuckin hailstorm
I pollute yo, my new flow, put on your funeral home suit
And execute 'em with a bang (shoot), the blow torch has been ignited
Those who so excited, ha, I'm bout to rope 'em in, a bunch of bitch niggas are being extradited
You soundin' so sloppy, like a broken muffler draggin behind, an old jalopy
Once the bomb drops, here's the aftermath
Scientists tried to dissect the way, I formulate my craft
Worrying 'bout how I achieve things
The way I analyze shit and how I percieve things
My style is real, like lamb skin imported from the Persian
Follow my excursion, all the way 'til you feelin' the new revised version

How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger,
Now give me everything you walking with and everything your man is holding,
Even the watch that got the platinum moulding,
And as the situation start unfolding,

How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace
And if you thinking you that strong
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around
You feel the four five long

Why y'all niggas think, that y'all could really see my Squad?
And if we hit you hard, that's when you feel the power of the God
Do it right, and big up my peeps, and A-Alikes
On alike, repel, especially feel, ""When Disaster Strikes""
Extremely delicate, like the blowin' out of candle lights
The quiet killings of projects niggas, whenever they wanna fight
That type of shit that shine, and blind a nigga eyesight -
Aight? We keepin' it tight, y'all niggas don't want it right?
You will never ever get no wins inside, mi casa
We killin' all impostors, like we kill the cucarachas
Bounce to award ceremonies, like we winnin' Oscars
Rhymin' Rastas', eatin' enough exotic pasta
Ha! Yo! We keep it movin' for all of y'aaaaaaall
Freak y'all niggas out, while I'm makin' y'all niggas faaaaaall
Disaster will hit cha quick, any time you wanna brawl
Perm press a nigga back, peel them off the wall
So tell me, why do you be wastin' your time, being mad at us?
Every voice should sing, and help the music sound miraculous!

Let me talk to you baby
I've got some shit to share we your freaky ass, ha

I like the way you freak it baby, I love your style
The way you stick your tongue in my mouth and act wild
The way you give me them little fights and little tussles
Bite the back of your neck weaking your leg muscles
The type of chick who always want to take it there
She don't care, ready to fuck anywhere
Make a nigga want to bust 'til my legs cripple
Put your breasts in my face, tell me bite the nipples
You got me breathing hard, the whole shit
Kiss me on the chest, my belly button
Baby, start to kiss the whole dick
Strap you up, one time
Slap your ass up, two time
And watch you jingle
I love the way your whole ass wiggle
The way she turning me on and make my little freak wanna giggle
Before the dick paid the pussy a visit
Grabbed the pussy from the back a stuck my fingers all in it

Chorus:

Have you ever went over your freak's house to chill
And the both of you understood
That y'all could chill with the talking 'cause y'all were straight fucking
And for both of y'all, it's all good
Sometimes you try to play it off but you know you can't
Now a nigga dick hard like wood
You tried the macaroni-salad-the-sweet-pussy-delight
I'ma fuck it every time I could

My freak start stripping
I take a closer look, her pussy dripping
Flipping, you know I ain't tripping
Got my heart skipping, anticipating the fun
Baby, kiss the dick one more time and start the dick suck
I like the way you lick it, the way you suck it
The way you tell me you want the right dick to fuck it
The dick rest upon the pussy right here like wool
Grab my ass and pull, say you want your pussy whole full
Now talk the dirty shit, I like it like that
The way you swing your waist and throw all the pussy back
Baby got me all in the pussy, I ain't joking
She turning round, bending over, spreading her ass wide open
Oh yes, so I can get all in
She say she like the way the dick make the pussy feel from deep within
And when it slip out, she stick it right in
I love her just the way she is and how handle her biz

Who I am, the black Abraham
Zunga zunga zang, yellow man, Vietnam
Add an extra bar as I spar with literature
Taking kingdoms from tsars
Winning more wars than the Moors

Hey, what's the deal?
I seen the Devil spar with Allah
Mathematics was the key to set my whole race free
You might debate we, a refugee
No harm hurt me
Dying, thirsty from the struggle
To my own hustle bubble
On the low, woe is me
To show the Free Bob right
The righteous Asiatic thinker
While Satan rob light
Civilised like the Molly
Burgundy, wildy rocking
Seen the fifth when Ali clocked him
John Forte will keep you locked in

You got to recognise and witness

But take the text and change the picture
Watch Muhammad play the messenger like Holy Muslim scriptures
Take orders from only God
Only war when it's Jihad
See Ali appears in Zaire to reconnect 400 years

Tussle with a lasso in the Royal Rumble
Seperate boys from men in the concrete jungle

Taking trips to Zimbabwe
Africans started calling the God Ali Bumbaye (so bwoy)

Blow that make you feel like you was poison bitten
Ha yo I'm 'bout to blister you and your sister
Predicting every ass whipping before my fights my nigga
This be your last warning once you walk past the doorman
Ali and Foreman gonna lock ass until the morning
Marvellous finances provided by Joseph Mobutu
Special guests of honour like the Archbishop Desmond Tutu
We watched the Rumble In The Jungle
To see who be the targeted uncle to be the first to fall and fumble
Nuff blows they gettong thrown, like solid milestones

Where you walked to at night, caught you then tried to extort you
New York niggas is trigger happy, got Pataki scared
This town ain't big enough for both of us and I ain't goin' nowhere
There it is, plain and simple like Jigga my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow their brains out they temples
I'm into black magical torture romantic dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker, like Tony when gas whores I'm the masked enforcer
Out for the cash and the cho-cha
Smash the coca, bottle it up watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff
I don't give a fuck anymore, I'm only twenty-four years old
And I've already broken every law
I'm horror core, this is for the heads
Runnin' up in your crib, knot if you still hot in under the bed

Yo, parental discretion advised, please cover your eyes
Little kids, get out of here! This shits is homicide!
Drugs and money, this ain't no Bugs Bunny!
Little girls too; this ain't for you it's for the thugs honey!

Hey yo my shit's the truth, one fifty proof no question
Parental discretion advised, keep out the eyes of the youth
It's too explicit, bullshit! I challenge the statistics
Violence existed before our music was even suggested
Arrested on sight, it's like there's no rights
That's why I rhyme so aggressive and bring every message to life
I fight the power, spite the power the 90 percent
Keep 10 and feed Twin half for personal reasons
The seasons change  things re-arrange, but I stay the same
Play the game, for the wealth, until I've made myself a name
So blame it all on the gangster rapper, thanks to Joey Crack
For the chance to do it my way like Frank Sinatra
I ain't a actor so it's all facts, strictly raw rap
Totally intended for yours dressed in all black
With the ski mask, or the pantyhose makin' cameos
In liquor store cameras with the twin Calico's

[Chorus: x2]

So forget the boom, one look, you shook, you know I'm stickin' you
Liftin' you off the ground, look down, that's where I'm puttin' you
Look in my eyes and remember me, how does it feel mentally
Havin' the enemy be the last thing you ever see?
The recipe is death and I'm the chef, fricaseein' your flesh
Be my guest, but I ain't cleanin' the mess
Me and TS we testin' niggas faith, just to see they face
Expression when destined to states, that death be in the case
I'm in the state of grace, in the hated race, by the pagan face
Couldn't fight us, made a virus, gave us AIDS
I paint the wake 'cause they ain't get me yet, wet me
Or reflect me yet, I know they comin' they just tryin to let me sweat
I wreck it like when I was just a boy, eatin Chips Ahoy!
Wasn't allowed to raise my voice, now I'm makin' noise
No more toys, strictly Mac's and missiles, shorties with forties
Packin pistols catchin bodies make sure we'll get you
So they say, I pray there's a better way
My kids don't do as I do, they do as I say, 'cause daddy don't play

One thing about MC's is that we don't conceal the truth
We present real pictures about the positive and the negative
So don't blame the hip-hop 
When your seed is learnin' the real life from us
Do your duty at home and raise your child in the house parents 
You don't do your job

Hey yo, balls your pencils
As hollow tips get in you
Bots cutting to slice your face you
Rhymes is natural
Hold two lives and four wives
Up in the crack capsule
Flipmode cruddy styles has been past you
Rush pass
You couldn't touch cash
If it was under your nose
Like a mustache
Nigga
What ass
Show your whole cheek
Slugs with no heat
Diamonds that don't break
You thugs is so sweet

[Rampage]
I float so much I get seasick
Flipmode is the squad who I bee's with
Who I get plucks with
And push german v's with
Rampage I'm psychic I can see shit
To the next millennium
You not goin' be shit
Scratch your name off the list
Cut your wrist
You know the issue
I'm official
When you die none of your niggas is really goin' miss you

[Chorus]
Flipmode squad
Here to drop bombs
Against all odds
Still remain gods
Grip your arm
We always come hard
The world is ours
Call a national guard

[Rah digga]
Here we go
Any bitch that rhyme wanna flex she ass
I'm stomping all things like I'm plexi-glass
Niggas make way like when they hear sirens
Treat you like park and too close to fire hydrants
All up in the board
Kicking back long islands
Get your wig split first solid defiance
Rah earth and sun in this imperial alliance
You do the science

[Spliff star]
I'm getting money shitting, turn intruders into vixens
Fall off beeper uh-uh niggas stay getting
Dirty nigga for life
That's how spliff's living
Throwing niggas in caskets
Tired of a yellow ribbons
I buck my duck if you touch my one
Rather Jamaican than belly boy make you people for fun
Fat man's son, street educated
The colonel of ghetto jurors, still thug related

[Chorus]

[Lord Have Mercy]
We enemies of three strike felony laws
Gorilla dicking k-y jelly for whores
Lap dances trap grands without laws
My baby moms, three eighty for your arms
That bust with loud force
The ghetto with us
That bang makaveli in trucks
That whatever the fuck to give a cheddar in chunks
Who gazey chase
Fake thugs with lazy aid
Track marks
Rap stars
And a rain of aids

[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, what you want from us
Now visualize more of us
Stay toting under my given flavor from nauticas
Destroy every arch rival or any challenger
Make you remember this day
Nigga mark it on your calendar
I'm showing you something
You ain't saying nothing
My niggas make noise
Like a bunch of volcanoes erupting
None of y'all niggas really wanna war
The type of nigga to crash my plane in your building
In the name of the law

Busta Rhymes,"Yeah, everybody, c'mon
Here we go party people 

Pull up in the whip, pop the trunk, feel it?
Fear for the will of baboon funk, ya hear it?
Me and my nigga Richie was itchy to meet some women
Met some chickens, they was acting so snobby and bitchy, fuck it
Pass me the sticky, 
The chicky wanted to leave me with a kiss and a hickie
I ain't wit it but give me a quicky
I ain't in to doing the licky-licky
Even though you be looking so pretty, 
I own all of my shit, never 50-50
Oodle noodles all 'dose fools never refuse
Accuse me for the bruise
Chick outta rattle and sound, better tighten the screws
Running and gunning, kinda stunning
The way we be coming around, slumming, wyling and dollin
My nigga Horace kick up a nigga like Chuck Norris
Got some other niggas lost way up in the forest
Hang you up in a harness, label me and all of my niggas the hardest
Fuck around, be the next ""Formerly Known As"" artist
Laid out with a goddess, pretty lilly Adonis
Besides all of that, niggas is 'nomous, I make you all a promise
The promise is that I'm so dominant and that I am so prominent
Captured the whole of Asia as a continent
Oh shit, I be coming and tumbling down
Rumbling, stumbling down
Freaky prophet with unusual musical sound
Bringing the ruckus, you motherfuckers be givin me pounds
So many sound, give me the camcorder and a city with plans
Me and my fam, hustle and tussle in makin this groove, me and my mans

How we gon' do this? (Make them move)
Keeping it live (Where my niggas is at?)
Stacking my paper (Put it awat safe)

What we gon' do? (We goin' do it to death)
What we gon' do? (Do it to death)  
What we gon' do? (Do it to death)

Yo! Pin or a needle, make you wobble or weeble
Niggas is feeble, back in the day I used to get money illegal
Get some ass, cop a room down at the Regal
Hit you wit so much drama make niggas always wait for the sequel
Yo there ain't no equal on how we be repping for the people
Yo there really ain't no equal
Ask Hillary, met her down on Flatbush and Tillory
She killing me, got me crazy, wyling, acting straight grizzly
We never made it too far together, 
I left her standing on Franklin and Willoughby
Another mystery to me
While she still on the corner kissing at me, hissing at me
Ignoring these bitches, they're angry, now they're riffing at me
Vital and critical, literal lyrical, make niggas pitiful
Go to the clinical, examine your physical
Frightening and enlightening at the same time
Get the goods and price them, and doing the heist again
You thinking we would be nice again
We on a mission, we don't need none of your advice again
Hold me down baby, pitter patter, you chitter chatter too much
I'ma splitter splatter your blidder bladder, 
Make you spill out your guts

Getting paid for securing shit for my seed and my mom
For my physical ,and my entire flipmode squad

Hold it down for live niggas in the name of hip-hop
Off with another path where niggas are made to struggle and starve
Fuck that! I'm here to fight for mine, adapting your ass
If you or the government try to do away with my cash
One of the most extraordinary that comes from a place
We demand to stab you in the back and smile in your face
Take all entire niggas off the face of the earth
And do away with all them niggas before I get to them first
So throw it, niggas don't get it and run right through it

Keep your eyes on greedy niggas gettin' greedier
Keep your eyes on meaty asses gettin' meatier

To all whack niggas I smash your dedication

My purpose is to purchase and really hurt this
Bring all of my niggas amongst the wealthy merchants
Gently we conquer the spot until it's empty
Present me and my niggas with arsenal aplenty
Break fools, send you to school, follow the rules
Violate my tools, lay you in your own blood pool
But for now I drop jewels on the mentally strong

Shit for all of you all niggas to smell up in your noses
Hocus pocus, introduce me to the hostess
I was dyin' a stroke uh play strip poker
In the limo as I directed the limo chauffer

Told the nigga to spin over by the Club Copa
Watchin' shorty lay as she spread on the limo sofa
She asked the chauffer to stop for a Frappachino Mocha
Then she let me blaze it while I still had my gun in my holster
Still bonin', word I love the way shorty moanin'
Zonin', word is born niggas is wide open
Yo, have a little fun all in between time
And now we focus on the money shit all in the meantime

Word to mother, I work hard to keep microphonin'
And alert niggas to shit like when the devil started clonin'
What nigga? Yeah, we bowlin' and shit is rollin'
Little shitty-ass niggas should run and go clean ya colon

I check my nigga Ruben for the ice cuban
Assist him in my Lincoln Ave boomin'
What's the issue? I come to get you

May the force be with you
Bang your head, rupture your brain tissue
I unravel shit faster than sound travel
Battle any amphibian or live mammal
Don't fret from sunrise to sunset

Started hitting the pussy the song from the wusang

Come out from wherever you are and be outdone
Acting like you about something
And you ain't about none

The wrong move making me whip it out like live dude
Fuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack

Break fool, make all y'all people want to come to
Feel the force of my shit kickin' like it was kung fu
Blast through, don't these corny niggas harass you
Set a tone in the streets where even the fans blast you
Ask you niggas, do y'all really want the brand new?
Corny niggas just finish your time and over pass do
He ha what ho, think it's way pass your curfew

Hit y'all niggas with an effect that y'all never felt before
Or leave you with somemore freaky dicky metaphor

Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
This, means, war!

I work hard to take care of every one of my niggas
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggas
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
Watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma banish you all
And celebrate all in your ? once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my men's
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay true, now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge
This means war!

Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, shedding a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggas standing alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggas going the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggas, breaking the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we taking your head;

Coincide with yo boy check out with no lines

For your boys got instinct rhymes
When you bump between the sixteen lines
When you bowl win the goal bitches scream
Win the goal keep ahead keep it live
Before you go get your tattoo rhymes
For your boy pick a bell in the bathroom
Penalized doing it till he get tired of ya boy
That shit between me and you niggas
Then trying to figure out what I say
I give less than a fuck, what you doing over there
Just don't get in my way
Hear my records feel my presence now and forever and until
Stop what you doing and work it fuck it nice
Just complete it with a licking to the man right there
Tell you mother fuckers what we came to do
It's just plain as day but they don't wanna see
If you don't wanna fight get the fuck is you'll be
In the spot working on my beat
Long time I'm having no compromise
I'ma open them up and them I'm dumping them out
I'm keeping it hard so don't get mad
Cause I'm loading 'em up and I'm running 'em out
Hit 'em with the bang then I feel a bang
Take her in the backyard outside leave 'em in a ring
Teach the niggas not to fuck with us
And next year we gon do the same thing and

Hehehehe, Flipmode, Sic-Wid-It
You know what`s best for you, you better get widdit

[E-40]
I heard him talkin, but then he walkin, now tell me why
They never been incarcerated in a correctional facility
For doin this kinda street chemistry (hell yea)
I`m an original rapper, retrospected by plenty, hated by people
Me, 40, we took it back as street soldier
You got my back I got your shoulder
Peas and toes, tryin to make it, it`s all oh`s
Impossible is a hit never get caught diggin in my nose
Ex d-boy used to be a big time neighborhood rock star
Although I never owned a gui-tar
I-uh-I`m lyrically inclined with my start stutter scrilla
Type delivery, 40 and Busta Rhymes, was drinkin
And smockin hickory, on the porch one time
When I came up with this line: I was perkin
Off of some of that Carlos Rossi wine -- whatcha playa patnah got
Flows, like a latina female orgasm
Hoes, be yellin and screamin causin contractions at my
Shows, they take off they clothes and throw they pantyhose on stage
Any appliable age from dookie braids to suki braids, deal widdit

Chorus:
Do it to me baby, do it to meeeee!

[Busta Rhymes]
Check it out yo
Do it to me I`ma do it to you
Rubber you glue, bounce off of me I stick it on you
Weather whatever you could never ever measure my pleasure
Dig in my treasure, be making your lungs cave in together
Blow smoke out my face, pick up the pace
Speed up the race, never let a hot joint go to waste
My dogs`ll bark when your marksman trespass
You better use caution, your body parts might get auctioned
No need for you to keep stalkin, HELL but what you talkin
Have you dusted like a zombie lookin straight Christopher Walken
Shorty tried to call me and warn me and E-40
About these other corny rappers that ain`t got nuttin for me
You know they all blew it, time to move it
Blow the spot you knowin how we do it, capitalize
Upgrade to gold now we platinum-eyes
Keep my flavor holy sacred and pasteurized, WHAT!

Chorus

[Busta Bust`]
We doin this to blow through it til you suffocate, losin your breath
Til you satisfied, you know we do it to death
Ay you know we do it to keep you flippin, do it for whylin
Doin it for me to get my hustle on, do it for profilin
Do it for the love affair because I`m lovin it
When we clubbin all you hear is the live DJ rubbin it
Runnin it all into the ground, doin it for days
Do it for money, know I gotta keep my bills paid!

[Charlie Hust`]
My reals be pokin and stickin out like nipples
The felines, be lookin at us like we some popsicles
Busta Rhyzzzimes, and Charlie Hustle, or should I say Fonzarelli
Poppin they collars and workin they star jelly
Up in the club, order the one, the party`s just begun
Love, batches outnumber the fellas ten to one push come to
Shove, forgot my gun, but it won`t hurt fool
My music come up out the woodwork, beatch!

Put you in a pine box

Leave em all stiff, blow smoke from this foul drift
Nigga with the 6 story, throw em off the cliff

The small thug with a slug put a mark on his wrist
A tattoo of pyramids, puttin hollows in clips
Peeped your gat, jammed tight, Ross your lookin to riff (what the fuck?)
QB's type shit, cause we runnin your clique
See me in the drop, with your six, sayin she snitched
But never that, 'cause-o, high beam through the window 
My lookouts move slow, they heard you never blast though
Got a safe in your crib, sham, you know the code
Search, spoke out, 3, 2, 1, that's zero
Took the see notes and flip mode left on the quietest note
Swallowed these then cleared your throat
Bitch ass, you should have spoke

Yea, your man got a gatt, but he ain't bustin no slug

Viscious knife wound, fucked up like Ron Goldman

Closed coffin with flags folded in half
Triangular shape, blow out the candles with grace
For fabulous tastes, some will, battle for space
Pay the ultimate price, poltergeist
Put the holy ghost in your life, bring you closer to Christ
Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight
Resculpture the mic, then smash heads like the opium bite
Prophet in vein, Metropolis claim body and soul
ID's controlled in the optical frame
Never stoppin the game
Remove your squad with steady plans

When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in god's places

Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like cobra heads

Wonder who

You wish you could play out
So you could blaze, too
Before I shout you
Or give reason to doubt you
I study shit and re-analyze everything about you
My rhymes on the preserve

Everything up in your stash and in the reserve
Fuck that!
Hook up all my lyrics on the echos and the re-verbs
Never fuck with these herbs

Dirty baggy jeans
Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match
Quick,
Whip up a batch
Of bullets to blow up the map

Uh-uh!, in effect mode, y'all niggas know it

Sayonara, send my rivals, slam a guy, 
Be damned if I
Had to tell one, tell a lie, get paralyzed 
Stay payed, rock shit made in ultra suede 
Switch blade yo wack act back to first grade 
Even if y'all never seen us you know y'all need us
Suck my penis from here to muthafucking venus
Think back when you was amazed and had to sit back 
Imagining me ending your world like Deep Impact
Blood clot, watch me come through and bust a gunshot
Yeah people, come inside of your dance and done that

Patch his body with gauze
Mop up the floors

Choked her by the halter, bitch bloody to death
Then the ho starts crying 'bout her hair and nails
Gettin' stomped with the shells...

(Rampage)
...I heard the bitch-nigga yell
Caught Peter, man, by the speaker
Looked me in the eye and didn't even know
I was his brother's keeper
Slap the nigga, through him in the sleeper

(Spliff Star)
Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight Grim Reaper
Still lookin for that nigga Peter

Kill the bitch while she ain't even looking
Still all fucked up from the last ass-whuppin
Chop the bitch up

Caught up in this foul mix-up
Tore wide open, bitch'll need a major stitch-up
Dig a ditch up where no blood-hound'll sniff up

(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, bury that bitch, don't leave a scent for dogs to pick up

(Rampage)
Oh shit, yo I hear somebody coming 
>From the upstairs bathroom where I hear the water running

Fuck that! There the motherfucker go right there
I want a morgue for him, make that nigga's crew pall-bear
Yo let me lift him

Wait, before that, let me go kiss him

Put five in his head and wrap him in the bedspread
Fled from the scenery without nobody seeing me

A lot of brothers don't like me
Screw me when the site me
Pop a lot of shit, but they scared to death to fight me
See me on the stage wit Bust on some rap shit
They see me in the club wit Bust on some lap shit
Befrore this rap shit, it was the corner crack shit
But now i'm on the world on some autograph shit
Spliff-a-Spliff drop the 4 5th round the waiste
So if you want war, let me deal with the case
Ain't nothin to it, brother i got the heart to do it
Blast in, cover the sidewalk wit ya fluid
Ya niggas stupid, ya got brains, brother use it
Ain't nithin gonna stop my black ass, from gettin cash
On the real, that's how deeply i feel
A born again hooligan, hungry for this meal
Got the iced- out platinum rings that you want to steal
Come get it, watch ya whole shit get wetted
Street colonel cat, got enough cats to set it
So if you ain't doin shit , ya niggas need to dead it
Watchin my money, it cost bullets in ya tummy
It's all ral here, there ain't no fear here
You mess around here, you catch ya death here
I mean it, you could front, but you believe it
Nigga guard your life before i turn around and steal it
Look into my eyes and analyze what you deal wit
If I can't find you, I take it out on who you be wit
Type of bitch nigga i would never smoke a tree wit

Nowadays we blow like smoke out the exhaust
Contamenatin smoke still makin me cough
I mean we bout to turn this wak shit off
Wak niggas is sick wit the flu sippin chicken broth
Now here's another winnin ripoff
Gettin money, eatin fine cuisine like buttered shrimp and rice pilaf
Stay heavily armed, Alakun Salom
Watch you bitch ass suffer til you got to beg for ya moms
Now turn the truck on, get ya fuck on, got you stuck on
Stupid right between yo legs, get yo suck on
drink bottles, treat niggas like Gus D'Amoto
Eat avacado, soon to go purchase a white Diablo
Niggas know my motto, lets get money, Macho Camacho
Applaud another rapper, lets go collect the nacho
Oh shit, hope you don't slip, another murder commit
The episode comin on Teen Summit
Little corny nigga talk too quick, think he slick
Throwin a brick, yappin off, lyin on his dick
Too late, you'll be the type o' nigga that I love to hate
Brutally bust ya shit like a nigga turned primate
Time of the year, feel great, clean slate
Throw a nickle plate, property shoppin to but a landscape
How they say street niggas 'ill never have
Now we possess the 5S wit the cherry red Nav
Doin things like signin graffiti on autograph
Gettin so much money staff calculate the math
Laugh you know the half, eyin in the stash
Mediatin watch the wind blow the blunt ash
You had a blast , now how long you gonna last
Ice grillin for nothing, you make yoself ass
Brace yoself one more time, know what i mean dun
Violate cross the foul line, it be yo last one

Uh, straight off the bat
My squad is known across the map
When y'all niggas show love then we show you love back
y'all niggas want beef
Fuck it take it to the streets
y'all niggas gon chill
Then we sit down and we build
My squad finally here
Unit of the year
We settin up shop and we ain't going nowhere
We want it all
Even if we gotta brawl for it
We want it all
Even if you gotta fall for it
We stage wreckers
Fifty-two car deckers
Reppin to the world till the law come and get us
You jealous fellas
I'm puttin holes in vendettas
Twist your body
With two shells from a shottie POW!

[Baby Sham]
Niggas want to get me touched
(Naw they can't touch you)
Shinin and flossin too much
(Naw they can't cross you)
Light on my toes
Left him ten feet
Part from his heat
Play it softly
The truth speaks through this poetry
For me to call shot
Cock block my life
Add a little spice
Devil eyes snake rise on dice
Have your fam call christ
Flipmode battle for mics
All my shit be high priced
I'm slashing dikes
Feel me
Liftin thugs out they crease it's quickly
Shift two keys in two weeks
And gross forty g's
Report me
And live shortly
Slouch cat livin off calibil breeze
You want to get involved
Better grip on tight
Take the next flight
We got it locked on the next bike

[Rampage]
Check it out
I got the eye of a tiger
That's plan to go higher
My squad is on fire
And till death do us
If the label want to sue us
Yo I'm taking the reels
I'm the man with the gat that be ready to peel
I'm the one next to Spliff when it's time to ill
I'ma show by astro red cross and blue shields
Watch us make a move
Catch us on smokin groove
Rules house of blues
MTV News
On the bus with my Flipmode loco (loco)
Takin flicks
Hittin chicks by the dozen (dozen)
Keep a shot runnin
Now I'm on a journey
It take you twenty light years to burn me (burn me)
If you want beef call my attorney
All that other wack shit don't concern me
I'm being felt
I got a title under my belt
I'm out to get the wealth
I'm bout my squad and myself

CHORUS

[Rah Digga]
Uhh
Comin correct for all my Flipmode brothers
Stats ratin higher then that of single mothers
Peace to my Outz clique
Bitches that I bounce with
Everybody else get the gas like Auschwitz
Like, flows for real like a rap bitch should
Type takin niggas out like they packaged goods
Rappers want to contest
They buggin
Straight up and down we run the underground like H. Tubman
What, I'm the bomb bitch
nigga RAH
D-I-G got Rah
God be my
Witness
Long as I walk this globe
I be spittin more verses than the Book of Job

[Busta Rhymes]
Why are you ignoring us
Running into hiding and avoiding us
Niggas on the low be recording us
My rhyme flow remain poisonous
Thus
Yo your shit sound wack still annoying us
We alive nigga ain't no destroying us
You better off if you come join with us
Perpendicular
Or analyzing my whole molecular
In particular
Roll with my squad or go singular
I ain't into bitches who fuck animals like caligula
More hot shit so get your water sprinkler
Fire extinguisher
Rhyme prime minister
C'MON!
Never mistake me for nobody else
Another blast make you shit on yourself
I hope all y'all know that I always master the art
Rip you apart
Put your hand on my heart
Flipmode number one on the charts
Solo or collective
My perspective the objective
Is to win
All praises due to my squad one in the same
Cherish every blessing I have to make y'all witness my name
Burn another calorie
Come inside my galaxy
Put your money where your mouth is double your salary
Hey dude you know we stay rude high on a aquelude
Bust your shit bouncin in a Honda Prelude
Let's G off
Nigga ease off
I make you breeze off
Brickfull make you rip your jeans off

CHORUS",To My People,1998
Busta Rhymes,"Yeah, where you think you goin'. Where you think you goin'.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the unit for the 9-8.
Flipmode Squad baby. That's my word.
All you sucker MC's, try to hide this stuff. Come back here.
Where you think you goin', nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein' Jack. Shit !!!

Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin' hertz.
Freestylin' of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin' my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes"".
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin' me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin' yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin', hopin' you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You want to switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin' with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin' it up.

Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama, bullpen personna
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama
Take the cash you gave me and buy marijuana
Check me boy, in some turbo (?)
Back in the days I bubble drugs like a sauna
Make a pussy boy kill himself like Nirvana
Get 'em like goose feathers, cold weather rock the bamma
Lie in front of the jury, D.A., and Your Honor
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas
Play for keeps niggas, ain't nothin 'bout me sweet, niggas
I stay token, gun butt your skull open
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin'?

[Chorus]
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Aiiyo, what you movin for.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'.
Where you think you goin'
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin'.

You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin'. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin', another nigga missin'.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Caught in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin'.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin'.
Enslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin' sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin' son ?
We gon' catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin' you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin' of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.
Where you think you're goin'.
Pocket stay throwin'. Smooth like the lowin'.
Rap chick flowin'.
Where you think you're goin.

[Chorus]

I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin' snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode moneymaker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin'.
People want to know when the album droppin'.
Start talkin'. Keep walkin'.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.
Now we coppin' platinum things.
Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.
Ramp's the rugged MC.
My squad keeps growin.
Where you think you goin.'

Chief gunnin' to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.
Now low muscles moves.
Smash crew like statue with jungle jewels.
Son gets school, wit the dummin' crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Oh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you 'cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn
Like James Evans when I'm blowin'.
Fuck is wrong wit cha.
Where you think you're goin'.
Where you think you're goin'.
Where you think you're goin'.

[Chorus]",Where You Think You Goin',1998
Busta Rhymes,"One two, one two
One one, one two one two
Yo it's the Q-Tip, you know I get down
Yes I rock to the rhythm of a funky sound
It go
One one, one two one two

And it's the, Phife Dawg, and I do the same
And when it comes to ripping mics hey yo it ain't no games
One one, one two one two

Hey yo you know it's Busta Rhymes, ev-ery time
Oh yes, I'm coming wicked with the new design
I'm saying
One one, one two one two

MC's ain't coming equipped with the rhymes
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time
The time is eternal when you play with the miser
Soul is in my body, and the health make me wiser
The tantalizing wordplay yeah that's the joint
Sometimes I have to cuss just to prove my damn point
Brothers need to come, with better, compositions
I write and recite to make good position
In this, rap game here, we engineer
Stabbing up the jam yeah son shit's clear
And I be kicking rhymes in my own damn way
Beating niggas to the punch like Sugar Ray
Got the cool-ass style, that's cooler than the cool
My lyrics is the bullet and the mic is the tool
Peace to C-Seventy-Three, and C-Seventy-Fo'
Do a little something when I'm out on tour
Coming through like narcotics for the antibiotics
Flapping shorty's stockings to the Space-like Sprockets
What you really need to do is just boogie your ass
It's not gassed, we got to make the good times last
Let the good times roll, cause we in control
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll
Let the good times roll, let the good times toll
Take you out on your high less you paying a toll

Question Why is that, MC's be wack
And major labels wanna sound like crap, hey yo Funk that!
Word to life I'm coming rugged
Cuz once you add the hip to the hop kid, it equals out to love
If the beat's fat I use it, some wack shit, I lose it
Refuse it, how could you chose it, it stinks Refuse it
Put down the mic kid, cuz you gets no dap
How long did it take for you to see you can't rap
The name is Phife Dawg, and I got nuff styles
It doesn't take long for me to get buckwild
So bust what I'm swinging what I'm swingin when I swing
I rap when I rap cause I never wanna sing
Go ask the last MC what happened when he said battle
I bust his ass in Cleveland now he's Sleepless in Seattle
Rude boy official coming with the ill grammar
Coming back on kids, like Joey Montana
We be the three MC's to make your mind go batty
Mad play, on WKRP in Cincinnati
So lord send a hon, if ya kyant send a han sen a man
An if ya kyan sen a man, come yaself
Cause all deez biting MC's, lawd them something else
See I kick the styles that'll make ya ass melt
Money on my mind so never mind a trick
New York is the town and the team is the Knicks
World's greatest five footer ripping parties apart
Here comes Shaheed with the big green shark
Never had to rhyme about feelin what with lead
NEVER MIND DAT MON HERE COME DE DREAD

We coming far far far
Busta Rhymes is coming far far far
Ya know ya hear me Star! Bet your bottom dollah
Right after this jam about one million one two niggaz go follow
Whether it be to-day or to-morrow
Niggas be collaborating sickening you beat them like they father
Oh shit check out what I saying
You know my niggas don't be playing
Once upon a hacking time
I received the opportunities to represent my first rhymes
To define, lyrical sensations
Black masons blowing up the spot Just to represent the Nations
Three dimensions, tryclops,
Mr. Busta Rhymes three eyes
Fat like a burger and fries
Go back to the country to go check my grandmama
Bring it to the table at the meetings
Gathering large receivings delivering intellectual ass beatings
As I carry on with my proceedings
Greetings!! Watch a nigga debut on premier movie screenings
But before I be face to face
With my eternal resting place
I hope you find civilized every soul and every race
Sit dog sit! Busta Rhymes forever on that ultrasonic shit!",One Two S**t [*],1998
Busta Rhymes,"You know I plas-ter, the little bas-tard
And mastered the real way you slap the bitchest niggas backwards
Hah! Uh-oh, aiyyo, whenever Busta Rhymes say so (mmmhmm)
When we move yes (mmmhmm) sometimes we lay low (mmmhmm) aiyyo (yo)
Big up my little nigga Pedro
Make you after the L like turkey, cheese and to-ma-to (to)
Fuck is that? Especially for niggas that will pay no
Attention to instructions, like they still wan' disobey y'all
Wonder twin powers activate real quick
But then I could grow about five feet more with an extra dick!
One dick to hold in my hand when I'm rockin the mic
The extra dick to blow up the pussy for the rest of the night
Then I return with more lyrics like a bunch of rough niggas
They tough niggas that snuff niggas (hah)
I know the club got enough niggas (huh!)
To slap your face, expert, who the next jerk, to make me
Exert heat? FUKKIT, let me network!

Ha-hah!
Yo Reggie Noble
Feel me, yo Busta Bus

Yo Phife Dawg, yo it's time to step up

Yo what the fuck, ungh!

Girl swing yo' ass, I can feel you climaxin (climaxin)
Don't even front, you know you wanna make it happen (make it happen!)
Yo Busta Bus, do you hear Violator faxin? (mad faxin)
Eighty G's for one show (eighty G's yo) that's satisfaction (satisfaction)
Now which emcee feel like he fuckin with dis heah? (This here)
Word to Queens, I keep shit hot like a canish, yeah (Nish yeah!)
Malik is back, I'm here to make you look foolish (foolish)
My roughest niggas in the Apple (Apple) on Coolidge (Coolidge)
Remember White Shadow? My click stay sharper than an arrow (c'mon)
Plus in Trinidad I'm treated like the Mighty Sparrow (uh-huh)
Freestylin son, like there was no tommorrow (fuck it up nigga fuck it up)
Hence the reason why your bitch ass would love to follow (what?)
Two different toasters in your chest will make your shit hollow
How's about them apples, oh is it too hard to swallow?
Push your wig back, word to Big Moot and Bolo
Billy Razor, Fudge Lover, on down to Shine Lightro (Love Movement)
Yo Bootsy takes this mic from this fool see, make him run it
Five-foot invasion son, you can't run from it

Yo Reggie Noble
Blaoowww, yo Phife diggy!
What up?
Yo yo Kamal it's your time to step up!

Check it out, the original, shit, we makin it
Takin it, to the extremes, we breakin it
When we get, inside a zone then you feel that it's good
All you jelly cats stop marinatin my wood
Niggazm grab the mic with loads of malarky
I bring the knowledge and wield the anarchy
Put it on pooh-butts who's unsettled with ignorance
Give the last sentence with poignance and diligence
Eighteen wheelin through niggas like truckers
Breakin ankles, put it on like we at the ruckus
Guaranteein that shorty can move it around
In the place that gets you hot but leaves you here on the ground
Contenders don't you even think to challenge the crown
Of these brothers who so elequently hold the beat down
Fuck the rigamarole, we vyin for the control
We the musical equation of the whole entire nation

Yo Phife Dawg
Yes Kamaal
Busta Bus
What up?
Yo Reggie Noble yo it's time to step up

Yo yo
I'm just a ill nigga who don't got it all up stairs
Riding dick, get the balls til they come in pairs
Oh yeah, throw the goggles on these engineers
Cause it might, get kinda wet when I spit this here
Yo, I'm six-foot-one with a big ass gun
To carry it you'd need a waistline the size of Big Pun
But I move crowds without a gun
Like if -- The New York State Lottery is ninety nine million!
Hah-hah, yo, when it's time to flow I suprise and blow
Five hundred thousand units off a dime a trow
Forty below, I'm thorough when it's time to throw
The caboose, I'm even hard to be touched by a masousse
Whoo-whoo! Funk Doc gets the money
And best believe I went through more trees than Sonny
Me, Kamal, Busta Bus, Phife Dawg
Shittin, pussy niggas get Lysol!
