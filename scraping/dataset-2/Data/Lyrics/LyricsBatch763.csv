Napalm Death,"Abstinence works for me, not for them.
Intolerance, far worse things ?
This makes no sense.

Get high on me and mine
Take the poison.

Raise a voice ? the art of making noise
Attacking stance ?
Fist in face for personal choice

So whithers ? self, self, self
Take the poison.

Two polluting lifestyle doctrines in defence
Re-access the threats to well bring
Re-direct
And clear your heads

Dialogue (is) a powerful drug ?
(Not) a verbal poison.

Abstinence works for me, not for them.
Intolerance, far worse things ?

Take the poison.",Take the Poison,2005
Napalm Death,"Blindness feeds the world to madness 
Faith's crumbling, there's no doubt about it 
Religion and science fighting a new kind of war 

Helpless wander the streets in desperation 
Fearless to the path they tread 
Shameless the powers that butcher 
Ignorant to the deeds that they commit 

When all is said and done 
Heaven lies in my heart 
No slave to beliefs that propagate pain 
When all is said and done 
Heaven lies in our hearts 
This life is a gift to be lived and loved 

Fracturing the structure of nature 
Iconic catalysts to slaughter 
A stalemate bursting bound by contradictions 

Heartless divine blueprints of hatred 
Selfless Diseased master plans 
Shameless the powers that butcher 
Ignorant to the deeds that they commit 

Decoded treachery shielding the tyranny 
Black Bible tyrants behind masks of righteousness 
Relentless the onslaught of misunderstanding 
Descending into a unified chaos 

One more chance for a shot at redemption 
Lost within, can we summon the might?",When All Is Said and Done,2006
Napalm Death,"Lowpoint

Banish the emotion
Severing the ties
Mutual aggressions
Multiply unwind

Reason lost is reason gained
Reluctance seeping through the rage
Acceptance changing on all fronts
Phase me out, I've reached my lowpoint

Tarnished with the motion
Voids in which we hide
Excuse pales from pressure
Desperate thoughts collide

Reason lost is reason gained
Reluctance seeping through the rage
Acceptance changing on all fronts
Phase me out, I've reached my lowpoint

Confessions, protection, the facts distort
Frenetic, eccentric acts are caught

Phase me out, phase me out

Relentless, contagion, a single choice
Dissecting, mutating, the single voice

Phase me out, phase me out

Banish the emotion
Severing the ties
Mutual aggressions
Multiply unwind

Tarnished with the motion
Voids in which we hide

Peace to freed jail cats come home, now they cop ranges 
Hand to hand shoot outs with mack, new on the block stranger 
Caught up in VA, New York language 
Miami niggas had these projects locked till the knox raided 
Holdin ball, paint job, the top flavor 
What up my nigga? Rock the gold teeth grill, bally some dark suede gear 
Twenty dollar bill mixed with speed ball 
Teen team burn, finger firey red, makin the king fall

[Napoleon talking]
All you fag niggaz gotta move on
(get the fuck out the way)
I kick up dust for real, nigga
fuck this rap shit nigga
you want to see me, see me nigga
Nigga I'm the nigga to see
Punk ass mutha-fucka
Don't get your pockets pulled nigga

(check it out uh-uh)
Hold the fuck up nigga why you lookin so tough
You don't know that I'm an outlaw and I'll fuck you up
Punk nigga, the street change everyday,
But I'ma change a long will 'cause the streets where I lay
Nowadays it ain't about runnin your mouth
It's bout (gun cocked) and (gunshots); assed out
Turnin me out nigga, I turn the streets out
With this underground thug shit that killers come out
Where the gunz be at, where the money be at
I stand full, nothin but the uncut shit I'm hardcore
And ain't nothing changed since back in the day
Just new money frays and new hand grenades
When the war pops off I'ma knock the street lights off
y'all some paper back soldierz nigga you too soft
And killin in my raps I'm too real for that
But if I say I'ma do it, if you say you have too, prove it to me

[chorus]
It ain't nothin but a freshin to me
And if ya fuckin with me,
Then you can die if you want to nigga
And all my life I had issues with me
you try trippin with me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
The street made a slight killah for me
And if you soft too me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
You act tough
And you can die if you want to nigga
You in a rush
And you can die if you want to nigga

I'm a street nigga, check my background
I did a couple of driveby's with the fo-pound
And I was never ever scared to bust a couple of rounds
It's all in me, my whole family was raised wrong
Nigga, my whole team strong, buck buck, double glock dead wrong
And imitatin Pac nigga, you know you wrong
And runnin your mouth will get a gun in your house
There is money down south so I gotta take some
There is money on the west coast I gotta chase some
There is money on the east coast I gotta take some
So I bought me a gun, I'm bout to rob everyone
It's like a 2000 jack the rapper, fall down
Empty down your pockets nigga and pass it around
And what was you thinkin when Pac was around
He wasn't trainin Outlawz to burn shit down
I strategize for the dough dough, cock block with the fo-fo
send four more at the po-po, his whole ass like Zorro
it's real nigga so I'ma bleed for mine
with money on my mind I'ma get it, it's mines nigga

[chorus]
It ain't nothin but a freshin to me
And if ya fuckin with me,
Then you can die if you want to nigga
And all my life I had issues with me
you try trippin with me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
The street made a slight killah for me
And if you soft too me
Then you can die if you want to nigga
You act tough
And you can die if you want to nigga
You in a rush

We want the fame
C'mon (C'mon) 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors 
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher 
Fortune and fame 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Searching for fortune and fame 
Lost in the rain 
A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it 

One thing we all adore

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for

Acting like a hoe

I don't know why I'll be fucking with you

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know

Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game

Why you keep actin' like a hoe? but there you go

I'm like, damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time

Except for her sister, who was hateful and spiteful

This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir

A head full of daydreams, his hands full of material
She says it`s nothing, he`s messing up her hair
And still he looks so neat

So the best man will do his best again
Now they`re getting dressed again

Sneaking out of the bridal suite

This casual acquaintance led to an intimate bonsoir
We know who you`re with and where you are

When your true lover comes your way
It's cherry pink and apple blossom white
The poets say

The story goes that once a cherry tree
Beside an apple tree did grow
And there a boy once met his bride to be
Long long ago

The boy looked into her eyes, it was a sight to enthrall
The breezes joined in their sighs, the blossoms started to fall
And as they gently carressed, the lovers looked up to find
The branches of the two trees were intertwined,

And that is why the poets always write
If there's a new moon bright above

Solo por tenerte a ti.

Las palabras de mama,
Pero como la queria,
Nunca la quise escuchar.

Que no confiara en ti
Que tu amor no era sincero
Y por ti mi pobre vieja
Se murio de sufrimiento

Aunque hoy me pase a mi
Esto le pasa a cualquiera
Creo que no soy el primero
Que una mujer engaño
Tu fuiste pa' Nueva York
Con tu visa de paseo
Pero pasaron los dias,
Semanas, meses y años
Y yo aqui en Santo Domingo
Quede, tu amor esperando
Hasta ayer que me contaron
Que con otro te has casado

Le di una copa de vino
Me dijo vente a mi mesa
Y yo, le dije vente conmigo

Subimos, a un viejo cuarte los dos
Hasta el alma nos quisimos
Me acompano hasta mi barco
Le di como recuerdo mi anillo

Volvere, volvere
Por que te quiero, hasta tu puerto volvere
Volvere, volvere
Seras mi estrella
Si tu me esperas volvere

No he vuelto por la taberna
Por mi, pregunta a los marineros
Se sienta frente a la puerta y alli
Suspiras por mis requerdos

Si algunos le dan una copa se va
Porque le ensenas mi anillo
Es una promesa rota es ya

I was born hard in the paint where the stars hang out
Just to find out that what they buy ain't bought
And then I found me, stunt and go the same route
I do this for the love, you can throw the fame out
A tear still a tear, even when I change house
And I am hip-hop, even when I claim south
What'chu think we all look the same, game is bad
Cause now we all fightin' for the same damn spot

And I ain't talkin' bout no fancy mansion or no yacht
Just a quarter pound of pot on my forty acre lot
Wit my Caddy coupe and drop, and a Range Rover spot
I mean sport, sometimes I lose my train of thought
But I'm back again and promise that every track is hot
We gon' hit some traffic headed to the top
So we gon' take another route and simply creep right past the cops
And the haters man, they comin' for my spot

Fresh out the skillet, never feel it or you're not
We gon' verti-cal grille it, watch me sell it on the block

Can't let they friends know they not doin good
See you lay low, and focus on ya kids
Hope somebody remember somethin' that ya did

Yeah
And if they did, then you gon' trip
Grind for seven days a week, and then you watch it flip
Legit is wicked clean, that's how it seems that the chips
Gotta dig a little deep, you wanna see about the grit
The grass gets mighty green by the fence
Which side is the question? I'm headed that direction
Knowledge is the weapon, and I use it for protection
If you think I'm really slippin', then run up and learn ya lesson

Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared up, but what was we afraid for?

Flipped the 25 to 50 cent, now watch the bitch triple
Game simple, ya here today, tomorrow ya ain't
Now who the hell gon' save it right
That ain't gon' change the way you think
I took a buck fifty, ballin on a budget, bought a Dutch
Quickly spilled it and I stuffed it with that chunky from Kentucky

It was a ho-down, another ho-down

Walked into the club and farted
Damn! Look at shawty off in the cut actin' naughty
Eye contact, made sure that she saw me
Said y'all, don't get it twisted like I'm ballin'

Down south stripper from New Orleans, thick as mud
Baby show me love, with a little tittie rub
Said, ""Hit me later on baby, maybe we can what?""
Said, ""Sound like a plan"" wit my hand on her butt

But shit hit the fan sho' nuff, nigga hold up
Baby doll had a man, matta fact was a soldier
Ain't that a beyotch! He was sittin' on the sofa
Smokin' on some doja, tryna see some exposure

Had the whole spot sold up, legs tired
Bar done closed up, all of a sudden her man showed up
Automobiles, planes, and locomotives
Train with the focus see both ran through hunger

Tag-teamed that beyotch, then I called my niggaz over
They smashed in the 'Lac, popped that twat like a soda
Fuckin' with his wife so you know when I ain't sober
And niggaz in the back seat with the freak in the Nova, it was a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

Uh, now peep game of a star, stepped out the car
Walked through the door, checked the bitch at the bar
Eyin' her down, while I split my cigar
Can I offer you a drink or some dick in the park?

You know I'm just sayin' that to get you mad
But you knowin' damn well I wanna hit yo' ass
Yo I ain't the type of nigga that be jumpin' the gun
But you lookin' like a dime piece and I'm huntin'' for one

What's ya name? Nah, better yet, what's ya game?
Wanna ride in the Navigator, switchin' four lanes?
Or chill up in the bedroom, sniffin' cocaine?
Said she's the type of girl to get down with no shame

And everything I said before was no thang
We ran outside, and jumped in the ride
Next thing I know I'm gettin' head while I drive
Eyes open wide, down 65, it's a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

It was a ho-down, I knew it was all great
When the hoe caught me late in room 508
Oh, she got live on tape, the price was low-rate
Plus she had a nice showcase, you thought she was ya soul mate?

Just because she got some shove in her can
Doesn't mean your 'sposed to go and fall in love with her man
Kissin' and huggin' and actin', in love with her, man
Takin' her out to restaurants and, rubbin' her hands

If you knew what I knew, you wouldn't do what you do
But it's true that you, had no clue what she do
'Cuz you trust her through thick and thin
You missed it when, she was gettin' live offa fifth of Gin

Get rammed in by me, while she lick my friends
When she finally came home you probably kissed her then, lame-o
The more you tried to claim the hoe was an angel
The quicker I realized the freak was a stank-hoe, it was a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew
You would be down in there too, it was a ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

I can't believe that she's real, it was a ho-down
The way she makes me feel, another ho-down
If you knew what I knew, it was a ho-down
You would be down in there too, another ho-down

We take the back road off in Glasgow, we can travel it with no hassle
Shoot through Roscoe, back in A-Town like a king off in his castle

Pound of weed, a couple of freaks, and a gun in it
City slick if you want, but us; we be slumming it

Simple life back to its hardest again
Farmer in the dell, I'll be damned it's harvest again
Get it in, get it in, hey boy, cook it and eat it
Hit the bar for relaxation and a BAG of cheeba
Planes to catch, shows to do, reps to lose
Lots of game, nothing to lose, paying the dues
Tryna get ours, winning to lose
Brought in the game, then we was applied to the rules, whoo!

[Skinny DeVille]
Back to the field with hustlers, take anything and make work
We catch ya slipping, we just might get up and truck and take yours

Take only what you make first, bump to wake the neighbors

The rooster crowed so I know it was time for me to awaken 
Country living, and the country cooking in a country kitchen
Good intention and strong religion, it's a strong tradition
Kicked to mud off my boots and dust off my pants and
Just came from the ranch but they swear we was ?

Finna mail off my stamps and we'll be grilling
Step off of this Kentucky Mud

Aye man, I wonder what's gon' happen the minute my cash get dropped
You ever thought about that Skinny? Nope?
Shit what about you Scales mayne? I'm-I'm unsure mayne
I got alotta, lotta question that need to be answered
True we all got questions, but dawg I got questions
I got a lot on my mind, just just
Just get me a blunt man, just fire it up man
Man...

[Big V]
Now fire up the weed, 'cause one day I'm gon' pro'ly burn
The Ten Commandments in life, never my concern
Thing on my mind was, ""get 'em, fore they get you""
Thing on my mind was, ""stick 'em fore they stick you""

That's why niggaz know, I'm bout the game before peace
'Cause being free-hearted that's where it leave you deceased
Cold world, cold game - they gon' split ya thang
And bang shit out the car what, would drive the average man insane

Ghetto love, ghetto life, ghetto death; then ya gone
And after I'm deceased I'll know life gon' go on
And what about my sons - will they do what daddy didn't finish?
Will the light come to a close, shortly after my decision?

What about daddy girl? Will she do what I wanted?
Or will she break my heart and let these, niggaz up on it?

I'm on the verge of losin my mind, this (?) is my last nerve
I done served my last dime, standin on this crack curb
It's absurd - I been on this block, from the first to the third
Rocked a 'Bird and seen two niggaz shot and left for dead in the dirt

I'm concerned if I die by the glock, will my soul soon burn?
My past clash with my future then, take a drastic turn
I'm submerged knee-deep in this here, but those around can soon return
Morality's hotter than burn, makin they hearts they burn

And say ""Fuck the world!""
We all going to Hell for some, shit that we deserve
But first we was promised a hearse
And a chance on earth to visit church, for what it's worth

I'm tryna make ammends for all the sins that occurred
The uncontrollable urge that emerged when I, snatched that lady's purse
And the, last week that I slurred, when I, cursed on every verse
Inevitable but well rehearsed, freezin my hunger as well as my thirst

This glock; ready to burst, on any fools I encounter first
With the, maximum amount of force, even if, worst comes to worst
'cause life's a bitch!

Welcome to the world - I did 12 months for this shit?
Moms and pops couldn't get along - older brothers gettin grown
Now I got nothin but this dice I'm sittin on

At night I'm closin my eyes, and thinkin about my folks that died
Tryna sleep on 'em, thinkin I ain't supposed to cry
Uncle (?); he just died from too much alcohol
And all he wanted was a fifth and pack of Paul Mall

And moms was hard gettin back, grew up on (?)
I'm tryna cut down on drinkin but that's a lost cause
Guess we don't learn our lesson until we all fall
These racist cops got niggaz writin they own laws

Please God, don't let 'em take us
Just tell momma I meant well, in time don't let me wake up
Please God! Don't let them folks take us

See I'm a dying breed, a country-fried emcee
I used to rhyme for free, but now I rhyme for cheese
See it was bound to be, when there's mouths to feed
And there's bills to pay, somethin gotta give way
The way I feel today, I could care less
'cause my mind is made, yeah my hair's a mess
I don't bother to shave, I walk around bare chest

There was a couple of things poppa put in my head
Never; sit down when ya need to stand
Never; drink down all ya dreams and plans
Poppa, what's that inside ya glass?
""Don't do as I do boy, do as I ask""
See ah - do it right if ya gon' do it that fast
And - don't do it if ya gon' do it half-assed
Well, since then I been an over-achiever
Smoker and drinker, only I would opened my blinkers
And I'm broke, so I guess I gotta choke on my finger
'cause I need to come up, ah I'm just a dreamer
A hustle schemer, these cops be corrupt like Rupp Arena
Try an bust my weiner, with these court subpeonas - petty misdemeanors

Get a dutch, jump the gultch, then stuff it with straw
Get higher than a motherfucker, deep in the call
Hit the liquor sto', makin mo', fifth and I pause
Get love tryna cut, got ya dick and balls
Awww, hell naw then broads at the wall
Big pimpin on a budget, tryna make it the mall
Thank the Lord, for just livin, makin the most
'Scuse me, anybody got change I can borrow?

Nobody never gave us nothin but tough time and made us somethin 
Different stretch of road, new somethin to see 
Every state on the map, a different somethin to eat 
Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin for real 
Everybody makin a killin man, showin no feelins 
Walkin off collectin pay, it's the way of the world 
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world 
Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world?

I'm thankful for the chance I got to say amen

We represent the slums, where we from, we feel they bump 
Polish shot off on these presidents, and hardtimes they go and come 
Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all 
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin this call 
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong 
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long 
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin me, ""Daddy be strong"" 
We gon' make it through these hardtimes 
Even though they go and they come 
Ya absolutely right, for somethin happen to me on last Tuesday night 
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade 
Naw brave any order but confoldure 
Better make it home when nothin seems to matter 
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way 
They got me fooled, see the Henny with the J 
Front porch, chillin broke, country folk, I'm Nappy with my ways yo

Ya gotta take responsibility for ya own man

I love to hear my woman moanin, it's on again 
Damn I hope you play this song again 
The soul cleansin, the melody just read my end 
Not a lot of things but usually just appendin my lady 
Been searchin bendin and saw my folks locked in the tennants 
And it don't make any sense (why) children and sentencin 
Broadcastin from the slums, that's why I'm writin these sentences

Let a player cut somethin *scratching*

Now it's on anything that got drunk
Skully took it strong to the brain, and I'm
Talkin dirty to this broad, ""where yo' mayne?""
Think about it, till early in the mo'nin, bout 7:30

Get it on with the Philly, light the blunt and hell it's on
If ya tryna hit me, then hit me on my cella-phone
Really homes, take a hunnie with the silicone
Tighter than an S-Type sittin right on plenty chrome

Done heard my momma cryin if I knew what I know now
I'd pro'ly have to greet the party room with the fo' pound
I'm tryna keep my head on straight to keep me from catchin

Now if the world was my oyster
Baby girl everyday could be red lobster 
And you would be draped in pearls
But it's not read the front page herald we need help 
Sometime I wish I could save the world 
Till death I wonder if there's any heroes left 
Quiet is kept won't hold my breath 
Land of the slaves, home of the graves
Of war aids, young aids, gone crazed 
These military ways in a flak scene

Love and basketball
Blood and alcohol 
Cryin' my eyes out 
As I watch the tower fall 
Nowhere is safe, comfort is a coffin man
Lookin' out the window duckin' and crawlin' man 
Daddy your son is callin' man 
Look at this broken man 
With broken plans 
Thankfull as hell we holdin' hands
Now I'm feelin' love used to livin' it up
Not givin' a fuck, livin's enough

You got to stand for something
How about some hardcore
Save the world 
Around the globe in ninety days 
Hell on earth they say its nintey-nine ways
To meet your maker, dare the devil and I bet you be brave 
It's just a phase 
Like in puberty at school to be crazed 
I got the classroom bully on my list to behave 
And if he can't then I'ma show him what it means to be saved 
I'm just a nerd on my last straw 
Bout ten of this my last call 
My self esteem extended like this planet bout to blast off 
Three- two-one 
Feel the black planet 
I'm like damn is that granite 
That I could be a rapper, a hobo, or some mechanic 
That I could be a failure, in fact that's how I planned it 
'Cause I could never say the whole world is too demanding 
And I could never video shoes I couldn't handle it 
So what if I tried to just do scales and not dibs 
And I settled every god in the crib until then
Just prepared for this war to begin so you could stand up

You got to stand for something
(so you can stand up)
You got to stand for something
(understand)
You got to stand for something
(but nothing)

Mentally still they whippin' us 
Thirty lashes 
Ain't no love, ain't no sympathy 
Them dirty bastards 
Be washin' our brains with chemicals 
Insubliminal leaving our sight impaired
But its right there 
In plain view claim you 
Pack a pistol already but the missiles are already aimed to shoot 
One push of a button and this whole ****** game is through 
All of a sudden there's mushroom clouds 
Evacuate the crowd 
It's too late, it contaminates the (?) 
The symptoms are maliable contagious 
Without protection its infecting all ages 
Soon your body's going through stages

We came in the game, plain ya see 
Average man when the rest was ashamed to be 
Nappy head and all, ain't no changin me 
Ooh-oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh... 
So rough it was, downright wrong I tell ya 
Nobody never gave us nothin but tough time and made us somethin 
Different stretch of road, new somethin to see 
Every state on the map, a different somethin to eat 
Daps and handshakes, it meant nuttin for real 
Everybody makin a killin man, showin no feelins 
Walkin off collectin pay, it's the way of the world 
Can't change it, so I guess I'm gon' pray for the world 
Sometimes I ask myself, was I made for the world? 
I scream this to you, and I say it to the world 
Nappy then, Nappy now - Nappy for a bit 
Knee-deep, head over heels in this country shit! 

[Chorus] 

[Skinny DeVille] 
Even though I picture better days, 
I'm thankful for the chance I got to say amen 
The Lord done blessed me with his grace, I wish this day would never end 
We represent the slums, where we from, we feel they bump 
Polish shot off on these presidents, and hardtimes they go and come 
Some take up off, without the chance, to make it at all 
Who woulda thought Skinny'd be the one that's, makin this call 
Lord, help me out, tell me where I went wrong 
I'm tryna find a righteous path, although it's, never been long 
I gotta do it for my sons, they tellin me, ""Daddy be strong"" 
We gon' make it through these hardtimes 
Even though they go and they come 
Ya absolutely right, for somethin happen to me on last Tuesday night 
It's plain as day, man they... with this World Trade 
Naw brave any order but confoldure 
Better make it home when nothin seems to matter 
That's when, see, everything can go - any which way 
They got me fooled, see the Henny with the J 
Front porch, chillin broke, country folk, I'm Nappy with my ways yo 

[Chorus]

It's a blessin we woke up this mornin 
All my colored folk stressin, come let's join hands 
Got the folk with depresses of being po' man 
Poppa taught me an order, survive for no man 
Nappy got some for we gon' stand 
Prophit grew from a juvenile to a grown man 
Ya gotta take responsibility for ya own man 
Zonin, two blunts a mornin, by sunrise sometimes 
I love to hear my woman moanin, it's on again 
Damn I hope you play this song again 
The soul cleansin, the melody just read my end 
Not a lot of things but usually just appendin my lady 
Been searchin bendin and saw my folks locked in the tennants 
And it don't make any sense (why) children and sentencin 
Broadcastin from the slums, that's why I'm writin these sentences 
Just lower my income, (what) though we ain't finish it

Lets get it while this gettin good cause Granny ain't gon' live forever
Season changin, we like these dependin on the weather
Look what we doin, summer's ruined, fall y'all pack y'all sweater
Somebody told me war was comin, y'all just stack y'all cheddar, better
Checked my mail the other day and Sam done sent a letter
I opened it and line for line it said I was a sucka
The nerve of this motherfucker, claimin he's my uncle
Good God almighty, Lord have mercy, think that we's in trouble
Please send some help like quick, fast, do it on the double (9-1-1)

I burn shit once my lyric drop, one false move and you're stained
We're pushin 'em 10 dollars a pop and I got exact change
It's like investin in NASDAQ had me caught in the rain
I'm 'bout to pull the mask out and have 'em screamin in vain
And I be puttin them tracks out and it's all for the brain

It's Nappy bitch, what have to come
Pay attention, learn your lesson, yup

What you think that Nappy gon' be broke forever? Shit naw
Hit the bank and cashin in on old investments
What, you ain't know about them country fried sessions?
Does that Likwit hit in '97 +Answer+ all yo' +Questions+?
Kentucky's on the map now, who you think done gave directions?
From the top and back down, we rep the country to perfection
Don't it look so slum with 55 from New York down to Texas?

[Chorus]
[Verse 2 - Ron Clutch]
(Let me tell you about it)
When I first got my baby she could barely start
A-hand-me-down from a real O.G., all day she stayed in park
Almost never did she drive
Born in 1979
And she weighed about a ton
Big ol' body built to run
First thing I done, hauled her over, had her hummin G notes
Underneath her hood, hundreds of horses powered her ego
Her government name was Coup Deville but I called her Miss Piggy
Top her with some (?) and fit her for some twenties (twenties)
Playas hate that I be trickin like she's all that I'm love with
So we took her to the edge and shoved it and still ""Ball out on a Budget""
Dug in her guts, laced her up with leather and wood
Together it go good, us country boys forever stay hood

[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - B. Stille]
You shove that shit that go bump bump bump bump
And ya, shake the lock off her muh'fucker trunk
When ya, hit the block make her muh'fucker jump
Roll your window down, stop, look like somethin like a pimp
Roll that window back up, and show 'em they reflection and their ultrafade
Then chop on that sucka like Wesley's +Blade+
Escalade D.T.S., switch it up, keep them haters on they toes
Red Rolls, Fleetwood hoes
Can't believe it, when they see them twenty fo's, believe it
My ham and cheese the freshest
Now what I'm talkin bout? I give you three guesses

[Chorus]
[Verse 4 - Big V]
You feel the wind, don't ya?
You hear the tires squallin
Kentucky, Colorado, Boston down to New Orleans
Big bodies get it done, Dodge Ram preferably
Cause they do run run, they do run run
Black magic, lookin better then Wesson fryin a pan of fish
Gangsta leanin like they do in Los Angeles (that's gangsta)
Adjective, describin what I'm rollin in
Them country fellas ain't gon' stop it, we on the road again

God damn, yes I am, the thriller with the skrilla
Got plans, Pac fan +Strictly 4 my N.I.G.G.A.Z.+
Stop starin, we not playin
Armor color kryptonite
Rims nice but thank God our dreams came to life
Fast roller, cash swoll up

Grandma got me hollerin' damn
It's 6:30 live and callin', tellin' Prophet roll up
It's a trip to Sunset Strip and not we off to Oakland
Cal-I-forn-I-a got me caught up in the moment
I be back in like a couple of days is what I told my woman

Yo 'aight
Take me a second to breathe and let stress go
Walk out, grab my paper and wave next do'
Take me a shower, get dressed and do a quick pass
Say me a prayer 'fore I leave so I can get back
It's easy like Sunday mornings with a six pack
Monday I'm back on the road and I respect that
Gotta go break a little bread for some improvements
Gotta go share with the world this new movement
I'm gone

(Woo) That's what it felt like
Gut tight, last night, barely slept right
Just couldn't wait to get up this mornin'
Hugged the kids, kissed my woman
I love performin', she hate the tourin'
But daddy gotta go make that money, baby
Pray for me while I'm away and when I get paid
We can get carried away, is that OK baby

I told you how I made a dollar, out a dime and a nickel
Blue collar, gotta grind on instrumentals
See my, pencil and pad has me punchin' the clock
I put in, time and a half, skip lunch, I can't stop
I gotta start somethin'
Started with nothin' but hard at some hustlin'
Girl, I'm gettin' sick and tired of fussin'
I'm sorry, there's hardly enough time for lovin'
But baby you know the time is comin' (Yeah)

One drink at the bar, led to the dance flo'
She was lookin' at me, dancin so G, names no need
Felt the way that I was feelin'
Waffle house immediately, now we at the house chillin'
Back rub, I was tense, y'all know where it went
Patio in the rain, car hood, the kitchen sink
Layin' in the bed now, pillow talk all night
Gotta hit the studio, I'll be back tomorrow night

How many ladies in the mornin wake up lonely
Love rough sex, baby screamin ""Put it on me""
But when your man ain't around you call his homie
How many times I gotta be him nigga, owe me
I follow my lines and take your panties off slowly
Makin' it hot like Cash Money flashin Roleys
You tell me to stop but I'm rockin', steady growin'
If your man knock I'm on the job and not goin'

Nappy Roots,"Music, music, music
The blowin' of the wind
If you ever think about it you walk in the rhythm
The flap of a bird's wings, calms the savage beast
Your whole life is a beat
The cries of a baby
Soothes, the baby sleeps
The mirrors and expressions of your life
Emotion
Life is a song, a beat, a tempo
Christ our Savior, Adrenaline
Adjusted by a situation
Inspiration, that's music
And that's us
Here we go

Ya, that's what I'm talkin' about right there
You just can't get that, nowhere but this
Ya know what I'm sayin', this is classic shit
C'mon

Groove to the bass line, slap that snare drum
It's music to yo' eardrum, snap these back
We ain't goin' nowhere hon', keep on dancin'
From the mud to the mansion, imagine that
Back rubs, get the body oils, pass me that
Hot tubs, sit yo' ass in that
And only music this good, could make 'em act like that
So just do it
This is a classic track
It's like music

In the light, in the dark
In the soul, in ya heart
To the end, from the start
Good music

In the light, in the dark
In the soul, in ya heart
To the end, from the start
Good music

Aww man, I'm in the zone again, caught up in the whirlwind
And I'm, tryin' to make a decision before the whole damn world ends
When days turn into nights man and burn for twice as long
Cause when my pen brushes the pad with an art form that microphones
And every county 'cross the nation, every house and every basement
Hustlers on street corners live by a beat that's constantly changin'
The one thing stays basic, nappy roots ain't nothin' to play with
Every move is practicin' patience, perfectly pacin', how to stay blatant
My sole reason for existence is for all my folks to be a witness
To the movement of this music that this group put out for centuries
And has a life of it's own and it
Prob'ly gon' take on some different identities
Now who'd a thought we make it happen with this rappin' in this industry?
Ya

In the light, in the dark
In the soul, in ya heart
To the end, from the start
Good music

In the light, in the dark
In the soul, in ya heart
To the end, from the start
Good music

Shot up in my bones
Deep in my soul
From head to toe, whoa
Shot up in my bones
Deep in my soul
From head to toe

Lots of songs, lots of sounds
Bookoo fan, lots of towns
Good and bad time, farewells and makin' up
Even feet hurt in the rhythm that run with walkin' off
Fights in the club, lullabies to a newborn
Jazz softly enhances gettin' grooves on
Tears in a funeral, brought on by a sad song
After biggie's, one more chance, who was ugly doin'?
Sade made me wanna do it in the rain
R. Kelly had me rentin' cars to do it in the range
Breathin' is a beat tempo adjusted by adrenaline
Situations, thankin' God for the situation

In the light, in the dark
In the soul, in ya heart
To the end, from the start
Good music

In the light, in the dark
In the soul, in ya heart
To the end, from the start
Good music

Shot up in my bones
Deep in my soul
From head to toe, whoaaaaa
Shot up in my bones
Deep in my soul
From head to toe

Said it got to be music
Deep in my soul
Got to be music
Said it can't be nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' else

Make do with what we got, use the logic that God gave us
Losin faith is enough to make a man crazy

Heh, yelled for this
Sinnin every night, know I'm goin to hell for this
The hurt and the betrayal, compelled by this
Tough wall to climb but Nappy Roots scaled the shit
Just don't let me rap in vain, people pray over this
Don't take my word for it, see for yourself and shit
Everybody out in the wind, ain't no help with this
I coulda thrown in the towel, coulda walked away
Eyes on the prize, so I'm strong today
Simply want it, believe it, think it, breathe it
Chase it, cease it, maintain, keep it
Hold it, control it, never let go of it
Hold on, press on, push on, I'm gone

[Chorus 2X]

Nappy Roots,"Way before platinum there was a place we used to go
and ride for hours at a time on a country road
Whatever is  troubling, you can let it go
I get out of the car and walk through it, visit the river and talk to it
Simply saying, ""Mr. water, what is it that you running from?""
Asked the bird in the tree, ""What is it that you humming for?""
Now knowing (Why the Caged Bird Sings) is wishing to be free
Reminded myself of life and it's hold on me
Touring, the children, women, sexual resistance
Religion means so much to me, the church don't see enough of me
This way, that way, bending corners trying to get away
Sometimes you have to see a storm to appreciate a pretty day
BACK in the car now, headed for the liquor store
God, what a vivid scene, digging what I just seen
Rolled up another one, still in a daze though
Gassed up at the Mini-Mart, my mind on the country roads

[Chorus:]

I just want to go
On the country roads and get blowed
On the country roads again roll
Been on the country roads again

Yo, we off in these backwoods Caddy-hogging, Nappy dog, ain't no joke
We glad they robbing, rap imposter's, for they problem no hope
It's cutthroat, we hungry starving, charging for the front do'
You want mo'? We smoke and sparking, jokers like the blunt go
Been shoving folk for plenty miles, yes I'm the type to grin and bear it
The second chance and out the box, I'm back again with 'dro and spirits
Look at me now, I found a spot, I'm down here by that rolling river
Grab a rose and took me to a place, au revoir, I'm rolling scriptures

Man these country roads making me zone out
Riding through all the bullshit that poppa would scold 'bout
But soon as my hustle got good I showed out
Quick to jump I-24, come back with plenty mo'
By '97 I was smoking perfect o
The chains and the Willie Esco was the dress code
We lost our littlest cousin Gwin, a skid row
Tony Renfrow rest in peace your kinfolks, I miss y'all

(Dude what the hell are we doing?)
Back deep on these country roads blowing, getting in touch with my mind
No worries just striped lines and curve-filled signs
When all the events throughout the day, good or bad, somehow rewind
While I recline, in my Cadillac seats
Hit the trees and press repeat
And let the melody of these windy roads keep my soul upbeat
No destination proposed, just riding these country roads...
Listen, this killer's that's willing to catch a court case
Split your wig apart quicker than the divorce rate
Niggaz show out, go wild in the corpse cage
Blow out in the news and I don't mean the sports page
Get drowned in North Lake, could get found in horse cave
Fool, get down, the boy's crazy!
Lil' Stille's with ambition, itching to fill my position
Replace me, but by the Lord's grace still existing
Should be in depression La trill is missing, cousins in prison
Heard Little Ricky was snitching, now he's a born-again Christian
Always had my suspicions, our teens with bad addictions
Family members gone overseas on a mission, we miss 'em
See you can travel straight through two different coasts
State to state, navigate this beautiful globe
In search of a plate full of food for the soul
I could taste it when the smoke hit my nose
On a place called country roads",Roll Again,2003

Deep down I know he love her but he should a worn a rubber

As darkness approaches
And I'm fumbling through the blunt roaches
Its looking hopeless, totally unfocused
Stumbling onto the front porch
Poasty with my closest associates
We were so broke
Though a couple of us had sold dope
Still humble enough to be po' folk
We coming up to be grown folk
Ain't dumb enough to be slow poke
Though the hours of death they grow close
So we give our lives to the utmost, Plus
Here's an extra point
Visualize the gold post
No we not eating duck roast
But we live our lives to the utmost, Cause
Those pressure points
Are the corners we cut close
Turn most civilized
Yaggers to cutthroats
And it's these men they send
up state by truck load
And hurl 'em in to the pin like buffalos
I'm saying

The game was sold, not told to me
Heartache won't let go of me
Games say that I'll live and lie
But I'll trrrrryyyyy

Every which way tell you the angles
I done tossed and turned
Hit and missed
Pissed cause of that didn't amount to this
Getting it ain't got a damn thing to do with keeping shit
Working damn hard to get it
Plans and not parting with it
Life got a way of showing you shit
you can't barely see
Tough keeping close
Setting sail through a sea of g's
Something should this night I lay me down to sleep
Wasn't happy with my friend
Pray the lord my soul to keep

I'm 'bout 3000 miles from Graceland
By the county from Macon
But you would think I'm arm reach from Satan
I got a strange way of telling the truth
Most felons do stuff between
Hearin your story and telling it too
Stuck between nom and feelin it
Right between calm and militant
On the search for deliverance
I'm three days from beatin my case at the arraignment
This shits basic
Get the (?) get the statement

Part with the heart of a soldier
Right now I'm stuck behind bars with daddy told ya
I chose to march with martin carryin posters
They lock me down, but they usually hang us folks up
We so tough, white man trying to control us
And mold us, simulate our cultures, they doped us
Hell naw I'm stayin focused
I won't corrupt with evil
Forever fightin for my people, equal

Fight for you rights

Said in the clouds last night she got higher then she's ever been
Seen shuttles and huddles, hard rocks and war bombs
In real life our words in distorted sound

The world's corrupt, how can I defend it?
Need more love, that's why I have to send it

Know what it is when you really tryin to be somethin
But in your minds you really can't find nothin
But am I wrong if a preacher can't reach me?
Or am I dumb cause a teacher can't teach me?

I'm too much hell for this heaven here to keep me
But you can beat me, slander me, cancel me
But see I'm real so you still gotta answer me

Shattered glass the aftermath, tragic death is on the trail
Empty shells, the ghetto's extinct, there's heaven and there's hell
Burnin souls, the opposite of peace for 7 million years

It's time for revolution, get yo' gauge and bullets off the shelf

Because the end is almost here but I done been here before
So I haven't any fear for I trust in the Lord
When I die nobody cry, nobody shed not a tear
In the middle of the floor pour out your liquor and your beer
I'm still witcha, you can hear me loud and clearly
When I'm howlin at the moon (whoooooo)

Heard me battlin the beat of her heart when it boom
I'm born again, I'm free! I'm Nappy to my Roots!

He said he seen one fine chick, hips thick and ass fat
I told him pass her like a Swisher, we can double that
She pulled up, she started yappin on how she loved the ass
I scratched my head cause I ain't tryin to catch no drama back

[Verse One-B. Stille]
Each day I listen what the streets say
Like a DJ my negroes scratch ghetto recordings, for my peoples
Got the eyes of an eagle, can't see us ever being at peace for a reason
Cause we ain't never being equal
And got us believing we heathens, uncivil soldiers of evil
Reach up and assume the position, you know the procedure
Can't even leisure smoke hollow reefer
With out police and search and seizure by the same police who murdered Ceaser
It's brutal
Seeing them treat us like lower creatures than human beings
More so like aliens
Touring the land of Europeans
Seeming to have the tendency to think we ignorant
Cause of our pigment, can't take away a nigga's dignity though
Still I pimp the industry hoe
And even when I'm rich I'm a pretend to be poor
My life's a work in progress, soon to be end of the road
But I don't stress cause I have been her before, you know

[chorus]
My life's a work in progress
(and even though I'm rich I'm gonna pretend to be poor)
My life's a work in progress
(but I don't stress cause I have been here before)
My life's a work in progress
(and even though I'm rich I'm gonna pretend to be poor)
My life's a work in progress
(but I don't stress cause I have been here before)

[Verse two-Ron Clutch]
In life
Every step you take
Every right every left you make
You can look at it like chess in a way
Cause life is best when you take your time
Don't make a move, unless you done made up your mind
Play by the rules, don't ever play the fool
Sometimes you play and lose but you still pay your dues
Come on
Everybody knows the cost to be the boss
Yea the price is kind of steep but sacrifice is never cheap
I learned that life can be sweet and bitter at the same time
It's the Ying verse the Yang, sorta like rain without shine
Sometimes against the grain you grind gotta grit your teeth and bear it
Matthew 5, verse 5 ""The earth the meek shall inherit""
Cherish the day before you perish away
Cause who can say how many days your power last?
It's like a crack in your hourglass
In a flash, the hours pass
Then you're gone

[Chorus]

[Verse three-Big V]
Long life living (?) will bring you close you dying
The more laughs one had will bring you close to crying
Cold unforgiving planet, yea it is
Racists, communicating those who wrong did
I daydream back to the 80's when we was all kids
A stab wound kidnapping (?) experience
Though at the time not a glock would blow in da wind
It's a good day in the hood to witness a stabbing
Now stories told to us, without tragedy
Seem like it involve bloodshed automatically
If you ever get a chance, just stop and use your mind
Observe the world for yourself and just check your time
Yeah, Oh, Yeah, that's right
([Scratched:] my life's a work in progress)
Smoke something with your country people
Drank something with your country people
([Scratched:] my life's a work in progress)
Thinking back in Junior high when sex was the shit
Fein pussy now a day can get you killed quick
'Bout shootin ball in now they 'bout getting licks
I'm playin Nappy Roots just to hear the realest shit
Expect it to the best of my know how and my rapping wit
See next to nothing sugar coated in these cold streets
Whatever you do, be smart, tote your heat
Did I mention if you don't work you don't eat
If you ever get a chance stop and use your mind
Observe the world for yourself and check the time
Yea, Smoke something with your country people

Don\'t call me nigger, whitey!
Don\'t call me whitey, nigger!
Don\'t call me nigger, whitey!

They was talkin\' softly to each other

Take a nigga back to tobacco road
I'd give my old soul what it's asking fo
I'm trying to find where them angels sing at
Where X and King at
So listen for the knowledge I bring back
Cause cigarette pack and deuce bottle
Blue collar ain't too much we can do father
Taketh me I live life so anxiously
Tell me this is bout more than sex and buying weed
Maybe but anyway we burn daily, sip baileys, early sex
Unwanted babies, scream push till I push daises
Pops raised me through this blind crooked and crazy world
I'm just riding along see where it takes me
Keep buying cars and rims until it breaks me
I'm fold like bread on a loose sandwich, too damaged
Still I've got to slow down and find a balance

You spend a lot of long nights trying to make it like an open flame
Smoking jane posted on this porch
I got this close to fame without the Leroy
But we live forever wood and leather
Slum is in my village like them niggas in Detroit
What up though? It's all or none and I'm going for the gusto
And everyday is cut throat but I don't give a fuck yo
Gutter bread slice it different ways
I got some shit to say, split the swisher, pack the hay,
Roll it up and hit the bitch
Addicted to this country living giving it my all dog
Raw till I fall y'all here to California
And back again trafficking like Rog what's happening
I'm traveling looking for the kill like I'm bill I'll
My own right left without my soul tight
Roll threw a cold night
Swerving on a country road
Six pack of Michalobs, o with some funky dro

See I love my reefa, love my ganets
And I don't fit into society I'm a menace
Slap my balls on ya rack like tennis
And turn the henney up and don't stop till I'm finished
I'm pissy drunk, one shot might get me crunk
Not to mention shawty rollin' up like 50 blunts
Got nappy in this bitch
Sticks to the bricks
I'm a cowboy dog it's to the face though mix

We go ninety in the slow lane with just enough to traffic
Cross the line 'bout forty times a week on an average
Forward then backwards packaged like a sack lunch
Ridin' dirty, high as fuck, puffin on a bad blunt
What's ya ass want? Nappy serve it all day
Always keep it caddy hoggin' dog it's all wood
Too much of anything can make ya think it's all good

I'm a God-fearing man, who's had to dance with devil
The Lord I pray my soul to take
If I should ever die before I wake
But see, right now I just wanna love and live
And show this country girl what I got to give
My whole heap and hep of country fun,
Full of four wheel drive, dirt road and shotgun
Ain't nothing better than being out in the woods
With Nic and Nappy Roots and blazin' that good good
Lord I'ma tell you we're doin' it just right
Got my Playboy bunny right by my side
This is me and my girl and ol' Sick Em Sam
In a flatbed Ford off the Copperhead Dam
Listen to Jennings sing that lonesome song
It's all just right, y'all can keep the wrong

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin' right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
Since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time

With my feet up, lawn chair beat up
I'm on my third six pack, player can you keep up?
Got it right deep in the sticks, wanna see us?
Front yard golf field bought em, wanna tee up?
Cataracts here tell Jenny go re-up
Bulldog been every truck throw a G up
Hospital, school and the church one street up
Talk more proper when the city folks greet us
Tired of goin to jail so I learned how to chill
Me and the lil lady have a ball every Chri
Friends and a keg and the country boy meal
I should write a menu how a country boy live
Luck no love, or bucks no buck
Someone hand me a ball and a truck-boat-truck.
I've never been rich but I really don't want much,
Just a roof and some good liquor in my cup.

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light
'Cause since I met you, all I wanna do is
Waste some time

I got five on the wood, twenty on the keg
I been left the hood, yep I did what I said
Momma I'm good 'bout as cool as they come
We cooked a whole hog and love chicken where I'm from
I used to be the bomb, now to think I'm fresh
Still rock my same jeans and keep the liquor to myself
Got a little wealth so I gotta thank the Lord,
Couldn't do it by myself, got some help from Colt Ford
Now we in a Ford, and we travel on a gravel road
He said he knew a spot, where the music and the liquor flow
And of course I'm down like four flats
Drove a country mile, took a left to be exact
Led us smack dab in the middle of the sticks
Now I had seen a lot of things, but nothing like this
A bunch of pretty women, nothin' less than a dime
Colt Ford and Nappy Roots so you know we gonna waste some time

I've been told I need to focus on my life
Work a little harder, do my part, start livin right
I ain't got the answers, but I think I seen the light

Take the day off hit park and just hang
Barbeque, roll a few and put up your dukes
And if it's beef, put the peace up and put down your dukes
It's time to change our ways
So we can save the day
For the children sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good break out your group and grip your wood
And if you ridin' dirty just light your spliff and blow your

Napua Greig,"A long long time ago
There was a volcano
Living all alone in the middle of the sea

He sat high above his bay
Watching all the couples play
And wishing that he had someone too

And from his lava came
This song of hope that he sang out loud
Every day
For years and years

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Years of singing all alone
Turned his lava into stone
Until he was on the brink of extinction
But little did he know
That living in the sea below
Another volcano
Was listening to his song

Everyday she heard his tune
Her lava grew and grew
Because she believed his song was meant for her
Now she was so ready to meet him above the sea
As he sang his song of hope for the last time

I have a dream
I hope it will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Rising from the sea below
Stood a lovely volcano
Looking all around
But she could not see him
He tried to sing to let her know
That she was not there alone
But with no lava, his song was all gone
He filled the sea with his tears
Watched his dreams disappear
As she remembered what his song meant to her

I have a dream
I hope will come true
That you're here with me
And I am here with you
I wish that the earth, sea, and the sky up above
Will send me someone to lava

Oh they were so happy
To finally meet above the sea
All together now their lava grew and grew
No longer are they all alone
With Aloha as their new home
And when you go and visit them this is what they sing

I have a dream I hope it will come true
That you will grow old with me, and I will grow old with you
We thank the earth, sea, and the sky we thank too
I lava you
I lava you
I lava you",Lava,2015

Ser só minha até morrer

De falar devagarinho

E chorar bem de mansinho

Aquela amada pelo amor predestinada
Sem a qual a vida é nada
Sem a qual se quer morrer

Você tem que vir comigo em meu caminho
E talvez o meu caminho seja triste pra você
Os seus olhos têm que ser só dos meus olhos
Os seus braços o meu ninho

No silêncio de depois
E você tem que ser a estrela derradeira
Minha amiga e companheira
No infinito de nós dois

",Minha Namorada,1965
Nara Leão,"Um cantinho, um violão
Esse amor, uma canção
Pra fazer feliz a quem se ama

Muita calma pra pensar
E ter tempo pra sonhar
Da janela vê-se o Corcovado
O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim
Com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

",Corcovado,1971
Nara Leão,"Olha que coisa mais linda
Mais cheia de graça
É ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar

Moça do corpo dourado do sol de Ipanema
O seu balançado parece um poema
É a coisa mais linda que eu já vi pasar

Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, por que estou tão sozinho?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha

Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo inteirinho se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha
Ah, se ele soubesse que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

Nara Leão,"Quem acreditou
No amor, no sorriso e na flor
Entao sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz
O amor, o sorriso e a flor
Se transformam depressa demais

Quem
No coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder
E na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz

Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou

E a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou

",Meditacão,1971
Nara Leão,"O meu amor sozinho
É assim como um jardim sem flor
Só queria poder ir dizer a ele
Como é triste se sentir saudade

É que eu gosto tanto dele
Que é capaz dele gostar de mim
Acontece que eu estou mais longe dele
Que da estrela a reluzir na tarde

Estrela, eu lhe diria
Desce à terra, o amor existe
E a poesia só espera ver
Nascer a primavera
Para não morrer

Não há amor sozinho
É juntinho que ele fica bom
Eu queria dar-lhe todo o meu carinho
Eu queria ter felicidade

É que o meu amor é tanto
É um encanto que não tem mais fim
E no entanto ele nem sabe que isso existe
É tão triste se sentir saudade

Amor, eu lhe direi
Amor que eu tanto procurei
Ah, quem me dera eu pudesse ser
A tua primavera
E depois morrer

",Prima Vera,1971
Nara Leão,"Podem me chamar e me pedir e me rogar

E também podem me intrigar e até sorrir e até chorar

Pra viver em paz
Onde eu possa encontrar a natureza
Alegria e felicidade com certeza

Lá nesse lugar o amanhecer é lindo
Com flores festejando mais um dia que vem vindo
Onde a gente pode se deitar no campo
Se amar na relva escutando o canto dos pássaros

Aproveitar a tarde sem pensar na vida
Andar despreocupado sem saber a hora de voltar
Bronzear o corpo todo sem censura
Gozar a liberdade de uma vida sem frescura

Se você não vem comigo
Tudo isso vai ficar no horizonte esperando por nós dois
Se você não vem comigo nada disso tem valor
De que vale o paraíso sem amor

Além do horizonte existe um lugar
Bonito e tranquilo pra gente se amar",Além Do Horizonte,1989
Nara Leão,"No alto de uma montanha existe um lago azul
É lá que a lua se banha
Até amanhã de manhã me banha de luz

A solidão é um Saara que o firmamento seduz
E o céu brilha na Guanabara
E sonha só fascinação
Teu olhar me diz

Vejo a lua dizendo pro sol, eu sou tua namorada
Em meu quarto crescente é você quem brilha e me reluz
Se você vai iluminar o Japão eu fico abandonada
Num pedaço qualquer de canção na voz dessa mulher

E o sol derrama um desejo do céu nessa cama azul
Um mel na tua boca e eu te beijo
Até amanhã de manhã, me banha de luz

E o sol derrama um desejo do céu nessa cama azul
Um mel na tua boca e eu te beijo
Até amanhã de manhã, me banha de luz

Nara Leão,"Nasci lá na Bahia
De Mucama com feitor
Meu pai dormia em cama
Minha mãe no pisador

Meu pai só dizia assim, venha
Minha mãe dizia sim, sem falar
Mulher que fala muito perde logo seu amor
Deus fez primeiro o homem
A mulher nasceu depois

Por isso é que a mulher
Trabalha sempre pelos dois
Homem acaba de chegar, tá com fome
A mulher tem que olhar pelo homem

E é deitada, em pé, mulher tem é que trabalhar
O rico acorda tarde, já começa resmungar
O pobre acorda cedo, já começa trabalhar

Vou pedir ao meu Babalorixá
Pra fazer uma oração pra Xangô
Pra por pra trabalhar gente que nunca trabalhou

A praia, o mar, promessar no ar
E tudo que eu quis sem medo de ser feliz

Eu, você, até de manhã
Lembrando as bobagens de amor que eu falei
Você meu galã, e eu sua Dorys Day

Não dê força ao prego
Que nos põe contra a parede
Pra nos afogar de sede

Chove chuva na sua boca
E você não bebe
Há palavras, existem letras
Mas você não forma
As frases loucas que cultiva por aí

Fale pelos cotovelos, e pelos joelhos
Me critique sem razão
Se omitir não vale à pena

Mas não polua minha cultura
Não venha dividir comigo sua auto-censura
Me desencontre, não me prostitua
Se não seremos mais uma carcaça em desgraça por aí

",Meu Ego,1999
Nara Leão,"Dia de luz, festa de sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
No macio azul do mar

Tudo é verão, o amor se faz
No barquinho pelo mar
Que desliza sem parar
Sem intenção, nossa canção

Vai saindo desse mar
E o sol
Beija o barco e luz
Dias tão azuis

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

Céu tão azul, ilhas do sul
E o barquinho, coração
Deslizando na canção

Tudo isso é paz
Tudo isso traz
Uma calma de verão
E então
O barquinho vai
E a tardinha cai

A mountain you know I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time

My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife,
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy

Yeah but this time Lord you gave me a mountain, 
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
Yeah Lord, You gave me a mountain
Don't you know

Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me

Narvel Felts,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge
Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me
 
Feelin good was easy, Lord
When he sang the blues
And buddy, that was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee",Me and Bobby McGee,2006

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.
 
It's strange how life deals you sorrow,
Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,

Went through all the things a teenage girl goes through
Hangin' out all night and breaking my curfew
When my daddy hit the door I gave my mumma the blues
Use 2 spend my time blazin' lazin' days away
Thought I was grown left home at 15 didn't wanna obey
Had 2 get my act together couldn't take the heat
And now I'm makin' beats 4 the streets

And I come 2 rock da show
I'm Ms Dy-na-mi-tee
Everybody loose control
Let my vibe 2uch ur soul

I remember all the house parties that took place
Bein' in my bed upstairs and we could still feel the base
And my cousins and my brothers we'd sit up all night
Listenin' 2 my family vibin' till the mornin' light
Remember my first years of school I was so innocent
I just wanted 2 learn I never been so content
But the more that I learned I found a guidin' light
That showed me the need 2 fight
And be

At 13 I thought that I was in love with this guy
Anytime I caught his eye I thought that I'd just die
Remember playin' class clown I was just a disruptive fool
And the beatin' that I got first time suspended from school
Remember Sunday School and after go 2 grammas 4 lunch
Macaroni, rice and peas, chicken and pineapple punch
Never had much my mum brother sister and me
But love was enough 2 succeed
2 grow

Exuberant, change, cross, exhilarated 
Flamboyant, but bouncy on beat breaks, I'm animated 
Now it's been stated, I'm lyrically enthusiastic 
I'm dope like all east coast CD's wrapped through plastic 
What's the meaning of life, y'all should know 
In my lifetime I need a whole lotta dough, bro 
No need to get zealous, you jealous, say you jealous 
I spike on that like Monica Seles 
I split a divine rhyme, exquisite like some elegant wine 
Here's a toast, the world is mine 
I promise I'm a keep it punk 
I represent the real hip-hop, I ain't no freakin' country bumpkin 
Hooparistic, freakaristic, poetic frenzy with conception 
I got more flavor than a mystic 
Fringe benefitic, urging y'all to get wit it

Together we provide a ton of better on the way and 
We rhyme related 
Very under-estimated, that's why I'm winnin' 
In this world of sins, steady grinning, money boss spendin' 
Distanced from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influential 
Spiritually and mental, what you into I'd a been through 
Preachin' my words and don't know it, you owe it 
It shows you want to be me but won't show it 
Ain't nothin' changed but the playas 
The game remains the same 
I had a ten year run, hey, I can't complain 
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi 
From the B.X., we ridin' to South Beach on jet ski 
Play to survive, you ain't live, you just livin' 
You breathin' a good one, but where I'm from y'all forbidden 
Come around, bad decision, you'd rather be in prison 
Ain't no duckin' when I'm delivering, won't be forgiver-in'

You gotta walk towards the light, everything is aight 
Make sure, everything you endure stays tight

Right above your naval 
Your belly button's pierced too just like I like it girl

New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
""What you up to, the cops goin' bust you""
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin' at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin' them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein'
While he lookin' at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showin' they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin' proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother durin' the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein' replaced
Pre-trial hearin' is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I want to crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leavin' everybody

Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game somethin' crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin'
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin', out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas I got your back - the fools don't play""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin' and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin' the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin' to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fuckin' with you
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people goin' get down, how we ever goin' get up?

Count how many bad honeys I slut, it’s a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I’m under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin’
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars

Dick ‘em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose ‘em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I’m not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon

Blastin’, I’m after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I’m so high, I never land like Mike Jackson’s crib

Past nasty now, I’m gross and repulsive, talk money

In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got all you envy
But don’t offend, I’m skinny, but still I’m too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin’ Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the ’90s
Drug dealer call, rush to the bar
Move, niggas, we don’t give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them them saggin’, bet a hundred stacks
Niggas’ll run it back just havin’ fun
I ain’t even begun to black, light another blunt in fact

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin’
Saying it was Nas I used to hustle with
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashes, guns on my waist past his
Since I’m cakin’ up, put funds in my safe, laughin’
And joining the blunt passin’ you niggas was straight assin’
Excuse the vulgarity, I’m still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin’ me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin’ they drivin’
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin’
Fake it ’til you make it, I’ve driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin’ in doors

Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screems with emotion
This my daily devotion, the verses stay deaper then the ocean
So hip hop you owe me a promotion
Yea I do a little boasting and bragging
Whats all the commotion and nagging about?
Cuz Im Still the Champ in the south
Cuz rappers get in the booth and I keep dragging them out
For they fire at these pink slips im handing them out
Cuz this is theatre of the mind
Considerate a sign of whats to come next
My moneys just fine bank filled with dumb checks
Terrorist threat flow, proceed to drop bombs like mr.pump flex

I do it with the beatbox, I did it from the start
I do it for the DJ's, I do it for the chart's
The fan gel flow,luda do it cuz it's art

No need for drama yo I do it for my soul
To hold and control what I can and thats the goal

Improvement thats the destination, provin the obligation

We racing to like the masons all the way to the top

Cats faking and acting lame just to attract fame
But lyrically we react and blast them with words not gats

And I can show 'em my fortunes but can't force 'em to think rich,
And still I don't abort 'em ? when and if they sink quick,
Ignore the ignorance, I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge,
And pray to fans, let Murder Inc. live

I don't talk about my guns, nigga I just blaze

'Pac is watchin', Big is listenin',
While Pun talkin' to us, Jam Jay still spinnin',
To every nigga listenin'
I was supposed to be amongst kings, my Mom shouted out at my Christening.
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a man hole,
Cam got shot inside his lambo', sample, life is a gamble,
15 years old red rag around my hand, My sisters used to laugh and call me 'Rambo',
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle,
I rekindled the flame,
Dre created The Game,
nigga with an attitude from the cloth I came,
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain.
Keep the crown, clown, I rock an LA Dodger Fitted,
I showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down with it,
Now the ball's in my court, never dribble out of bounds with it.
Behind the back to Nas, he alley oop to Jigga, nigga

Me and nasty puffin', this a classic, trust me,
How you gon' pass the dutchie ? to them niggas that don't love me,
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top,
Same niggas that never wanted to see the Doctor's Advocate drop, flop, I think not,
I'll fuck you rap niggas like virgins,
Dre took my training wheels off his curtains.
I don't need no encore, no claps, no cheers,
The Game ain't over, this the beginning of my career,
The ending of yours, the endin' of his,
Like Flavor Flav's clock, I'm back to handle my biz,
Nigga, it's Game Time, that was Dre's favorite line,
Back when proof was in the booth and I recited his lines,
And I still think about my nigga from time to time,
Make me wanna call 50, and let him know what's on my mind,
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that,
He ain't Big, and I ain't Pac, and we just eatin' off rap.
One love.

I'll do Marsha's bit if you want, but it seems kinda pointless.
I thought Nas was on point with his multis, the cotton line is a bit old though.",Why You Hate the Game [Exclusive],
Nas,"Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta and braver, I pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass
40 side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't' a damn thing gonna change
I'm a perform a strange show the mic wonder was born the game?
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

It's halftime

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got at him, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off wit my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels to never run it
Wit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, kid, surprise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fucking man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S, now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a fagot
But not a bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
'cause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be fouled whenever I freestyle
I see trial niggas say I'm wow
I hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime

It's halftime

I got it going on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the narcs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey or heartless Sparkton
'cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slaying them fast, doing this, that in the third
But chill, past the entree and let's lay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo-fo
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten

Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
'Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up

Nas,"Visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's ""the baddest""; a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But something must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some resting in peace and some are sitting in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping the effervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thieving
We'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere else stacking plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
Cause you never know when you're gonna go

I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels
And rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying ""fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage

Life's a bitch and then you die

Henessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke woolie thai
I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a coke head cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented, with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous night times, and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac gold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggaz no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to Ceelo
With side bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below (Peace God!)
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real, or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowin', black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some up-rise, plus some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace.
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck 'rap is real', watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

Nas,"Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kicking
Musician, inflicting composition
Of pain I'm like Scarface sniffing cocaine
Holding a M-16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the celo champs
Laughing at base-heads, trying to sell some broken amps
G-Packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be running through the block shooting
Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston
Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, ""Back up,"" the Mac spit
Lead was hitting niggas one ran, I made him back flip
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby
And it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you saying?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to they name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us
Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact
Same niggas'll catch a back to back, snatching yo' cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash until the coke price drop
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo
You gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasing and they wives basin
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind

New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

Be having dreams that I'ma gangster, drinking Moets, holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewing up the blocks
To sell rocks, winning gunfights with mega cops
But just a nigga, walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testing
Give me a Smith and Wessun I'll have niggas undressing
Thinking of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated I'ma hijack Delta
In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black
I'm living where the nights is jet black
The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dice
I'm taking rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhyming is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks
I'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times

I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flip it, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome s niece, on her way home from joes beaches club
Plus little rob is selling drugs all the time
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort, now I represent to the fullest

Out in new york the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm a put it to a cease
When I heard you blew a nigga with the ? for a phone piece
Whylin' on the island but now with ?
Better chill 'cause them niggasz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
I maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next v I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks
Plus ? flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four Maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key

Though incarcerated your mind (dies)
I hate it when your mum cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week and hittin' nails while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty
Do I roll them two phillies together and the friends we call them oowops
He said nas, niggaz cold be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhailed so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'cause when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
If the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only the bolder herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose

Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners  (Ay, yo, yo, who that?)  They better break North
Before we get the four pounders, and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D.A.'s on the roof, trying to, watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em
And leave em done, won't even run about Gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure

Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
Cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggas and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's

Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!
Represent, represent!

No doubt; see my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun Son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too
With Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

(Hey yo, Nas, (Whattup, Paul?) Kick that fuckin' rhyme)

Check it out
When I'm chilling, I grab the Buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin and root for the villain, huh
Plus, every morning, I go out and love it, sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Cheap lubrication, lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control, quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, acapella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Got niggaz who's born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a forty top, yeah

I'm still writin' rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm trying to get this money, God, you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold be starvin', make you want to do crimes, kid
But I'm a lamp, 'cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching three to nines, Muslims yelling free the mind
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a meance, yo, police want to murder me
Heine(ken,) dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the north ninety-five interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the wiz' to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop, Pah
I shine a light on perpetrators, like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic, and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack the Reverand
I contact eleven L's, and max in heaven

Yo, one time for your mind, one time

Nas,"It ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet. invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
'Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fail

Nas,"We got that green stuff, Big Tite
Lil Flip the Leprechaun, Slim Thug the Boss Hogg
Fin to put it all in why'all face

I got too much money, too much cash
I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank
I'm top rank, Slim Thug gon' talk the talk
Walk the walk, we can bet ball for ball
We some paid young G's, with too much cash
Too much flow and do', talking too much trash ha

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]
Too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass
We got too much money, too much cash
All why'all haters, can kiss our ass

Too much money is what I got, like Scarface I rap a lot
S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G
Lil Flip is who I be, I know your gal know me
'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man
I'm sitting on Dubs, kinda like a blank tape
You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something
I'm a young pimp, with a whole lot of cash
And why'all haters, why'all can kiss our ass

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I got too much M-O-N-E-why
Anything I S-E-E, I be	-you-why
Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car
Attracting your star, cause nigga my piece attracting your car
We got too much green, and that's real by far

Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
Don't go against the grain simple and plain

When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash

Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with
Is rich or doin years in the hundreds
I switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto

I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back

So hustlers make crack sales 'cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While makin cake with real golded plate rims on Hum-V's

I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow

Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they would send the dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They want to lock us up cause they kids are lovin it

Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks

Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggaz was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shannon Scott, LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggaz talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a plant yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's why'all are clitoris
why'all niggaz roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars

Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out

This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police

Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggaz who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in Kay Bee Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggaz check you

Keepin the schwepervesence street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin thievin we'll be leavin with some kind of dough

So, and to that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers-ll be somewhere stackin plenty papers
Keepin it real, packin steel, gettin high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

[Chorus: AZ the Visualiza]
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die; that's why we puff lye

'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die

[Verse Two: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing
The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created

Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
Don't go against the grain simple and plain

When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash

Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with
Is rich or doin years in the hundreds
I switched my motto -- instead of sayin fuck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto

Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric
Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage

[Chorus]",Life's a B***,1994
Nas,"In the Rotten Apple take a bite taste the worm 
Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn 
Coke connection drug bust graveyards where thugs rest 
I keep my mug blessed the evil is illegal substance sold 
Roll mob deep guns in the black Jeep 
Mac 11's and legends cracks in the streets 
Patroller gold money folder gun happy soldiers 
Never sober takin' over my blood is colder 
Niggaz respect violence so I become it 
I'm from it, I even done it blunted so run it 

Yeah son, you know what this is 
Take it off [come on dunn, don't even come at me like that] 
[dunn, come on dunn] 

[Chorus]
Imagine this, no guns no knife 
It's a one on one so now we gots to fight, son 
Imagine this, no gun no knife 
It's a one on one now we got to fight, yeah 
Imagine that, no gun no knife 
It's a one on one now we got to fight, yeah 
Imagine this, no gun no knife 
It's a one on one, son 

Yo I'm a cream fiend, with a mean dream 
Brain full of schemes, my crew's rollin' fresh out the greens 
Give you what you never seen, the ips on the Mac-10 
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens 
Try hard and die hard 
Chances of survivin' the game is like tryin' to feed Allah lard 
A walk a piece with a deadly shadow 
They want to blow me with the double barrel, found no sorrow 
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in a thinker 
Don't make hell your new home, with the blue chrome 
Mistakes want me, suave fellow but raunchy 
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country 
But only to shed tears for years 
Too wild for my own self, hopin' help is near 
Street fightin' was cool but in school I brought a new tool 
Toolin with the devil, a rebel, a fool 

[Chorus]

Yeah, take it to the bridge Queensbridge 
Yo whassup money? [Yo yo do you remember this face?] 
[Yeah yeah yeah, run these, run these] 
 [Break you down! Get broke!] 
[No hands, run that, run that, run that, no hands] 

I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep 
Marked money I keep, play the bitches all week 
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits 
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof 
Sippin' eighty proof, watchin' Juice, but hold up 
I see some brothers tryin to roll up, wishin' I could fold up 
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie 
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me, I'm out

Yeah yeah kid, don't front, 360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin? 
That's how it comes back at you. Queensbridge, that's how we live. 
South side, all that. New York, light it up, light it up. 
Yo yo you saw how I snuffed that kid? [Yeah I saw that, I saw that] 
You know how we steppin'. That's how we do out here in the street fight!",One on One,1994

That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!

I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass

I had the joint out
Nigga gon' ask me ""what [I] want?""
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm like
Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five boroughs

Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money getting niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin my distance, cos bein poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still skeptic on who I cling to
Cos every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just cos we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket
Cos they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin no trace to track it, kingpin thinkin tactics is accurate
That mack shit, livin the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with

Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs

So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And until I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualize it to live it
Movin cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolises the essence, you're sailin in a sweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers
They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enourmous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
Cos for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So

Nas,"Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, the things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual

Perhaps bullets bust niggas discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building niggas building, like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack sales bubble like Woolworth's
In the projects, richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GS's, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew feel 'em like swords

With the green leathers, hundred pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop
In the 'nile, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up duke I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was wiling
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got juxed!""
Sharpened toothbrushes, 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block",Verbal Intercourse,1995
Nas,"This is what, this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact, sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Huh, huh 
Hey Noyd, what up this cat right here, man 
Word up! 

The tough guy strong me 
I guess he got plans to ruin me 
He want to do me slowly but surely 
I beat his fast ass a bit early 
Grabbed the biased raid, the shit was curly 
Put the drome to his dome 
Let him know it's never early 
You can slide before I snatch the heat from his side 
Saw the devil in disguise by the look in his eyes 
He was surprised I snatched him up 
Regulated his gat and backed him up 
Stepped to the side, P blast em up 

Hey yo, cannons are rough 
You got strucked up, ya strokes slit 
So rapper nigga playin' thug try to pro shit

All I remember was I shot for his throat G

It gets deep, fuckin' with these Chi-nese 
Thai weed burnin' my hip from hot thats 
Burnin' my lips from roach clips 
Catch me on 40th and Bootlegger in the a.m.

Four in the mornin' we throwin' back some Cognac juice 
Lettin' thats loose in the blue van blitz-through 
These kids too couldn't find the pistol 
Hey yo, I got the Lexus, holdin' my necklace 
I'm bent off some next shit 
Gasoline wick, a kerosene twist 
Stumblin', place of my gun right, it's slipped down its caliber 
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now 
Numbed up for my fiery cup

Saints found they youth 
Mega-action, bitches all around ready to fuck 
Big asses, you bought all the shit, pressin' ya luck

Wit two females that don't sound in they style son
What up son, these niggas done started somethin wild
You know the clique well Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holdin the steel
I paid attention to the females, maintain bitches when it gets real
Soss pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes sprayed shots and still handle the wheel
Point em out smoke a phill and chill

Lookin delicious handle yo business and step to em
Shake yo ass try to screw em do
What ya got to do to get to em
A tight parasucco with young faces can turn niggas Buttafuco
Of all ages, they was amused with the way they walked way
They talked, only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they had too, heard him ask Venus ""Can I have you?""
He jumped out the jeep heard her tell him ""don't grab boo""
They started chattin was only about a minute
Flat line they jumped in the back of the jeep laughin
We followed them polian 
They probably thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We laid low about a hour or so these bitches movin too slow
We both holdin, What if them wild hoes started foldin? 
Sossa said say no more we started rollin
Before we got in they must had shot em, security wildin
There the girls go hurry up we outin

Twenty Gods poppin wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', sprayin shots like a drumroll
Blankin out and never miscount the shells my gun hold

Henny and Sprite, I separate, watchin crab niggaz marinate

Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy

I'll one day walk into shots drunk off Champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'm a pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye

Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang em high

Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement - chilling on the via with Mumia

Jokers in and everything, you know what I'm saying?

Son, I'm playin' with the fifty-two.

You want to stress on how I used to play, that's how I play.

But, yo, they takin' us into this next millennium, right now.

I'm sayin' law, you know what I'm sayin' we gotta lay the law,
Cause without law ain't no order, you know what I'm sayin',

Nas,"A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin
The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
What up mah, frontin like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin the same ol' games
Messin with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes, a black girl, lost

Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever gettin down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, startin' wars, makin me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keepin' me on all fours
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you
Igloos of ice trickin' on you, you never listen
To this nigga spendin' Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin' screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Comin' home wantin' more from a college degree

Diamonds all shinin', lookin' all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin', tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin' the same ol' games
Messin' with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes, a black girl, lost

Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value, too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin' to
More than the world, but not knowin' nothin' about you
You leavin' the crib, takin' all your kids out to
Drop them off, lettin' some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growin' up seein' it, it should remind you, you bein' lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancin' topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doin' silly things that is wrong

Will it take me under
I don't know

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial

Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got not
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Troopin' out of state for a plate, knowledge

Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues
Your people holdin' dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine, law with no undercovers

Could it be, if you could be mine we'd both shine

The way to be, paradise like relaxin', Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani, exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the ill'er path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin'
Trickin' six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd make Coretta Scott-King mayor o'the cities and reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could be mine we'd both shine

We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from Jake, gettin' chased, hunger for papes

Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace stack, the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cock hammer
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin' shit

I push a Q-4-5 infinite
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or be felony

The God with the God-you-Now, pulling a caper
Running up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig tied they motherfucking wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas in-to
Peep the issue situation like this, we sticking him too
JFK on our way to L.A.
Got links with big cats down to Santa Barbre (Barbara)
My crew do it the Mobb way, everyday
Crime pay, who wanted gun play? Drill me
Niggas kill me, thrilling me, you want to look?
Peep the nine milli, now undress, you know the drill-why
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats, I have yet
To met challenger who go against my set
Gem stars razor sharp like Gillette, shaving closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burglars trying to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate

No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a bid
The prosecutor, running up in your crib
Do your dirt, I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the gat that's holding me
We got it locked beyond measure, the click's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser
Represent your click, go ahead, get that ass whipped
(Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic)
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talking
QB represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rapping, I'm busy trying to sneak the gat in
Could tear men, cut the party while you jamming
We think smarter, reach harder, got the 44
Bodyguard of something you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me, you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me

Niggas thinking shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600, you just a crumb inside a world
Where the rich run it, curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggas mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerrilla ice on this killer's life

Now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Aire lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than how DeBarge is

Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit

I peeped you fronting, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpint
Across the street you was wilding
Talking bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Laying up, playing the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinking on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin something told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazing at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lighting L's sipping Coors, on all floors in project halls
Contemplating war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown copping the raw
But uhh, a thug changes, and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up

""Y'all know my steelo""
""There ain't an army that could strike back""

Nas,"The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

Substantial amounts you owe to the fam

Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP

Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump in the courtroom drunk, links truck
Rocky bracelet cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero

My mindset, son got wet
I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas acting illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder why they're broke
While we was gleaming, niggas was scheming
Seen the ill Beamers beaming
Triple-beam and doubling cream, had em fiending
To get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
Sosa these niggas hit the God bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my rat beggin me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
With two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over
My nigga Hav gotta soldier
It's getting down, it's going down kid
I heard he might not live, I'm holding back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile digging they style yo
Whattup son, these niggas done started something wild
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I layed back Escobar status, knowing The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born with

Spark the lye, QBC yo it's do or die

That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rocking boulders
He's stunting, after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus
And Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness
And step to him, shake your ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight parasuco, with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused
By the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
If they had to, heard him ask Venus, could I have you
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him don't grab boo
They started chatting, was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughing
We followed them pollying, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We layed low about a hour or so these bitches movin too slow
We both holding, what if them wild hoes started folding
Sosa, said say no more, we started rolling
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin
There the girls go, hurry up we out in

Nas,"Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, looking for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasing niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he making ten arrests, shit
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde Caesar
Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She do be looking weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speaking loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolving, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starving
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, sucking dick and coughing up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazing from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first)  Soon as he open it your glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked
Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eying us (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, hey yo the bitch is saved now
She's living in a snitch grave now

Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God to save the life that the Devil sold
See ""It Was Written"" but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Trying to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man going up creek
To do his two to four, niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord, Sony Handi-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill
Couldn't take losing his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holding, 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reaching
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggaz jet off
Police blitz quick, waiting for that to set off
Running the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of fagots
Starting shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearing Jake retaliating, and Wiz was up the alley waiting
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleeding inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes

Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar

Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Getting put on to crack money
With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt

I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk

My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon, the wettin'
Never freaking the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione, are you the type of nigga
To shoot a leg to get your name known?  I flip the brain tome

Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tachinni flippin mad pies
Low price, I blow dice and throw em
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the ""Do or Die"" slogan

Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate, watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about tecs and good jooks and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness

Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off Champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moon-roof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the via with Mumia

A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope-fiend, named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's,
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough holes for cracked out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the tecs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug,

There ain't no drama that my niggas never handle for me

Where the snakes put a smile on they face, hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winking at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be sticking you
The mag inside the triple goose
Face down on the floors, the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen

CD cranking, doing ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking

Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening just bobbin your head
Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself nobody's taking mine
At the same time, your hoe is getting snatched from behind
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know,
You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took em to your place, straight to your safe

See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black

Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus, Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, your top papi Señor Escobar

In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multimillions in the biggest bundle
In the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E Money bags got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar: Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki

Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?
Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfuckin gun
I can't believe this shit...
Word up... (word up)

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab and me bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired
A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves
Under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggaz shock me
I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me
Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf
His eyes bubblin, he said, ""It was on""
I felt his palm troubled him shakin
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic

When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge

Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead

Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, Armor All Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catching feelings

From fat cat to papi, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

Growing up project-struck, looking for luck dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Getting put on to crack money
With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these

happy days balancing with life's atrocities 
hoppin' in v's knowin' some day I got to lead properly 
high up in a five realizing the price paid 
for this life laid in the light shade

pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives 
while you could catch me in a crisp white five 
dark tinted, dijon-scented, with Al Green on 
my theme song, love and happiness, how can it seem wrong 
I mean before this, I used to rock a taurus with the donuts 
now I grown up, got it chromed up 
got the rap game sewn up, sho-nuff 
niggas acting cool, but it's really no love 
I feel a slow buzz, off the dutch 
this is everyday, every second 
got to make it pay, every lesson I learnt 
got me open while most of these rappers'll stay burnt

goin' through this difficult stage, called life 
but each year my physical's praised

Nas,"Verse One: Nas Escobar, AZ the Vizuliza

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in the Firm
I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time
There were wise guys everywhere, we were around
Twenty one, twenty two at the time
Yeah every place we go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars just for keeping
The ice cold, yeah we were legends and we still are

Two hundred fallen angels, we balling from every angle
Heavy bag gold, panamania changed angle
Let's tangle, tabernacles
Ill lukiens coming at you, fuck Parus
A billion years B.C., originally black Jews
Cashsews honey now roasted, let's kill the colprate
He owe us shit, toe toe toe with that four four bit
Fuck the hoe shit, mercury back tax ?birth? for me
Personally I existed when Earth was in need, indeed
Human lifeform transformed from light storms, poltrons
Electrons nuetrons, iced long
Nights long, repltilaians I'll see ya'll in the next millennium
What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Caribbean
Underwater force, placed under the court of law
Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambiants, love fine carats and cars that launch
Nonchalaunt, usually there are Jimmies up in the palms
Play low style, Guteians change my whole profile
Left the dope pile, bet the guard be around for awhile
Firm Islamic, hit the croner of the Earth just like a comet

Verse Two: AZ the Vizuliza, Nas Escobar

See I like Esco, he knew everybody and everybody knew him
He was the type of guy who routed for the bad guys in the movies
But hey

Die for this Firm, live for this Firm
Niggas learn, never should come before your fam
From ki's to ported grams, these are corners in the blue van
E's upon on us, cause of warrants 
While we smoke hash cheese enormous, stack cheese
Travel the world like Taurus, went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camdon, we handlin' to D.C.
Chips on fights with China White's by they tight PP
Wanting PC but all they get is good dick or four clips
For loose lips, by the jungle flise
Suck the pearl tongue juices, off you fly misses
Take her out to the Spark's stakehouse, gentelmen style
Coincidental, family's here
Meet fem fatale, French connection
Persian wet don, let's get this ""F"" on
The Ebony queen, Fox you grab my left arm

Veres Three: Foxy Brown

You know what, most hoes would have left these cats a long time ago
I mean if your man gave you a gun to hide, what would ya'll hoes do?
But you know, the shit kinda turned me on

Black Madonna, hoes kill for they popals
Never seen a bitch like this, queen misses
Rock BDS's on the left wrists, trick check this
Respect this, Firm's niggas lie knee deep in this bitch
want to need bitch and have my pussy bleed, swear for 'em
Fuck and take the chair for 'em, whoever dare cross us
The thoughts that thoughts across a bitch's minds, pops the nine
Leave 'em resting in peices, while my thorough bitches peep this
Death before decid-a, screw me on the dick-a
Lace me in Gabanna, peep dat
Think I'm flippin' on these three cats, 
Set yo clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G's, stash the guns for 'em
And the icedy E Berkee, breathe the the sun for 'em
Long dick style, swallow the enemies cum for 'em
Pretty ass hoe, bitches fuck 'em and I dumb on 'em

And will they ever let Gotti out?
Am I real? Feel free to try me out
Guaranteed eternally, you signin out
I only bang quarters, not a thing short of

Thought shorty would lose but the game taught her

Killer put you on, got you laced in Bucon
Bledest stone, where the place you call home?

Brooklyn girl, plotted then I took the world
You know the whole drill, Na Na so Ill
Make mills and escro, decimals

Bracelets got all, along with gold

Hot from the jumpstart, let the game spark
Thriller, will I shot to the top of the charts

More of the shit to hold you with
Keep hatin I'ma fold your bitch
Should've known to control that chick, hoes mad 'cause I roll the 6

Make em lick that, get the cat for his cream

Receipts in your Prada bag, sweets every weekend
Spendin my doe, I coulda spent that on hydro
You ain't slick enough, think I don't know

Nas,"Yo, this Esco, who this

What's the deally, I just touched grounds down in Philly
Brought a pound with me, Feds floating around silly
Tryna find Lynn; bitch supposed to be in the Benz
Parked in row ten, her and that slow ho Gwen
Shoulda known she was a bitch that we both could'a boned
To post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone
But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes
I know the jewels no time for them thoughts, too much to lose
Just trying to vibe until them hoes role with the ride
Where's your joy and pride, you know little Des got your eyes

In the cut drop CLK, the top's up
Left the mall bought Little Amal the toy truck
Your boy's what, three-years-old now correct
He and my daughter age neck-and-neck, they future's set
Trees got me wet, in the background's an old cassette
Fly Stephanie Mills shit
What's the deal with, all this shit I'm hearing up top
You got arrested, shot a fair one with a cop
That ain't ya stee', you usually low key when o.t
I'm only going off of what some weak bitch told me

That's some ill shit, hear that bitch go with her clique

Yo Dunn, I'll hit you right back cause the static is thick

We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, we got you

We just hit the crib-o, I'm curled up on this pillow
I'm still low, heard the ill news, these niggas killed Mo
The shit touched me, tryna chill just lit a Dutchie
From a while back, same foul cats who tried to bust me
Caught em sleeping in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights right off the Deacon
Feel awful speaking, for some reason feel the phone's tapped
Alone with gats left with a vest to watch my own back

Keep your eyes open, stay wide, shit is mind blowing
Look for any sign showin one-time is knowing
About the dynasty, shit is not minor leagues no more
Cats bleed in this cold war
Son we took an oath, then this life took us both
We rich now, milk the whole cow, split the growth
Now I'm on the car doing, headlights on
Fluid in the windsheild wipes gone this light storm
That's forming in the sky, you coming home tomorrow
Will you drive or will you fly - hold up, my other side

Yo son some other cats tried to ruin our plans
Sending two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Asking your whereabouts, I gave em no leads
For all the nigga know them hoes fuck with police

No shit I'm clicking over, I'mma tell Sos quick
Son, them outta state bitches tryna get us both hit
That was Nate, he hit me last night late while in my ho's stomach
Said it's no hundred, we FBI's most wanted
So play the low; change your clothes, pack your bags
Watch what you say on this phone, get home fast

We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, we got you

Yo it's all good
I'mma hit you when I touch down tomorrow son, word

Ya only reach for your hip when your two ways go off

Keep two 9's on me like Warren Sapp from the Buccs

And I keep chicks on my lap throwin' me head fakes

General status smoothness mixed with malice
Trips to Dallas built a pool in my palace

Who want what from more moneys I want a cut
Extortin' start from the corner step on us up
Sixty inch screen laserdisc with the beam
It's my life I'm holding the dice don't intervene

I send a team to smash out your whole plans
No cold hands liquid or hunger to hold grands
From state bids to large cats who lace cribs

Pretty thug style, I blow you out slug style

Bent in the Caddy Coupe me and daddy duke
He schooled me on how to stand on my own two
He said, ""Son it's all kinda shit you gon' go through
Either you gon' make it or you gon' fall too""

Hope the panties drop only if I cop
The baby blue drop gotta keep my wrist iced

Jumping out the range in the iceberg tights

Kids know the half, you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak at last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin' you, watchin' me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
'Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin' out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin' fort

In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked

Fiends yellin' out, ""who got those"" go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin' from court cases
Slugs shootin' past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down 'cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The mayor want to call the SWAT team to come and kill us
But, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three-six to eighteen
And only five in, the belly of the beast
Didn't want to hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin' off his teeth
We slangin' to eat, bringin' the heat

Nas,"My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a number two pencil
Stabbin students, grabbin' teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cuttin' class, passin' my reefer
In my own class, operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label to earn
Like that nigga said in ""Dead Presidents"", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage, respect Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep, polish baguettes, niggaz is dissin' that
I'm just the best, puttin' all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the blood ""los sangres"", blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison

My crew puff lye, anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try ""Now you know you done fucked up right?""
Hah, you ain't got no wins in my casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate a actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial college material insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter you shitter shatter, I'm the kid
Out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter

And spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that fagots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
'Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell I soak and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get Nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox, John Blazin'

My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass, keep the heat
In the dash, did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God, stackin' up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw, hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless, the anthology consolidated
With the quickness, dress up in the wig and blouse, killer sickness
Lex, imagination large, gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the Older God
Specialist, iciclist, Woolridge collar
Feelin' the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin', Don up in the line up

[Chorus]

It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise, undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, bust with guns til it hurts
For fuckin' with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster, with my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned?
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to parlay, I've had a hard day

With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

My cake thick, I live the life
Eatin' crab, watching bitches shake shit all night
I make the big moves, do the big things
Take small groups, turn them into big names
The big dog with the big chain, frostbit bracelet to match
Cats say I'm the shit man
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew
Type of dude that will do shit you won't do, can't do
Get more burn than a candle
Too hot to hold, too much to handle
In the black C-low, he know if she look
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no mo'
I'm ""The Truth"" like A.I., got the proof and stay fly
In the safest shit you could never buy
Know why?  Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
I don't know about y'all but every night I swing

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all ship a mil'
And ya hit a R&B chick and she fit the bill
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxin
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Went from wholesome to Jigga, you awe-some
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
What's down is a bet, roll the dice

Yeah, yeah, so let's play
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that
And personally your raps is where the trouble at
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain
In the platinum frame screamin it's not a game
Gleamin, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy

In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang

Bubble hard in the double R flashin the rings
With the window cracked, holler back, money ain't a thang

Jigga, I don't like it if it don't gleam gleam
And to hell with the price cause the money ain't a thang

Put it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bang
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang

He had coliseum jewelry no tito tricks 
(Nas) 
That's what he supposed to get 
Nigga play you close he gets hit 
Laying in dirt for something you say you get hurt 
Fuck around though, probably with some old school shit 
How bad you hit him up god? 
You he's ghost and shit?

Yo it's a body in the trunk son

Verse 2 
(Noreaga) 
I had the Queens hoodie on wit the blood on my sleeve 
Gave that nigga one offer he could take or he leave 
But it's a body in the trunk son it's getting scary

Yo send it, go in the trunk light an incense 
Spray the lysol all over the car 
I know you wasn't dead then but you're hear now paul 
Yo it happened like an hour or two

Wasted a little time 
Didn't want to disturb you 
(Nas) 
For some reason yo I couldn't sleep 
Yo slept with my heat 
Yo you think you in some movie shit son? 
I think you're losing it 
Pop the trunk who's the kid? 
You really had to buck him? 
You couldn't just snuff him? 
Yo he had to lose his wig? 
Fuck you bring him here for? 
What you think I could do? 
Somebody could've followed you 
Fuck it nigga I'll ride wit you 
Some real niggas gonna do what we gotta do 
Slide in this wip and we out 
Empty the clip in his mouth fuck it 
That's how we move in this game 
Rulin this game 
Niggas stayin true to this game

Nas: {Verse One} 
What? 
Back to back Benzes, wit the wild gremlins 
Gaudiere style lenses, talents in the 40 cal, this is 
Life now, let me find out, you want the life style of mine 
no pal of mine 
Runnin' wit goons wit knife wounds from jail time 
Got the squad lookin' like tycoon, we all shine 
While we parle wit the flyest mommy of 25th street 
Watch how honey in the Lex do it 
I'm in the 6 V wit the 12 next to it 
You want to stick me, then put ya best to it 
I die black, we see you in Allah Kingdom you try that 
Check the fly cat, 2 point 5 multiply that 
Cash rules, on my arm I flash jewels, and tatoos 
You can look, but don't touch we bad news 
AZ: {Verse Two} 
American Me, elgancy, treasury 
Wit the hopes to be rich before the bury me 
Born a Baptist, but moved on to higher practice 
My fire ashes, only macks I interact wit 
We all Dons, strong arm, all on calm 
But if it's war we on, comin' for niggas who crossed me wrong 
Select features, sit back connect the pieces 
Inject the thesis, spoke to my pops and left him speechless 
He saw me sprout, goin' through worlds that wore me out 
Never call me out, bitches and money, that's what we all about 
Through all the routes landed here, beach houses wit the chandaliere

Never want for questions, every move made is destined 
Black professors, let's take it back to the essence 
Another version, of the Goldie, mack, pimp servin' 
Convince the urban, project, ghetto prince emergin' 
Half Hispanic, hollow tips, massive damage 
The path was granted, loaded gats, blast the cannon 
chipped up, live by morals don't get it mixed up 
Dis what?, millionaire strut, wit the Crist cup 
Switched up, slow goin', gold showin' 
Doe flowin', eyes don't lie, hoes knowin'

Trained in mackin' never, rockin' Gators clashin'

Nowhere to go from here, but the top of this sphere 
Nuttin' stoppin' us here, we lockin' this here 
Wit the black toaster by my hip bone, fuck a holster 
See me at the Copa, platinum choka 
The God's wit me, mad blunt smoke, it's hard to miss me 
Pick one out of two dimes to twist me 
New nines is crispy, mind on chips, rhyme on shit 
that's strictly made for cats whose rich 
Excuse me, is that your bitch in my 6 
turnin' up the volume when she hear my hits 
On her wall mad flicks, now you want me blasted 
But don't get it confused over this rap shit 
Kinda laced, lookin' at diamonds in my onyx face 
Oyster perpetual Roly wit the day & date

Yo, for those who live the way that I live
We came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell

[R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side
Anything I want, I can say it's mine
No more worries 'bout how can I provide

Money makes the world go round
(Nothin' move but the money)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
(Said nothin' move but the money)

Oh, many say it's wrong cause I love to spend
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins
All I wanna do try, and let you know
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke

Money makes the world go round
(Money makes the world go round)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
Yes it does
(Still nuttin' move but the money)
Said money makes the world go round
(Money make the world go round, what?
Still nuttin' move but the money)
Nothing but the money
Money makes the world go round
Yes it does

Feels so good, yeah, yeah
So good, this life I finally live
And feels so real
So real this freedom I finally feel
Show me the money

Money makes the world go round
(Go money, go money)
You believe it if you want to
Money makes the world go round
(Go money, go money, yo)
Said that almighty dollar
Money makes the world go round
Yes it does
(Still don't nuttin' move but the money)
This brother's got to have it
Money makes the world go round
From sun up till the sun goes down
(Yeah, what?)
So much money

Money makes the world go round
Hey, makes the world go round
Money makes the world go round

Money makes the world go round
 Show me a man that don't need money
Money makes the world go around
And I'll show you a world

In these kicks, prince sneakers, jogs is loose,
Robbing truce, while my revolver shoots
Chinky eyed, devils is grin 
Purple range rovers, waking up with hangovers 
God damn I need my brain sober
So I jump up in the ride and slide 
Me and my nigga Jon Clue, just called he got the purple 5
Damn nigga's is live, Queensed out
Got to put the card hard jeans on

Henessey dro, use to only cop thug sacks but now I cop a oh
Six double oh, I trick a couple hoe's
Get em in my car, dirty shit all in the fucking floor
Clean that shit up now throw in outside
Took about four hundred G's to cop the bulletproof ride
Bentley its on, yo we on the world tall
We got a show on, top of the coliseum open doors
Let them rock-a-way nigga's in
Queens bridge starting shit, chill, calm it down we got to blend it in

Look at em, they roll me red carpets
Praising me as one of the dead profits
When I talk these nigga's heads bobbin
Strait out of queens with TNT, they did there first drug stain
With one and hundred cop shots, niggas with first scene
With D-Days and cop killing, laws was made
10 G's to a witness, you seen a cop get sprayed
What's on the AGQ club or club Mercedes
Sunrise, movie theaters to chill with our ladies
Load up the 80's cause cop killing craz is crazy
40 to basely, Q gardens to woodhaven 
To AQ that got booted barrel goddy that was made in
Whips on the vanwick queens day and shy stadium
Anything that's transported to New York
Got a come through the gates of either 2 airports

Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the live of rowdy packin' fifty cali's
Rockin' lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin' beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly Latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin' out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin' papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Domateus
Fakers get used to shootin' targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin' straight crimy in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army

So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggaz be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lex over who's petrol
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin' Cristal like it's my first child, lickin' shots, holiday style
Rockin' Steele sweaters, Wallaby down
Twenty-four carats, countin' cabbage, like the Arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin' Guinness shootin' catchin' cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano Frankie Aiel, Bugsy Seagal
Green papers with eagles from a tray that's illegal

Yeah yeah, get this money, yeah
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, hey yeah yeah

Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
It's choir attire standin' on ground with one pivot
Two players rockin' silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
Lands with name brand seats reclinin' like in spaceships
Bodies on ice
Livin' trife, rollin' fixed up dice
Gamblin' Grants
Handlin' stamps
Moves are sheist
My bankrolls, got the cops comin' in plain clothes
Tryin' to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
True
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamor
Cookin' up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin' scramblers in Alabama
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin' us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin' sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Caribbean suites, deep, rippin' beats with flows
Aiyyo, we went from standin' on blocks, without some socks
Sellin' rocks, to pickin' up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin' all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
'Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you
How I run the streets, I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's, I really wanna show you
Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you

I had the master plan
I'm in the Caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon' to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin' black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you
How I run the streets, I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's, I really wanna show you
Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin'
Take ki's 'til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his crib rated, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam, moms, sister, his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin' like nuttin' wrong, hustlin' again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin' up coke, a fiend holds it in a separate car
Cooks it up 'til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin' like Fright Night
Coppin' the motorbikes, the scooters, countin' dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggaz die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big, Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin' my weight in they titties and bras
My bitches out of state get busy while they pushin' my cars
Callin' me up, callin' me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' say 'Nasty'
Push the dash for the stash box is where the cash be, watchin' for task force
'Cause I know they comin' but I'm reachin' my goal
Fuck bummin', I'm makin' sure I leave this whole game wit somethin'
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin' at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby

Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you
How I run the streets, I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin' G's, I really wanna show you
Come and roll with me, I really wanna show you

Queens Day, cash made on Hollis Ave 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, makin niggas seem easy 

Yo
From the days of arm call niggas hung around blocks and corner stores 
Herringbone chains and fantasies rushin the door 
Niggas from Rastel poppin shells, snatchin rings 
Fly from shirt kings, from Queensbridge to 118 
I had my eyes open, steppin out into the world 
So fiendish, Ol' English 'til I url, growing pains 
A young kid, learnin early how to know the game 
USA Roller Skate rink, mobs and crews would take minks 
Clean streets, hustlers, crack cocaine 
Gave back by throwin block parties and basketball games 
A lotta cash made on Hollis Ave., fast and change 
High rollers was livin, until the Task Force came 
A lotta ghost towns and memories, bad blooded enemies 
So many died with the same gangsta pride that entered me 
Peace to them old timers, they who taught us 
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters 
We all glow, and I'm proud to be all that I know 
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, who I die for 
Survi-val, how we came a long way in solidarity 
Don't let nothin try an spoil this day 
To Run, D and Jay it's love and my thug salute 
'Cause real love's the only thing that comes above this loot 
Carhart jeans, it makes me think of LL's troops 
Let's celebrate, it's Queens Day, this one's for you

But three teens from Queens took over the world and never let go 
Just regular cats you know that just happened to blow 
Not anonymous with Hollis, Jake, Darrell and Joe 
Ay yo, we made so that others could grow 
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb and Nas Esco 
Ain't takin credit, we showin pride, look at us now 
Got haters mouths all open wide, wonderin how 
In some cases the only thing that father and son 
Have in common is they love for Run 
Been the illest since day one, I'm too advanced to ever be caught 
Who's more legendary than me...that's what I thought 
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this 
Peter Piper picked peppers...... 
And see I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it 
It's been a minute, I'm still the king of the world so don't forget it

Summertime Broyal Wilders Park used to be the shit, 
why'd it have to stop 
On the Ave. niggas blew on all the jewelry spots 
Kicked the shirt kings for an ill airbrush top 
That'll match my cortez Nike's 
Niggas gettin robbed at the back door comin out with bags 
We used to get our gold fronts, from Eddie's gold caps 
What y'all know about that 
I bet the whole Queens do, around '86 with the chrome bass crew 
The young guns and lost boys made the news
Queensbridge is story in two 
The story is true

Why'all can bounce to this

[
Cha Cha, I, I
Imagine Tuskadero, a.k.a. as the wife
And I don't give a damn if these broads don't like me
Cold as the freezer cause the baby stay iced
Heard the neck broke, how these chickens want to fight?
Might be the reason they lost complete faith in your market department
Scared to hear the release date
Keep the beats laced, sell a mill in each state
See the wife get the house and extra keys to the safe

You know this game that I'm in
The pain that I'm in
Esco, cars, jewelry
Catz be out to kill me
The last girl that I tried to make my wife
Was kidnapped, the ransom was an outrageous price
Still paid it, dangerous life
Now I seek out a gangstress made for this life, for me to bang with
I think you'll fit perfect
You're young and you're pretty
You're something that I can work with
We'll be running the city, ya heard

1 - 
 You gotta have money if ya dealing with me
 But ya gotta be a live one to get it from me
 You ain't never met a broad that's expensive as me
 And you ain't never met a thug that can pimp it like me
 Yo, you gotta have money if ya dealing with me
 But ya gotta be a live one to get it from me
 You ain't never met a broad that's expensive as me
 And you ain't never met a thug that can pimp it like me, get it

See mommy, and niggas pop me and replace me like copies
Crying for weeks, thinking what he'd do with out me
Your cake holder, flying all through the states for ya
The one who gets you out of the jams with the fake lawyer
Came along way from the pants-pocket inspector
The young beeper check, collect call acceptor
See I was with you, when you was a two figga nigga
Way before they knew you was that Escobar nigga
You best remember, who kept ya warm during the winter
And kept the judges paid through the whole trial in September
'Cause if ya every try and flip on me
Know everything's in my name that requires a key
So you'll be home missing car notes before you walk over me
Sorry to see, and sorry that you started with me
'Cause when you beefed, I kissed you on your bruised lips
Put you in your blue chips and your new whips
Now you don't want to lose this

Repeat 1

Who gave you bubble baths?
Loving you, bundles of cash
My tongue in you
Hummers to crash, bought you another one, thugging you
Chinchilla furs, Rolls Royce, silver spurs
Who hit it till it hurts, put ya in fifty skirts?
Before me you was getting jerked
Transporting any nigga work, now your clothes matching fifty purse
You was a thug mommy, wild in the club mommy
But now I got to know you, it's nothing but love mommy
I hold you down with the pump to the handgun
Prince Handsome, Escobar, nobody compares
In this cold world it's hard to find somebody who cares
And you was there, when I though I was getting twenty-five years
When them fake niggas left me, you stayed
When them jakes tried to arrest me, I only got away cause you sprayed
Top of the world, just us two, got you

Journey Through the life of some real niggas
Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen

When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast 
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body 
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my hoe close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that

Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder

You may find yourself going underground

Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars, 
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God

I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back 
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'

Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater

Expanding more to the big screen

But it seems you'd rather see me in jail 

With state dreams 
Want me off the scene fast 
But good things last

Back to the projects

Nothing to play with

People warn me, when you're on top there's envy 
Took my n****s out the hood but you doubt on us 
Sayin' we left the hood 

But can't get it out of us 
My bad, should I step out my shoes 
Give 'em to you? 
Here's my car and my house 

You can live in that too 
Criticize when I flow for the streets 
Hate my dress code 
Gucci this, Fendi that 

What you expect hoe

Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one 
Took a little time to claim my spot

Ride for the cause

Plottin, I'm sure to catch me 
With they glocks to my jaw 
Try stickin my up but I 
But I flipped on these ducks 

Instead of me

N****s fear what they don't understand 
Hate what they can't conquer

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes

Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit

Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big G's
Who am I to disagree?

Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear

with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty

For real G, I'ma fulfill my dream

Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it

A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smoking on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar

Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing

G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up, giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Getting put on to crack money
With all the gun play, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

My Bentley cruise the block, with the sun roof top
Hood rats jumpin' on my jock cause I blew up the spot
Crushin' your Benz, crushin' your Navigator system

Are you riding alone, can I be your date?
Come get me, get me, don't diss me, don't trick me
Got some friends, can they come too?

A hot boy, a rock boy, on top boy

But up in the sheets with me aiight
Gangsta, true to your gang, street master

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.

About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah

I'm like the farmer, plantin words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's

With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes

And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?

One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb

This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it

Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?

If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

You want to buy time?  I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you

Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'

Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.
Around the way where we from

Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain

Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder

But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

I want to talk to the mayor, the governor, the motherfuckin president
I want to talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin congressman

And we built this motherfucker
You want to kill me because my hunger?

Mr. America young black niggaz want ya
I want to talk to the man understand
Understand this motherfuckin G-pack in my hand
Look what happened to San Fran young girl hit by policeman

Twelve shots up in her dome, damn
Niggaz thought we slept but the architect sent
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now

Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggaz play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars plottin civilizations
Dissin us discriminatin different racisis
Tax payers pay for more jail for black latin faces

[Chorus]

I'm just a black man why why'all made it so hard damn
Niggaz gotta go create their own job
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved 

Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live  cart ack to get high
It's the ghetto life yea I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it

Now why'all combinin all the countries we goin do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang

Fake black leaders of puppets always talking bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin to the public
They eyes watchin stay wise move above it

Water floods predicted hurricanes twisters
Its all signs of the Armageddon three sixes
People reverse the system politics verse religion
Holy war muslim verse christians

Niggaz in high places they don't have the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this

I love you so much, don't never leave me, I won't let you leave

The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold

Heart-broken she walked right out of mad n****'s life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna loose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big

She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks

Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act
When she not around, I'm heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

[Chorus]
My money, money, money, my b**** is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my b****
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a n**** rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me p**** whipped

Ohhh money, money, money,
Yeah yeah that b**** treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
Its so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss

Embarra**ed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
N****s always expect to see us 2 together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup, 

'Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya
Seeing n****s wit' you I wasn't happy

Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich

I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you

Before you
Real n****s said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm wit you
You floss too much

Turn n****s out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you

You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I like'd you better when you where illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical

Now when we f*** we use profalactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it
F***ing me, I gave you back shots in ya A**ets

Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess b****es like you just grow on trees

Uh..
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars

Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five

Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our b****es in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was f***in'
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin'

To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?

Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo

To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense

Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin on the ceiling fan, I stopped it

Swingin' slower and slower..
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin'
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react

Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin' with some n****
Mumblin' s***, he had one hand on her a**
And she was rubbin' his dick, toastin' wine gla**es
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the s***

Searchin' for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm goin' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through

{Nas singing}
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?  * repeat 2X *

[Nas]
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip

Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin -- and probably still is

Snuck in my crib - some n**** f***in my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'm a grab shorty, I need you to grab the n**** for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she s***ted on me

Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly

Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, c***ed the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk
B**** tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot

Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face

Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin out we out like kamikazes
We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide

Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love
C***ed the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms

Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin
Put it on her ring finger c***ed the glock, and started prayin
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin

I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""

Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""

She was the modern ices honey dog she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used icepicks shiest list put you on their heist list
How we met it must have been fate first date crushed grape we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raised kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she want to live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home 
I called you hit me back i want to dig that did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at her future kids had
You held out for two weeks longer than these hoodrats
You precious more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together

I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil do I hear wedding bells?
My dogs throw on rice its the day your father give you away
To a real man I gently put the ring on your hand 
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now look me in my eyes and say i do
driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend a bouquet something in the back of my head say
For us two maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you 
As long as we are together its heaven for meto please you
Won't stop until I tell you to beautiful deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair its not days that go by
While I'm witch you that I won't even care 

You been with young dudes old guys
Hindus papas Colombians who cut pies
But none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones for those soft the baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who act crazy shit
until one day she decided to flip it was nothing I can do about it
Like she the boss and shit started talking this divorcin' shit
I gave her my half rib half my crib half my cake 
Half my car half my kid can't get that 
tried to swing on a god had to dip that 
Yo pushed her on the bed lifted her leg
Had to rip that all she wanted was rough sex with her slick ass
Had to sit back smoke a blunt and just look 
With her fine ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too

Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself

Where ya clique now

And take food off your table

Don't understand your mission

Check it out
It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fucking with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally
Beating up the block, leaving these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Kamaneze
Now dey a motherfucking see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggaz in New York
Coming kama-kize, sparking this shit that keep me off the heezee
Jay-Hovah, he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowing dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here

Nothing but the New York to Texas connection
Nothing but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreaming, think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas

You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfucking cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherfucking plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfucking mind
Him and whoever standing by, I'll tell these niggas, ""Let's go""
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwing up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckig mug

Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.
About to shoot us for revolution, that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar, or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, planting words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil, help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channeling, from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies

Ghetto prisoners

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real, what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men, not taking charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit, it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily, I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad

You want to buy time?  I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, begging for nothing but taking
Headed for nothing but the state pen, where they cousins be waiting
Judges is not relating to pleas, guns busting where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get canceled, D.O.A.
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustling harder than the generations here before he came
Going through the same bullshit as our fathers
Reading history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter

Nas,"Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me; this is what I am

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin' ""that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G
People warn me, when you're on top, there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now

I remember the first time girl you and me f-you-see-k-I-n-g

She was the modern Isis, honey dog, she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is I like this
Showed me how exciting life is
I used to hang around dudes that used icepicks  shiest list put you on their heistliest
How we met it must have been fate first date crushed grape we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raised kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she want to live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home 
I called you hit me back I want to dig that did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at her future kids had
You held out for two weeks longer than these hood rats
You precious more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hoping we can stay together

[Chorus: x2]

I see you dressed up in white face covered in Vail do I hear wedding bells?
My dogs throw on rice its the day your father give you away
To a real man I gently put the ring on your hand 
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend a bouquet something in the back of my head say
For us two maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you 
As long as we are together its heaven for meto please you
Won't stop until I tell you to beautiful deeper and harder love laying new with you
Running my fingers through your hair its not days that go by
While I'm witch you that I won't even care

Until one day she decided to flip it was nothing I can do about it
Like she the boss and shit started talking this divorcin' shit
I gave her my half rib half my crib half my cake 
Half my car half my kid can't get that 
Tried to swing on a god had to dip that 
Yo pushed her on the bed lifted her leg
Had to rip that all she wanted was rough sex with her slick ass
Had to sit back smoke a blunt and just look 
With her fine ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too

Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be Bentley'd out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya

You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit

Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna loose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I don't know how to act

The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup, 
Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya

Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife

Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
Stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark, NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve, they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building, come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain, strangle men
Niggas gaspin for air, til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes, tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
Father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggas, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
The sixth one's parole flipped, five niggas, went to four quick
When he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggas still hangin, years passin and slang changin
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real, he did the snake shit

The money rate, the paper chase, you know what I mean?

I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox

Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in or leave
Cause I ain't playin, niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
Runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
But it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas scheamin, some real, some niggas frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin

New York, New York
New York, New York","N.Y. State of Mind, Pt. 2",1999
Nas,"Freedom or jail, clip's inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell
NAS, NAS

""Nas is like"" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
""Nas is like"" Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blasting, tecs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it with you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

""Nas is like"" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning somethin deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night

See no evil, fear no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil, 
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nothing to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Know what i'm saying?

Yo, yo yo yo
Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant, her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Ki's of dope, loving cats to ski in her dope
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passing for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shopping when she not, copping bricks of that shit
She hopping on dicks, riding Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shopping for jewelry
Her bodyguard screwing me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothing new to me, blowing backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about, cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never cough once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, not since he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work

[Chorus]
It's a small world (""It's a, small world"")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
A very small world (""It's a, small world"")
where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
It's a small world (""It's a, small world"")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world
Watch what you do (""It's a, small world"")

Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home
from Attica known, for keeping chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
Five years planning to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks
Had a girl in Westside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.
Started robbing niggas til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starving niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Layin with his bitch, niggas is rich, is what he told her
Played the block, holding cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash

[Chorus]

I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
we let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull
Another thug died, pitching your soul, into that infinite
black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore, got niggas hit up yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope-fiend OD-ed, eighty-five
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where po-lice died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)
He staring at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit em
I'm reaching for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on
At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racing
out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
but can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now, put the tools down?  Never
Cause everyday is on, living this life, out for this cheddar

Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
Flashing cameras, dealers, shuffling cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five
Cause shells coming back at us while we jump in the ride
Flying, ducking, our bitches in the club clucking
Telling my wife who I was dancing with like I was fucking
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beaming
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleeping
Told my dogs peace, kept in moving, I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doing her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet, size twelve Timberlands
Something swinging on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swinging slower and slower,
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughing
Thought about my nine-side Glock but something made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey laying with some nigga
Mumbling shit, he had one hand on her ass
And she was rubbing his dick, toasting wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searching for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out bugging, whyling, what I'm goin' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm coming through

I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?  
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?  

Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
""Son you home early they wiped you out that quick?""
I said, ""Nah,"" showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' and probably still is
Snuck in my crib some nigga fuckin my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
Twenty G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock, Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard sirens, I guess we going out we out like kamikazes
We surrounded, red lights flashing, who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplating suicide
Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was going on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was saving
Put it on her ring finger cocked the Glock, and started praying
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listening
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope""

But I'm the mobster, Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha, you riding with me
You keep asking, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your hear, ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers, star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying

Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami

Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up

Caskets do you believe in angels or devils?
Welfare it's dark and there's no help here
Killing cops shooting black kids to instill fear
But we still here, not afraid cracks is made stacks get made
A ""g"" will get you gats sprayed
At my man's funeral it's like know body care
The police get shot, the mayor and everybody there
Graffiti on the lobby stairs, kids with naughty heads is greedy
Soldiers small faces painted on the walls
I was born to ball
Rings you can't afford, name a clothes line, I then worn it before
Dictate the naked soul of Nas henny four fives
Hoe's with thick thighs be the wives of rich guys
Never trust a bitch, 'cause a bitch lies
Enemys close 'cause friends switch sides when shit gets live
Dealin' with a lot of pressure, I'm in too deep

Ending up by the jaw of the throat another law broke
I try to patch it white kids is buying acid
Closing down spots popping a knot
Heard the foremores use binoculars watchin' the blocks
Calling phantom on the tape 
I'm the phantom of the wax
Now meat the man behind the music examing the facts 
I use it to my advantage, do this shit everyday 
Like sneaking gats up in grade eight 
Six Flags catch me getting on the popular rides
If a nigga violate, he get top of the line
Small hot ones locked in the spines
Transformed, roll out, pass it off to my man, no doubt
I keep shits disguising six shirts in the trunk
Imagine it gets six times worse when I'm drunk
Prepare for death first of the month
Open and rise, t's right here in front of you open your eyes
I can't explain it 'cause it's not normal 
Is niggas loyal, I talk about life and live it for you, this shit is soil

Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin my will you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids

Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggaz love to see when
Niggaz slippin off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin your ice, appraisin it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, want to get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin my wife

Keep it moving that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin
(Still crawlin) apply street rules to the office, high performance

Rap author, made millions off of melodic, hypnotic productions 
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions
(You feel me?  You feel me?)
You feel me?  I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggaz to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music
(Don't get no realer than this)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up  (what)
Hop out them shits like what?  Y'all niggaz can't touch us

Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin, gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way we came a long way

From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
Nastradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes
You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket

The, life, is, mine

I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the law
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you want to get down
Cause you're a big girl now

[Chorus]

Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every hoe that you know want to know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
want to follow me, Ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't want to talk
Don't want to hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't want to feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl see the world is yours

Power and crime, the thugs slinging powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques awards applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way

And I'm well prepared
We can take it there

You don't like me clown?  Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what?  You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shining, baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth?  Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-I
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who I'll as me?  I wild on haters in album three
Next level, I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers 
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard

If you ill come get me, cause I ain't running

You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of em dying
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
And dining, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
? to gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm getting head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block

If you ill come get me, cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, cause I ain't scared

Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns 
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, ""I don't give a fuck"" in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son (what)
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on

Hey yo I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You ballet?  They read your obituary, in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope-slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
Thieves on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, ""Freeze black kids!""
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh) put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?

Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason bein we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door

To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, as uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight

God love us hood niggaz (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uh
And I know he feel us, uh,
God love us hood niggas (I know)
Cause he be wit us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen, uh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uh
But he forgive us

He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the sirens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring em back today
So long my crimies now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They taking him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loading clips up, counting bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watching me

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood
I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood
Got my ways in the hood
Learned to play ball closer to NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh) in the hood (what?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

Better slide before you get bodied outside

Living hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail

I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you wit me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates falling apart
Call for the gods and let them out when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whispering)
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is coming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal

And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know

That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it

Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, ""Please daddy pay it""
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink?  Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money, is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck

Uh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He want to stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling wit you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe
And you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong?  Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut?  What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop tickin', get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up

Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne

But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you see over from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm

Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearing gold
Solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waiting lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers taking over they jobs

Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars taking pictures
New hustlers getting new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly starting wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's

You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrary
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothing make me more happier than seeing today

Nas,"What's happenin' brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time

Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
In spite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
We the assassins laughin while the New World's collapsin
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armored carways I'm blastin
As the Earth rebels now womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted blackness and hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yem and yaw
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and barred
All paper money is gone

Your sky has holes

Nas,"Black hoods, cops 'n projects
Sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Changin' top locks with ripped off hinges

Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
Vision blurry, cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era

Finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slave-house where gats go off, I show off

Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on

[Chorus]
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up, hit it up, *puff*

Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hi Satan, United Nations quietly taken, to own your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation

Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole ma**, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow

Perishin', brain dead from a Erickson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune

Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said ""go and see the world for myself, and my brother Shafala""

Sang the rules, guitar strings he played smokin' his ?

? hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' cause somebody pulled a knife out

So I look at this poem, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, ?
Reading's what I should've done, cause my imagination would run

I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlers and hoes, drugs and fo-fos
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eating, not killing everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
there's no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch that's fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hating
You can find us in the hood; thugging and regulating

Rege on the regular chops is up, like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator
If yawl wake I'll wet it up

With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge

Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hand
At the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor
Then we shot some more
Niggas he was with
2 niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tryed to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done before we bail, I ain't trying to goto jail
Must handle beef, code of the street
Load up the heat, if these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things
By all means, niggas knowing how we get down, it goes

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what

Driving through roads, suburban chevrolet
6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell
Could they be at, I'm about to leave
Steppin' slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that?
Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man
And we have the same plan
There them bitches go
Civic '94, looking funny though
Open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy
""Nas this is sherri, sherri this is nas, and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes
Plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam blam
Now I'm wondering, ""in this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they doe
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky
Coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain
Took his shit, emptied out close range

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what

A hood nigga wanting G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the jooks at?
These are your niggaz, creeping they be leaving niggas sleep with you
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speaking on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phoning lonely homey chickens
All the homies stick em, you think you own em man listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missing
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices

Pushing you to do no wrong, praying for you that you live long

This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops seperating
Spitting image of a gangster the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turning into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime following the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit

Now once again this is you, entertaining your desires
Bitches money and guns, aiming and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feeding your seed
Trying to eat?  You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By sticking up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy, my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit
And now the body experience, so now I feel it
Looking at my blessings, the bullets, that missed me could of hit me
Them court cases could of put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future, and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearing real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will til permanently, my eyes are closed

While all the old folks pray, to Je-sus' soakin they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter

Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne

I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
'Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip

Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin big Willie style

Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games
People play, bust the problems of the world today

Nas,"Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me; this is what I am

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin' ""that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G
People warn me, when you're on top, there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

Yo, the Lord is my shepard
The sword is my weapon
Reward is a blessin', that comes from the struggle
Shoes been scuffled, blood's been shed, another Mother loses a son
'cause where I'm from the young chooses a gun
Before they choose an education
But once dead their ain't no awakenin'
So like once said, life ain't for fakin
Yo, you wit' me when I say duct tape 'em?
Fuck waitin'
Got the truck outside, Benz jeep for navigation
Everything in position, they'd rather be fuckin' wit' Satan
When I aim I ain't missin', master of assassination'
I heard he call himself Esco, drive a Lexo
Rocks his hat sideways, showin' off his waves with a chipped tooth
Is this the truth?
This is what we do, sip a brew
Wait around his crib until it turns around two AM
As soon as he walks in the door we slay 'em
You guys got fat while I was away, so start payin'

[Chorus:]- Okay, you wanna play rough?!
(gun shots) (scratching - a thug changes, and love changes) repeat 3X,
Okay yo, we could play rough!

[Verse Two:]

Okay now, drive up to my crib, am I high enough?
Who these niggas tryin' to hide in their truck
I ain't order cable, why in the fuck these niggas
Ducked in they seat? are they lookin' for me?
But I ain't do shit, could it be that niggas thought
I slept like B.I.G. and Pac did
May they rest in peace, but while I'm alive I pop shit
P-11 glock spits 17 shot clips
Put these niggas in boxes, where they Moms and Pops is
Pull the strap from under the seat
Back up in the street
Watch these niggas that's tryin' to watch me, I carefully creep
Take off my shoes, barefoot nigga poppin' my heat
Empty every shell in their direction
Its you, I should've guessed it!
Same niggas that I was connected wit', I know sent you
Now I'm'a take you off here, you don't know what you got into

[Chorus:]

[Verse Three:]

Walked in his house, smackin' him up, ""what you talkin' about?"" he said
Shut-up nigga! knocked him in his head with chrome
Never thought I'd be in his home
With his wife taped up for my niggas to bone
Fuckin' with me, you should've known
I'll have 'em write ""stupid nigga"" on your tombstone
What money can do, get you hit for less than a G
For threatenin' me
I'm'a do it myself, take you to Hell, this ones for free
Killin' you niggas with nothin'
Left him dead, engine runnin'
You the only I'm makin' sure that gets what's comin'
Look at your Woman, anal ripped out, its your fault
They gang banged your bitch out in your face and you saw it
But before I let you have it I'm searchin' your crib
For pictures of relatives, addresses to where they live
Shit like that, incase a nigga wanna strike back
I'll be right up in his ass to blow 'em out with the Mac
Niggas treat you like Fam, and you on it like that?
Now you gotta lay flat, gettin' eatin' by rats
Gettin' even's never wrong, its only right to react
Eye for an eye, 'cause the sweetest part is payback
Somebody kncokin', who dat?
""a cop man"", let him in
And give that mothafucka one under the chin
Can't believe this nigga down with the Feds!
The copped screamed out your government before he dropped dead
Don't explain, I put the pound on his head
Blew 'em! before that I can't remember the last time I said......

Still a nigga, ain't never gonna get the fuck up outta here

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Niggaz die for the street glory

When tonight's pregnant girls strugling to get a cab
Fiends lurkin', D's searchin', pat pockets
Kids put to bed duck, they heads from gas poppin'

Queens bridge slingin', hoppin' our benches
Don status, throw feeds, got sirenges
Poppin' out they arm scratched, now, remember parked jams
Cause' else perfect ways, shell Adidas

Smellin' reefer, way before purple haze
Private stock, peer nigga, with ill walks like Mark Clare
Has tilted wild, niggaz, lickin' shots in the air
Me and Pop was there through the years, our names have switched

Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nostradamus and Blitz
What project is this? Q.B., burnin' in tint
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Niggas, seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember our name

I'm familiar with the dead grass drama, black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born, face and time
Niggas, shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame, got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?

Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's 'cause I see the past grimly

That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations, leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window

Watched the buddah clouds lingo
Pluckin' the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways

Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap, another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate

Like the battle on the thirty-eight
Snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs

When death calls, who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

Niggaz die for the street glory
Go to trial, get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And Q.B. the streets call me
So if you see me slippin', reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory

You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to kill that noise

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight

Yo it ain't just the music
Group aspirations or ghetto illustions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness

Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries

Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

Get ranked on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns

We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms

Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your hoe, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth

Nas,"Crime, life, bitches, money, time
For my Braveheart's, my Braveheart's
Uh, uh, uh, what, what, what?
One time, two times

From 'Breaking Atoms' to 'Illmatic', to goin' platinum
Shit did change course since rippin' it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule

Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin' cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave ya'll a way to rhyme

God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up

Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin' niggaz mistakes, visits at niggaz wakes
'Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggaz never wanna see you with it, fuck them tho'

Niggaz can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
'Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

Different ways to come out the hood, in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin' three pointer baskets
Or maybe, it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin' in doors

I asked a reverend, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What ya'll recommend is either dope weed or blow
'Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot

Duckin' truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin' at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked how much it cost

Korean man brushin' me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, ""I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?""

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggaz never wanna see you with it, fuck them tho'

Niggaz can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
'Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

To them niggaz who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin' bitches, comin' through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished

You first time in, you known for poppin' your toast
By your third year in you, forgotten by most
Niggaz wife cut them out of they life, niggaz don't write
Friends actin' like they don't be gettin' your kites

It be ill, niggaz comin' home and no time to get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled
Backwards in they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart in the projects

Who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggaz know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin' your 'dro

Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggaz never wanna see you with it, fuck them tho'

Niggaz can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
'Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out

Lost respect for those cracked out
Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang

It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would

First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin

That we was home alone tappin
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya

[Nas]
Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit
Hold your head little man, why'all can't tell me shit
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss

Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York
Talk to this hottie with my niggaz who quick to blast you
If you old cats, to these niggaz, they harass you

[Millenium Thug]
Hey yo 'cause, growin up, I almost shattered my plans
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time

A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes
Only twelve in this hell where kids die
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly
My Range shift by, I peel the road up

With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest
Wild as a teenage thug

[Chorus]

[Millenium Thug]
Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggaz
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that
Yo where your mack at? I got mine
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine

Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with
Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen

Under my glove shit rocky
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine

No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people

And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy

I'm the first that ever loc'ed on a Nok' track
CNN back, like number five Jordan's purple and black
We spazzed on purpose, fuck trying to sit in a cat'
I erase drama and talk, memories in my rap
It's kinda hard to rap on radio while I sit in the box
All I could think was money, send a few flicks to my pops
I give the street life my all, stripes and scars
Nights was hard, felt I had a right to rob
Now I spit righteous bars, FUCK living like the stars
Give me a hood crib and a Chrysler Dodge
Cause I'm just like why y'all, my kicks scuff like why y'all
I still get harassed and searched up like why y'all

Pone shit kosher you think not? I give you my ear
Now listen closer I was born, and I'ma die here
Listen soldier, I rap and keep one in the holster

Knock you out position, and have your little hoe missing

Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a New York state of mind, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors

Let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron, no pryin' rules
Let my niggas live, ayo let my niggas live

(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you

My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
dealers, bitches, killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat, pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it

Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the night sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace for him, is all I could whisper
as I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggaz have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..

Jump aboard here on this train

Yo, yo, yo, yo, hey, yo
Never will it stop
Hang guns with double digit shots
I move work on other niggas blocks
Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, hour
Beats is knocking, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cooking with beer
Like the Bobby Wilmack of crack
Might see me in the Burgundy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clapping em' down, backing em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm what's happening now

Grab ya guns, soldiers ride (show discipline nigga!)
Kill ya moms, kill ya pops, kill ya seed

Sell ya E, sell ya smoke (you hustling nigga!)
Grab ya nine, grab ya pound
Grab ya tec, grab ya pump (you busting at niggas!, what)

We brave hearted, I had bitches trying to poison me
Niggas who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and ice sticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killing over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holding dead rappers ? in my palm
Burning flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus America cause that every car that's driving
Holding the ? you focus you know its Nas then,
Prince of the globe, leave no prince of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankenchise with a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus a waste of evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creep show, but yo

Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)
My niggas is happy, ya momma is sad
If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas is snitch, been judging my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changing the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Call this girl after dark so we talked the bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, I ain't taking the L or wasting a shell
I bring the heat like I'm Satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say that this is a war
If in the four, mackign a pump, acting I dump

Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty
Middle fingers up and say ""Fuck the world""
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out

What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana

Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to

Yo
Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumping out Chryslers, easywider paper
Pops puffin his sess, punching his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursing front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant something
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was hunting
Living carefree laughing, got jokes on the daily
Y'all acting like some old folks y'all don't hear me

Yo, dude is 31, living in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slinging, got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watching Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smoking L's
In the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sitting on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he want to be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth, he's in his second childhood

Drinking smoking hates her baby daddy, craves shopping
E popping Ecstasy taking, won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changing, stuck with limitations
Lusting men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel
With nothing in her bank account fronting she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay working, mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flying she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doing well

Nas,"This is a journey into the worlds most largest
And notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most
Cowardest rappers

[Nas]
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like telling some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his names Cory
Hung around my mans Like and Big Trevor
Trevors still locked up, Likes getting his cheddar
Cory changed his name to arr, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat lookalike, its Mega
Right Mega was his name sorry about that
But its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing
But thats Nas always looking out for breadrin
Cause when brethren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughing to the bank and shit
Back to Cor, got him a deal but his rhymes was whack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch you from around the way its sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Chorus x2]
They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

[Nas]
Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies
Mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies
Theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arther and Knight Sir Lance-A-Lot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what nigga you're butt and it got back to me
Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You aint from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.
Nature moved to Marcy
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy
Back with ass niggas in fear
Fuck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we aint friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Chorus]

[Nas]
I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P how many times aint you shamed that
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back
They dont respect you a checks due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm saying your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position cause you'll never be king
Even Jigga want the crown, ?? poor thing
I'm representing Queensbridge U.S.A.
Where two sk's go off every day new flesh lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

[Chorus]

[Talking]
The bridge is over my dick, Bridge'll never be over
Long as I'm alive and breathing, Braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm saying, just get them unloyal niggas
From out your circle, you can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga
Be untouchable my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real
And thats real, ayo Nature I can't hold your hand through this shit man
I'm not your father man, be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself nigga or dont even rep this
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta? Theres real gangsta
Shit going on in the streets man, yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man? Niggas be bucking
Why you never bucking, where you be at man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin Neo Brown of the fucking hood
Its disgusting man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherfucking mouth
Theres no more room for jealousy, we destroying and rebuilding
That means the cowards get out and the real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine, shining
with suede motherfucking balles on in silks
I'ma always be the young don, dont be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggas in Queensbridge
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby

You been on my dick nigga, you love my style, nigga

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you the king you know you

(Lose) I prove you lost already

Brace yourself for the main event
Y'all impatiently waiting
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big
Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne
I got this, locked since '9-1
I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiin Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
Check it

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you the king you know you
(Not) ""God's son"" across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Hey yo, pass me the weed, pour my ashes out on these niggas man (no doubt)
Hey , y'all fagots, y'all kneel and kiss the fuckin ring

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you the king you know you
(Not) ""God's son"" across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some ""well wishers,"" friendly acting, envy hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big
Dick sucking lips, whyn't you let the late, great veteran live

(I, will, not, lose)
""God's son"" across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
(I'll, will) Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you the king you know you
(Not) ""God's son"" across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad, watching his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was getting chased through your building
Calling my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the god
Wearing Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo hoe, trying to work it out, you tryna' get brolic?
Ask me if I'm trying to kick knowledge
Nah, I'm trying to kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rockafeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?
Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you getting girls now 'cause of your looks?
Ne-gro please
You no mustache having, with whiskers like a rat
Compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Caine, to Herb, to Big
And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-riding fagot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons
Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shaun Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is goin' come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss",Ether,2001

Blessings in life to the children
They say life is like 5 days
Words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me

Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
'Cause animals and sweetness, sharks smell blood in water

Ishmael, Moses and Gob, moved a divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, coppin' the five

Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers
Hollow tip, lead busters there's no heaven or hell

Dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with god
Your mind keeps lurkin' to earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'
Live to see another mornin'

For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'
Live to see another mornin'

It's blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality loaded with vast stories
Of lust, greed, and contempt no street is exempt

Extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin' em hustlers pitch rocks
All you paintin' pictures of my pain
Illustrate the city in vain

Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind
In these fatal times, vesh crimes
Nickel plated nine and niggas from the dime

Hear the sounds of them baby's cry
Still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain

Breathin' in the game, exhalin'
Guilts and the shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring
Look at anthrax, I stand back through
Hopin' I make it through tomorrow

My skin is a art gallery, right
With paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders

But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with benz's and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'

Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a lex
And spendin' time in chuckie cheese with little des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter

Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl

Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the father

I'm lonely...
Hold me, it's gettin' darker

For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'
Live to see another mornin'

For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'

My country shitted on me (My country)
She wants to get rid of me (Naw, never)
'Cause the things I seen (We know too much)

It was packed on the Ryker's bus
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

Me that don't give a fuck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20 inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hog tie gag
Forget the life we had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see for miles the land it's major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back

Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe

But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in this system, I'm bout to rebel

There's not a bitch in sight
All block bench, all block gates
All gray fence, look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown man cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Every time I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the news flash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I want to escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

Word to Will, buried in his fila suit and heavy chain
I want to be iced-up nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under beds, mask and a flashlight
Living my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Bopping to the supremes, smoking joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

[Chorus 1]
I did it my way, from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door
I did it my way, never gave a fuck what nobody said
I did it my way, they hope that I fail and wished I was dead
I did it my way, if I fucked op it falls on me
I did it my way, I'm lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

[Nas]
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Juzzi's, Gucci soap, throwing cash in the air
Though I, still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get with I got
They think its a lot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not
But i be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game, y'all can't relate, fuck y'all (I'll Will)

[Chorus 2]
I did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, I call it how I see it niggas
I did it my way, if you don't like it so be it niggas
I did it my way, I make my own rules, I do my own plans
I did it my way, gangstas do what they want
Suckers do what they can't
I did it my way, taking sacrifices kid
I did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live

[Nas]
Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony
From blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesel
Here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminiscence and remember, sitting on wood benches
Gave me splinters, just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, moving
I think the ones who said shorty go home, we about to be shooting

[Chorus 1]",My Way [Snippet],2001

Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh

[Intro: repeat 2X]
No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

[Nas]
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find
where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin, I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
""No Half Steppin'"" with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
on a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made ""Runaway""; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers want to be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like
Somebody's always watchin, my life
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they want to see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son
Dog, whatever they call you, god, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending

The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closing this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screaming, ""Shoot don't please""
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewinding a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Going reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out something crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sitting in back of this chair, we hitting the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holding my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya
'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemies the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed thinking 'bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell""
She talking 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started sucking with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left her nigga behind
Walking through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited Vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voice mail on the cell
It said, ""Son we found that nigga we gotta kill""

Hey yo son, hey yo son, you hear me, you hear me?

Bitches flapping they gums, do he be clapping and shooting guys

What is his race nation or creed?
Is he Arabic, black, lating, Asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants

Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start
I shall, stay real stay true stay holding figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never, cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs

Turn my voice up

Ayo, the brother is ""stillmatic""
I crawled up out of that grave, wiping the dirt, cleaning my shirt
They thought I'll make another ""illmatic""
But it's always forward I'm moving

Never backwards stupid here's another classic
See-notes is falling from the sky
By now the credits roll starring nas executive poet, produced, directed by
The kid slash escobar

Narration describes the lives and laws tribes in the ghetto trying to survive
The feature opens with this young black child
Finger scratch, cigarette burns on the sofa, turning the tv down
Mary jane girls, 45's playing, soft in the background

Food from see-town's mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walking out the door, all of us paw
I learned the difference between the snitches, the real ones, and who's soft
And the murderous, hungriest crews

People jumping from roofs, shotguns pumping made it through my youth
Walking very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses

Walking through the hot desert searching to be free
This is my end and my new beginning nostalgia
Out for the in a mega places, it's like a glitch in the matrix
I seen it at all, did it all, most of why'all been pop for a minute

Spitters, sinners and the game get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all didn't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap reaper man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggaz who real

Professionals, stick up childs dreaming for meals
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From crypts to pirals this is survival

Blood of a slave, heart of a king
Blood of a slave, heart of a king
Uh, uh blood of a slave, heart of a king
Uh, yea
Huh, braveheart",Stillmatic (The Intro),2001

Nastradumas, astrologic, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now its loads of baguettes, prefer a mack-10 over a tech
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldiers, cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""Nigga light that""
Hoes you fuck, ask you where your ice at, dun
Its all about playboys, when we was young
Can only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
Fuck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

(Its what they want) fuck it

Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of bitches
Hung up my riches, her childest wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'
So when your click roll, I let my clips go, Niggas on opposite polls
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhuman, living hostile opposed
To living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, frantically foul niggas
See niggas in blast, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you and chill, chrome objects
Hit you in your projects, its street anomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger painting
Get off your ass, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting 
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment 
Now back in the hood, certain cats they want to kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Nas,"Hey yo it's poison, ecstasy, coke
You say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison

Niggas up in my hood be getting shot giving poison
In hospitals, shots rittle the block
Little children and elderly women run for their lives
Drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies,
Must be out my fucking mind, what is this, the hundredth time?
Sending flowers to funerals, reading rest in peace
You know the usual, death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
It's funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
Fast food, cola sodas, skull and bone crosses

It's all poison, ecstasy, coke
You say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison

Sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
Stop working hoping that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless, thinking a perm or
Bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
White girls tanning, lypo suction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips that's life destruction
Light-skin women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves
Denying even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I overstand the mental poison
That's even worser than drugs

Yo it's poison, ecstasy, coke
You say it's love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison

Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plow

Never to worry, all the wrong doers got it coming back to em
A thousand times over
Every dog has it's day and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em
Everybody reaps what they sows that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it
Y'all be strong

The China-men built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed em
They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hellday
Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles connecting and we hitting the lad
This is my level, fuck if it get you mad
It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about keys, it's all poison
How could you call yourself emcees you ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison

This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey
Light skin with herpes
Fuckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.
This is the problem cause he never tell em he got it
From letting fags suck him off Rikers Island in nine-three
Drives in Benz, hangs in all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
What's your name, where you from, chain blinging
Thinking girls every wheres dumb, taking powder ruining their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDs
I contemplate, believing in karma
Those on top could just break and won't be eating tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
They leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowing dudes that's neglecting their seeds
Instead of taking care of em they spending money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies
Cause when them kids get grown it's too late for you
Now you old and you getting shitted on
It's all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas

Nas,"Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the top of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas, too real, Nas, true king
It's however you feel, g'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with god
I don't kill soloists only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming
Soon as I popped my first bottle I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since ""Barbeque""
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said,
If I, ever make a record
I take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since in the project, crack in my socks weep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now

""You're the man"" ""You're the man""

Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la'
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings and Ghana stay
So I could get on my flesh right away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N the A to the S-I-are
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
Forty-five in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like my conception
When everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne
My destiny found me
It's clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful

Now slowly, thinkin' of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fuckin' pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (hoe)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
Cause she want to dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggaz too (ha)

You couldn't catch us in a car without the bangers
Believe, I touched a couple of movie stars and entertainers
Indeed, one in particular, almost started to name her (ha ha)
I was there when you first pushed up and started to game her
Been a long journey, certain shit just don't concern me
They ain't hurtin' shit; we flip, they hire attorneys
Yo I'ma stay custom, 'til I'm old grey and rustin'
Reminiscin' the number of chickens that claim we fucked 'em
Bet some badda hoes than them other funky rappers chose
I'm tryin' to wife a chick, light a spliff (okay)

Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's

Nothin' but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin' heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion

So, you tried to front, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
You ain't real, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)

My, first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoos real with ""God's Son"" across the belly
The boss of rap, you saw me in ""Belly"" with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and Tupac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames should huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads apparel
But the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast, 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody, uh

I got mine, I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You from the hood I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You want beef? I hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So, you tried to front, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
You ain't real, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)

Yo, I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life
It's the return of the Golden Child, son of a blue's player
So who are you playa? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"", with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow
Flip the beat back, now it's all reppin'
Hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

I got mine, I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You from the hood I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You want beef? I hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So, you tried to front, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
You ain't real, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)

It's, the, return of the Prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist gliss, I floss
Stick shift, look sick up in that Boxter Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody want to know where the kid go? Where he rest at?
Where he shop at and dress at?
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back-twister, lingerie-ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta wit' ya, uh

I got mine, I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You from the hood I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You want beef? I hope ya (got yo'self a gun)

Nas,"Visualizing the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's ""the baddest""; a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But something must of got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some resting in peace and some are sitting in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping the effervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thieving
We'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere else stacking plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff la
Cause you never know when you're gonna go

I woke up early on my born day, I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbing foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels
And rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smoking blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying ""fuck tomorrow""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic that crack your whole cabbage

Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high

I look at the bright side, the fact that I got a life side
Born 73 (September right nas)
True, virgo child
The first thing I learned is money makes the world go round
On a small planet, its 10 women to 1 man
I wonder how we managed
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures, bitches even nastier
They throw it at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky ho's licken niggas ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragen till her baby dad went nuts
And now were looking for me, 2 cars deep
Rollin up on niggas
Barrel out da window, asking (you nas peeps)
I can't here dat 2 4 5 nigga grad at
Pass it to me sucker for love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me into trouble, I pissin bubble
I thought I felt a sharp pain betta stick to rubbers
When lain, hooker after hooker down and day
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name em
Just a thought we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent
Fuckin' entertainers, and basket ball players
The bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all il say ya put your dick in her dough

My nigga james got married same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was to stuck
Studied for her masters, part time nurse
I tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
And I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, syke, cause james and me like
I was with a z like, luke and han solo
Fuckin with niggas girls, forbidden, that's a no no
It's death and we're real niggas civilized guards
And there ain't to many niggas like nas I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheatin
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life even
Happy for james cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he was lucky an clown something
Rollin up duckies while watching roy jones in round one
He froze put his to the t.v. about an inch close
Move outa the way nigga what the fuck the matter with you, you blind
He pointed to the front row, thought he was losing his mind
She was supposed to be with her sick mother
Left for the weekend, stress when she was leaving, now she next to some nigga cheesin
He's having trouble breathing (breathing)
He pictured them making noises, grindin em and kissin em
Yellin, ain't no telling where her lips have bin
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser then
Ten minutes later and they start wrestling, and screamin
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at the fight you speakin
That's vegas this is new york you bugin
I held up my hand for dat, but he wouldn't touch it
I was like when you started actin like that, this is dumbness
Gave me a crazy look and started swingin punches
I ducked couldn't believe it, the niggas so wet 
He got his gad and started squeezin, hit two police men
Neighbors dialed 911 they heard the thumpin
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumpin
Me and his wife hit to the floor she smelt strange
My comrade was breathing no more they killed james

Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in

He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong

Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
Drivin they cars, robbin connects
Drivin his Lex, keys was movin
Young don, now they know they weakness

They never seen it comin
Son was on some real take over the streets hit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?

Dudes be, comin from bids thinkin shit is different
'Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear

Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
'Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only

So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain

Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low

Will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil

Past the milky way and all the planets

Nas,"New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starving
Pushing cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
""What you up to, the cops gon' bust you""
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
If God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Staring at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwing them bones
Hoping my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoeing
While he looking at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showing they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lying
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I want to crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezing
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out, nobody leaving everybody

Some niggas fuck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, disappear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chilling
They had the coke game something crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or something
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggas ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we lounging, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, ""Nas I got your back, the fools don't play""
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thugging and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Should of never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Opening the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had something to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't fucking with you
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherfuckers

All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?

Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)

Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It ain't you it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you

If Heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherfucking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it

Three times a week, yo keep trying but people
Is hard and God your young soldier's not so bold
But needs you

Nigga what you think I'ma stop building
I'ma stop feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
Not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable 
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.

[Chorus]",Heaven,2002
Nas,"The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in ""Set It Off""
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', ""Hi Nas""
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, ""Sorry I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room""
Nine push-ups, Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know When will they learn
Nas need a queen not a hoe to
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue, A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbecue I call Professor and Ock
Cause you point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cause I'm lovin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be cruisin'
But let's take, it, slow

Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we, suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got, we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cause I'm feelin' ya energy

Hey Nas, how ya doin'?
Take my name, and my number
Meanwhile, we'll be groovin'
But let's take, it, slow

I can be, what you said
That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby

That you need, I can be, all that
I can be, I can have your back, baby",Hey Nas,2002
Nas,"I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Gotta astrung when I heard when
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Prince that's when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)

Nas,"Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought ""Kick In The Door"" was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still tripping off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'mma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rocking at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, dropping out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representing the rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changing, I had a baby
I was making my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticing my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in with more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready To Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performing at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the balling starts
He had Kim in his crew, I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggas
But dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on the purple tape
Bad Boy biting Nas album cover way
Big told me Rae was stealing my slang
And Rae told me out in Shaolin, Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with ""Ain't No Nigga""
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today don't know nothing, about this boss shit
There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

Rap became a version of Malcom and Martin
Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal? Puff soaked Interscope offices
With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama's on me
Cause previously it would have been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone planning
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hitting the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores
In the Firm I learned I Am NaStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama
She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? Fuck that shit, the first shall be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo

Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

No reason for your mans to panic
You don't want to see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just comin' homeys, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty

Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers
Protect the children, grab revolvers

Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
And be ready to die for what you believe in
And ride all the time not just when convenient

You ain't a man you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in

The most beautiful place in tha world
If you in the hood, the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey, the best journey, its a mansion
Acres of land, swimmin' pools and all that, check it out

I'm capable of anything, my imagination could give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things
Kids walkin home from school, on drug blocks, missionaries
Pass out papers that read love god
I see faces cases, judges n jurors, masons lawyers n cops
I watch 'cause every thugs face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
Sixteen years old did his jail since there was no where to go
Every mornin' calls his commrad to come n get em' a smoke
He insane already gone mad, blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where his sets at
Sling from dusk till dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his ass was flarin
Smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin'
He needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin
I give em a helpin hand, bring em out to Thugz mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy

Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion

Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the hommies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook drinking
Peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace that last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy

Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, jus' thugz who collide
Not to start beef but to spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin'
I'm just twenty some odd years I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Anne Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
With angels songs, with golden rings, in Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy

Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind o' waitin' is scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I subject to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight through his heart I'm still alive how did I make it this far
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way 

[Chorus 1: Alicia Keys]
This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 

[Nas]
Like King Nasir fightin' the
British regime I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost in their world
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to
God that you ever have kid I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Want to pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but
I can't keep still I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, fuck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole 

[Chorus 2: Alicia Keys]
This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior

Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 

[Nas]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful If you was me
All this pain I'm feelin would bend and killed you
(I'm a Warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause
(I'm a Warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found I guess it's just a warrior's way 

[Chorus 1: x3]

[Nas]
To my warriors
To all these, baby Krucial
Keys! Braveheart y'all
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words:
Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, why'kno keep marchin'
Yea yea yea, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha

Why don't y'all blast on these niggas, man

Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cats nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, , four head gone 'n
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit
Back in ya hand, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals
Tryin' to wild out there so crack, bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
Fuckin 'em hos, born to cope since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray Mack 10 and a pocket full o' dimes

Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but fuck them hos
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin',
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My moves erase a ton, your son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket

Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said, for me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's that, who made this style, solo or X
Are you TFO's doctor or Mobb Deep
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryina show niggas are rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a fuck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga inchin' a bus
You got a house in Virginia
The only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous fuck
No need for the gun play, it's ok, 'cause you dyin' anyway

Yo, this is for them Heisman drop outs
Niggas who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back
Braveheart's gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have a bike on a bench
Now I got a jeep on this trip
Coke in the pot, heat on my head

Nigga don't stop blazin' 'cause ya target's movin'
Shoot 'till the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And that's Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Running from D's quickly knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm all about
To all my real niggas

Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet

We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe

So I put the cards in yo hand
All I know, when Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

Money, cars for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me ""This ain't right""
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say

Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start

You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do

I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be leaving without you (Leaving without you) {Huh, this life is crazy}

Nas,"Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, everyday is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Cezar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then?
Must it go on, we must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, ""dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town""
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must
Open up his eyes to the set backs and rise
'Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors increases, to home it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all it's residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a hot light now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm goin' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid and unless
Popping any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now

World is hating, that's forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World

Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm saying?
Niggas ain't forget nothing
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of life
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about
This is what my country is, and my country's a motherfucker",Rule,2002
Nas,"Yeah
I want all my n****s to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous

Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo

Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
'Cause I'll go back to spirit town

So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist

He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they don't
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

[Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
They must want to keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive

When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm that's no lie

Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me

But month 3 was closer, see
that's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well

Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large

Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73

Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, a lot of s***'s gonna stop
See how the government will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced

Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out

Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said ""At least that n**** ain't ugly!""
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother

Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
why'all bout to see this world in trouble

All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell god forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holding 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothing is fair, niggas roll up, shooting from wheelchairs
My heart is racing, tasting revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggas really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothing in our way, they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!!

All I need is one mic, that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic, there's nothing else in the world
All I need is one mic, that's all a nigga need to do his thing why'know
All I need is one mic,

All I need is one life, one try, one breath I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Or want to see me on top, too egotistical
Talking all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blasting cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? fooled you niggas
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashing
War gets deep, some beef is everlasting
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifing each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggas throwing dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Should of knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blinding, I never make the same mistakes
Moving with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swelling my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard he was, telling police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searching, the time is now

All I need is one mic, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic, that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash
All I need is one mic, fuck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic, to spread my voice to the whole world",One Mic,2002

Fuck a vest, put a bulletproof hat on your head

When I'm clappin' the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say he not the feds, then I'm servin' the nigga
I'm thirsty for the change, playin' games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now

I got that coke and that haze on my gristle now
We goin' to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwin' missiles 'round, you still tryin' to get a nine'
Uh, it's the last days, end of time

The terrorists jackin' planes, sendin' bombs to the Pentagon
They off the hook like intercoms
We just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil' when it's dinnertime

You still spendin' time focusin' on dumb shit
On the block smokin' but you broken on some bum shit

I Soo Woo with my crew, from under Young Wayne
A walkin' motherfuckin' flame livin' up to my brothers name
Rockin' that red shit, wasn't fuckin' with them other gangs
Amongst other things, they wasn't fuckin' with me
Ain't your average motherfucker, I'm a motherfuckin' G
I got some shit on my chest that I want to get off

Stay on my hood shit, hop in the bucket with ya
Throw the ski másks on and get to straight fucking with ya

Birthed me in the drug spot, nigga with a attitude
Searching me is fuck cops, nigga pay your gratitude
Before you say I'm acting Ruth
Understand I'm tryna feed my people
Hati just like Compton the way I'm packing food
But I will act a fool, put cheese on your head
Motherfucker I will Green Bay Packer you
Have a whole football team of niggas after you
Like the public turn, when will you fucking learn
Now take your ass back to school
Wait till three o'clock click clack at you
And fuck with your conscience like back packers do
And I ain't Talib, Black Though or Mos Def
But I've seen the most deaths and nigga I'm just telling you

Nas,"QB the whole NYC 
We gonna bounce to this 
To all my niggaz (yeah yeah) 
To all the ladies 

Chorus: 
Sometimes I wonder 
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger 
This game is risky 
If a nigga slips six deep 
Will these niggaz really miss me 
Dead partners too soon 
All these niggaz flipping on me 
Cause I won't give no loot to them 
Sometimes I wonder 
Sometimes I... 

(Nas) 
Top of the world is what I'm aiming at 
These niggaz is flaming gats at my circle 
I catch you, my first reaction is to hurt you 
I hit your bird too, two in your scalp then you out 
Your thug crew is out, blood oozing out 
Some serving caine 
Knowing nothing about this murder game 
Its easily told but hard to hear 
When niggaz finally find out its real 
that's when they heart pumps fear 
The real remains the weak will disappear 
My words is 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear 
911 style sits on your mind like chrome 
Lets say your brains is V12, put it in drive let it roam 
What color? Might as well make it same as your dome 
You need your thoughts together, that means destination is unknown 
As we travel on this road, an infinite path, I get into this math 
Drop and get intense for this cash 
Will I be subject to kill, live my life by a gat 
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back 

Chorus: 
(Nature) 
I know a lot of fiends by they first name 
Living in Queens, a lot of cats getting stuck for they chains 
Holding dirty guns, the young owe dirty ones 
Running wild, niggaz I raise hell above ground 
Live in sin, holding rocks, benjamin grin 
Figure once I got knocked, it would end 
Never that 
They try to tell me I don't love my own 
The thugs know, they ride my zone 
Like the cyclone trademark 
For coney isle, yeah you know me now 
I'm giving fake hugs, phoney smiles 
Stack profits, you know how the niggaz on the block get 
Try to give you dap to stare at your pockets 
Cruise advance nothing new just the rules of the land 
You could tell if they wolves or lamb 
You could fight a few, there's a few that ran 
Or you could feed them and lose your hand 
What you want to do? 

Chorus: 
(Nas) 
Blessing be to the ones who left us 
Transcend into spiritual essences 
In Allah's arms you rest in 
To him we pray for my peeps 
Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sunny back in the day 
Get the money yam, he use to say not only nice with hands 
But streetsmart he was twice a man 
I try to understand life's deep plot 
I think of Weewop, Shikeisha they both was mad nice on the rocks 
They could have went pro but only God knows why not 
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers not be clean 
He'll start snapping on you, making a scene 
Kept the lye, a cool nigga warm heart and stayed fly 
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face 
Are you there pa? Or looking on from a distant place? 
My thoroughbreds, Blackhead quiet but real 
Expect to see your black jeep fly over the hill 
In the spirit of Richie Lou tribute 
Remind the world of the crimes that NY pigs do 
We miss you, Harry and Sonia 
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier 
T.J. Black better known as Killer 
I can't replace you, but in me Havoc will always have a brother my nigga 

My man Will till we meet again 
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here 
I hope you hear my prays clear

Nas,"It ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet. invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
'Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up

School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks

Nas,"What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should of slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flip it, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome s niece, on her way home from joes beaches club
Plus little rob is selling drugs all the time
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort, now I represent to the fullest
Say whats up to herb, ice and bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? one love

Dear born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in new york the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm a put it to a cease
When I heard you blew a nigga with the ? for a phone piece
Whylin' on the island but now with ?
Better chill 'cause them niggasz will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
I maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next v I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks
Plus ? flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four Maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind (dies)
I hate it when your mum cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs
For one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, etcetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the week and hittin' nails while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in belle vue
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty
Do I roll them two phillies together and the friends we call them oowops
He said nas, niggaz cold be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce
He inhailed so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these bitches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'cause when the pistol blows a shot that's when a murder be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
If the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only the bolder herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for jake shorty what

A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key

Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin for somethin..

[Nas]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catchin feelings

Chorus

[Nas]
From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, givin a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?  Gettin put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

Chorus 2X",Street Dreams [Remix],2002
Nas,"Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
Where the homeboys are meaner, but let the bullshit come between us

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?

Strap up when it's time for war
Stack up, every penny money over these broads
Back up, against the wall in the right or wrong
I pledge allegiance to I-N-see, it's the clique
Until I die I'ma ride for my niggas, through thick
And thin, playa and we playin' to win
Steady ballin', soarin', long diggin' these broads in
Now my brothas keep my slugs a street and pluggin' heat
Ya fuckin' wit ma family so undastand be	
There's no me without them, all we got is us

Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it
Underground in they casket? Ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day, there is no Lazareth
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
What do we own? The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies

[Chorus]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)

[Nas]
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars
We've already gone insane
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality; too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
On our own people and, fuck black leaders
Cause whites ain't got none leading them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet-less
All get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation, black zombies

[Chorus]

[Nas]
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
That's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas",Black Zombie,2002

Is this love? somebody's wife fuckin a thug.
Hitting it raw, tasting it, wildin out on my character, taping it.

Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs.
Millions, she would get, if his neck got slit.
She rolled the equality, then passed the lye ta me.
Told me bout her mans life insurance policy.

Twelve point five million, he kept his funds in the Lloyd's of London.
Goes to his wife and his children.
Yo I thought, what if shorty gets scared, electric chairs all I vision.
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision.
I'll switch the plan, then maybe fly to Switzerland.

Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare.

Uhh Uhh  Where am I going? 
Where am I? Yo  it's ill 

(Verse 1) 

Yo my wife's tired of fucking me 
Life tries ducking me 
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time 
Mack in my right arm  Tequila bottle in 
My left arm like Cristian 
Watching my life go  keeping myself in 
Wolves in the night yo  hells men 
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin 
Hop in my Benz  push it to the limit 
Buck sixty  who wit' me? My (?) to well 
Twisted blunts and inner conscience 
Telling me that I ain't shit 
No matter how much cash I sit with 
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness 
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain 
To replenish my adolescent brain 
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane 
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain 
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets 
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat 
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive 
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is 
To maintain, bitches playin' games 
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names 
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang 
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed 
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash 
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me 
Instead they speed ahead 
Yo nigga watch me 


Chorus: 

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat 
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef 
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to 
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to 
Steering wheel in my hand 
Trying to hold it steady 
Anything in my way is dead 
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already 
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone 
Drunk by myself 

(Verse 2) 

Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once 
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts 
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves 
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well 
Take them to hell 
Stick up niggas once ran up on me 
My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me 
I ain't your mark homey 
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake 
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes 
Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision 
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison 
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision 
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos 
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico 
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated 
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me 
I hate it when I'm like this 
The bottle's my accomplice 

Chorus: 1x 

(Verse 3) 

The reason that I want to be alone 
Tired of all the things that went wrong 
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own 
Take another swigg 
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts 
Fake friends who hung around who want to bring you down 
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through 
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true 
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately 
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again 
To keep my mind off that weak shit 
There's love through it all, things to live for 
I swerve, almost crash into a wall 
Think about the good, find myself laughing 
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached 
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets 
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home 
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip 
Bring my ass to the crib 
I'm tired...

Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village 
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers 
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war

You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqo fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em

Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher 
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but

I know where niggaz sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggaz get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggaz back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that go t prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation 
Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe

Nas,"Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous

Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo

Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
'Cause I'll go back to spirit town

So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist

He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they don't
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

[Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
I shot my way out my mom dukes
They must want to keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive

When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm that's no lie

Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me

But month 3 was closer, see
that's when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well

Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large

Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73

Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, a lot of shit's gonna stop
See how the government will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced

Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out

Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said ""At least that nigga ain't ugly!""
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother

Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
why'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...",Fetus [*],2002

It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

No idea's original, there's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
""No Half Steppin'"" with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin'
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
You're part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrapping with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothing less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watching for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shining since Roxanne Shante' made ""Runaway""; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watching
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever

You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin' damn wish my niggas could afford this
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried will your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real

Taught us right nigga

My old dad imported to the family structure
Provide her god
My moms a queen at university civaliza
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned out the johnny carson
Jumped out the bed
We grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other
My papa played the street all day
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding
But still I didn't see it
Mama hid it from us
We was kids younger
Till we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love

Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
[repeat 2x]

So many kids I knew, never knew what pap was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I fucked up
He could have left
My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fist fight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing
So then I asked him
What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?
Papa why you butt ass from the waist
And who's this lady I'm facing
Dark skin you're not my mommy
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand little me
Was in you to side me

Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down

Pop's told me hold my own
Pop's told me value home
Could I help it papa was a rolling stone
Who loved the pretty brown round
Out of town bound
Jumping in his jazz benz he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how, I do my thing now
I'm in the game now
And heard of it his brain pow
To pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are same now
No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
And beats that be pumping
Before he left he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life next day they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed

Always will

I still feel you kid

Light it up, uh

The whole, city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it, it's just an intro
Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it
Writing, across the stomach spell GOD son
Life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots
May the ghost leave a body, now they haunting the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's taking they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, laying low with a bottle
I'm blowing circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uh
Yeah., . light it up, light it up, uh

Y'all just want to deal with drama
Talk about niggaz who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma
Everything you went to is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you molding soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died trying to be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standing, still roaming through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowing all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs with you even now that's ready
Trusting your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holding a mirror
Lookin down a tear in jail, making weapons to kill ya
We smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowing smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up light it up, uhh
Light it up, light it up, light it up, uhh
Uh, uh, uh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble
Reacting before thinking, they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinking
When we should be climbing, in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewinding
Instead of moving forward, to blow up so what's the science?
People shouting, police pushing the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hanging out him
Am I hallucinating off the hazing?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces
It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you
So, my state of mind's all purple",Purple,2002

Nastradumas, astrologic, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now its loads of baguettes, prefer a mack-10 over a tech
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldiers, cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase ""N**** light that""
Hoes you f***, ask you where your ice at, dun
Its all about playboys, when we was young
Can only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme ""Don it""
F*** it, too many crabs in the bucket
If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of b****es
Hung up my riches, her childest wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'
So when your click roll, I let my clips go, N****s on opposite polls
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhuman, living hostile opposed
To living on the streets, proper from my top to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon n****s in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, frantically foul n****s
See n****s in blast, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you and chill, chrome objects
Hit you in your projects, its street anomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger painting
Get off your a**, stop complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting 
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment 
Now back in the hood, certain cats they want to kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, n****s feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it

Fuck around and you get wires in your mouth
Cowards I despise and my power keeps on risin 
Niggas try to hate me but they keep recognizin

Pop pop your body drop from a couple shots
When you see me in the street, we can handle the beef
If you see me in jail you know you dead meat
I be fighting and stabbin, shooting and laughing
My ratchet blast on top of you bastards
Committing sins in Cincinnati
We'll drive by in all black caddy's
A 21 gun salute

Pussy, I'll put a slug between your eyes
And stand there and watch your punk ass die

Since birth, I'm cursed, the worst motherfucka in da state
Time and time again you niggas back down, laugh now

Bang him duff him, actin like he don't know what's going on

We used to meet at the motel
Heart break hotel
Body hypnotic exotic as hell
Got a nigga in a spell
She from my dreams
Girl taste good like carvelle ice cream
A few tattoo's on her butter soft skin
I gave my support when she had that abortion
Remember I could make you warm in the winter
Buy you a mink coat every December
And laugh and joke about the shit we been threw
Then you open your legs and say be gentle
I'll try I can see they spark in your eyes
It's gonna be fireworks like the fourth of July
Untouchable, unbreakable, intimate, multiple orgasms...
When I be rippin it
Your favorite positions, neighbors be listening, 
Hating and wishing that our relationship end
But you my brave girl

My baby girl is stuck stupid looking miserable ma keep your head up
Cause ma I'm right here let's do the damn thing girl it can't be love
Cause I be waiting a minute for your walk by
Listen I'm lifting your legs up in the air my only vision
While I'm stroking thinking about money and smoking
Hoping we could do this again and again and again and again yo
I feel your pain I'm leaving your mouth dry your man can't do this ma he to lame
Keep him of your brain
While you let me do me on you drove off as soon as I came

An architect, doctor, maybe an actress

Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Gotta astrung when I heard when
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right

We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes

Be, be	-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice

Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person

Gotta astrung when I heard when 
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath

'Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

[Chorus: x 2]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I want to be (be what I want to be)

Be, be	-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID

Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 

Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice

You don't want to be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books

To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans

The Persian military invaded 
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 

Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 

If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
They learn to survive until they gain control

Niggas on my dick beef don't stop
Niggas asking what happed to the Firm
Did you and AZ bone Fox? No
How was it working with Dre though?
Heard you was fucking Lil Kim and Mary J, Whoa , the list goes on
There is rumors that Brandy broke my heart
The world want to know what's in the life of the prettiest Don
Nas, was Jay fucking with your baby mom's?
Was she involved with a plot, to deceive my perfect degrees of
Three hundred and sixty, he ugly she pretty that's life
Never been married eloped with dope; Music's my wife
It's true, me and 2 PAC once steped to each other
Confronted our like's and dislike's in front of Suge Knight, we left it as brothers
As a child pop's blew his weed in my face, results, mixing ether with base
I'm the rebel to America, less is the nasal voice chipped tooth bastard
What your hearing is a replica
I never had a clue, that all you dudes should be in dresses
Double edges playing both sides of the fences

Am I crazy what they make me out to be or what?

The streets say what up wit Lake, not showin his face
And did he really shoot at the Jake's?
When he just came home, and dude shot at Capone, for his necklace
Why was Lake name mentioned?
Was he reppin on the island taking phone time?
Did he get Prodigy his chain back in ""99""?
Who's writing his rhymes? He is
Do he be with Kingpin like Delson and Jesus, What was he thinking?
On Revolutionary Warfare when he said, He's a modern day Hitler
Did he shoot more niggas, Than every dude in QueensBridge?
Why his last case made the daily news in June?
Do he have the strength to unify heads from BX to Harlem?
Who did he stomp and walk naked in his Projects?
Did he get shot in his chest, never fall with no vest on shoot duke and walk off

Nas,"Uh, yeah, yeah, yo, it goes tick tock
This is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits pop

Hey, hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys' pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

5-8 with double-X-L, pen saggin' blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine, a felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity, the chance to live sweet
Think positive k-nowledgement k-cypher complete

So you can be an architect, design apartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set, I'm never on a chick, I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet, it's just the booze

Check my niggaz, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb, all I see is niggaz runnin', chin shots
All I heard, dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down

Now it's back to the same old shit
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines
I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit

Bloodied up, screamin', I'm dyin'
I be in Queens where the famous hood rats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz, well, live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

It's like this nigga, it's on, toilet up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live

Well, first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
""Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open""
Gangsta, I soaked it all in, my first ammo was a one shot

Deuce, deuce, had my pockets full of bullets, I was real loose
Thug parties out in wave crash, always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queens bridge, always got shot up

No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggaz aim on the fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that old English Red Bull and Blue Bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit, fuck it, we was broke

Little bad ass, my nigga rap sat me down, like this
He said, ""P, you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind off the street""

And it stuck in the back of my head
Though I still did my little bit of menacin'
Every now and then bang-outs in broad daylight
Like these things really happen
Niggaz get cut up, I put it in my rappin'

It's non fiction, it's the real deal fiscal
It couldn't get more graphic, I'm so trail
I said, it's non fiction it's the real deal fiscal
City you havin', let me touch that ass

So tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop
Get your tick tock from this hip hop, any day

Tick tock, this is for my niggaz in the bridge, blocks
Comin' through, better hide your wrist watch
Because niggaz well live they shits popped

Hey hey, tick tock, this is for my hoes
Make your hips rock
Light a L, baby, let the Crys pop

Rappers arguably, started fuckin' up the game horribly
'Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targeted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me, lyin' to me

What I've discovered is my brother's tryin' to be
The next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see
Jealousy he love me to death, am I buggin'? I love him for life
We both still mournin' on our mother's life

A six, a truck, some guns to bust

Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin'

Gotta keep a lot of heat, 30 cals 10 millimeters
40 cals plus the heckler to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the tech about
Huh? I'm stressin' out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy

We can sell mo', boats on the coast
Give, coats to the po' and give hope to the broke then live low
But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
Will love you but lead you to they own hidden evil

Bitch you the reason niggaz be beefin', hoe get on
Posed to be earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day, million dollars ain't what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggaz, most involved but they fake

Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-getting style, rolling foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesus, soaking their sins in trays
Of holy water. Odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction. All the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction

For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded

I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lamping, Big Willie-style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild

Walk the blocks with a bop, checking dames, plus the games

Nas,"Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta and braver, I pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass
40 side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't' a damn thing gonna change
I'm a perform a strange show the mic wonder was born the game?
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

It's halftime

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got at him, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off wit my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels to never run it
Wit more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, kid, surprise
This is exercise til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
Kick my little raps 'cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fucking man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S, now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a fagot
But not a bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
'cause in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be fouled whenever I freestyle
I see trial niggas say I'm wow
I hate a rhyme biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime

It's halftime

I got it going on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the narcs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey or heartless Sparkton
'cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slaying them fast, doing this, that in the third
But chill, past the entree and let's lay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo-fo
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten

The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout

Kids cheer me like the count of monte-cristo
Steady poundin' soundin' like g without the lisp though

This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes getting blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenuptial agreement
cause Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
cause she deserves Cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbing
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away 'cause this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggaz laughing, and its baffling
cause just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatching Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggaz in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married

It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit you're crazy aunts and uncles
'cause I love you much, 'cause you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standing
Heart pounding out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm staying I'm saying vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talking to
I'm getting married

I ain't mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you crying?
Y'all got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with.
Yeah, I know they know we talking.
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, stop cryin' now.
Oh, there's something I gotta tell you, I heard they watching you, yeah they watching you.
They watching me too.
But there ain't no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, I'ma stand up for you, no matter what; and I know you'll stand up for me.
I don't have no doubt about you being true to me.
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us.
So study, be strong, don't cry no more.

And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?

Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'

And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home

As days comes and nights falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn

For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy, my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home

Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children?
Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleedin'
Cryin' a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speakin'
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

As days comes and nights falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn

Live now niggaz, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I dropped pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga

It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, ""Me a victim?"", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now

Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo

A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggaz in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress

[Nas]
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
my taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie

Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggaz pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said ""My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum""
They judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggaz wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she want to feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Caribbean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
'Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oh-whoa-ooh-whoa

I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops 'cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggaz gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? 'Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
in her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

""Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what try to conquer all.  
So what? To all my niggaz with they kids that love they kids, man.  
All the daddies out there to all the niggaz that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know.  
Yeah, yeah ladies forgive us.

I think I can remember some

Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my urethra
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker

[Chorus]
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you

[Nas]
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious want to cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer

Mighta been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six bars
To ten LP's, what can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?

Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstasy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', water bed seats in his car
All red ferari, Florida where we met at a red light
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limousine, Benz
He shouted, ""Nas, roll with us""
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Don, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him ""Here keep that""
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life

Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican, half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'

Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's calling, but I don't answer

Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
Next to me in the Phantom, who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps
With they bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where feds be laying from a dreadful slaying

With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky

If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
A thousand times harder than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
We possess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning

[Verse 2]
I take summers off, cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheet
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd

Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Rule which car heart, gun powder stains
Smellin' like trees, set some mill on the brain
Skeemin' on ya girls, bamboozled on ya chain

Got ill up on the train, twistin' off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Death crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
'Cause you bought a drummer sooked, from one of my boys, it's

.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em

Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night

[Verse 1:]
January 28, 1968
Born into this world as William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch Long Island
Scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with

Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This
'87 dropped a classic disc

The facts is the tracklist was like four
The vocals, the beats -- according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative

This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
'Cause Clarence 13 next had New York on lock

Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearin' Kurtis Blow saying
""It can't get better than this""
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits

From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre

Supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap
Forte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn

With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote ""Smack me and I smack you back""

Sounded like the answer to the ""I Ain't No Joke"" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzin' from Wyndanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddie Foxx

Totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son

A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, some was watchin' him, mesmorized
Respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

Nas,"[Chorus]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

[Nas]
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those
Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', got no,
My chauffeur driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll  take her
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize
I stopped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride stop 

[Chorus]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
'Cause she's standin' on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

[Nas]
Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, ""never disrespect me""
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart toppers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

[Chorus]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down

Nas,"Cup'a hen', cup'a goose, cup'a Cris'
White chain, colored watch on a wrist
Switch lanes in monster whips, ambiance
Specially dressed, guess who?  Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just order dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggaz are SEX
Yes, we get respectic, eclectic messages
Left our brains, grit into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she's touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction

NAS, then they ass, over-spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties, bubbles, call head skull
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't fuck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us

Don't talk, just hold your breath
Been here a while, there's only one nigga left
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song

Uh, from a boy to a King
Love the rock diamonds and fancy rings
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mayn
I'm fuckin' something tonight that's on everything
Fellas who beat bodies with me
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks
Old cats only roll when I'm in the city
And the dance floor it's disgustin'
Move your waistline to the basic percussion
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'

And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song
Bass beat bang
Bass beat bang
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song

Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes
Her light eyes, pretty lips, fly face
First you said you would spread for me in an instant
See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you way outta character
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On the eyes shades in the nighttime regardless
The army's so thick you can't harm us

And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang

Nas,"I know you think you got it together player but fuck the bird
You with and listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch there's always
One thing wrong and you wish that you could switch or fix
While you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper mad niggaz in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it, my stupid dick again
Searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about
Leaving a nigga with nothing so my experiences taught me
How to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man

A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her I creep in the night
Like a kinky undertaker I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd
From the Ivy League, next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one
And flee what's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant
To kidnap the chef, say goodbye to the stress

I know you think you got it together player but fuck the bird
You with and listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch there's always
One thing wrong and you wish that you could switch or fix
While you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever these surgical gloves
Are made of love, couldn't be better four cycles of blood
Child birth first menstrual cycle, last menstrual cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth put 'em together
That's a genius, a slut and a chef holdin' the scalpel
While cutting the flesh heavy bleeding, so I need suction
It's such a mess if she survives she'll be sucking me next

Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck
While she do my taxes for the IRS so I could just relax, shit
By now I'm blessed I'm her daddy I'm her Messiah, I'm God
'Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad 'cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath

I know you think you got it together player but fuck the bird
You with and listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch there's always
One thing wrong and you wish that you could switch or fix
While you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem body from Ketoi Johnson
And Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms Maya Angelou's brain
And some groove from Terry McMillan them Angelina Jolie lips
Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit helping me load clips

Some words form a pimp was, ""Nas, it just don't exist""
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without, without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt

I know you think you got it together player but fuck the bird
You with and listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch

Nas,"Yeah, yeah, yeah

You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, comin' home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby, turn to young thug, description might fit you,
Look around it might hit you, no joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's goin'

The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggaz from gettin' stacks
Feelin' trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple

From the day you were born
Starring out, a young disciple
You had that gleam in your eye
Disciple of the projects
From the day you were born
Street's disciple
Yeah, disciple of the projects

Moonstruck stuck, slow as molasses in my actions
That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin' Tyson
After watchin' him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin' back at it, blow jobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin' no static, told some lil' niggaz they can have it
Coke baggin' and toe-taggin'

They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true 'God's Son', not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin'
Not to his likin', and say, ""Son they bitin' you""
He never got to see my debut, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggaz frontin' couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple

From the day you were born
Starring out, a young disciple
You had that gleam in your eye
Disciple of the projects
From the day you were born
Street's Disciple
Yeah, disciple of the projects

Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knockin
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants, it's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhymin' to music all this time
Fightin' 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it

Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezin'
Hell, if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again, fuck these
Devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them, riskin' my freedom
Burners in bubble coats, fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's, young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples

From the day you were born

Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
We sipping on Merlot, you ain't got be my girl though
I drop you off at, Willoughby and Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo, ain't got to take your shirt off
You seen me convince your homegirl though

Plus she says her life is too hard
She says that she want to come and build with the God
Promise that she gon' play her part
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
And, she's damn fine, feet Hammertime, damn if I mind
Love is the bu-bubbling back of your waistline
I don't waste time, gotta GET GET ON IT
Just you and me, two glasses, sip on Patron and
in the club scene where I met Ms. Green Eyes
She walked by asking me, ""Are you Nas?""
Why? ""If you was I'd be totally TWI""
What's that? ""Totally with it, T.W.I.""
Ha ha, well, here I am, yep I'm the man
Bartender put a Cosmo in that girl hand
So, here we standing before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem
Tongue skills, yeah I like that, now we on the right track
Straight to my Phantom, call Africa Black
Ever since then, she been yapping a track
Told her friends, now they hollering behind her back
Sing!


Now I was, so fresh and so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining
Bling! A little cute thing said, ""What's yo' name?""
I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain
Oh oh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
Blow! Ludacris in the hoouse
The needle hit the record, they was playing this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back chilling in my be-boy stance
Could be a little pop locking if your girl's top droppin
But watch for cock-blocking on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that
honey in the black cause I'm feeling her curves
He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD
Why only serve one when we can serve up two
Then at the bachelor's pad, doing what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover
So we can have sex but I can't be your lover
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
Sing!


They got my voice for the record and my voice for the beat
Virgo proof baby run the streets
So let's go (let's go) let's go (let's go) for the beat

Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz
Little kids scared cops, wit bread dots

Philosophical gangsta, where violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin' on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, or anybody tryin on the blocks I'm supplyin on

Mighty call, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the penal got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of

Mortar, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians

 Where fake niggaz don't make it back 
 I don't know how to start this shit yo now 

 Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kickin 
 Musician inflictin composition 
 of pain I'm like Scarface sniffin cocaine 
 Holdin a M-16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now 

 Bulletholes left in my peepholes 
 I'm suited up in street clothes 
 Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes 
 why'all know my steelo with or without the airplay 

 I keep some E&J, sittin bent up in the stairway 
 Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the celo champs 
 Laughin at baseheads, tryin to sell some broken amps 
 G-Packs get off quick, forever niggaz talk shit 

 Remeniscing about the last time the Task Force flipped 
 Niggaz be runnin through the block shootin 
 Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston 
 Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and 

 I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin 
 Pick the Mac up, told brothers, ""Back up,"" the Mac spit 
 Lead was hittin niggaz one ran, I made him backflip 
 Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look 

 Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck 
 Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger 
 Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber 
 So now I'm jetting to the building lobby 

 and it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be 
 (So whatchu sayin?) It's like the game ain't the same 
 Got younger niggaz pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name 
 and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners 

 In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us 
 Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact 
 Same niggaz'll catch a back to back, snatchin yo' cracks in black 
 There was a snitch on the block gettin niggaz knocked 

 So hold your stash until the coke price drop 
 I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock 
 And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo 
 You gotta slide on a vacation 

 Inside information keeps large niggaz erasin and they wives basin 
 It drops deep as it does in my breath 
 I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death

 I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind 
 
 New York state of mine [Repeat: x 4]

 Be havin dreams that I'ma gangster -- drinkin Moets, holdin Tecs 
 Makin sure the cash came correct then I stepped 
 Investments in stocks, sewein up the blocks 
 to sell rocks, winnin gunfights with mega cops 

 But just a nigga, walking with his finger on the trigger 
 Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger 
 I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin 
 Give me a Smith and Wessun I'll have niggaz undressin 

 Thinkin of cash flow, buddah and shelter 
 Whenever frustrated I'ma hijack Delta 
 In the P.J.'s, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays 
 Young bitches is grazed each block is like a maze 

 full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed 
 From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back, black 
 I'm livin where the nights is jet black 
 The fiends fight to get crack I just max, I dream I can sit back 

 and lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn 
 Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes 
 I got so many rhymes I don't think I'm too sane 
 Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain 

 and be prosperous, though we live dangerous 
 cops could just arrest me, blamin us, we're held like hostages 
 It's only right that I was born to use mics 
 and the stuff that I write, is even tougher than dice 

 I'm takin rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow 
 My rhymin is a vitamin, Hell without a capsule 
 The smooth criminal on beat breaks 
 Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes 

 The city never sleeps, full of villians and creeps 
 That's where I learned to do my hustle had to scuffle with freaks 
 I'ma addict for sneakers, twenties of buddah and bitches with beepers 
 In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya 

 Inhale deep like the words of my breath 
 I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death

Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Coulda died, so young, no looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and right
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
It was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They learned about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
They learn to survive until they gain control 
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Prince that's when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my queen""

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Theres no we, it seems I can't get free 
Sombody tell me what's happenin to me 

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
The country bud got me chokin 
I'm on a mission to the point motherfuckers think I'm smokin 
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the H-shot fifth 
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit 
Don't you know that killin is thrillin 
All the blood spillin, is all up on the drug dealin 
A broad gangsta my daddy was a thug 
Had a .38 wit the hallow point slug 
So when he lit shots 
Niggaz dropped quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor 
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes 
Payin dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's 
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster 
Got the Mac .11's swingin from my shoulder 
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain 
I'm livin in a house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Is anybody listenin and tell me can you can see this God be surroundin me 
Now it's gettin colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin hard to breathe 
And it's gettin blury, I'm gettin worried cause it's gettin hard to see 
When your lampin in the house of paaaiiinnn 

[2Pac] 
When the motherfucker dust kicker, who can you trust? 
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga? 
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue so many foes 
Bustin motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go 
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame 
From doin fix to bustin tricks out the fuckin frame 
Got these bitches on my jock niggaz on my block 
Jealous ass suckers got it duckin for my fuckin glock 
And bustin niggaz ass is to stay alive 
Skinny ass playa watchin victim motherfuckers fry 
They ask me how I'm livin? how I'm a hustler? 
Buckin busters ‘til they die 
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard? 
Niggaz got they AK's headin for the bird 
Aimin at free ass bitches let 'em rain 
Givin 'em, wettin 'em, welcome to the house of pain 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 

[Nas] 
MJB, be worried niggaz, yea, Nas... 

Wendy Williams say I stayed dust maybe I should 
cuz these rappers'll have your phone tap like Savion Glover 
And on the West the police corrupt, some are bloods 
But these Teflon I loaded explodin some mugs 
I'm like Furious in ""Boyz In the Hood"" 
But at the drive through I'm ain't runnin I'm dumpin 
Crazy like a paru and load up, know how Nas do 
I'm callin Henchmen to save shit, to organize a black truth 
And we party hard party wit Nas 
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras 
And Bush won't apologize 
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize 
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize 
Ya'll yellin my name but y'all soon die in 
Tryin to portray real but they be ly-in 
Cuz they want the real niggaz to die so they can game 
But neva that, this ain't neva lastin this is the house of pain

Y'all niggas is crazy
(To think) y'all niggas can't fade me

Anyway I got to get it, I'm givin' it all I got
Y'all haters can't hold me.
(No Way) And y'all don't want to zone me
(Want it your way) So when I get, I'm gon' get it, in my life how I live it
And whips I be whippin', smokin' on the exquisite

In the crib, two bricks of coke, liquor and dope
Pretty Hawaiian bitches who eat choch and deep throat
Same niggas that get down, remember them
California style, yeah I went back again
But much wiser, 'cause these guys are
Leave you up shits creek and won't lose sleep
So while we pack the heat, I got the heckler and koch
My man got the dot, five-oh block
It's like the movies shots as niggas watch
But the American version
East coast, west coast as we connect these curtains
'Cause we ain't scared to buck, step on the Timbs and Chuck's
Is gonna happen, gun clappin', remember that
Now we on the southern part of the map
Houston, party of the year, everybody there
Texas, no guest list, only real players allowed
Me and my dudes make out rounds 
Y'all must be crazy

VA game spittin', platinum grill grinnin'
Chrome rims spinnin', with wood grain glistenin'
Any amount we sippin', passion for thugs livin'
Free, fresh and out of prison
Flexin' that new edition
Good grain gettin', shit and lovin' the feelin'
Bobby Womack singin', Marisa Rings gleaming
Hat cocked duce, puffin the quarter loosely
Poppin' the bottle and tippin' fifth of that to goosey
Shinnin' for Swill and Halle, smokin' for Lil' Shawney
Still reppin' Bad Newz, and all my soldiers for me
Enjoy some better days, dispute burdens I carry
See cousin hookin' money, for God momentary
Floss every chance I get, spread love freely
Still spittin' gangsta shit, 'cause the streets need me
Still got that mack with me, for niggas actin silly
Still pimpin' gangsta pretty, reppin' in every city

[Chorus]

Yeah, I pray every day for a better life
I think it's gon' get better but it's like I'm never right
Make about it Christ, I'm on both of my knees
There's no hope, that why I'm smokin' the trees
Damn, all for the chees, I lost both of my mans
That's why this toast is in the both of my hands
Damn, and I'll sell coke and birds 'fore I go to work
I go to the Range more than I go to church
My whole mentality twisted, but this reality isn't it
I ain't tryin' to be fatality listed
And yo reverend, gettin dough is like goin' to heaven
And goin' to jail, like goin' to hell
But before I go in the grave, I'll go in the cell
Just send my son mo' dough in the mail
Oh well, but I got god on my side so I'm beatin' the case

I can't control it, can't hold it, it's so nuts
I take a sip of that yak, I want to fuck
I take a hit of that chronic, it got me stuck
But really what's amazing is how I keep blazing
Towel under the door smoke until the days end
Puff, puff then pass, don't fuck up rotation
Hypnotic for Henny, now nigga that's your chaser
Turn nothing to something now pimpin' that's a savior
Best things are green now pimp and get your paper
High off the ground instead of skyscraper
Too low thinkin' we local, come on homie, we major

We major (come on, homie, we major)

Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say yes to soon
Until you have a daughter, that's what I call karma
And you pray to god she don't grow breasts too soon.
Projects to' up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorty's write rhymes just to blow up?
Get they first car and then IRS show up
He ain't never had shit but he had that nine
Nigga come through flickin' and he had that shine
Put two and two together in a little bad weather
Gon' be a whole family on that funeral line
Ask the reverend was the strip club cool if my tips help send a pretty girl through school
That's all I want like wino's want they good whiskey

I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line, should it be about the hos or the ice?
Four-four's or black Christ? Both flows would be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man's plight
At the studio console asked my man to the right
What this verse sound like, should I freestyle or write?
He said, Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, Stillmatic
Picked up the pad and pencil and jotted what I feel
Been like 12 years since a nigga first signed
Now I'm a free agent
And I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
Cause rappers be deprived of executive 9 to 5s
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony where King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasting longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way my change came like Sam Cooke.

Feeling better than I ever felt before today
Like better late than never is orientation
Still we can make it better throwing all your cares away

I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'mma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'mma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (hey mama)

I just want you to be proud of me (hey mama)

Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin' to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say Mama, now everybody answer me (hey mama)

I guess it also depends though, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (hey mama)

Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'mma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (hey mama)

To everybody who knows my story
To all of those who came before me
My time is now I'm goin' do it all over again
Ain't nothin' new ain't 'bout to change
I'm still gonna do it my way
Yeah I still remain

Felon, fights behind me on the intersection
Sex and drugs my anthology on perfection
Dress superb admired by conspirists
Who wanna try me but ain't high enough to 4-5 me up
Child of the 80s, y'all niggas is lazy
Complainin' 'bout labor pains nigga show me the baby
And my nigga Game light another L pass the bottle
Pro-black I don't pick cotton out a aspirin bottle
Yeah I learned my lessons and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin' with narcs confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on my niggas I'll bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water but can't make 'em drink it
And I can show them my fortunes but can't force 'em think rich
And still I'm out on the boarder wonderin' if they sink quick
Ignore the ignorance I rep the brilliance of Queensbridge
And pray the feds let Murder Inc. live

'Pac is watchin' B.I.G. is listenin'
While Pun talkin' to us Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin' I was supposed to be
Amongst kings my mom shouted out at my christenin'
And while you still listenin' Shyne locked in a manhole
And Cam got shot inside his Lambo it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindle the flame Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown clown I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted
Showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down wit' it
Now the ball's in my court never dribble out of bounds wit' it
Behind the back to Nas he alley oop to Jigga nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: The Game]
Check it, Me and Nasty puffin it's a classic trust me
How he gon' pass the dutchie to them niggas that don't love me
I'm talkin' niggas that never wanted to see me on top
Same niggas that never wanted to see The Doctor's Advocate drop
Flop I think not, I fuck you rap niggas like virgins
Dre took my trainin' wheels off it's curtains
I don't need no encore no claps no cheers
The Game ain't over this the beginning of my career
The endin' of yours the endin' of his
Like Flavor Flav's clock I'm back to handle my biz
Nigga it's Game time that was Dre's favorite line
Back when Proof was in the booth and I recited his lines
And I still think about my nigga from time to time
Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind
But I just hold back 'cause we ain't beefin' like that
He ain't B.I.G. and I ain't 'Pac we just eatin' off rap
One love

What up, homie?

I mean
This is what you expected ain't it?
Let's go
Turn the music up in the headphones
Yeah, that's perfect

We just come out of nowhere

I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, like fuck it then

Huddlin' over the oven, we were like brothers then
Though you were nothin' other then the son of my mother's friend
We had governin' who would have thought the love would end
Like ice cold albums, all good things
Never thought we'd sing the same song that all hoods sing
Thought it was all wood grain, all good brain
We wouldn't bicker like the other fools, talk good game
Never imagine all the disaster that one could reign
Could bring, should blame the game and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain
Forever be in debt and that's never a good thing
So the pressure for success can put a good strain
On the friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out of the worst in every person, even the good saint'
And though we rehearsed it, it just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things like cars, jewelry, and Miss Thing

Jealously, ego and pride and this brings
It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
The route of evil strike again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the post and the point
This puts the ring in jeopardy
Indefinitely

I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, like fuck it then

I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like fuck it then

I'm back in the hood, they like 'Hey Nas'
Blowin' on purp, reflecting on they lives
Couple of fat cats, couple of AI's
Dreamin' of fly shit, instead of them grey skies
Gray 5's, hate guy, wishin' our reign dies
Pitch sling pies and niggas they sing 'Why?'
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds keep tryin' follow the street signs
I'm standing on the roof of my building, I'm feelin'
The whirlwind of beef I inhale it just like an acrobat
Ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin' eighty proof, bulletproof under my attire
Could be the forces of darkness
Against hood angels of good that form street politics
Makes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce
To get his feet out of them Converse
That's my word!

I feel like a black republican, money keep comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably in the back in the hood, I fuck it then

I feel like a black militant takin' over the government

Nas,"Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley
Got blazed before they told stories
I'm a get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on t.v today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated, took his ashes, and then made it to a Diamond ring
Now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that, while I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yea

The makin' of a mad band
Intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes..

Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was puttin' coke in his nose, nigga whylin'
Could be a myth but I swear that the source was close, Phyllis Hyman
Killed herself, it was crazy, mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway freefall from a balcony, he swings

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I?, did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame out last me?

The blunt's ash falls down in the ash tray
Will I see my whole life fly past me?
I'm askin' did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I?... anything else you wanna know, just wanna ask me?

Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossin' in the grave, like, ""this is how you repay me""?
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said ""no mountain's high enough, fly stuff""

David Ruffin was punchin' Tammy Terrell, gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was layin' down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside

John F. Kennedy's, enemies dealt with treachery
It interests me, Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals
She's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery

Or the Chicagoan Harold Washington
Someone is sabotaging them
Watch out for the traps
Larry Troutman killed his brother Roger Troutman

Then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain
From their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange

As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me

Long record perfumes, smellin' just as sweet, ha-ha

Nas,"There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids about how life is golden
So I will light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, eight by tens
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Collidin' with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See, I almost felt a tear drop

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)

Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Cas, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin' on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up; rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry to win the game in the finals, kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first make love

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

Oh, I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, can't forget about you)

Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable; it's the end 'cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer, nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past, enough of it, a'ight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25

When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me

That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Can't Forget About You,2006

Yea, niggaz want to talk about this rap shit
Niggaz want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody tryin' to get rich
Now get rich niggaz, fuck it

[Verse 1: Nas]
Some rap pioneers, be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggaz your grandfather's age
They pants still hangin' down they legs talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, 'cause they say, you ain't pay dues
And ..... was stealin' and robbin' them
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit
We don't want niggaz to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables

Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
Wit their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes, you spit hate
Against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggaz, I coulda wrote your shit; I had off-time, was bored wit this
I coulda made my double-LP, just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks - it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?

Now niggaz got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound, versus the studio state of art sound
We on the charts now; from British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, wit our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, sip Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what?, every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now (Carry On Tradition)
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead one's gone, we miss 'em
I promise I (Carry On Tradition)

Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why is that?
'Cuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
'Cuz we love to talk on ass we gettin'
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I they like me in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that we not takin' it lightly

Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business
If it got where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man then a mobster
If the guys let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a Rasta
Went from turntables to mp3s
From ""Beat Street"" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts

Homemade shorts cutoff, Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wipin' away eraser of the paper man
I'm just tryin' to say it right

Big radio, tape slowin' down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I gotta freeze 'em 'til they ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm starin' at the speaker

Sunk in them 808's deeper, cleanin' my sneakers
Wit the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoe strings soak in water...

[Chorus is sung over Nas outro]

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Live hip-hop live, live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays

[Outro: Nas]
Ain't got nothin' to do wit old school, new school
Dirty South, West Coast, East Coast
This about us, this our thing, 'knaw'sayin'?
This came from the gut, from the blood, from the soul

Right here man, this is our thing man
You know, so I say what I say
And I say what I say, and I mean it
Y'all take it how you wanna take it

'Cause if you're askin' - Why is hip-hop dead?
It's a pretty good chance you're the reason it died, man
It's a pretty good chance your lame ass, corny ass, is the reason it died, man
You don't give a fuck about, you don't know nothin' about it

You want this paper, be a hustler
You a hustler, you ain't a rapper
Get your paper man
You know what I'm sayin, but this rap shit is real
Bitch, this shit is real, bitch, ha-ha

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, (Live) stay hip-hop stay (Live)
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays

Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live

Nas,"Dre, he a Compton-Compton O.G
Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history

Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together like every several years
To sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with grey eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? - cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take, is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens, The God's back
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leaving

1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
""Illmatic"" on the top shelf, ""The Chronic"" on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off ""Illmatic"" and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""
Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned""
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, cause I'm ""Ether"" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
""If I Ruled the World"" I summons all you weak rap niggas to death

Yo, the Jordans sportin'
Come off the dice game with a fortune walking, you a walking coffin'
The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes - of Cuban cigars, you fooling with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that ""Soul Plane"" movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clapping
Nasty man, from bagging grams and running from cops
To a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch, I'm fucking with Doc

It's clear out there? Yeah
It's like I'm hang gliding over the hood, ha
Never worry (ohhh, no, no, no)

[Verse 1]
Check, let there be light
No gang banging in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger then life
Turn up the kid mic 'cause ya'll ain't listening right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been, they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will

[Chorus: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
[And I] I know my business, so my sins great
[And I] I thank the hood for all the love they gave
[And I] Forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light

[Verse 2]
This ain't the glorified, just painting the street picture
There's no God in sir Bibles, just blunt and switches
Gillettes cut pain in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth ""Supreme"" Griffith
It's like the same difference cept when niggaz get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggaz get to snitchin
If I could reverse the monsters and turn forward the razas
And bring back the niggaz who was livest
Old hustlers, reminscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin and flaggin
Got the West Coast laughing, now Esco's asking
What happened? My homegirl from upper Manhattan
She remembers the quarters that's Latin, alotta rat-a-tat-tatting

The son of the audio cassette era, tech wearer
Bullets and begets, Binzbo's speaker terror

Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder, not manned-a-wanno like the parent of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart 'cause ya'll'll run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about 'ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake ya, the x-ray splitter to touch ya, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game, we can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite ya on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let ya pick my brain, niggaz

The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out

Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade

If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1: cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
Rule 2: thought you knew don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait

'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner

Once even gave me a phobia, that I be in a spot trapped like

Why are we out here? What's going on? This is retarded, yo we gotta
This is crazy. Never again. You'd throw everything away, for what?

Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'

Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga
Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga

I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got
'Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time

Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up

Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid

The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact

Whores charge niggaz with raping
'Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars

So they counter the laws to take what's ours
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars

While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough

I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
He said one glance is all it took ya
She's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger

Transporting in any weather
And at this rate we'll never get her
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's gettin' me tight

Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party
What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang

It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe The Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said see you later
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers

He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck

Behind the street lamp was a silouhette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do ya know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke says the devil got you guys by the throat

We hit the bodega got her a few 40's

We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish now she's past tipsy

The truth came out as we got to her suave house
(Chopped and screwed) her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said it's gettin late c'mon give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady? She says Bill Gates

What are ya born 77 or 78?
She says, Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times, claims the slaves said rhymes
But she fell in love with some fella named Clive

Who? Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx
Now she shows me the cash
I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt
She said Clive Campbell
He's cool Herc

Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor

Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son

I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending

The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closin this chest of a n****
Now he back to square one
Screamin, ""Shoot don't please""

I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin a hit
He put his hands back on his b****
My caravan doors open up

I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin reverse, slowly prepared
My n**** Jungle utters out somethin crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sittin in back of this chair, we hittin the roach

The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans

Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC
I give my n****s dap, jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear

Listen up so why'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya

'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemies the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang 
I'm laid in the bed thinkin 'bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug

She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell""
She talkin 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick

Started suckin with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left her n**** behind

Walkin through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited Vodka back in my gla** with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun

That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, ""Son we found that n**** we gotta kill""

Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now!

Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer,
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city,
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy,
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle, 
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle,
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher,
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture,
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest, 
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project, 
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier,
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja

A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me, 
Draped in paisley bandannas,
Suits with Adam Stacey,
Cigar like Dick Tracy,
Its dark I get spacey,
Alcohol and laced weed,
That was part of my 80's,
The Cartier consigieres be near me,
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly,
Liz Taylor tried to joke me
Cause I keep it green like the other side of bill hicks be

Think fast before I blast hoes,

Put my foot on the pedal, riding through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seeing when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, strutting in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga

Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm making my mark

Toast in the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it

Watch me run in your spot, fiends coming in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cooking the pot
Drugs, bitch! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love toting the glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defending my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit, bust a cannon have you run in your socks

I don' know what the fuss is

I'm not to be fucked with

I used to give a shit, now I don give a shit more
Truth be told, I had more fun when I was piss poor
I'm pissed off
This what success all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple cars I don bring half them shits out
All of this ace of spade I drank just to piss out
I mean I like the taste could of saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Childs, towels no booth
Hold up, lemme move my bouwls
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys

Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receives great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on the range just to make me a chain

Came home with the paper in hand
They gotta brag about the FEDS young man

Best friends wanna be enemies like thats whats in

 Livin' since my real niggaz bailed me out of prision, a lot of scams 
 Cause the narcotics beamin', Queens had marked dollars 
 And the knowledge of thieves, my dream is the legacy 
 Of my penetentary, fake thugs couldn't even take gloves to burry me 
 Verse Four: Nas Escobar 
 To all theroughbreds takin' the corners, ya'll need to join us 
 Firm most powerful nation of rap performers, high class generals 
 Confidence, payin' lawyers 
 Swift as Oscar Delaholia, green berett warriors 
 Fakes I keep them like the John Kennedy tape, in the new with two 
 Bustin' all in they face, I'm never worried cause your see through 
 My man built the Sugar Hill from sweet tooth, we all eat 
 Cause we I speak truth, uneducated black youth 
 Street diploma, teach Greeks and Romans but the legacy was stollen 
 It's a Firm thing, generally green I wrote the theme 
 On how to sell a million while ya cats are mad at ya promotion team 
 I roll with the nice as Fox, black ice pushin' whips without a license 
 Yeah, tight as five strokes, Nas got 19 wifies 
 Seven sheisty, nine of them Piceses 
 Three white meats under tight cheese, woulin' 
 Big links is heavy like bricks, used to want a pitbull 
 While feedin' them raw steak, it's core take 
 More cake, I take the time off the so-called king of the town 
 And lock it down",Affirmative Action Remix,2007
Nas,"Is y'all ready for Twenty-0-7, it's now another drought
Everyone's a killer, wow we bugging out
Since 86 showing the crowd what I'm about
And they still want to know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and Ask the kids
What they definition of Classic is
Timeless, cause age don't count in the booth
And your flow stays submerged in the fountain of youth
And no doubt the truth I'm off the meters
Everybody co-signing even non-believers
I came in the door, became one of y'alls leaders
In the fresh pair of Air Force One sneakers
Uptown we call 'em uppies when they on divas
Probably worn when KRS One teaches
Nas, made you look, before the haters
I bet you Kan had 'em on when he walked with Jesus
This is classic

Classic, better than I've ever been
Talent,
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than 
I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been
Classic
Better than I've ever been

Can't buy this, super flyness, like a shyness, your highness
It's performing, look how long the line is
That's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
That's what happens these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished, I got a right to be a little bit snobbish
I did a little bit of college, semesters it took 2 like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place, the beat slowed til you listened to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident, and y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic it's gonna last forever than 
I'm everywhere you never been and better than I ever been

Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper to them it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice, now let me see you do the same thing twice
New times, 4 times, then been a couple of more times, please your amateur night is show time
It's one life to live so live it the best you can, the world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories to manufacture new vehicles sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like ya chips ain't right, 
By the time you could afford it the car ain't important
In the streets silent, it's just I and, cops keep firing in my environment
Leaving your slum when they drive home far from the hood brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they post up on, I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air Ones, the Hustler shoe, that's what I'm accustomed to

How many y'all got criminal minded you you you y'all don't be blinded
Me I got no jewels on my neck, why, I don't need 'em I got your respect
KRS 1 20 years I rock I do it for JMJ and Scott LaRock, this hip hop
And we's a nation, don?t you want to hear more KRS on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoking trees, on the radio we need to hear more local MC's
Where you at? Come on where you at? This is the difference between MC'ing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal, MC's spit rhymes to uplift they people
Peace, love, unity, and having fun, these are the lyrics of KRS One",Better Than I've Ever Been,2007

Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed

They wanna shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on, yeah

They dug me out the soil in the mines of the motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again

Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave trade then the diamond trade
Every child's afraid when
His mother and father get sprayed

Forced in the army, young killer brigade
Gets a new name then he give his nose glue
Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that eyes so blue
Then the Royal Family, the ice goes to

And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my platinum chain when you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery, the same way we made apartheid history
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right?

Everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed

They wanna shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on

My VVS glimmers on my chest
200 thou' encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest

The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect clarity

It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it

Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep the Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine

Everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed

They wanna shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on

Nas,"Word-up A
I had the joint out
Nigga gon' ask me ""what (I) want?""
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm like
Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five boroughs

Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money getting niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin' my distance, 'cause bein' poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin' out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still skeptic on who I cling to
'Cause every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just 'cause we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin' off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me, properly with that inner city, urban GC
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket
'Cause they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin' no trace to track it, kingpin thinkin' tactics is accurate
That mack shit, livin' the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with

Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin' G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin' wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five Burroughs

So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And until I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualize it to live it
Movin' cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin' papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolizes the essence, you're sailin' in a sweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers
They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enormous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
'Cause for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
'Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So

Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme (Rollin' trees, stackin' G's)
Gimme what you can't get back (True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme (Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (Rollin' wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC)

Just gimme (QB)
Just gimme (B-K, VT)
Gimme what you can't get back (See me, AZ y'all, representin')
Just gimme (Yeah, the street life is trife life)
Why don't you gimme the world (Representin')

Someone suspicion then came to me
I'm so close and I've come so far

You on a winning streak
You survived the killer streets
Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet
Number seven might get you to Heaven
You break the bank, just might make you a legend
It's after eleven, you playing against a poker face
Genie eyes, light green, sipping on Bellini's
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch
She'll be a devil in disguise, lady incubus
Better know who to trust
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up in Asian rugs
I'ma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em

What would I do if I could suddenly feel?
And to know once again that what I feel is real?
I could cry, I could smile
I might lay back for a while
Tell me what (what) what would I do
If I could feel?

I was young, I was surviving the times
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NXX, I was hoping I'm next

You warned us

Move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block

I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush, I bought my first mic

I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house-buying
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived

I was happy, just getting some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me

Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me

Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me

I get to record demos at attempts to blow

I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go

What would I do?

I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us

Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter

My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam

Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees

Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then

[Chorus]

Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But back to the matter at hand
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
Some cats didn't make it alive

Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart.
Lotta blood gonna splash in war

Task force homicide, federalies gonna arrest
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate

Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, yall niggaz ain't silencing shit
Ya bench been wanna police the dick
The big Benz, Imma model ya chick

Was that posing, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel

Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hot and my gun handle

[Chorus]

[Nas]
The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya
If you stand close to the woofer
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular

Give it up smooth, I ain't beggin ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table

Street etiquette with speech impediments
And s'til see presidents, no matter who paid
'Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it

Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from
Q Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more question, ya know what it is

[Chorus]

[Nas]
Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financer, skull doo wrapped up

Mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor
Diversified all my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis

That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars

Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock And Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in, in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick-trick

[Chorus]",Where Y'all At?,2007
Nas,"I said, ""What time you get off?""
She said, ""When you get me off""
I kinda laughed but it turned into a cough
'Cause I swallowed down the wrong pipe
Whatever that mean, you know old people say it so it sounds right
So I'm standing there embarrassed, if we were both in Paris
I would have grabbed her by the waist and kissed her, but
We in the middle of whole foods, and those foods
Ain't supposed to beef, but you'd think they hated tofu
Check-in line got rowdy, my vision got cloudy
I started seeing circles like some Audi
Emblem, I'm hearing them say, come on man
Do this own your own time, get the hell on, man
I walked out, hm, I got bout
Half-way to my car when I heard shorty shout
""Three thousand, forgot your credit card, smart move
By the way, my little sister loves your cartoon""
Well, here's my name and numb
If I ain't the one, lose it, if I am, use it
If a man chooses, and he can, do's it
And he don't, don't take it personal, he might be might be swamped
With making mozzarella, no, making worlds better
Cheese will come, believe me, I'm, never focused on the cash
Ask Mel Gibson, Jesus Christ, I'm bout the pass, ion

Stop, baby bring that thang back
You know where my heart at
Shorty, show your boy some love
'Cause I'm about to lose it
With the way you move it
It's been making me do it
Girl tell me what it do
I'll change the game for you
I'm a player, yes it's true, but

Can I be for real?

Run through ya, undo ya bra, gimme medulla, uh
Ya cute as a movie star, in sin city, Hennessey, my love slave
Lovin' is pimpin', no rest have, with none of 'em
I would leave every one of em, you just say it
Just leave it the way it is, he ain't aware that sleepin' dogs lie
But keep a sharp eye on him, cause I'm the wrong guy
To wanna put this four-five on em, let's get it on, ma
You got my nose wide open
You already locked down and rot down, but so delicious
If he get suspicious, bring up his old mistress
I ain't dry-snitchin', but why should you be feelin' bad
Cause I be killin' that, huh?

So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines

[Chorus:]
Verse One: Prodigy
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
KnowhatI'mean? Have a situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
for the cops to discover, while I be dippin in the Range Rover
All jeweled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryin to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low sippin Asti Spumante
Niggaz try to creep on the side of my jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack, it was a small thing really yeah
but keep lettin them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours and your team's inferior
You want to bust caps I get, all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back, the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely, 'cause niggaz want to toast me

[Verse Two: Havoc]
Yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the con-sequences
Count up my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend servants
Tryin to make a mil is stress you know the deal
So we sling drills get your cap",Eye for an Eye,2007
Nas,"Life, I wonder
Will it take me under, I don't know

Imagine smokin' weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine goin' to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruisin' blue behind my waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters

Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feelin' like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually

Troopin' out of state for a plate knowledge
Of coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion
Designer clothes, lacin' your click up with diamond vogues

Your people holdin' dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read 'The World Is Mine'

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

The way to be, paradise like relaxin' black
Latino an' Anglo-Saxon, Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path

The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes an' Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in

Open they eyes to the lies history's told, foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seein' things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Trickin' six digits on kicks an' still holdin'

Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work, release purple M3's an' jet skis

Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
An' reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

An' then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin' from jake, gettin' chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state

Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Tryin' to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin' moves in Atlanta, back an' forth scrambler

'Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin' shit
If I ruled the world an' everythin' in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 infinite

It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or be Felonies
Strictly livin' longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

If I ruled the world, imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls, could it be
If you could be mine, we'd both shine?
If I ruled the world, still livin' for today
In these last days an' times

If I ruled the world
I'd free all my sons
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
Black diamonds an' pearls
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em, love 'em, baby
",If I Ruled the World,2007
Nas,"I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Henessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke woolie thai
I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a coke head cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented, with formality
My duration's infinite, money wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Childhood lesson make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous night times, and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac gold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggaz no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' mats for craps to Ceelo
With side bets, I roll a deuce, nothin' below (Peace God!)
Peace God, now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that y'all, it's like that y'all

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real, or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowin', black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic fo'-fo' I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin', some up-rise, plus some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace.
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck 'rap is real', watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""
""Comin' outta Queensbridge""
""Now let me take a trip down memory lane""

Yo, yo-yo, y'all
Whattup?  Whattup
It's time man (Word, it's time?)
Straight up, it's time man
Aight, set that shit off
(Set it off then nigga, set it off)

Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not?  It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog
to my building -- come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
Niggaz gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare
with dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
The sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick
when he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggaz still hangin, years passed and slang changin
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth
could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?

New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
Cause I ain't playin, niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South
comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggaz, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin

and got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers

Oh, Rich Boy, you niggas better get focused
Get money, muthafucka, get money, muthafucka

Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, bustin' them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still gettin' pulled over and asked by the police

'Bama wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of ya skin get 'cha put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sendin' niggas to the pen or the funeral home

I be feelin' like the Lord'll never answer me back
So I'm holdin' on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in ya house'll make it hard to sleep
Ya see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap

'Lotta niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doin' life from under covers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men

It's where you learn your favorite slang

It's where I live, it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto

Can't explain how I feel growin' up in the gutter
Told my mama that I love her put nobody above her
Doin' crimes, a hard time for food on the plate
Know a couple of niggas ain't never comin' out the gate

Movin' weight the only thing them street niggas know
Servin' thangs at school, they never teach 'em, don't show
But a 44'll get 'cha money fast from robbin'
Do or die situation when ya tired, be stavin'

Government'd never send me a dime for school
So I went and started workin' like my nine my tool
I'm a leader for the South, pa, open ya ears

I'm a product of the block, watch the fiends come back
Got a couple white packs 'cause they fiend for that
Early five in the mornin', pigs showin' they badge
Real niggas in the street still showin' they rags

Speed bumps in the road start slowin' me down
See them fake niggas actin' like they know me now
Got a chance to advance, so I'm makin' my move
Couple o' people still thinkin' they got somethin' to prove

Pay the card for the South, yeah the hood my home
Told my mama I'ma leave the dope game alone
On my knees every night conversatin' wit God
Niggas dyin' everyday 'cause they wanna be hard

Still totin' my piece 'cause it ain't nothin' like the movies
I'm wearin' my vest in case they hit me wit the Uzi
Even if I take a trip around the world and back
I'm representin' for the hoods where they feel me at

Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers, we all stare
At the out-of-towners  (Ay, yo, yo, who that?)  They better break North
Before we get the four pounders, and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D.A.'s on the roof, trying to, watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em
And leave em done, won't even run about Gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards

Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
Cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggas and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's

Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun Son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too
With Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit

Nas,"This is a journey into the worlds most largest
And notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while nas saves his hood from the most
Cowardest rappers

He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like telling some stories
First there's this arrogent fuck, his names Cory
Hung around my mans Lake and Big Trevor
Trevors still locked up, Lake's getting his cheddar
Cory changed his name to arr, whatever
Cornchip, buckwheat lookalike, it's Mega
Right Mega was his name sorry about that
But it's so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing
But that's nas always looking out for breadrin
Cause when breadrin they return love they don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughing to the bank and shit
Back to Cor, got him a deal but his rhymes was whack
Def Jam now that he signed a contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch you from around the way its sad what this do to me
But queensbridge, we gotta have unity

They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood, but it's the cowards that kill it

Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood dummies
There's plenty that want to be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and knight Sir Lance-a-lot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what nigga you're butt and it got back to me
Asking a braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep q.b.
Nature moved to marcy
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy
Back with ass niggas in fear
Fuck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but it's the cowards that kill it

I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan
Q.b. before the Roc had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you a checks due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm saying your name (mega, mega)
Hoes play your position cause you'll never be king
Even jigga want the crown, poor thing
I'm representing queensbridge U.S.A.
Where two sk's go off every day new flesh lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say

The bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood, but it's the cowards that kill it

The bridge is over my dick, bridge'll never be over
Long as I'm alive and breathing, braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm saying, just get them unloyal niggas
From out your circle, you can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga
Be untouchable my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real
And that's real, ayo Nature I can't hold your hand through this shit man
I'm not your father man, be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself nigga or don't even rep this
Ayo Mega you want to be a gangsta? There's real gangsta
Shit going on in the streets man, yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man? Niggas be bucking
Why you never bucking, where you be at man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin Nino Brown of the fucking hood
It's disgusting man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherfucking mouth
There's no more room for jealousy, we destroying and rebuilding
That means the cowards get out and the real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine, shining
With suede motherfucking balles on in silks
I'ma always be the young don, don't be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggas in Queensbridge
Young niggas come up and get this money and move on baby

Second floor of my hotel
I'm rollin' up bout' to blaze
It's on now
To this Frankie Beverly and Mase
As our days about to pass
And our days in the past
He said my mind free
So my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can
And do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a king
I do the math
Coincidentally on ya birthdays
I ditched the Class
Cause the younger me, dumber me
Was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass
Lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school
In front of the bus
Not even thinkin' bout how
Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars
And she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars
Till she won it for us

Sometimes I wanna give up
Or at least take a break
Thats when I close my eyes
And see Coretta Scott's face

Panoramic view of the seating
Greeting
I've been meanin
To do me some letter readin'
To the king, he forever breathin'
Your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies, fonies
I should said it when I seen em
Some sleezy bastards
Greedy pastors
Should never be allowed to be
In Ebenezer Baptist Church
In Atlanta
So people be patient
I know there's ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude
Normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther
The model of truth
But hate killed em
Nobel peace prize winner
They duplicate the feelin'
As a kid, I ain't relate really
I sell your dream speak jokely
Till your world awoken me
First I thought you was passive
Soft one to ass kiss
I was young
But honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strip
You had to have the march
You were more than talk
The first real Bravehart
We miss you.

[The Game]
The word nigger
Is nothin' like nigga
Don't sound shit like
Like game like Jigga
One came before the other
Like aim and pull the trigga
Wanna slang for my brother
Wanna hang and take his picture
The rope ain't tight enough
He still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on em
Call his daughters Black Bitches
Make em pick cotton
While his momma cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white tees
That's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would
But would Hillary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint
Make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Because when it rains, it pours
I need Rhianna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops
When she got the phone call that
The future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson didn't catch em
Before his body drop
Would he give me the answer
Probably not",Letter To the King,2008

Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes

Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet

KKK is like: ""what the fuck"", loading their guns up
Loading up mines too, ready to ride
'Cause I'm riding with my crew he dies, we die too

I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another, so many political snakes

Confused over the feeling impatiently eating you
Intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine

Man this history don't acknowledge us,
We was scholars long before colleges.
They say we N I - Double G E R
We  are  much more,
But still we choose to ignore,
The obvious.
We are the slave and the master,
What you looking for?
You the question and the answer.

We trust no black leaders,
Use the stove to heat us,
Powder eggs and government cheeses,
The calendar was Martin, JFK, & Jesus,
Gotta be fresh
Go to school with fly sneakers.

Schools with outdated books,
We are the forgotten,
Summers coolin' off by the fire hydrant.
Yeah I'm from the ghetto,
Where old black women talk about they sugar level,
It's not unusual,

To see photos of dead homies' funerals,
Aluminum foil on t.v. antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV eatin' TV dinners,
Girls die they hair with kool-aid,
They gave us lemons we made lemonade,

Thought patterns consist of boss matters,
Spit Moses' ""Lost Commandments""
Like a gross sandwich out my mouth.

Toast to government cameras
Peepin' us every week
I must have my cars homes & phones
Squeaked for bugs,
But this is what I was dreamin' of,
Between cutting hard coke with new razors
Slicing my fingers up,

They use to string us up,
We wanted everything,
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes
Like the...
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes trying to get it like 'marajuin'

But I always put myself in a sacrificial position!

Yep! I'd give this cash up
This paper don't matter

They seen me from skinny to fatter
When I rap about war,
They got the tendency to scatter,
They ain't my backup no more,
So now my enemies are at my front door,

'Cause any time we mention
Our condition, our history or existence,
They calling it reverse racism,
Still till today the street's torn,
My brother Jungle always have a seat for 'em
Not behind me - beside me

You'll always know where to find me,

Its all love bun, I'm forgiving you pimp c
You know how the pimp be
That nigga go'n speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven
He tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doin' fine Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so ya'll let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther feelin just like a king
Guess dis is what he meant when he said dat he had a dream

Yeah!
History, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets try to flip some keys
So a nigga wont go broke
Then they put us in jail now a nigga cant go vote
So I spend dough all these hoes is trippin'
She ain't a politician honeys a politician
My president is black Rolls golden charms
Twenty two inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of people is riled up to see you
That can arouse ya ego you got mouths to feed so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cuz at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity never lose your integrity
For years there's been surprise horses in this stable
Just two albums in I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr black president yeah Obama fa real
They gotta put ya face on the five thousand dollar bill

Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)

Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

Yo, I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after you're gone
Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow
The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night, and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep

Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books

We can turn it out

So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?

Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time, send a fax from my car

May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today, yeah now

The black oasis
Ancient Africa the sacred
Awaken the sleeping giant
Science, Art is your creation
I dreamt that we could visit Old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid
For some western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praised bridges that carried us over
The battle front of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us
Ya hear me out

Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today, yeah now

Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today, yeah now

Who are we today?
The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need all that to fade
We cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after
The make shift youth
The slave ship captured
Our diaspora, is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
Americas first immigrant
The Kings sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers, astronomers
The first prophets and doctors was us

Now can we all pray
Each in his own way
Teaching and learning
And we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
And shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother Nature feeds all
In famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways
Not to share us out
What's a tree without root
Lion without tooth
A lie without truth
You hear me out

Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Ye lord
Well Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were Kings
I'll tell you young blood
This world is yours today

Must be dementia that you ever thought you could touch our credentials
What's the initials? Q-B Jamrock the lyrical officials
Send out the order, laws, and the rituals
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news we hood heroes
Put ass to anchor, we come to conquer
I not badman, we not play Willy Wonka
And I got the guns, I got the ganja
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash-box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals
And I'm shrewd about decimals and my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star, y'all feel me
Even if it's in Swahili or body Ghani
Masuri Sana, switch up the language and move to Ghana
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers
Rhythm piranhas, like two Obamas, unfold the drama

Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong came to turn it out
Body the verses till they scream ""murder"" out
The kings is back time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

Queens to Kingston gunshot we use and govern the kingdom
Rise up to Winstead I can see the fear up in your eyes, realize you can die any instant
And I can hear the sound of your voice when you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen
Snitching, I can see him pissing on his-self and he wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly, come around, and keep persisting
That's how you end up in a hit list
In a bad man business
No evidence
Crime scene, fingerprint-less
Flow effortless
Casual like the weekends
No pressure when
We're comfy and decent
We set this off beasting
Hunting season
And, frankly speaking

Jah told you, in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or I'm sitting with goons in a visiting room
Flip it, I could've been you
Behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for 'em
Or a shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see 'em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called

[Chorus]

Hey can you think of a color that you've never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you've never been?
Well is many are called
But them never deemed
Worthy for the cause
Cause them never clean
Help who help themselves
Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah
Like a Cherubim
Keep us strong through the winter like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems
All things are related and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keep his word, don't care what the plan is
Don't be astonished
Stumbling bocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, whoa!

[Chorus: x2]

Yo, yo,
Some people ask me if I feel the Zionists are real
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combination's of pain, joy, fear, and love
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren
Could've asked us why Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
It's like it's been exchanged for this penicillin

The world was run by black men
Back to the future

If these are the last days
And hundred-foot waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds
Pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse
My synopsis is catastrophic
If satellites is causing earthquakes
Will we survive it
Honestly man it's the sign of the times
And the times at hand

There's a lot of work to be done, oh gosh
In the promised land

Talking 'bout promise land
Oh gosh get me to the promise land
The promise land oh the promise land

There's plenty of land for you and I

But save the animals in the zoo 'cause the chimpanzee them make big money
This is how the media pillages, on TV the picture is savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images and this is what the image is
You buy khaki pants and all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
And thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzi's I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see and that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West will never move east and feel they could be at home
Get tricked by the Beast but where them gon' flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage where them can't defeat and them could never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever own, Lord

Can you read thoughts? Can you read palms?
Can you predict the future? Can you see storms coming?
The Earth was flat, if you went too far, you would fall off
Now the Earth is round, if the shape change again, everybody would start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things that he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out the root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze and that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up when them get cut
Wanna heal them broken bones in the bush with the wet mud

Can you make peace? Can you fight war?
Can you milk cows even though you drive cars?

Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an, and was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth and then dinosaurs were born?
Who made up words? Who made up numbers, and what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it, microwaved it, and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hu-? What's -man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consumin', eatin', deletin', ruin
Tryin' to get paper, gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson, watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of fifty-two fakers, Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious, throw salt over your shoulders, make a wish for the day 'cause
Like somebody got a doll of me, stickin' needles in my arteries, but I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like, ""pardon me, but I got a real big spirit""
I'm fearless, I'm fearless, don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms, felt they body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place ff this is how we gotta go? Damn

Nas,"All I do is stay focused, looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up, I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go, man, let's go

When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you

Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self-defeat is your own dispute
And, man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
'Cause you're starring in your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right and know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold down all the sprinklers on Mt. Olympus
My god's tougher than Zeus

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?

Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
'Cause in life you cannot press rewind
Get it right: you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell
And disregard those who most need your help?
Thick-skinned, the dark won't take my soul
Survived spiritual wars, see my welts?
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread (I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan (We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you

No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better, just be a go-getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
The drastic time call for drastic measure
Your girl tied to pleasure from your neighbor since ever
The land and the treasure work for whatever
Just don't be a beggar, the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper believe in every skin
No matter which color they are
Would never let, Him not care which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebbecca
Don't stop for a second
Every man reckon it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in

When the Armageddon's dark and dread (I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan (I get up and we get it cracking)

I'm a street-lifer always harassed by the C ciphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerge from the street life
This for the homies who relate, know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis the Thirteenth life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon, if that's you and me tonight
I pray our fate's greater
I speak life, I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Cowman
How in the hell am I supposed to stay comfy
When I pay child-support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, but only hos want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say they man connin'
So I'm stuck with some married woman so fine
Cheatin' while they husband is rushin' on the forty-yard line
Wonder if this is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas always seem to end up with some hard times
Hope not, if a pimp slippin' in a ho plot

Man, what happened to us? Geographically they moved us 
From Africa--we was once happiness pursuers 
Now we back stabbing, combative, and abusive 
The African and Arab go at it--they most Muslim 
We should be moving in unison; disputes should end 
Bounty hunters in Grape Street get cool again 
Substandard housing got the young running rampant 
Wilding for a phantom he can style in 
Mask on his face, grabbing his Ruger 
Said, ""nobody move, I'll shoot ya""; man, you're expiring 
Catch twenty-five and he doesn't like the man inside
With black, white pride, and Mexican, survive the best he can 
Strap a shank to his thigh 
Why do we all collide? Why do the young die? 
Extortion, murder, and burglary 
Tattoos his chest; it says his enemies don't deserve to breathe

Timeless in case we ain't never been acquainted 
Flyness--we made it; it gets duplicated 
Mindless violence--well, let me try to paint it 
Here's the five steps in hopes to explain it 
One: it's me and my nation against the world 
Two: and me and my clan against the nation 
Three: and me and my fam' against the clan 
Four: then me and my brother with no hesitation 
Go against the fam' until they cave in 
Five: now who's left in this deadly equation? 
That's right: it's me against my brother

Over red and over blue and over chuckers 
Over red and over blue and undercovers

The miles I take put in your face
Oh my mistake, you're not a floozy
Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y'all know the story, y'all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again? Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady's interest, I just met
The love scholar, she's the teacher's pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant, no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin' for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can't stand it
I'm a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? 'Cause I'm deemed a heart breaker
Like smoke, girls linger 'round a player, yaya

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hang around in the unbalanced
Woah, oh

Yo, this recession is a test
It's affecting my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I'm IEG
Those fly suites and my bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn't protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you're so deep
I said, no let's go through it
Historically so ruthless as feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She's thinkin' that's just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it's a dragon, it's a bastard you're in tune with, just lust
I'm through with you after my crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura, Funky Buddah, Whisky Mist on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, ""Yeah""
You know how me and Amy are, straight players

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on

I’m just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That’s garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I’m reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your best, how it get to this

Will it ever get better?

I gave, it’s yours
I can’t get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you’re pushing me away

I gave you everything that I got

Now I was hoping
We’d get through this together
You said you’d love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn’t it you who said
We’d be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it’s yours
I can’t get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can’t make you stay
I can’t make you stay

Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
How I feel inside
How I feel inside
This is how I feel
This is how I feel

I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I’m to the point where I don’t know what I believe in

If you don’t want this, I don’t want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write, back
Tell me why it’s like that

So make up your mind, boy decide
We can’t go on like this, this ain’t right (it ain’t right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it’s time to go

Jewelry Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate
Weed to alleviate the pain

Stainless steel watches, ostrich turtlenecks

Cayenne Porsche rap, how many horses live official
I run with generals who flash Uzis in interviews

To get an advance here, an advance there
Because somebody else controls your destiny

Reppin' QB till the death of him

Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
""We ain't got time to respond to niggas""

I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa, Blood gang, five
It's that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin' like they ain't gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroin, it's no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!

They say I'm underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' ""there he goes again!""
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain't no fakin', ain't no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door

From the hood

I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she tricking from the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake
Her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait to get home
Early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low, runny by Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I would rather stay alive for
Tatts on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathers the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on!

I don't even say shit, she can feel it
I toss the realest, sold nails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Frying chicken, macaroni
Raise on the [?]
Ghetto press, she's my apolonni like
Tony, Montana
Reminded me of [?] or my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My beats is the streets and I know who my friends is
In this love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the canvas ain't closed
When the cameras snap snapping, she's ready to pose

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turn from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes
Congress women inflicting pain onto my game
Warned that I'm sadistic
They liked it, they diked it, devices twisted
Til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, slap a door behind a white fist
But I'm still single, looking for Cleopatra
African Queen, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keeping girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She loves glamor bought Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette
My man is half hood half class
Photographers cameras caught us out there
The spotlight, I hope she can handle
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Event having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live the dream with me when you are just in the projects

Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like
How could I not protect her from this awful phase
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail dead that
Wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid

This social network said ""Nas go and get ya kid""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon post no pic
Of herself under dressed, no inappropriate shit, right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's ya little princess
Next day she talking boy business, what is this
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world

To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Dream chasers

Yeah, it was all a dream
On the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'

Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em
Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs

Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is
Mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now
Transparent ceiling now

Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thou mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban Linx's equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on

Look how far explain we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed",Maybach Curtains,2012
Nas,"Eyes must be wide shut
Liquor got you open, closing your blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet, bullet out of my head

Change your body, need a visor
Car too big, but f*** it, don't need a driver
All me want is a girl who'll be a rider
Can't believe she pull it, pull it
N**** gun, gun down

She want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now
Must be coo-coo, got me f***ed up, f***ed up, wow
You know a n**** ain't goin' hold ya, hold ya down

I'm a mirage (f*** I look like?)
I'm a mirage (what the f*** I look like?)
It's all in your mind, your mind (f*** I look like?)
Open your eyes, you're blind (what the f*** I look like?)

Your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe 'em, I don't wanna accept the truth
Who the f*** you kiddin', kiddin', what's the use?

Sad to see you playing the fool
You don't know half the s*** that a n**** been through
I guess you got your reward, reward for it
You actin' like you don't need me, baby

But she want me to hold her, hold her down (got me f***ed up baby)
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now
Must be coo-coo, got me f***ed up, f***ed up, wow
You know a n**** ain't goin' hold ya, hold ya down

I'm a mirage (what the f*** I look like?)
It's all in your mind, your mind (f*** I look like?)
Open your eyes, you're blind (what the f*** I look like?)

You lookin' for love, and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin'
My body wrapped in some Valentino, Laurel Piano fashion
Sex with passion, romancin', laughin'
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxin'
They got some good sushi in Aspen, that good p**** I'm smashin'
I call you massaheesa, yeah I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love, and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya
I used to love ya, I think to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage

I'm a mirage (f*** I look like?)

Nas,"This shit's special
DJ Khaled!

And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to heal you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya
(Bitch) I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked Hip Hop

And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
""She's dead!"" and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck Hip Hop",Hip Hop,2012
Nas,"Yeah, word
Got some Remy Martin and some good-ass cigars, check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of scotch, smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII, freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semiautomatic weapons I brought
The world crazy, I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick ‘em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose ‘em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high, I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib sacrilege
Talk trash about the nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive, talk money
Is you jokin', cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got all you envy
But don't offend, I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the '90s
Drug dealer call, rush to the bar
Move, niggas, we don't give a fuck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them them saggin', bet a hundred stacks
Niggas'll run it back just havin' fun
I ain't even begun to black, light another blunt in fact

(Nasty) Yeah, nasty kid

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin'
Saying it was Nas I used to hustle with
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish, guns on my waist past his
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joining the blunt passin' you niggas was straight assin'

Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I'm no fake rap CD listener

Sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my Gs, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga",Nasty [*],2012

Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days

Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they killing, they reckless

Gucci pillow on the bed while she giving noggin'

Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was ya daddy fault

Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches

Yet, the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like ""Hiyo look at my wife""
Gangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened and later we at that Heat game

Half of your soul, half of your heart you leaving behind
It’s either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards, under they breath
Saying ""why did Nas trust her?”, but look at yourself, speak louder bro
You live with your baby moms and scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps you ain’t even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride

She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good

Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president

I had to tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone, my bad

Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted

At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's ya little princess
Next day she talking boy business, what is this
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world

At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash

My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem
Bronx
All that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at

At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reaching, soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I
Must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all

This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
Ha for y'all niggas",Loco-Motive,2012
Nas,"P.S. 111 at free lunch, embarrassed but managed to get a plate
We was kids hungry, mom's working I was famished, she getting home late
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. Spare A Quarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of
Dudes who switch up and change
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them know, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow

I remember early mornings, syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing 40, she only 21
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back

1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them
She says, ""third leg from a legend is sheer heaven""
She says, ""it is the greatest loving""
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis, this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see

In front of you, it's foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money, too, the fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could've died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November thirtieth, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y'all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them beams out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, 8th Street, twin buildings
Vernon, can't even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap, though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey's ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home, Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for D.U, say what up to Snatch, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through

Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team
On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock & Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
(You all know how the story go)

Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask?
Probably is, but odds are we'll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you D.U
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy, and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real O.G cause back in nine-three
Niggas couldn't fuck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie's gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now, but you know I'm still mental, but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here

Liars brag they put work in

Better stay on point, if not, it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me, probably
If music money didn't stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went?
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?
Bo cooking blow, fucking slay that, where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since

I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

3:45 AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive, guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep makin' my millions
Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you love and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill, then it's grind time
Imagination better than knowledge, as Einstein
It's all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all excited, you all repeat it
So call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I force you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet

He was the wise gardener

The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors your Josephine baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I've seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British knights, can rival your foamposites
Don't make me pull my Lottos out the closet

Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket not enough blacks have it
Who should I date? Project chick or Cuban actress?
A white chick, they might flip talking that blackness
Should only attract black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em right?
You resent me every time I make a million right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me, I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fuckin' liar

Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?
I might kill you, but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under 6 feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me

Some say hatin' is confused admiration

And praised God with a bullet, I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the gods
Moet spilling, splash my mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shell toes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
And vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throwed in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprise, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am
'Cause where I'm from, man, what I see you wouldn't understand 
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
'Cause where I'm from, and what I see you wouldn't understand 
Where I been, where I been

Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive, 550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles like fire, bitch
Gat's on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
Fuck it, I'mma die one day, they gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas, only OGs
Certified who kill niggas when put in that seat
But tonight we on chill, nigga, chill mode
Spill more Spades, listen to Jeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am (word)
'Cause where I'm from, man, what I see you wouldn't understand 
Where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)
'Cause where I'm from and what I see (yeah) you wouldn't understand 
Where I been, where I been

For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B., what up? Yeah
The whole city, I see you

Nas,"Sometimes I get so fucking paranoid
Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth
I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch, I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinemann, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam

This thing of ours
It's so mafioso
You ain't never know though
Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no

This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5’11?, what the fuck you guys scared of
I’m a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get ‘em outta their garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, natty dread, got no barber
I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target
So before them Foamposites get ya lawyer in order

It's so mafioso
You ain't never know though
Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no

The don of all dons, since y'all wanna call me something
All of a sudden, niggas ball and stunting
Y'all just started pulling on Havanas
Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest, he’ll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me?
I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women
I am existing
I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction, that’s enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand
This thing of ours

Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rap

Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, money cases in my place, let's celebrate

I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me

Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy,
you can see me on a yacht Blasting Pac, little not, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches, back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other

The side you gotta watch A&E cable television for homie
But we live this shit

I'm not a star
But thats a lie
I've seen a man raise his hand on the stand he testify
Spoke on a homicide
Amongst other things
Even shared my triple beam dreams

A project minded individual criminal tactics
Us blacks kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive
Mentally sex-crazed dysfunctional they describe us
They liars, the end of the day, we fucking survivors
I remember watching Scarface the first time
Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime
How could I sell this poison to peoples in my mind
They dumb to destroy themselves is how I rationalize
In a bastardized nation, Magnum 4.5 carrying
Where I'm from, ain't far from Washington Heights the cop Aryan
A rookie boy the cookie didn't make no profit
A stranger to the block I damn near had to make them cop it
It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage
I brought it back to poppy, ain't tryna take no losses
He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face then pauses
He gives me powder he has faith in Nas'
Ambition's to distribute coke
Had additions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes
But I'm again broke
This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers they up their orders
Barely at 62 they already up they quotas
They out there everyday, some true hustlas for ya
I'm at it halfway, none of my customers are loyal
Picturin' piping out the seats of a Pathfinder
Powerful pursuit for pussy cash, the flash diamonds
My junior high school class, wish I stayed there
Illegal entrepreneur I got my grades there
Blaming society, man it wasn't made fair
I would be Ivy League if America played fair
Poor excuse and so I was
Throwin' rocks at the pen just for the love
Evil the secret life of G's
You seeing my blurry, triple beam dreams

Pocketful of money, parking lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens they got cameras every angle
Dope been coming so you know the income major
Rule number 1 I can't do business with a stranger
Contract killers coming when I feel in danger
Early nineties reminiscing when I had a pager
Triple Beam Dreams now Pat Riley my neighbor

Fuck boy talking outta turn nigga
In a court room spraying like a germ nigga
25 on a line, them niggas dropping dimes
Cooperation got them red necks dropping time
Khaki suits and them niggas got to acting cute
We was all cool stacking them Acura coupes
More accurately we acted as if jackin' was cool
Snatching niggas out they shoes then wear their jackets to school
Fuck boy you caught up in my dream
Countin' cream on the cover of a magazine
I'm the Source, got the plug with the uncut
Jay-Z blue magic nigga, what! what!
Brand new S Class with a meal ticket
Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger
Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin' high
Triple beam dreamin' as the cream multiplies
Fuck boy talking outta turn nigga
‘Fore you sell dope there's shit you gotta learn nigga
Home invasions, duct tape
Fornicating, counting money with a fuck face
Fucking bitches that be giving up your whereabouts
Slow leaks, gotta air ‘em out
Kill ‘em all, Rolls Royce Ghost nigga ball
Phantom drop head shit, I had to get ‘em all
Niggas hate but they know they never get involved
Food on my plate, fuck 'em all like a
Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality
I'm from where ya hustle determines ya salary
6 figure family member, nigga forget about it
Low income housing, nigga try to get up out it
I got a plan nigga just believe in me

Nas,"Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hos
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold bow acres it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what why I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

Got my first chain
When I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me
A couple others and dreams, would've seen me
Me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Movin, feelin hellish to dolly with lemon, lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now?
Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now
How sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is
The troublesome chick, who throws fists
Sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up
But when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes
So dead it, shred it
Young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go
My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now
But I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought
Don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the god
It might be too late, but the song's will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance
Not really a dance, more like a prance
I'm signing off with a crotch grab

Thank you man, for letting me get on this record Sean
You the coolest
G.O.O.D. music nigga forever
Understand?

Nas,"Uh, someone called the cops on him
Someone told his pops on him
He was talking crooked and he had some rocks on him
Tucked, tucked in his socks’ corner
Chucks, chucks and the Charlotte Hornet
Cap, when he flowed then they all surprised on him
Yes, he's a fugee but he go all Nas on ‘em
Well, can’t go pras on ‘em
And he got that crossover
But he from the streets you don’t cross over
Hut, hut to the block soldiers
Buck, buck to the cop vultures
Nope, no I don’t know pilots
Nigga I know pirates
Violence the islands
Shout out to my idrens
Put your hands up like it’s a mother fuckin’ siren

[Chorus]
Well, I paid all my dues
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Shone a million shoes
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
‘Cause when you got nothing left
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
You got nothing to lose
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

I used to stand on Vernon and ten
Burnin’ a spliff burner on hip
Wishing to flip a bird, yac burning my chest
Black certainly I’m dressed
Strictly that army shit
Finish my shift
Pack gone before the dawn hit
Anything I could earn on the strip
Turn it and flip
Watching my back
Cooking the pot
Making it stretch
Discussing with’ my clique
Should we duct tape the connect
It’s rough and K’naan knows
He had the same woes
I’m voicing my opinions
I forgot y’all was there
I ain’t know y’all was still listenin’
Be honest I ain’t care
Y’all don’t get my innuendos my interests
Y’all on some simple shit
Thinking I’m preachy
Yeah my church is the world
Christians sip a cup of this holy water
Stuck at this phony border
It’s custom to enter the main stream
You must front and record
A poorer oratory
Your life story corny
Yo, my Somali niggas know what war be
We fam'

[Chorus]

Remember when niggas said Nas was Somalian
Baseball caps had the tags, like a yardie and
It was written just came out, I was gnarly then
Niggas dreaded seein’ me like a Rastafarian
We didn’t know the dress code though we was bargainers
The knock off Filas, with the pumps and cheap cardigans
Niggas looked corny I admit, we was foreigners
But this corny kid, quick to send you to the coroners
Y’all know my war story, I won’t repeat it
It’s just injury, my victory’s undefeated
Thought you knew me well, go back and delete it
I’m in every joint this year, Orthopedic
And yes the AK’s are instruments we do drum ‘em
I’m somewhere between killa and king Solomon
And the shades take half the face we over stun ‘em
And treat obstacles like ass we overcome ‘em
Man, they really made me do this
I was peaceful like a Buddhist
But then niggas came and screwed it up like Judas
Now I’m suited up with Lugers
Rugers suddenly intruders
Turn around like hoola hoopers
Fucking losers

This one’s for the world
This one’s for your girl
This one’s for your mama
This one’s for your nana",Nothing To Lose [Remix],2013
Nas,"Woke up this mornin', (yeah)
You got yo'self a gun (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Got yo'self a gun

Yo, I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines so

[Chorus]
I got mine, I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You from the hood I hope you (got yo'self a gun)
You want beef? I hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So, you tried to front, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)
You ain't real, hope ya (got yo'self a gun)

My, first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoos real with ""God's Son"" across the belly
The boss of rap, you saw me in ""Belly"" with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and Tupac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames should huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads apparel
But the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast, 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody, uh

[Chorus]

Yo, I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life
It's the return of the Golden Child, son of a blue's player
So who are you playa? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"", with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow
Flip the beat back, now it's all reppin'
Hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus]

It's, the, return of the Prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist gliss, I floss
Stick shift, look sick up in that Boxter Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody want to know where the kid go? Where he rest at?
Where he shop at and dress at?
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back-twister, lingerie-ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta wit' ya, uh

Nas,"Uh-huh, je-je je-je-jeah 
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah
How real is this, how real is this
Uh-huh huh, Inspect this here, check

I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets
So I felt some more something and you nothing check
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice
Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own

I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale
Your laughing, you know the place well
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well
And Government, fuck Government, niggas politic themselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, god strike me
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?
We'll never know
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done

Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, Ain't nothing nice

I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with
Three dice and shoot the five
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this

Not a student loan, tried to motivate

Lord, go toe to toe with any pussy boy
Fuck, one time for facin' all the Boobie boys
26 inch plates on a 68
Where I'm from a half a key'll set a nigga straight

With friends like that I don't need enemies

I had a lotta niggas that was down with me
Or should I say a lotta niggas hang around with me?
But when I took my fall
I found out I really didn't have many friends at all
When I was out there rollin' in the Benz and ball
My momma used to get a lotta telephone calls
Niggas tryna see how we was, I had a buzz
But all that shit stopped when I got popped by the fuzz
A couple niggas kept that shit true indeed
But not the ones I used to bail outta jail and feed
We used to smoke weed and get drunk off brew
I went to TDC, nigga, I couldn't find you
You couldn't find me that's what you told yourself
But you couldn't tell that bullshit to nobody else
But when they asked you how I was doin', you told 'em I was cool
Knowin' you ain't talk to me since I went to the pen, fool
No pictures, no commissary, money to eat
And now you think it's all good, 'cause I'm back on the streets
I'm back on these beats and still blowing like the wind

A nigga put a knife in your nigga, could be your blood
Kill a nigga over money, kill a nigga over drugs
They killing niggas over hoes be careful who you fuck
One false move and you fucked and out here on that bullshit
Catch a fuck niggas and they hit his ass with the full clip

Niggas ain't real
Niggas ain't trill
Niggas be jealous
Over the hoes, over the whips, over the crib
Niggas be broke, pockets be hurt
Nigga be stressed

Straight Henn' a toast to Pimp C , now on to fake friends
Tina best friend husband fucking her cousin
Her cousin, she think her baby by Tina husband
But Tina had a miscarriage by me
Ten months later, Tina had a baby, it's deep
Soon the whole hood will be related
Like an African tribe, misplacement situated
13, she's already ripping
So whoever daughter she is, you about to be in grandpa position
And pot, no pot to piss in
Man, stop and listen
Your man from the sand box, he on the stand snitching
His John Hancock, got 'em lamb chops with his misses

Life is so crazy
You've been through a lot
I'll tell your story sometimes, you know

Seem like yesterday, I was a baby on the street
I took a holiday, I was steppin' to the beat
I had to pay my rent, on the lower East side
I threw my tag around, let b-boys take me for a ride
I started writing songs, I kinda got into the groove
They tried to criticize my every single move
But then I realized I had nothing left to lose
It took me by surprise when I became my muse

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh I came, I saw, I conquered

I expressed myself, came like a virgin down the aisle
Exposed my naked ass, and I did it with a smile
And when it came to sex, I know I walked the borderline
And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind
I justified my love, I made you say a little prayer
They had me crucified, you know I had to take it there
I opened up my heart, I learned the power of good-bye
I saw a ray of light, music saved my life (music saved my life)

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark
I came, I saw, I conquered (let's go)

Ooh, I came, I saw, I conquered

In 1994, I came through the door
With that born beats versus scratches
Verbally murdered rappers
My mom's from the Carolina's, pops from Natchez
And QB's where I started flowing
But I was scared the cops was gonna kick my apartment door in
Had a baby girl by a crazy girl then I got married
Heavily accosted, that ended in a bad divorce
And I know how to pick 'em, don't I?
Never gave a fuck about public pressure
Or the ridicule of two bigaloos
Now who's the fool?
And I ain't never been happier, no lie
I'm just you humble servant, I'm Nas
If y'all burn down Ferguson I'ma riot
My life cannot be compared to anybody
And trappers, and rappers
Any politicians, beauticians, a musician
Anybody, so I'm anybodies
Many coffins, heads or tails
Penny tosses, we either dead or in jail
Not many options on the block I came from
And I turned to a rap messiah, spit rapid fire
And I roll right back to the block I came from

I was fearless like a renegade
I had a feeling that I can't explain
I didn't listen to what people said (whatcha do)
I came, I saw, I conquered

I was constant as the northern star
I had a fire burning in my heart
I never gave up fighting in the dark

Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see

Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic

My signature fade with the Bevel blade
That's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that
That's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself
That's a major key
What Tony had on the table
It's like us, we a major key",Nas Album Done,2016
Nas,"I wrote my way out
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Running on empty, with nothing left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen
And wrote my way out (I wrote my way out)

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
Street analyst, now I write words that try to channel 'em
No political power, just lyrical power
Sittin' on a crate on a corner, sippin' for hours
Schemin' on a come up, from evening'to sun up
My man awaitin' trial, misdemeanors we younger
Courtroom prejudice, insufficient evidence
Jailhouse lawyers, these images still relevant
Flickerin' lights inside my project hall
Sickenin', the mice crawl all night long
And '87 Reaganism, many pages I've written on
Writin' songs about rights and wrongs and bails bonds
Master bedroom, bigger than the crib that I was raised at
I'm the architect like I wrote the code to Waze app
I'm driven, black Elohim from the streets of Queens
The definition of what It Was Written means
Know what I mean?

I wrote my way out
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Running on empty, there was nothing left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen
And I wrote my way out (I wrote my way out)

I really wrote my way up out of 6E
Develop relationships with fiends, I know they miss me
Before the metrocards, it was tokens, I did the ten speed
Never had wrote a rhyme in my life, what was I sixteen?
At sixteen, arrested in housin', trips to the mountains
Came right back, trappin' off couches, watchin' for mouses
Only tools we was posed with, had a spot, smoke lit
The hate is just confusion, pay attention how them jokes switch
Diadora was my favorite, the Mark Buchanans
Mama couldn't afford them, I learned everythin' on the border
That's a big 8, Clicquot parties with private dancers with no mixtape
Bumble Bee Tuna, now we could get steak
I persevered, composition, I kept it close
Competition near, I'm a Spartan without the spear
Three hundred rhymes, it was written before I wrote it
Opportunity knockin', might miss it, that window closin'
This poetry in motion, I'm a poet

I wrote my way out
When the world turned its back on me
I was up against the wall
I had no foundation
No friends and no family to catch my fall
Running on empty, there was nothing left in me but doubt
I picked up a pen
And wrote my way out (I wrote my way out)

High speed, dubbin' these rhymes in my dual cassette deck
Runnin' out of time like I'm Jonathan Larson's rent check
My mind is where the wild things are, Maurice Sendak
In withdrawal, I want it all, please give me that pen back
Y'all, I caught my first beatin' from the other kids when I was caught readin'
""Oh, you think you smart? Blah! Start bleedin'""
My pops tried in vain to get me to fight back
Sister tapped my brains, said, pssh, you'll get 'em right back
Oversensitive, defenseless, I made sense of it, I pencil in
The lengths to which I'd go to learn my strengths and knock 'em senseless
These sentences are endless, so what if they leave me friendless?
Damn, you got no chill, fuckin' right I'm relentless
I know Abuela's never really gonna win the lottery
So it's up to me to draw blood with this pen, hit an artery
This Puerto Rican's brains are leakin' through the speakers
And if he can be the shinin' beacon this side of the G.W.B and
Shine a light when it's gray out

I wrote my way out
Oh, I was born in the eye of a storm
No lovin' arms to keep me warm
This hurricane in my brain is the burden I bear
I can do without, I'm here (I'm here)
Cause I wrote my way out

I picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the projects
Wrote-wrote my way out of the projects
Picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the
Wrote-wrote my way out of the projects
I wrote my way out
Picked up the pen like Hamilton
I wrote my way out of the

(I wrote my way out)
Really, I saw like a hole in the rap game
So if I wanted to put my little two cents in the game, then it would be from a different perspective
(I wrote my way out)
I thought that I would represent for my neighborhood and tell their story, be their voice
In a way that nobody has done it
Tell the real story",Wrote My Way Out,2016
