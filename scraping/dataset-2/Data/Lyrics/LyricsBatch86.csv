Cowboy Junkies,"Can't lose the taste of this river mud,
Black water in my lungs.
They say you can't step in the same river twice
Well I've been stepping in this river seems like most my life.

So sharpen up those dragging hooks
Tie that sheep shank tight
Cast into the river boys
We're dragging for those lost years tonight.

There's a man whose lost his wife
Said she'd be home by eight,
But that was well on three weeks ago
Now he's walking those banks searching for clues to her fate.

See that girl she's lost her boy
Flash flood stole him away.
Now she keeps a vigil on that suspension bridge
Praying for that river to return him one day.

So sharpen up those dragging hooks
Tie that clove hitch tight
Cast into the river boys
We're dragging for lost love tonight.

Can't lose the taste of this river mud
Black water in my lungs.
They say even the weariest river in the end will find the sea
But here among the cat tails all we discuss is breaking free

So sharpen up those dragging hooks
Tie that sheep shank tight
Cast into the water boys
We're dragging for lost souls tonight.","Dragging Hooks (River Song Trilogy, Pt. 3)",2001
Cowboy Junkies,"She took his dentures from his mouth
And placed them in her own.
Took a shovel from the shed
And then dragged him from their home.
(I did it all for you.)
Left a note tacked to the door,
""Paid in full"" is what it said.
High above I look below
And watch her slowly go.
River, like magnesium,
Burns.

(I did it all for you)

He stuck his fingers in their backs
To count the holes he bore.
Doused them all in kerosene
And moved to bolt the door.
(I did it all for you)
Called his Dad and said goodbye
As his lit match hit the floor.
High above I look below
And watch them slowly go.
River, like magnesium,
Burns.

(I did it all for you)

Set his guilt before his rage
Set it like a wall
To protect what he once knew as love,
But which he never knew at all.
River, like magnesium,
Burns.

Cowboy Junkies,"Just outside there waiting.
Just outside the circle.
Waiting for that finger to point your way.
Just keep running. Just keep running.

New ones quickly burning.
Old ones die away.
Fires lit to say goodbye or hello.
Which way you looking? Which way you looking?

Count all wounds that brought you here.
Lay your blessings end to end.
Rid yourself of all regrets
Because here is where it all begins.
A bumbler's game, a cheaters wheel
Where the winner pays the highest cost.
You've laid your marker now watch the ball.
Hold your breath its about to fall.

Just outside there waiting.
Just outside the circle.
Waiting there is someone i don't know who.
I'm so open, i'm so open.

I don't sleep most nights,
Just lie awake and count my blessings.

I'll take this endless life
Of perfect pointless mornings.

I'll hold you till the morning comes
'Cause it's all that i can do.

I'm so open. I'm so open.

I don't like these last goodbyes.
I don't like goodbyes.",I'm So Open,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"I've been told that it's just the way life goes.
Once the wildest river is now a trickle to the sea.
The peak we risk our lives to scale becomes dirt beneath our feet.
The wisdom of a life time always disappears untapped.
Paradise once given will always be taken back.
And the love you hang your life upon will start to slowly crack.

I have seen people suffocate the dream.
Forgetting to turn that one last time while she watches through the door.
Focusing on the garbage that she use to ignore.
Thinking she looks so beautiful but not yelling it out loud.
He should have thought to kiss her before he headed out.
Just forgetting how fucking lucky you are to have found her in such a crowd.

But we've seen a cloud of starlings rising on a crisp autumn day.
We were handed the weight of a child sleeping and bore her away.
We've tasted the tears that fall when saying goodbye forever.
And we've seen the silver from a waxing moon wash upon the shore.

I have heard about the lives of small swift birds.
They dazzle with their colour and their deftness through the air.
Just a simple glimpse will keep you simply standing there.
Legendary journeys made on fragile hollow wings.
The night skies rich with whistling each and every spring.
And then there's the day we look for them and can't find them anywhere.

I've been told that it's just the way life goes.",Small Swift Birds,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"Here we all are at the end of ""the century of beauty lost"".
We greedily ate what you gave us, the rest we tossed.
We've trapped all your rivers, paved every pass,
Pulled at your sky till we caused it to rip.
But you've got Jimi Hendrix so lets call it an even split.

I've met a girl who has turned my whole world upside down.
The stars i once stretched for, now litter the ground.
I am cursed by too little, or is it too much belief,
In the strength of another man's words.
But I've got a girl, thank you lord.

Here we all are at the start of another thousand years.
All those love stories, yet to be told.
Ours is this river asleep at our feet,
Blessed by this wet autumn day.
Here we all are",Thousand Year Prayer,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"(a curly blonde disaster
Lying out there)

He said, ""you make me feel
As desired as a crackling fire.""
She said, ""I saw a man out walking
Upon still waters

(I want to lie beside you
In a warm bed,

Feel your heart
Beat in my throat.)

And no one stopped to stare.
There he was all, alone,
Out walking upon still waters.""

He said, ""you can feel it fall,
All at once upon the land.""
She said, ""you don't know what you've missed 
Until you've walked upon still waters.""

Cowboy Junkies,"My days, they are the highway kind, they never come to leave
But it's the leavin' I don't mind, it's the comin' that I crave
Throw the sun upon the ground, stand to throw a shadow
Watch it too into a night and fill the spinnin' sky

Still among the pine tree's, it felt like a breath of air
Usually I just walk these streets and tell myself to care
Sometimes I believe me, sometimes I don't wanna hear
Sometimes the state I'm in won't let me go

Well, I don't know too much for truth but my heart knows how to sound
Shame that it's not enough, shame that it's a shame
Follow the circle down, where would you be?

You're the only one I want, I never heard your name
Let us hope we meet some day, if we don't it's all the same
Then I'll meet the ones between us, be thinkin' 'bout you
And all the places I have seen and why you where not there",Highway Kind,2001
Cowboy Junkies,"Sun comes up, it's Tuesday morning
Hits me straight in the eye
Guess you forgot to close the blind last night
Oh, that's right, I forgot, it was me

I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning,
The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom,
The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping,
But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed
Telephone's ringing, but I don't answer it
'cause everybody knows that good news always sleeps till noon

Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again
Maybe I'll add a little T.V. too
No milk! God, how I hate that
Guess I'll go to the corner, get breakfast from Jenny
She's got a black eye this morning, `Jen how'd ya get it?'
She says, `Last night, Bobby got a little bit out of hand'

Lunchtime. I start to dial your number
Then I remember so I reach for something to smoke
And anyways I'd rather listen to Coltrane
Than go through all that shit again

There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothing
Just listening to records and watching the sun falling
Thinking of things that don't have to add up to something
And this spell won't be broken
By the sound of keys scraping in the lock

Maybe tonight it's a movie
With plenty of room for elbows and knees
A bag of popcorn all to myself,
Black and white with a strong female lead
And if I don't like it, no debate, I'll leave

Here comes that feeling that I'd forgotten
How strange these streets feel
When you're alone on them
Each pair of eyes just filled with suggestion
So I lower my head, make a beeline for home
Seething inside

Funny, I'd never noticed
The sound the streetcars make as they pass my window
Which reminds me that I forgot to close the blind again
Yeah, sure I'll admit there are times when I miss you
Especially like now when I need someone to hold me
But there are some things that can never be forgiven
And I just gotta tell you
That I kinda like this extra few feet in my bed",Sun Comes Up It's Tuesday Morning,2002
Cowboy Junkies,"You're clean as a widow woman's washboard, son,
Stick it in the wind
Put the mountains to your back
The great plains on your grille
Time to take a little spin
Boulder looks like the type of town
That I could spend some time,
But in Houston they got our name in lights

The slab is yours tonight

With his hands in his pocket

Springer's feeling lucky, sits down for a spell,

Be careful with the dice

With boxcars in their eyes
Never count your winnings at hour 23
Of a 24-hour drive

With her throat cut after dark
Her pockets turned inside out

Waits for the sports,
He only wants to know,
'Did I win or did I lose'

That's where my baby took me with her smile.
To Hunting Ground from City.
I never thought that I'd have to retrace those miles.
It's been a while since I've seen that smile
Appear upon her face
And now I find I'm slowly drifting back

From Hunting Ground to City.
To Hunting Ground from City.
Our daughters eyes they took us for a ride.
To Hunting Ground from City.
Cat's eyes sparkling, blue eyes in my mind.

We said goodbye under a drop of sky
We left her in that place
And now we find we're slowly drifting back

From Hunting Ground to City.
From Hunting Ground from City.
The journey down is sure to be a laugh.
From Hunting Ground from City.

But will he listen when you cry?

But always seem apart

And leave you twisting in the wind
She will call you darling
Keep you stunned and wondering
She will take you to another world
Where the winds of confusion swirl
She will call you honey

We should call them lucky
As they watch their babies dance
Or maybe call them crazy
For even thinking they have a chance
They will carry her as far as they can
Then abandon her once again

Cowboy Junkies,"Jesus was a carpenter he died nailed to a wooden cross.
Irony oh irony upon me it is never lost.
Gather 'round now people, I'm here to tell a tale
About a man who walks among you, a man you each know well.
My name is Simon Keeper I had a wife and three grown kids,
A job in the towers cooking the books for the shills that grease the skids.
Irony oh irony, you are a bitter fruit to eat.

Stripped of all your beauty your flesh is none too sweet.
Now I ain't the most honest man that ever worked a skim.
I was caught with my hand in the cookie jar and brother that was it.
Fifty-four and a big black mark upon my resume,
I found selling off what you don't own might earn you the time of day.

Next it was a letter from my darling one,
""what's yours is mine, what's mine is mine"",
Sealed with a hug and kiss.
One by one my children closed their lives to me.

Lesson learned on Daddy's knee,
""give no quarter to the weak"".
Irony oh irony, you are the polar seed of truth,
You grow upon the open plain the faithful you uproot.

Kicked around 'bout a year living hand to mouth,
Then one day tryin' to bum a light I felt my will give out.
Sat right down on the corner, started prayin' a little too loud.
Left my troubles far behind
When I saw them emptying their pockets out.

Irony oh irony, you are a treacherous son of a bitch,
Pretending not to care about the heights you'll never reach.
Now I won't start in preaching 'bout reaping what you sow,
This is the story of a half-hearted man,
Half honest as they go.

Filled us with his light
Gospels, fertile minds
Taking root, taking root

His pocket change would jingle
Sacramental bells
Heads tucked low
Sneaking peaks, sneaking peaks

And the rain comes down
It's dark and the browns begin to bite
Here you will always be behind me
And you will not go away

There he sleeps on untamed land
Dark corners yet discovered
His heart yet to be
Trod upon, trod upon

I can't bear to hear his breathing
Simply knowing what's to come
I can't bear to hear your breathing
Knowing what's to come, what's to come

Secure the good, leave the rot behind

Takes my breath away 
But I should know better by now

But everybody's tasted pain
I've known your sorrow 
Since God made the rain
I see tomorrow when God makes the rain

I used to believe in the spirits

But I was your walk on the wild side 
I should know better by now
And if you see me looking for something 
Or someone who'll never be found
When I look your way, 
Turn your eyes astray 
Cause I should know better by now 

I used to hold my fury 
And keep it bottled tight 
And wrestle with the consequences 
Each and every night
But if I put my faith in someone 
Who was only trying to bring me down 
I wouldn't stand 
Where I am standing now

Are firmly in our grasp

You wonder what you're doing
As you rub your eyes so violently 
While falling out of bed
Is there nothing educational 
In words that you are chewing
As you seek the soothing solace 
Of a friendly shower head


But I really must admit that 
I am glad that I am living
There were times when I 
Would pray to God 
And ask that I was not

I live in an apartment now
But there's room enough for two

We could be together somehow lovers more than friends

You've gotta go to work too soon

But every time I tried to talk to him, he put me down,

Maybe it's because my mind is so easy to steal.
Then I'm living in a world where nothing here is really real,
So I gotta let go.

How do I get the fuck out of this place?
How when I look in a mirror do I not see my face?
Can I turn in my membership card to the human race?
Cause I gotta let go.

Nobody cares who you are
Nobody knows why you feel

When I'm battling the moments when I wish I was dead.
When my mind and body feel like fire and stone
And I know I'm gunna spend all my life alone.
And I swear I need to cover up my heart and soul,
I only gain perspective when I lose control.

Chasin' all the same old ghosts
Has my fear become a drag 'cause
That's the thing I fear the most
You run your fingers
Through my hair
A thousand things that show you care
But sadness is my worst addiction
My head is filled with fact less fiction

Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree 
Oh, I can still see the flowers blooming round her 
Where we met on the Isle of Capri 

She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning 
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me 
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning 
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri

Blue Italian sky above 
I said ""Lady, I'm a rover, 
Can you spare a sweet word of love?"" 

She whispered softly ""It's best not to linger"" 
And then as I kissed her hand I could see 
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger

She's sittin' at the bar, sippin?on a beverage
Try to use your platinum card to get leverage
It don't matter, she's got her own
She's got diamonds for buttons on her cellular phone
She's a cutie with a booty, a hottie with a body
Get her on the dance floor, gonna get naughty
Don't mean no harm, just a little fun
'Til it's time for breakfast and you see the sun

Can't find the key to the door where her heart is
Can't find no magic word to say all the things I want to say
There's no equation for that rose, she only knows when she goes!

Don't give her no static, she's automatic

Suddenly you make you way to the floor
It's a hick-hop beat boy your body is pumped
All the fine ladies just shakin' their butts
Step up to one then you ask her to dance
It appears to you she's in a trance
Take your time son play your position
'Cause that's the primary mission

Step aside, 'cause it's time for some action
I'm a hick rhyme sayer with a kung fu grip
I get the job done instead of talkin' 'bout it

Early in the mornin', I'm up and I'm out
Hopin' one day my album goes platinum
Rockin' that mic so viciously
Deliciously, not maliciously

When atmospheric pressure and vapor pressure converge
There's a party surge, so I must emerge
Get the people hyped and keep going nonstop
Knock the party off the meter when the bass line drops

I'm a beast on the mic, can't get no satisfaction

Time to hit the trail, boy, the mic is my horse

Sleepin under bridges and sleepin in alley ways. Afraid to go to the shelter, so at night she prays that hopefully she's gonna see some better days. Meanwhile, Mom and Dad are really frantic. When they saw her clothes were gone you know they really panicked. Thoughts in their minds ""Did she run to the border?"" or even worse, ""Will she be a case of Law and Order?"".

That rush like you're rollin' down a hill
You said, ""Be still, I got a chill!""
I said, ""Okay girl, I will!""
With the sweat accumulating in a pool in your navel
I'm rockin' your body 'cause I'm willin' and able
Truth not fable, I make the bed sing like the movies on cable
Holdin' on tight sittin' tall in the saddle
Your heels inside just like spurrin' cattle
Hearts in rhythm, nibble on my ear please be my friend
Your hair is gettin' tangled 'cause I make your body tingle
By the hair of my chinny-chin chin, gotta get your

In the morning when I'm yawnin' I wake up
The sunrise in your eyes helps to heat me up
A kiss and a hug and and an ""I love you""
A kiss back and a wink and ""I love you too""
Two hearts, one soul walkin' on air
Livin' on love, livin' on a prayer
Lips so sweet like chocolate
I get a rush so strong I can't forget
Love is the breeze that fills my sails
I crave to breathe what you exhale
I'll cross the desert with life at its worst
All I need is your touch to quench my thirst
Think the same without saying a word
Your voice is the sweetest thing I've heard
Go on punkin' put this song on loop
I gotta tell you again baby, I gotta get your

I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow

Though it consumes me, your kiss of fire

My body apart - I'm gonna ride -
Ride the night into the morning sun

Gonna make my resurrection
No more of this crap
Got a whole new direction
Ain't no turning back
Resurrection is a-gonna come

My spirit is weeping
For freedom it cries
Ben scraping my living
In the Valley of Lies
Ride the night into the morning sun

I'm a victim of a victim
Of a conspiracy
>From a corpum derelictum
Gonna fly and be free
The resurrection is a-gonna come

Clear the vision
Heal the system
Sins forgiven - RISE!

Flee the prison
Break the system
Sins forgive - RISE!!RISE!!

Ride the night- yes I know I'm still alive -
Gotta ride the night - yeah I'm gonna ride -
Gonna rise again in the morning light

There's no use in counting
The price of those years
There's too many heartaches
And too many tears
Gotta ride the night into the morning sun

Yes I thought I was dreaming
But the East is ablaze
With promise of the future

Those Heavenly Days
Ride the night into the morning sun
Ride the night - into the morning sun
'cause the resurrection is a-gonna come",Resurrection,1993

Headed for coffin or jail, to never try is the ultimate fail
But love is wanting more for someone than they want for themselves
Deep, I guess I love a lot
Because the more I do my thang the more I feel the guilt and shame that my brother's not
Reminisce as we was kids screaming f*** a cop
Guess he took it serious, for me that s*** was just for props
Arms too skinny to hug the block
I found comfort in my dreams, of things seen on the screen of fortune and fame

Now only selling his dope
But now he selling nympho's
Not so cautious about how he sells
Made his way to county jails
Now he lonely in them cells
How he feel
It was probably hell
He got out, but on that same shit
I guess when you lawyer to yourself then you can't switch
But how can you blame kid
Don't know what he was goin' through
Cause hustle is his bread and butter
He don't want any other fool

CPO,"Get up, best to follow the Nation
We are, the Capital Punishment Organization
Alias, we never needed one you know
We are the fortress of the empire C.P.O.
Here it is, yes, a rhythm message to the brothers
and others,  who think about killin' another
Who abuse the excuse for doin' it, because they havin' it rough
but ain't no reason valid enough
Listen up, while I tell you a story, devoid of glory
Might even be a little bit gory
cause the way that it happened I won't consider it braggedy
A drive-by shootin that ended up a tragedy
He was shot, layin in the street dead, reasons unknown
Another homey gone, never have his own throne
cause an ignorant brother pulled the trigger
He wasn't even a brother, he was a nigga
Another one dead, shot in the head, a sister
Wonder in retrospect, what if the bullet had missed her?
A victim caught up, in the storm of the stereotypical
Another brother shot condition listed as critical
Band together to override
In order to let slide the ramifications of the dark tide
Seperating the men from the boys, is the policy of a foe
A boy makes too much noise you know
Let me put this, in proper perspective
Killin that noise is my prime objective
And when I say noise, I mean the loudest of all
I mean the brothers killin brothers, so foe build the wall
The wall
The wall
The wall

Some try to escape the reality of it all (by doin what, what)
by cold drinkin 8-ball
Mind's in a zone below my own
They thinkin on a lower level, cause they in leagues with the devil
Neville Brothers say tell it like it is, so I will, it's a fact
The bigger the headache, the bigger the peer
So expose who oppose because the brains they lack
who distribute the powder white while they killin' the color black
Religion, not a smidgen in they mental vision
They choose to live in red, devil makin' decisions for em
cause they never knew the meaning of piety
Members only of the dead society
The cluckers the smokers the rock rushers the pipe chokers death
That's what they boast while they walk around comatose
And we'll be the ones to bury em one and all
Teach the religion of the wall
Bet, the jury of fury yes, the rebels of hip-hop will build
They want us to yield, but we'll not, we're visionaries
They buried my commentary in cemeteries
They knew my sermon of freedom was preliminary
to educated the uneducated, who stood in the crowd and waited
for doers of oppression to fall
This is the movement, the foe and the C.P.O.
had chosen to call the war against low-livin, the wall
The wall
The wall
The wall

We on a mission, that is to reposition the coefficient
So listen, cause I will be dissin throughout the coalition
those, who propose to live the life we label atrocious
So as I convert em to C.P.OSis, thus,
I reiterate, before you mitigate a cause to effect the situation
Fade to Lil' Nation
Sellin narcotics so as they increase
mental disillusioned seek to perpetuate the confusion
Scope the negative, to focus on the regulators of crime
This is the premise of a rebel rhyme
The culture with turbulence it's a problem of continuous buggin'
I go to the wall so I can plug in
the power, this is the hour to push the button
Cause nothin' can stop the flow or the purpose of the C.P.O.
The sinners the killers who be runnin it, can suffer a lifetime
The agony of Capital Punishment
And the dope dealers, I push and I push but you never budge
I send you to court - you own the judge and the jury
that acquitted you, they lied cause I know you a pusher
If not for dope, then you pushin' for genocide
But I'll ride you, lost I will find you
Blind I will guide you, forget I'll remind you
Your diabolical schemes to reign supreme as the enemy
is about to fall to the strength of, the wall

So the first motherfucker that's caught up in the twist

Take your place while we here to lay raws
Drizzaws, full of caper for some paper to fold
Sort of a jack episode if you will
I was a do-low nigga from birth, and I'm that do-low nigga still

See that, be what, the fuck a nigga mean
When I say - you can't envision me, cause I can't be seen
Like Casper the Ghost I creeps the most
'Cause I'm just so motherfuckin sly, invisible through the eye

So motherfuckers can duck and dodge and slide
But there's, really no escape from the nigga from this side
Which side? Westside, layin in the cut to gank your load
When we's in ""don't give a fuck"" mode

See if it's grip we want, it's grip we get
So run motherfuckers 'fore youse caught up in the sunsets
Bitch-made niggaz best to keep that ass at home
'Cause that Boss Hog nigga's on the late night roam

This is just so ya know - (??) niggaz to hoes
If an ass gets gone - well it's good as on (it's on)
If you're trickin' off your luck - you're dead as a duck
And 'til the day we gives a fuck, 'cause, you're wrong

The late night, creeper nigga gets his stroll
For seekin out that bitch, to open the guts and bust on my nuts
Off to the spizznot - with chronic and fat knots
And them murderizin' hoes droppin drawers to expose cock

Now I'm (?) - emotions of a G
Girl you know this Death Row, so you can not see a nigga
That's fin' to get paid on they block - think I ain't?
'Cause I've been known to bank and serve up glock fool

Now on the move, to much higher and bigger thangs
Must be in it to win it, cause I does them nigga thangs
My nuts is where they want to swang, and dangle off and on they roam
And no romance between us so gets the fuck on

Bitch-made, nut and break his nose, and meaner for tricks
I gots love for nothin but my niggaz and grip
So now you know.. and I be's off into the moonlight
Puffin the I-N-do

[Chorus]

(???) we, get into the grillin of a, fool
Ain't no nigga breathin can fuck up my rule
I'm that same nigga police done sought
But no a nigga never ever been caught, cause I'm just sneaky doe

I'm (??) and stinky, for those who see me
I rolls discretely, does my lows discretely
Completely, a true blue G to my name
CPO the shit, and Death Row's to blame

So if a nigga want to breathe in long
Then the nigga best to eat his own
That's how me and nina does, we gives a fuck who nigga what
If he's steppin to me wrong, nigga gone

Bitch so late (?? ??) it ain't shit
Kinda like that 'llac bendin corners, I ain't easy to hit

Peeps through the sight, them freaks as they peeps the late night

Freeze up, raise up, cause Jack it's on for your (??)
If you're (?? ??) motherfucker break yo' self
'Cause yo' fo' is kinda sweet

CPO,"Uhh, yeah
Do you want to ride?

Sippin yac, I blacks and the chronic fall
Flashback in on days of me and my Doggs
Said it shouldn't, wouldn't file when it was over but yet it still
Started out, fools for real
Now this of course was back when we sorta lacked this
Wit no paper or dealin with a phone
And I mean this broke shit was gettin old
'Cause we was in need of big clockin dollars
And was in need to clock a mound, uhh, beat em out
Situation became drastic and so therefore
We chose twin hos, some of those cum-on-their-lipstick tactics
Now low and behold, well I'll be goddamned
If the stack didn't increase ten-motherfuckin-fold
Must you cover that rolo again 'cause we was trippin
To stay up on top of things, the ???? life we was livin
Strictly business, we was in this to win it all
Didn't give a fuck if no others didn't love us, me and my Doggs

Now this is how it's done like one two three

With Capone on a mission with that nigga Boss Hogg

On a mission dippin down Imperial
The name's Capone but first let me inforward the scenario (yeah)
Creepin, holdin one wing to weaken
In a BMW, there they go, I see them (who?)
Them fools across me when I first started off
With the kingpin Kurupt and a G named Boss Hogg
But now I got a stack of Columbian crack
I gots ta cook it in seven so a nigga can make his ends back
Prepare to murder if I have to and I had to
So I blasted the two in front and got the last few
No one escapes as Capone demonstrates power
And regulates the Westside's leading white powder
Separates the boys from the men, you see who's your true friend
And who ain't when you begin stackin ends
That's why I never love no one but myself
There ain't a nigga crossed me that lived to tell (BLAOW!)

Now this is how it's done like one two three
If the motherfuckers serve tryin to step to a G
Only got love for me and my Doggs

Liten now who's a rather step would be (She gotta look when)
See we Kurupt, BG, who? What? (Simply not to be fucked with)
Best to be on your guard
We was stalkin the fuckin boulevard, really lord
But since it wadn't enough for the two-man crew
We disinobeyed em, contemplating on parlaying product in the revenue
Thought about it a minute then we concluded
We're been stupid as fuck not to get up in it
So we's like ""Shit! We had to do it!""
Servin them cavi to make the cash flow, just to let em roll through it
And so we gathered up the proper amounts
Bought ourselves a flight o' motherfuckin birds and me and my niggas sat
Down
(To defeat the rest
So we shook the fuck up from the east to west)
Came up large and come out at ease
Niggas started recitin philosophies like 'True as a rainbow'
Yes why'all niggas was born into bawlin
Since they was swimmin in Pop's balls
And all of a sudden I started noticin decreasin my grip fingers
And I'm like ""What? Hold on, wait a minute""
Wassup nigga with this shortness of my green
He looked me in my face and said ""Fuck, you think of me""
And right before my eyes the partnership dissolved
I sent him like he was a ho, showed him no love at all
He reached for his Glock but I was quicker BLAOW!
Used to be my homey but you's a dead motherfucker now
I'm ashamed but I say fuck it, the day I became the Boss Hogg
'Cause today I buried my Dogg

Check it
This just a quick reminder to let all why'all motherfuckers know
There ain't no friends in this game
Especially when you're dealin with half white and black hearted, cross
Eyed, curly haired motherfuckers, knowI'msayin?
The name's Capone puttin it down with big CPO Boss Hogg

Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways

Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone

Guess who's back?

I got keys coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 Big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'

Picture, picture me rollin'
Rollin', picture me rollin'
Wheelin', picture me rollin'
Picture me yea yeah

I gots to get the fuck up in it
Formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight suffering from lack of having paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

We caught em sleeping, he didn't peep you niggas creeping?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
Cpo, we got the bomb spot, nigga time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you could get the females

I'm lost in the land with no plan, living life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to serving this, Moet and pay-checks

It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawling
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coasting
Where you going I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowing against the grain niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act, shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?

The feds is watching, niggaz plotting to get me
Will I survive, will I die? Come on let's picture the possibility
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm living rough and raw
Catching cases at a fast rate, balling in the fast lane
Hustle til the morning, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, cause even getting high
These niggas got me tossing shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burning rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me!

Live the life as a boss player (All eyez on me)

Intro. (Acoustic Guitar and Electric Guitar)]
How can I sweep these words into a cluster
Put 'em in a pile like feathers on your floor?
Voyages and sea forests deep blue and rusty
Sew 'em in a satchel 'n leave 'em at your door
People's lives, people's whose lives
They fascinate me
All my life, all my life
I've wanted to understand
There's a man on the corner he's got the moon in his eyes
He just comes here to visit and he wears a disguise
And I wonder if he's looking for friends or for truth
I think he's calling for some in that telephone booth
And the smiling woman answers
She defeats fear with her eyes
She thinks life's fine so I think she's wise
And my heart wants to give her a gift so grand
That it will speak for me and tell her just where I stand
And I stand on a pillar and it's melting like ice
Of years that I've lived and some I've lived twice
And I have all these feathers and leaves on my floor
That I don't want just blowing around loose anymore
And I feel a need to gather to rummage and fetch
To shake out my life and give it a stretch
To bring shells to the surface, give 'em to you
Gifts from the sea floor rusty and blue
[Instrumental (Electric Guitar)]
Now these two lives hold my attention quite well
You see lives almost never run parallel
Like the boards in the flooring all deep grained and worn
Fated and fitted long before we were born
People's lives, people's whose lives
They fascinate me
All my life, all my life
I've wanted to understand
Understand

Cr7z,"Letzte Nacht träumte ich von Krieg
So realistisch, so intensiv
Die Soldaten, die vermummten Gruppen, das Ducken vor Kugeln und die Ungewissheit in jeder Sekunde, die verfliegt
Alles außer Kontrolle in Anarchie, brennende Regierungsgebäude und Feuer in Familienhäuser
Fliehende Leute, heulende Mütter, die nach ihren Kindern rufen, sie suchen, oder sie hinter sich herzieh'n
Ein getrenntes Pärchen, dass sich in Ruinen wiedersieht, weinend in den Armen liegt und direkt wieder liebt
Männer, die rennen in Flammen und keinen Gedanken daran verschwenden, ob es einer von ihnen überlebt
Als ich erwachte, war ich schweißgebadet, habe geweint, wie damals, als ich klein und schwach war
Öffnete das Fenster, atmete die Luft, sah zum Himmel über Deutschland und erwartete den Schuss
Aber heute blieb alles beim Alten, freute mich zum einen
Doch zum ander'n hatte ich Sorgen, die sich vielleicht im Morgen entfalten
Diese friedliche Idylle akzeptiere ich nur widerwillig, weil irgendwo da draußen etwas waltet
Eine kühle Brise, die meine Gesichtszüge streift, aus dem Norden, wo es kalt ist
Sind wir so weit, die Kanäle zu öffnen, jedes beseelte Geschöpf der Erde zu schützen in einem Lichtschein?

Geh'n zurück an den Anfang und sind trotzdem am Ende
Gefallene Engel fielen uns in die Hände

Wie weit ist es, bis sich all unsere Hoffnungen erfüllen?
Wie fern schweben die goldenen Aufnahmen ins All?
In einem Raum, der sich spreizt, wie das Pfauenfederkleid
Wie oft werd' ich noch geweckt von lautem Geschrei?
Wie lang' glauben wir noch ihre Schauspielerei?
Wie viele müssen sich noch von Brücken werfen?
In welcher Zeit sind wir mit den Feinden im Reinen und können glücklich sterben?
Lass die Mütter die Kinder gebären, die immer währenden Frieden und Liebe in sich beherbergen
Und nicht verzehrt werden in den Fängen der Maschinen, den Klängen der Sirenen oder den Kämpfen mit dem Biest
Sieben ist heavenly movement

Mannheim ist im Viereck angelegt
Hier unten fuhr ich Dekaden durch den Dreck, wie ein Jeep in Richtung Xer und bin nun endlich am Ziel
Die nächste Reise führt uns alle weiter
Zu lange wagte ich den Alleingang, aber lernte, nur gemeinsam verändert man viele
Unterbewusst hab' ich als Junge gewusst, dass ein Wunder geschieht, als ich mit 13 meine ersten Blätter beschrieb
Jetzt oder nie, der Zetter durchbrettert den Beat mit der Exzellenz eines weltbekannten Sängers
Denn die Gerechtigkeit siegt, solange wir uns vereinen, ich schweige im Leiden, wir beide schreiben heilige Musik

Diese Lieder gibt es, weil wir die Liebe empfinden
Dennoch werden wir klassifiziert als Spinner des neuen Milleniums
Die sieben Weltmeere, wenn die Wellen kommen, werden sie merken, wie ihre Lügengebilde vor unser'n Gefühlen erzittern
Wir spüren, dass etwas nicht stimmt und wir prüfen nicht mehr ihr Bitten im subliminal
Willentlich infiltrieren wir die Bilderberger Gefilde und ringen bis zur Spitze durch
Ich zieh' die Stärke aus dem Mittelpunkt der Erde und vermehre mein Wissen in jedem Wesen, das hört
Entweder, ihr jagt mir 'ne Kugel im Kopf, oder lüftet euren Betrug an uns
Sonst wird uns're Hydra sich erwehren
Wir werden alle nur geführt von den Sternen
Wir gehen dahin zurück, wo's anfing - Kryo oder Therme?
Prüfen meines Zyklus in der Düsternis der Berge, Mythos oder wer weiß
Der Kreis wird nicht brüderlich geteilt
Werf' den Schein in Wasser, es zieht konzentrische Kreise
Meine Schwester werd' ich niemals vergessen
Ihr geht zurseite, wenn ich flehe und teile für Jennifer in meiner Seele, die eins mit mir ist
Und das auch noch länger als ich hier lebe
Und mit Xavier gemeinsam steh' ich ein für das Menschengeschlecht
Langsam ist für diesen inneren Krieg ein Ende in Sicht

Lifeblood splashed upon Her skin 
In gout torture unleashed 

And to Her dead reflection 
Twas as if Her pallor gleamed 
Like an angel's warmed by candles 
Where erotic stains had cleaved 

So demons dragged this libertine 
Lusts screaming for release 
Upon the flesh of maidens preened 
As canvas for caprice 

Exacting obeisance 
Her gaze held a seance 
Of spirits too trapped under glass to commune 
A sleetier mistress than Luna 
Whose threats to consume Her 
Met with torments giving vent to Her swoon 

Flat on Her back 
Pack-prey for the reams 
Of verses and curses 
That haunted Her dreams 

Mid-nightmare chimed 
Thirteen in Her mind 
A disciple of scars 
Branded years hissed behind 

Ridden split-thighed 
By the Father of lies 
An ovation of wolves 
Blushed the skies as they writhed 

But Heaven is never forever 
She came, a spent storm 
From the clouds 

Leaving serpents in office 
Inside every gate 
To lick righteous holes 
Blinding Lords to the fate 

Of virgins forced naked 
To defile on rent knees 
Hacked and racked backwards 
Menses choking their pleas 

More whore more 
Twitching make me wet with thee 
Carcass rub me raw",Cruelty Brought Thee Orchids,1998
Cradle of Filth,"Nights came tralling ghost concertos
Heartstrings a score of skeletal reaper bows
Playing torture chamber music allegretto
Conducting over throes trashed to crescendo

Skinless the dark shall scream
Hoarse Her symphonies

Deathmashed as the moon
That had lifted Her dreams
And frowned on the winding steps down
To where the vulgar strayed,
Taunting sick Her tender prey
She glided in Her bridal gown

How sleep the pure
Desire in Violent Overture

An emanation of phantom madness
The Countess beheld in shroud
By girls bereft of future vows
Soon to wed in white the frosted ground
Burning like a brand on the countenance of god
A yearning took Her hand to His Seraphim, bound

Deep red hissed the cat whips
On the whim of ill-will
Whilst She entranced, nonchalant, abliss
Flayed further songs of overkill

How weep the pure
Desire in Violent overture

In a crescent-whime cellar of crushed roses
Pooled blood and broken dolls
A torchlit shadow theatre souled
With the echoed cries of lives She stole

Killing time
She struck the hours dead
In Her control
Thus menopaused
Her clock of hacked out cunts
Began to toll

""Thirteen chimes of ancient strain
I conjure forth with dirge
That fills the void with timbred pain
To fulfil my sexual urge""

Frights came wailing from the Darkside
Haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes
Velvet, their voices coffined Her in slumber
Bespattered and appeased
As pregnant skies outside bore thunder

How sleep the pure
Desire in violent overture

As when high winds
Attune whipped trees
Her savage nature pitched
Would once again conduct the pleas
Of those She loved to agonies

As if it were
The first time every night
That She carved Her seal
In the flesh of life.",Desire in Violent Overture,1998
Cradle of Filth,"Spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
Her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
A disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
Bled white and dead, Her true mother was fed
To the ravenous wolves that the elements led
From crag-jagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease

Through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
Flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
(Gilded in crests of Carpathian breed)
Bringing slaves to the sodomite for the new-born
On that eve when the Countess' own came deformed
A tragedy crept to the name Bathory

Elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
Grew so dark as this sylph
None more cold in repose
Yet Her beauty spun webs
Round hearts a glance would betroth

She feared the light
So when She fell like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
But after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
Never were Her dreams so maniacally cruel
(And possessed of such delights)
For ravens winged Her nightly flights
Of erotica
Half spurned from the pulpit
Torments to occur
Half learnt from the cabal of demons
In Her
Her walk went to voodoo
To see Her own shadow adored
At mass without flaw
Though inwards She abhored
Not Her coven of suitors
But the stare of their Lord

""I must avert mine eyes to hymns
For His gaze brings dogmas to my skin
He knows that I dreamt of carnal rites
With Him undead for three long nights""

Elizabeth listened
No sermons intoned
Dragged such guilt to Her door
Tombed Her soul with such stone
For She swore the Priest sighed
When She knelt down to atone

She feared the light
So when She fell
Like a sinner to vice
Under austere, puritanical rule
She sacrificed
Her decorum as chaste
To this wolf of the cloth
Pouncing to haunt
Her confessional box
Forgiveness would come
When Her sins were washed off
By rebaptism in white

The looking glass cast Belladonna wreaths
'Pon the grave of Her innocence
Her hidden face spat murder
From a whisper to a scream
All sleep seemed cursed
In Faustian verse
But there in orgiastic Hell
No horrors were worse
Than the mirrored revelation
The She kissed the Devil's phallus
By Her own decree

So with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
Solstice Eve She fled the castle in secret
A daughter of the storm, astride Her favourite nightmare
On winds without prayer
Stigmata still wept between Her legs
A cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
She sought the Sorceress
Through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair

Nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
For the throat of Elizabeth
Damnation won and urged the moon
In soliloquy to gleam
Twixt the trees in shafts
To ghost a path
Past the howl of buggered nymphs
In the sodomite's grasp
To the forest's vulva
Where the witch scholared Her
In even darker themes

""Amongst philtres and melissas
Midst the grease of strangled men
And eldritch truths, elder ill-omen
Elizabeth came to life again""

And under lacerations of dawn She returned
Like a flame unto a deathshead
With a promise to burn
Secrets brooded as She rode
Through mist and marsh to where they showed
Her castle walls wherein the restless
Counted carrion crows

She awoke from a fable to mourning
Church bells wringing Her madly from sleep
Tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
Like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
The biblical prattled their mantras
Hexes six-tripled their fees
But Elizabeth laughed, thirteen Autumns had passed
And She was a widow from god and His wrath, finally",Thirteen Autumns and a Widow,1998
Cradle of Filth,"""Mirror, mirror on the wall
Shouldst not grave pleasures be my all?
For if I shall see thy Will be done
Grant Me the Witchcraft of thy tongue""

Three moondials froze in the shadow of six
As another soul passed to the grasping Styx
Clutching their trinket crucifix
Bats blew from caves in a dissonant surge
Omens of corruption from within the church
A fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth

Alone as a stone cold altar
The castle and its keep
Like faerytale dominion rose
A widow to the snow peaks
Wherein reclined the Countess
Limbs purring from the kill
Bathed in virgin white and like the night
Alive and young and unfulfilled

Was it the cry of a wolf
That broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
Of Her life as a mere reflection
(As the moon's in narrow windows caught)
That opened like dark eyelids on
The sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon

Like a Siren weaving song
From the lilt of choirs choking
Where the vengeful dead
Belong...

To the Sorceress and Her charnel arts
She swept from ebon towers at the hour of Mars
'Neath a star-inwoven sky latticed by scars
To unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
Shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
In netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared

Was it the Kiss of the mist
That peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
Lost souls begging resurrection
From Gods upon their forest plinths
Whose epitaphs read of re-ascending to win
Remission from despair through a holocaust of sin

In a tongue hilted in invective rectums
Over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
To Death, to rend the slender veil
That Ancient Ones might rise again

As shadows swelled
The Countess fell
To masturbating with Her dagger
As the Witch gabbled spells
Cumming heavy roses all the way to Hell
As sudden thunder's grue harangue
Announced two pincered worlds

Exuding bane, something came
With the stench of necrophiled graves
To these clandestines
Who shrank from glimpsing horror
That the growls of mating houls inclined...

Resplendent
In pendants
(Natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns)
A demons, bewinged, bedight
In scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
An arctic tongue upon Her vulva
Where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
Glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
Receiving sole communion from the body of christ

""If blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
I will yield this witch to thee
If thou wouldst draw a veil for Me
O'er lengthening scars of age and grief""

As the Demon slavered foetid vows
And bore His prey away
In talons itching to perpetrate
The nausea of eternal rape
The Sorceress screaming in His grasp
Spat a final curse to stain
The Countess with the promise
That Her lord at war would be cruelly slain

And She would rot.

Waste away under the lashes of my whip

Expurse of innocence and helplessness
In the perfumes of my secret orison
Fresh blood of children drops down on me

Where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
hid the hissing of a serpent Libido
In an ancient tryst with catastrophe
Soon to be kept

Left tear streaked reason upon the shore
And bereft of compass, star or more

Few at the prow, most slave below
Painting coal a perfect gold
But for all it's worth, the engines slow
Dead in the brine again

Prey to phallus seas

Cradle of Filth,"The Moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait
Soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
As this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
And the Midnightmare trampling of dreams
But no, no tears please
Fear and pain may accompany Death
But it is desire that shepherds it's certainty
As We shall see

She was divinity's creature
That kissed in cold mirrors
A Queen of snow
Far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry
Sought Her everywhere
Dark liquored eyes
An Arabian nightmare

She shone on watercolors
Of my pond life as pearl
Until those who couldn't have Her
Cut Her free of this World

That fateful Eve when
The trees stank of sunset and camphor
Their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
An inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
On my love picking rue by the light of the moon

Putting reason to flight
Or to death as their way
They crept through woods mesmerized
By the taffeta Ley
Of Her hips that held sway
Over all they surveyed
Save a mist on the rise
(A deadly blessing to hide)
Her ghost in the fog

They raped left
(Five men of God)
Her ghost in the fog

Dawn discovered Her there
Beneath the Cedar's stare
Silk dress torn, Her raven hair
Flown to gown Her beauty bared
Was starred with frost, I knew Her lost
I wept 'til tears crept back to prayer

She'd sworn Me vows in fragrant blood
""Never to part
Lest jealous Heaven stole our hearts""

Then this I screamed:
""Come back to Me
I was born in love with thee
So why should fate stand in between?""

And as I drowned Her gentle curves
With dreams unsaid and final words
I espied a gleam trodden to earth
The Church bell tower key...

The village mourned her by the by
For She'd been a witch
Their Men had longed to try
And I broke under Christ seeking guilty signs
My tortured soul on ice

A Queen of snow
Far beyond compare
Lips attuned to symmetry
Sought Her everywhere
Trappistine eyes
An Arabian nightmare

She was Ersulie possessed
Of a milky white skin
My porcelain Yin
A graceful Angel of Sin

And so for Her
The breeze stank of sunset and camphor
My lantern chased Her phantom and blew
Their Chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
Best reserved for judgment that their bible construed

Putting reason to flight
Or to flame unashamed
I swept form cries
Mesmerized
By the taffeta Ley
Or Her hips that held sway
Over all those at bay
Save a mist on the rise
A final blessing to hide
Her ghost in the fog

And I embraced
Where lovers rot
Her ghost in the fog

Vaginal skin to later taste and masturbate within

Whors d'oeuvres eaten, I tucked her into
A grave coffin fit for the queen of spades
She went out like the light in my mind
Her face an avalanche of pearl, of ruby wine
Much was a flux, but the mouth once good for fucks
Came from retirement to prove she had not lost her touch
I kissed her viciously, maliciously, religiously

A kindred spirit in a graveyard
Beneath the stature of a colder Saviour
Mist hung like thieves wreathed in scant arabesques
And through the chill earth it bedwed Her drawling breast
Like a come dream true under etched glass spent
Making love to the beautiful dead

She has sinned and severed Heaven
And in it's vulgar sight
Two figures writhe, but one silhouette

To take the reins of pleasure

Out of spite and playful eyes

Pricked as a Witch Her stitches itch
For familiar lips to lick them dry

Even wild winds sang in chora for Her
Saffron from my heart, from the start I swore

Of concern save for the aeons left

Cradle of Filth,"Biblical choirs soar beyond veiled light
A swansong for ravens trapped flapping in night

A tragic yet magickal fall from grace
Too awful to taste for the led and the chaste
Those whose long fetters are addressed to all saints

Free shining souls torn from Giod's given Reich
Defiled, reviled, exiled from sight

And Hell knows we sought victory
Chancing the leash
But when bad die were cast
We were cast down to die
A steeple of needles thrust into our eyes
So scholars might say we were blinded by pride
Like the sin of Our Father (and the whims of our kind)
Whom in Isaiah and Midian thrived
Regaining His sights for the storming of skies

And after descenturies have crawled, vilified
Our dark harkened day on spread wing now arrives

For eternity is a coprophagic
Backward figure head
Gorging on Her own bitter end
And We have eaten shit
Until we're close to addicts

To retake what once was lost
To exalt our throne above the stars of God

Fellated Satan
Screams congeal in clotted pearl
As He unfurls from aching hibernation

Stormbringer drums thunder to full Dis orchestra
As lighting streaks with fire
Black clouds that shroud the Earth
Whose cold breasts have held us in scar pillories
But now the Sun is loath to come
The crescent moon is freed

Elated Satan
The scimitar slash to the undergash
Of Heaven too slight for penetration

We strike as wolves from the thickening fog
To exalt our throne ove the stars of God
Lowly holy goats bare the brunt
Of rabid dogmas on a stellar bearhunt
Bastioned in citadels and monastic cells
That smell of blessed cunt
Like a convent where crosses rust
From thirty dirty habits of shaved nun
There where deeper needs are begged of lust
And cess and less impress enough

Obtaining the ord of Our Gaurdian, Anger
And Death's tunnel vision
Bad thing in collision

Unpicking the seams of fate sewn over dreams
Feasting from throats of celestial thieves

And God knows we seek victory

To drive nails home of blind faith through those

Of dead rooks in the rain

Revenge accrued to a monolith
Bursting through from our roofed abyss

On reinstatement have won

Midian

Haunted by this portent
This obsession in my mind
With a city sunk below
Tall cedar groves and graves sublime
Sporting their importance
Marble wings spread to the skies
A vale of dreams that it would seem
The daylights race to leave behind

These visions struck like a furious fuck
Nailing wet lips to cold cemetery walls
Flashes of lust to dust
Splashed across my psychic pall
As hybrid lovers reached their cusp
With final thrusts I saw it all

Forbidden Midian
A long fabled Judecca
A sanctuary for sin
To rival Heaven
Free of Eden's tragic wreck
(Though the only Angels in repose
Were those with ivy strangled necks)
Small mercies in vistas of dolmen and vault
Gaunt, haunched edifices
Midst lightfingered mists
From whence more awful shadows
Drew back rusted bolts
And dared a threshold
The searing Sun had knelt to kiss

Shades of dusk, cruelty and myth
The Tribes of Christ will not forgive
And shall not suffer their kind to live

For I, mesmerized, started not from tombs
Or their waltz so sibilant
Through the gathering gloom
But from flumes of the moon in bloom
Baring cach a face effaced
And raped in the womb

In hidden Midian
A vatican lying in state
For the sanctity of sin
To rival Heaven
Above Eden's birth defects
Though the only Angels that arose
Were those who fell to most requests
Small mercies in vistas where dolmen and vault
Caught twisted whispers where fisted sisters
Haunched, flaunted orifice
Midst lighter fingered mists
Whilst I watched without revolt
Carnalities few beasts permit

Between the dog and wolf
Bared fangs met in intercourse
A nightly right of teeth and cunt
For those below who rose to hunt

Sor sights that preyed on Me for days
And in laudenum's haze
I painted them all

I drew in blood, my veins in thrall
To Deathugees at peace within

The raven winged and missing limbed
Suicides and split thighed Seraphim

And marble stairs
Star grazers dare
Ascend like prayer

Like the wrecking weed of a demon freed
To curse the star with vertigo

Through the black backed mirrors in sanity
Lucent prides amassed in last retreat
Prurient souls but no more freaks
Than those leashing dreams at harm's length from Me
And just like grim ascension prophecies
My revenge, carved deep, will be
A grisly plot that reads
Like my filthy white ward spattered with their screams
When My Deviliverers come from fog for Me

Through the bars in My room

To grace Her lips with contraband
The blaze once in my veins",Suicide and Other Comforts,2001
Cradle of Filth,"You thought it was gone
But the fire goes on
And I thought you knew me
I told you before
'Til I settle the score
That I'll never run free
I have enough pain and anger in my brain
To last many lifetimes
Yet still it grows, and the more that it shows
I won't have peace of mind

The fire, the fire still burns

I have a dream
And as strange as it seems
There's no embers glowing
The fire's gone out and there's no need to shout
'Cause no anger's showing
But it's not true, nothing I ever do
Seems to ease my fury
Get out of my way
I'm the hangman today
And the judge and jury

The fire, the fire still burns",The Fire Still Burns,2001
Cradle of Filth,"I'm waiting in my cold cell, when the bell begins to chime
Reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'Cause at 5 o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
The sands of time for me are running low

When the priest comes to read me the last rites
I take a look through the bars at the last sights
Of a world that has gone very wrong for me

Can it be that there's some sort of error?
Hard to stop the surmounting terror
Is it really the end, not some crazy dream

Somebody please tell me that I'm dreaming
It's not easy to stop from screaming
The words escape me when I try to speak

Tears flow but why am I crying
After all I'm not afraid of dying
Don't I believe that there never is an end? No

As the guards march me out to the courtyard
Somebody cries from a cell, ""God be with you""
If there's a God then why has he let me go?

As I walk all my life drifts before me
Though the end is near I'm not sorry
Catch my soul, it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on
Don't worry now that I have gone
I've gone beyond to seek the truth

So when you know that your time is close at hand
Maybe then you'll begin to understand
Life down here is just a strange illusion

Hallowed be thy name
Hallowed be thy name

",Thirteen Autumns and a Widow [Red October Mix],2002
Cradle of Filth,"Lurking in the shade
Of dark and fragrant trees
Shirking from the rage
That tore the heavens free

A vagrant angel
His with span to see
The garden swell with terrors
To banish man and Eve

Another fall from grace
Whiplashed from the gates
Half naked and insane
Full blooded, breasted
Nerve ends tested
To behests of pain

A sombre lot to gain

As the storm slid in
Borne by carnal winds
The upper ether thinned
And therein sat abominations

Satan seated there
To savoring the reek of desolation
But their dank despair
Moved his speech to leech the air

""Behold the golden door
Paradise is lost
So praise me as you raised your Lord
And I shall thaw this gnawing frost""

Another fall from grace
Whiplashed from the gates
Half naked and insane
And destined for a spiteful fate

Wherein evil sought the shamed
As pawns in greater stakes
Across this cosmic game
To win the hand of darkness and
Set her in her rightful place

Cursed is the ground for thy sake
In sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life
Thorns also and thistles shall bring it forth to thee
And thou shalt eat the herb of the field

In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
Till thou return unto the ground
For out of it was thou taken
For dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou now return

With that the pact was sealed
And as creation reeled
Bewitched oration filled
The hearts of all
Who came to crawl
Upon these earthen fields

A sombre lot to till

A wracked black acid song
Spat from the massive throng
Of Seraph knelt along
The deep red welt to domination

The deep red welt to domination
(Domination, domination, domination)
The deep red welt to domination
(Domination)
The deep red welt to domination

",II. Paradise Lost: Carrion,2003
Cradle of Filth,"I bled on a pivotal stretch
Like a clockwork Christ
Bears sore stigmata, bored

And as I threw Job, I drove
Myself to a martyred wretch
To see if I drew pity
Or pretty litanies from the Lord

So the plot sickened
With the coming of days
Ill millennia thickened
With the claret I sprayed
And though they saw red
I left a dirty white stain
A splintered know in the grain
On Eden's marital aid

So glad for the madness
I walked the walls naked to the moon
In Sodom and Babylon
And through rich whores and corridors
Of the Vatican
I led a sordid Borgia on

I read the Urilia text
So that mortals wormed
As livebait for the dead

And as I broke hope, I choked
Another pope with manna peel
Dictating to DeSade
In the dark entrails of the Bastille
And as he wrote, I smote
A royal blow to the heads of France
And in the sheen of guillotines
I saw others, fallen, dance

I was an incurable
Necromantic old fool
A phagadaena that crawled
Drooling over the past
A rabid wolf in shawl
A razor's edge to the rule
That the stars overall
Were never destined to last

So glad for the madness
I furnaced dreams, a poet, for of sleep
Turning sermons with the smell
On Witchfinder fingers
Where bad memories lingered
Burning, as when Dante
Was freed to map Hell

I sired schemes and the means
To catch sight of the seams
And the vagaries inbetween...

And midst the lips and the curls
Of this cunt of a world
In glimpses I would see
A nymph with eyes for me

Eyes of fire that set all life aflame
Lights that surpassed art
In sight, that no intense device of pain
Could prise their secrets from my heart

I knew not her name
Though her kiss was the same
Without a whisper of shame
As either Virtue or Sin's
And pressed to Her curve
I felt my destiny swerve
From damnation reserved
To a permanent grin...

Be my mannequin
I cannot remember
How it was that we first met
Curve of moon and haunted shore
The stars were not those heaven sent

Did we come together
At masked palatial balls
In silks and flesh and leather
Or did we come at all?
I dreamt a midnight castle
The eerie song of wolves
And eyes that danced with fire
As they have forever more

Our rites of sin
Have long fathered a hymn
To burden him
Whom by slip of after whim
At genesis
Dressed her like the wind
In autumn gowns
That pinned her down
To be my mannequin

Be my mannequin
Always poised on winter
But never would she break
My lovecraft and black witch heart
That pounded in her wake

We kissed on distant balconies
A law unto her own
Thirteenth dark commandment
Of figures pressed to stone
Turning cream with fantasies
That God alone would know
We graced vomitorium
With the sweet excess of rome

Flagrant in the past
Our names were deeply carved on the tree of life in long dead languages

But they would writhe
For my dark eye
Bewitched, was fixed like Mordecai's
On Esther's reign
And in this vein
I saw their lust still stain her thighs

Their cries
Have paralysed
And the smoke has choked these vistas
But still I lie
Though tears have died
On the grave of my Clarissa

Beneath these trees where the mist enwreathes
Her spirit flees, seeing chains of torches
A fleeting kiss stirring leaves of poetryâ?¦

I wasâ?¦
No dark knight, breaking men like ice
I was like a lycanthrope until the moon glazed over
Lipped with blood and last goodbyes

Now I dream
Enwrapt in pure clouds of the sweetest oblivion
Where beauty streams
Freed from the teeth of those beasts that had come
To tear out her spells
In red lettered cells
Wherein even the crown prince of Hell
Come out of his arrogant shell
Would falter to better

But her face soon dispels
And as black feathers fell
From heaven's smoke
So I woke to insanity
Her exquisite corpse
Found fit for their sport
Of course
Would burn on the morrow with meâ?¦

And there on this night
Strung up in my sight
Naked she sways
Displayed for their vulgar delight

I scream through my bars at the stars
That for these crimes of mine solace me
I will fear not the flames
That to passion are tame
Not nearly the same searing pain
(I pray) As held sway upon losing her
Nor the mettle of roars
That will settle like ashes and scores
As with our ghosts in the fog
When we both turn no more",Swansong for a Raven,2004
Cradle of Filth,"Dim the lights, wrong the rites 
Toss the peurile cross away 
We are gashing from a venomous womb 

Burning bright, dead of night 
Pyres stain a milky way 
Lust is splashing the dark face of the moon 

In the Samhain mist 
We lay in welcome by the western gate 
With the five fold kiss 
For every soul returning 
From the fecund abyss 
Where nature's travesties congregate 
With a stone cold wish 
To see the wickermen burning 

The wind, she whispers 
Through the graveyards of our hearts...

The wind, she flitters 
Through the forests of our hearts... 
Wreathed in leaves 
As she weaves her witchcraft 
We breathe, enamoured 
Of the conquering dark 

I will trace the knot of serpents in your hair 
Plot your face, then ascending marble stars 
You shall pluck me, masked, from roses-in-despair 
Tasting my blood 
That runs from worming tongue like prayer 

Under pagan veneer snakes a fear 
That makes the stars 
Grieve, just to be 
Uncharted on this Eve 
When part of me chars a path 
Through your heavely constellations

Cradle of Filth,"Evanescent like the scent of decay 
I was fading from the race 
When, in despair, my darkest days 
Ran amok and forged Her face 
From the fairest of handmaidens to 
A slick perverted wraith 

Nymphetamine 

Heaving midst narcissus 
On a maledict blanket of stars 
She was all three wishes 
Sex, sex, sex 

A lover hung on Her deathrow 
I was hooked on Her disease 
Highly strung like Cupid's bow 
Whose arrows hungered meat 
And the blinding flare of passion 
In the shade of narrow streets 
Where their poison never rationed 
All the tips they left in me 

Two tracks 
Bric-a-brac 
Something passed between us 
Like a bad crack 
Upward-lit 
I'd met another kind 

Of rat 
In fact 
With every Rome inside me 
Licked and ransacked 
She haunted at the corners of my mind 

In black 
Cataracts 
Wouldn't whitewash away 
Her filthy some stack 
She burnt me like a furnace 
For my future suicide 

Lead to the river 
Midsummer, I waved 
A V of black swans 
On with hope to the grave 
And through Red September 
With skies fire-paved 
I begged you appear 
Like a thorn for the holy ones 

Cold was my soul 
Untold was the pain 
I faced when you left me 
A rose in the rain... 
So I swore to the razor 
Than never, enchained 
Would your dark nails of faith 
Be pushed through my veins again 

Bared on your tomb 
I am a prayer for your loneliness 
And would you ever soon 
Come above onto me? 
For once upon a time 
From the binds of your lowliness 
I could always find 
The right slot for your sacred key... 

Six feet deep is the incision 
In my heart, that barless prison 
Discolours all with tunnel vision 
Sunsetter...

Sick and weak from my condition 
This lust, this vampyric addiction 
To Her alone in full submission 
None better... 
Nymphetamine 

Wracked with your charm 
I am circled like prey 
Back in the forest 
Where whispers persuade 
More sugar trails 
More white lady laid 
Than pillars of salt... 
(keeping Sodom at night at bay) 

Fold to my arms 
Hold their mesmeric sway 
And dance out to the moon 
As we did in those golden days 

Christening stars 
I remember the way 
We were needle and spoon 
Mislaid in the burning hay 

Bared on your tomb 
I am a prayer for your loneliness 
And would you ever soon 
Come above onto me? 
For once upon a time 
From the binds of you're lowliness 
I could always find 
The right slot for your sacred key... 

Six feet deep is the incision 
In my heart, that barless prison 
Discolours all with tunnel vision

Since the day I saw the cat at my door
So I came into you sweet lady
Answering your mystical call
Crystal ball on the table
Showing the future,the past
Same cat with them evil eyes
And I knew it was a spell she cast

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

Give me the ring on your finger
Let me see the lines on your hand
I can see me a tall dark stranger
Giving you what you hadn't planned
I drank the potion she offered me
I found myself on the floor
Then I looked into those big green eyes
And I wondered what I'd come there for

She's just a devil woman
With evil on her mind
Beware the devil woman

Be careful of them neighborhood strays
Of a lady with long black hair

Or the moon without the comfort of the stars

Improved it
Drove a sonnet
Right through it
And in this state of bliss
Evil kissed with wet lips
Pen-filled Fingertips
Which through me
For through me
Illuminati usually pissed
But with words of some hurts worth
I threw a party that extended God's list

Exciting new flames that my fame would claim for me
Reciting back the almanac of travesties

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
In excess and in canto

Grown wild
This child
Whole harems defiled
Faustina's and Mina's 
Lady Libertine and her sisters between her

What spread of lies arise when lovers die
Which circle of hell is mine when I arrive

They call me bad
Mad Caliban with manners
Dangerous to know
A passing fad
Taught in all debauch
Crow against the virgin snow


Grown colder, my shoulder
Like a boulder beside her
And bolder, not wiser
My dark seed took up root inside her
That mouldered, where older

Beddings would hold a passionate sigh
But Laudanum and soda
Lord Numb coda
Merited a forest of inherited spite

Fleeing grief for foreign maps
I still played vampire aristocrat
Unloading my gun in hot, promiscuous laps

Then shooting swans in a gondola
I tripped my foot on a fallen star
And there's nothing like a mouthful of Venetian tar
To let you know just who you fucking are

Brer Werewolf at her stocking tops
Beneath the tightened leather strop
Of the basque of the houndervilles

In a poisonous pen dipped in omen
To her surgeon full of general curses
In the hand of morgue redeemers

But it is She who has infected me 
For all eternity... 

As the sun slips the tearaway stars 
Into the scented scheme of night 
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose 
Set upon a marbled dream of white 
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue 
Jewelled with a God-lent grace 
I was close to coming when She bid adieu 
Fuelled by the heartache rent upon her face there 

Oh Mina, obscener 
Thoughts obsess my days 
Oh Mina, obscener 
Thoughts possess me 
That I must now obey 

They say the darkest hour 
Is that before the dawn 
When nothing in one's power 
Can dissipate the great forlorn 
Shadows of fire that haunt me 
Like risen whispers of her name 
For dawn is a dusk 
Wherein needs must 
Erupt from the grave, aflame 

Written in the dead of night 
And riding on the burning wind 
Smitten by her read delight 
My words alight like leaves of sin 

Stepping through a mirror 
The princess of the emerald glass 
Brought me one step nearer 
Love's infernal past... 

They say Hell hath no furies 
Like a woman scorned by life 
When the Heavenly Judge and juries 
Participate to chain this wife 
With forced virtues, Her secret needs 
Drew on my foreign blood 
On warm wet nights, with storm-wracked bites 
I gave her Eden after the flood 

Written in the dead of night 
And riding on the burning wind 
Smitten by her red delight 
My words alight like leaves of sin 

Verona, Marishka, Aleera 
Brides of old and goddesses all 
Forgive my wishes to be always near her 
Forever or whenever seas recall 

This Aphrodite from my embrace 
For as Mars (whom her lips placate) 
I tore these shores with wars of hatred 
Before our Paris set his fate 
In Helen, one might find mistake 
In winning tragedy 
For all eternity...

Through the rain that fell sick with lament
To this house of incest for when we undressed

The parade of my heavenly quests
Yet all tongues are not true, some are forked or askew
Like an uncivil serpent's at best
For oustered from Eden I fausted all reason
Hook in mouth like saint Peter Pan
To haunt faery groves and hot virgin coves

Claiming swift victory

When Joan had appeared
In a shower of tears
Last vestige of innocence

Yearning for her vision of divinity
Of her miracles and dreamt lyrical deeds

He would meet her at the pyre as the fire kissed
And together they'd climb to God, entwined in bliss

In a thin Disney veneer

Were those of children, disappeared

They'd listened to the winds
Heard the murdered Abel
Re-christened in the stone jaws of Tiffauges

Where the list of sins
Grew beyond a fable
They now roared abroad, restless with debauch

Restless with debauch

Restless with debauch
This tragic kingdom
Would see God's angels walk
Away

Satanic, enigmatic
His black magic was ecstatic
Megalomaniac in titanic displays
Dressed in the best
Wicked britches of the West
He cut a mourning figure in glorious swathe

But all his nightmares would come true
Drowning in a stream of unbounded pleasure

Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom

Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom

The moon bleared through the skeletal trees
Averting her face from congenital deeds

Thus eves grew murky, haunted, grieved
About this place laced with demon seed

Blanchet, a priest, his book of lies
Exonerated him from Gilles' crimes
Announced his fears, one night of sighs
A night for cursing nursery rhymes
In the light of the fire wrestling feckless shadows

On the weak and the rubies that his coffers let slip
Steered to near ruin in successive years

Lead all too enslaved by the flesh
To trespass against God's holy law

In this ornamental verse
In ventures down the centuries
Tormenting me with secrets so anathema

Am I too late or just perverse?

And the howling on the wind
Chills the blood for fear of spillage

Where nightfall used to be
Blessed with best tranquility

Templars from the crusades
Have birthed a church, more masquerade
In which they worship mass dementia

They came from dust and flame
By the Red Sea on dead shores
fleeing claims of blasphemy

And bestiality
Devils fed them back to us

Knights of holy wars, inviting hordes
Of grim infidelities
In the grip of cryptic lands
And desert sands
They found just cause

and midst their entourage
Under stars
They Bought relics and parts
Of saints
And evil left to clerics charge

With Muslim plunder they built their sect
To the composite Baphomet
An androgynous sphinx, open, erect
Universal in its closet display

Spawn of Lilith and Samael
First offender and the snake
In thrall like pawns beneath its spell

Sabbatical, fanatical

Of immutable beautiful
Darkness ever-afters

Then one eve when the ancient trees
Outside, drew back, unnerved
The pleas form those impatient teased
Something from the black beyond of nowhere

A stunning woman, summoned
Comming scimitar-curved
Statuesque, but living flesh
Draping nakedness about their pagan saviors

She came Lilith, a perfect myth
The scarlet whore
Skinned in magnificence
In her defense
She only slew a few of theme

Born of a sacrifice, a virgins price

A necklace wrought of twining snakes
Two gold illicit tongues
He laid it at her throat
Where the rope had wrung
He was burning from the furnace
Of his roused desire

He wrested with temptation
To be or unfulfilled

Her sumptuous form, the storm revealed

And with his driven lust exploding
Her lashes brushed his cheeks
They flickered with life, her limbs enfolding
Purring, licking wicked teeth

Drool for the love of my virulent sway

Until he was drowned
Hurled on the shore

Mortal kind, a morbid wine
For this dark moon goddess
And freed to stretch her claws
This beautiful whore
Would be brutally honest

Tortuous one, taboos undone
A glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
And a thickening mist, a seductress
Leading lovesick hearts astray

In the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
At the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
Burning behind her in arabesque smoke
Framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat

Victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
Possessed a regal bearing
Of omnipotent power
From wet lips to her smouldering thighs
Her beauty perfected and her will agonized

Drool for the love of my virulent sway

Inside a soldier's barn

But only when I smelt the blood
Did I fear her colder hand""

Reborn at last to cast my
Fecund shadow on this world,
You shall worship me, enslaved
For many lovers shall I crave
And in return, I'll gladly pave
Your psycho path with pearls

For I have been grating
And waiting so long to find
The most perfect hostess close to me
Whose thin-ice troubled mind
Was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
To slip right through in time
When at last I wore Harmonia's necklace
The cursed twin serpents mine""

Tortuous one, debauchery won

Cradle of Filth,"At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
And on the autumn air
The scent of bonfires everywhere
And a fell wind stirred the leaves

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Little Miss Demeanour in the demons bed
Gasps she just could not suppress
After lights-out midst the dead
And a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness

Time was running faster for disaster
Strange nights were burning
In the furnace of her dreams
A name was uttered, Lilith
Mistress, playmate, master
Such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy

And in the thick of all
In the Black Goddess's thrall
With the wood unseen for trees
Victoria stood tall
Promiscuous in step
The Devil breathing down her neck
As jealous zealots stitched apiece

The persecution song

Telltale signs of possession
Fickle Miss Demeanour hissed and disappeared
To her Sisters of the cloth
She now reeked of Astaroth
Again the curse had surfaced
Sneaking back the pagan years

Weaving webs of great revealing
Hidden in the convent
An evil libido abided, undone
Breathing, deceiving
Feasting on her deviant feelings
She'd clung to her crucifix
Once her torturers begun

Her screams came quick
The miserichord
Den to vice and screw
That had reddened many tongues
Wrung symphonies
Of suffering from her

Many moons hardened pure hearts
Those plagued by her black arts
Their rooms secreting phantom orgies
Vile rites and rifled graves

Mere hours, now towered
Above this bent and beaten flower
Her naked body privy to
The Abbess and her ways

Victoria fought
No guilt was wrought
Just a torrid retort of blasphemies
Nails and crosses vomited forth
From this pretty little whore now arched like Hell

Arched like Hell

At the very start
There were whispers in the dark
And for all the world to see
There was witchcraft at its heart
But then the end grew nigh
A dirge inferno filled the sky
In its customary key

The persecution song

Telltale signs of obsession
No wailing banshee would dishonour their name
Nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
Storm-clouds threatened holy smoke
They hanged her there like Judas
With the Hellcat in her reined

Time was running faster for disaster
Exorcism, torture, gallows
Now a shallow grave
A name was stuttered, Isaac

They made him dig the pit
Mindless of what it claimed",The Persecution Song [Elder Version] [Version],2011

Scaling the towers with power ordained
Dark flowers of infamy bud

Ransacking, hacking off Saracen reign
The temple drinks claret in floods

Mercy forgotten in our ill-gotten gain
Of women and innocent blood

Death abides in this domain of ashes
The streets are stained with the butchered foe
Now I hear the bells of triumph ringing
As they lay there rotting in their thousand shrouds
Beneath the clouds that skitter and scatter
Dispersions on the truth of heaven

I'm amazed at the price I choose to pay
And to think I ignored what really mattered

But when I finally reached the point of giving in
I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive.

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose
That holds be to the cross but sets me free
I will glory in the power of the cross
The things I thought were gain I count as loss
And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

And to die is truly gain

Craig,"Once there was a holy place
Evidence of God's embrace
And I can almost see mercy's face
Pressed against the veil
Looking down with longing eyes
Mercy must have realized
That once His blood was sacrificed
Freedom would prevail
And as the sky grew dark
And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

[Chorus:]
Mercy came running
Like a prisoner set free
Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin
Just when I felt like giving in

Sometimes I still feel so far
So far from where I really should be

Just to remind me

Immovable Rock, Omnipotent, Powerful,
Awesome Lord.
Victorious Warrior, Commanding King of Kings,
Mighty Conqueror and the only time,
The only time I ever saw him run,
Was when

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me By surprise, When God ran

The day I left home,
I knew I'd broken His heart.
And I wondered then, if things could ever be the same.
Then one night,
I remembered His love for me.
And down that dusty road, ahead I could see,
It was the only time,
It was the only time I ever saw Him run.
And then

He ran to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to His chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice He said
""Son, do you know I still love You?""

He caught me by surprise.
And He brought me to my knees.
When God ran, I saw Him run to me.

I was so ashamed, all alone, and so far away.
But now I know, that He's been waiting for this day
I saw Him run to me,
He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""
Lifted my face,
Wiped the tears from my eyes,
With forgiveness in His voice
I felt his love for me again.

He took me in His arms,
Held my head to his chest,
Said ""My son's come home again!""

Wiped the tears from my eyes,

Stay and the night would be enough

Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satellite television
You can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans
London, Belfast and Berlin

And if you listen I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you

If I could stay
Then the night would give you up
Stay then the day would keep its trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit I found
Stay and the night would be enough

Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter
As an angel runs to ground

As an angel
Hits the ground","Stay (Faraway, So Close!)",2002

Craig Armstrong,"This story is about love
The woman I loved is dead

There was a boy
A very strange enchanted boy

They say he wandered very far
Very far over land and sea

A little child and sailed about
But very wise, was he

And then one day, one magic day he passed my way

Is just to love, and be loved in return",Nature Boy [From Moulin Rouge!],2005

It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Who delight in panning the dancing teachers,
Let me tell you there are a lot of features
Of the dance that carry you through
The gates of Hea-ven.

It's madness
To be always sitting around in sadness,
When you could be learning the steps of gladness.
You'll be happy when you can do
Just six or seven;

Begin to day!
You'll find it nice,
The quickest way to paradise.
When you practise,
Here's the thing to know,
Simply say as you go...

[Chorus]
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step ev'ry day !
I'm gonna get there at any price;
Stand aside, I'm on my way !
I've got the blues
And up above it's so fair.
Shoes ! Go on and carry me there !
I'll build a stairway to Paradise
With a new step every day.

Every new step
Helps a bit ; but any old kind of two step,
Does as well. It don't matter what step you step,
If you work it into your soul
You'll get to Heaven.
Get bu-sy ;
Dance with Maud the countess, or just plain Lizzy:
Dance until you're blue in the face and dizzy.
When you've learn'd to dance in your sleep
You're sure to win out.

In time you'll get Saint Vitus dance,
Which beats the latest thing from France.
Take no chances on this Paradise ;
Let me give you advice.

That he'll appear.

The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay.

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand,
And in a little while,
He'll take my hand,
And though it seems absurd,
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not,
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Hot tires sing like a string being bowed
Sudden town rears up then explodes
Fragments resolve into white line code
Whirl on silver wheels 

Black earth energy receptor fields
Undulate under a grey cloud shield
We outrun a river color brick red mud
That cleaves apart hills soil rich as blood 

Highway squeeze in construction steam
Stop caution hard hat yellow insect machines
Silver steel towers stalk rolling land
Toward distant stacks that shout ""Feed on demand"" 

One hundred miles later the sky has changed
Urban anticipation, we get 4 lanes
Red orange furnace sphere notches down
Throws up silhouette skyline in brown 

Sun dogs flare on windshield glass
Sudden swoop skyward iron horse overpass
Pass a man walking like the man in the moon
Walking like his head's full of Irish fiddle tunes 

The skin around every city looks the same
Miles of flat neon spelling well-known names
Used trucks dirty donuts you you're the one
Fat wheeled cars squeal into the sun

Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination,
Silently the senses, abandon their defenses,

Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender,
Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Turn you face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling, sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music of the night

Tried for three years
Seems like thirty
Could you ask as much
From any other man?

But if I die
See the saga through
And do the things you ask of me

Announces the cat who can now be reborn
And come back to a different jellicle life

Let your memory lead you
Open up, enter in
If you find there the meaning of what happiness is
Then a new life will begin
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can smile at the old days
I was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Burnt out ends of smokey days
The stale cold smell of morning
The streetlamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Daylight, I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Sunlight, through the trees in the summer
Endless masquerading
Like a flower as the dawn is breaking
The memory is fading
Touch me, it's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun

Look, a new day has begun

(Come on)
(Can you fill me in)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said hey boy, come on right around
So I knock at the door
You was standing with a bottle of red wine
Ready to pour
Dressed in all that Satin and Lace to the floor

So I went in
Then we sat down start kissing
Caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi
Sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answerphone
Please leave a message after the tone

I'm not being mean
Her Parents were kinda cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
we were just doing things young people in love do
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answerphone
Red wine bottle half the contents gone
Midnight return Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say hey girl, come on right around
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride
Checking that nobody saw

The club we went in
We got down down down to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leaving
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold

I'm not being mean
I didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your Mum and Dad for fools
We were just doing things young people end up doing
Parents trying to find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12 come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a Taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

(Can you fill me in)

All they seem to do
Is be checking up on you
Baby

(Craig David)

Watching our every move
Think some day they might approve
Baby

Why were you creeping round late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine and she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked)
And I oh, oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression, girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
All you gotta do is just call me, call me

Craig David,"One two buckle my shoe
Three four step inside the venue and I 
See in the corner of my eye
This beautiful girl 
That's standing by the bar looking fly
She was like a beauty queen out of a magazine
Looked about 19
Five minutes talking next thing
It's her number being written

[Chorus:]
If you're looking for the man that can
Go check all the girls messing up with your program
With lyrics that make you say damn
The booty man can
Click off, click on www.CD.com
International bomb
The booty man's really got it going on

One two unbuckle my shoe
Kissing and cuddling 
At my crib after the venue and I
Didn't want to take it too fast so I said slow slow
I gotta make some calls so keep it down low
She was like I can't believe you want to talk instead
Of making love to me
Five minutes chillin', next thing it's my name she's calling

[Chorus]

Bomb bomb the booty man, booty man's really got it goin'
On on the booty man, booty man's really got it going

Into the year 2 0 straight from 9 9

One day minding my own business
Girl from the back won't keep her distance
She was all over me
Just won't let it be
So I said to her I got a girl at home
This is so hard for me, but you got to leave me alone
She said she didn't want to listen to me
Knew what exactly she wanted to be
My baby
I must admit that she was getting to me
Waiting for me
Wanting me to hold her oh so tightly

Together, forever, wherever, whatever
She said she couldn't find nobody better
Wasn't gonna give up on me never

About the thong th-thong thong thong that I wanna see
And when you talk like that you know you're really tempting me

The way you talk and your smile
But you gotta understand lady

Fill me in
Let me know whats up baby
Can you fill me in?
Let me know whats up 
Let me know whats up

Late last night you were chilling with your friends baby
Driving all the God damn guys crazy yeah
You said now would you like
To take me for a ride honey
I said that would be just fine for me, for me yeah
You come around and you were willing to drive
But it wasn't enough I guess you wanted me to come your way
You wanna ride & then tell me you wanna stay
No way ain't messing with the games you play

[Chorus]

So tonight we're gonna hit the club baby
Get up get your groove on party tonight ooh yeah
So don't you worry I'll be all over your body
Like chocolate over a Turkish delight lady
Said you wanted to dance but then you wouldn't dance
But you wanted to play so slow it down Mr. DJ
I guess the reason why you always seem to get your way
Is down to the games you play

[Chorus]

Girl when I'm rubbing you down
And you're making those sounds
Ooh girl you know I like it, like it
You make me feel so aroused
Hold it down in a crowd
Though I like the way you put it on me

Felt just like an ordinary day
Just around the corner,such a surprise a beautiful angel materialised
Time stood still,face to face
I'm sure we'd meet in another time and place

Our eyes met as you passed me by
Two souls entwined in the blink of an eye
And I had to figure out what I'd be missing
So I turned to you and asked if you wanted to

Craig David,"On my way to see my friends who lived a couple blocks away from me (oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me, stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her name, a six digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn, sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged twenty-four
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two

And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday 
We chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine and she was looking fine
Smooth talker, she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped it (back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked)
And I oh, oh, I, yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there (oh yeah)

I'm not a man to play around, baby (oh yeah)
'Cause a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression, girl, hmm you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty time for that
From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When your feeling all alone
All you gotta do is just call me, call me

Who comes home late night after night then tells you lies
So why you tripping out on me girl all the time
When everyday it's only you that's on my mind oh

Every time we take one step forward you take two steps back 
Every time it's right you bring left back oh

You know I've been there for you & that's the truth

Keep it real let me know just what you want
Sometimes you just don't know when to stop
You worry so much over nothing
You risk losing what you've got
Now can't you see there's no other girl
I think you're the most beautiful woman in this world yeah
But you say I don't appreciate ya
And I don't know how to treat ya
We don't do the same things we did no more

Don't forget all the nights we shared

You think I'm being led astray, but that's the way players play
I'm not that kind of man, why can't you understand 'cause I 
Want you to trust in me, baby girl can't you see

I heard some bitching in the background saying
That my girl was too good for me yeah
And I was like what? Why you chatting my name (oh)
Say it again, nothing to hide got nothing to gain
People wan front just because of my fame
You better stop! Before I lose control

Talking all about me in an angry tone
Talking all about how I be doing you wrong
You're crazy, whatever happened to the good girl?
The one that was in to me yeah
I want to tell it to your face girl

That's why she got you pulling strange faces
Drinking hennessy 'til your brain's wasted
She don't want to be the girl that Craig stays with
She just want to be there while Craig stays rich
She wouldn't be with him if he was paid basic and
She wouldn't be there if he wasn't made famous

She had a gold digger degree she must've studied for that
Wanted me to get her a mansion with a truck in the back
Flood her with ice 'til a nigga like honey relax
Messiah bolical ain't even got no money for that
All of a sudden you be tripping on my cellular phone
Talking about all of the women that be taking me home
Talking about all of the women I supposedly boned
She crazy, you know what it is 
You give them an inch & they be taking the p**s
You fed up of it get rid of the witch, don't be taking her s***t
She wasn't saying this when he was licking her lower lip
Making her throw a fit, put you fingers all over it
Tripping all over you whenever you rock the show

Takes your car & it's your money that be filling it up

It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties

I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before me go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same

That's when things changed

Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews
No pictures, and less demands

Given advices that were clearly wrong
The type that seemed to make me feel so right
But some things you may find, can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places

And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away

When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart

Busy trying to slam me 
'cause I smashed it

By taking British music to the masses
Now gold diggers go bananas
The same ones that didn't show me no love
When I was cashless
In the day when it really mattered
When I was penning competition
No publishing hits for damage
Now to go gold to me's a minimal
I'm involved in them platinum plaques
And records sold
Heaven knows that I've battled 
Producers with egos
And there were those who were told
Exactly where to go
Somebody please stop these little kids
That want to pull bumpers off my 206
Shoutin' outside of
The block I used to live
They don't like my records 
So why listen to this?

Craig David,"Ay, mira hombre, por qué me tiras el poble sobre la cara, qué pendejo este, ay

Yo, hit that
Would you like a drink with me?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's all right?)
I want your body close to mine
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
We could spend the night in ecstasy
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
You know that you don't have to leave (tonight)
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you tonight?"" (ah ha, yo)

In fresh form out of town
Just breezed in, so I thought I'd take a look around
And find a party where the vibe is right
I'm talkin' maybe meet a honey, take her home tonight
So, shades on, top's off the whip
Takin' in the sights as I cruise the strip
As I pull up to a red light
I see this pretty little shorty in my headlights

This girl looked half black, yet half oriental
Man, this chick's got class and style
I'd like to ask her for her credentials
Name, address, numbers to dial
She plays tough when deep down she's gentle
It ain't hard to read the signs
This girl bangs like Dre instrumentals
Well, here's an acapella of mine

Girl, would you like a drink with me?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's all right?)
I want your body close to mine

We could spend the night in ecstasy
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
You know that you don't have to leave (tonight)
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you tonight?"" 

Scene two, all up in the club
Got my game tight, about to tear it up 
Could be a night that I won't forget
Boy, I'm lookin' for a honey, and I'm confident
I was dancin', but I had to stop
When I clocked this fly girl wearin' a halter top
She had her hair done, nails right
This señorita had a booty that was so tight

She was a hot girl who looked continental
Damn, her body looked so fine (looked so fine)
The way she spoke I saw her potential
If looks could kill, then she'd do time (she'd do time)
I don't claim to speak perfect Spanish
But I do know a few lines (a few lines)
This female's slicker than your average
And I gotta make her mine 

So, quieres beber conmigo?
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's alright?)
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
Haz el amor conmigo
(Kissin', touchin', caressin')
Ya no me dejes solo tonight
Sayin', ""why didn't I go home with you?""

(Yo) tonight, I'm from a distance admirin'
Girl, you're lookin' so vibrant (oh, oh)
And I dig the way you move your body
Let's get out of this party
Maybe we can get naughty
Say bye, bye, girlfriends
'Cause just in a minute we'll be gone if we're in sync
(Yo, can we dance?)

Would you like a drink and some lovin'?
But leave your husband at home
Unless he want a bump on the dome
Come along, rub alongside me
Put your phone on silence, just breathe
What you're doin' is right, what I'm doin' is wrong
Only time I do right is when I'm doin' a song
So, expect your ex to exit the area
Exterior vex, perplex by the sex
What you drinkin'?
Drink's on me, find me on drink and a drink on me
You can ride next to me, girl, it's ecstasy
Here's somethin' for your ex to see
It's messed up how I slide up your thigh with my right hand
You want to ride all night, then I can 
Don't be shy of just one one-night stand, now, let's go

So would you like a drink with me? (Oh oh)
(If you don't mind, can I talk to you if it's all right?) If you don't mind
I want your body close to mine
(All night, while we're dancin' in the moonlight)
We could spend the night in ecstasy (in ecstasy)

Why d'you want to play these games with me?
Thought you always wanted to be with me

Well at first girl I wanted to
But things have changed between me & you
That's why I don't know what I'm gonna do

Lately, you say I've been acting kind of strangely ?
Like I don't love you no more
You say call me, but I just can't explain it's all so crazy
Between me & you baby oh

And even though at first you meant the world to me
The time has come to spread my wings & be set free
So I can figure out the place where I belong
To find my way home now love has gone
Oh my pager saying...

Why don't call me no more ?
It was every night you were calling me before
Given half a chance you'd be knocking at my door 
So tell me what's changed, why don't you give me some time?
Tell me 'cause I can't get you out of my mind
Right up until now we've been doing just fine
So tell me what's changed

Baby since we met I've treated you like a lady
But now I don't know what to do
I think maybe, it's just that my well for you's run empty
What'm gonna do baby oh

And even though at first you made me so happy
My love for you has changed so put the blame on me
Under pressure it's too hard for me to stay
And I feel so guilty when you page me everyday with oh ...

Why won't you answer my page ?
It was you who said thing were never gonna change
And it seems like lately you're acting kinda strange
So tell me what's changed, why can't you even pass by?
Spare some time even just to say hi 
You're not the type of guy who would make a girl cry
So tell me what's changed

Girl I know it seems like I don't care
After all the things we used to share
Now I know it feels like I've done you wrong
But the pain will heal the sooner that I'm gone

Craig David,"Saw some pictures in the paper
Of a girl I'd met the day before
I couldn't believe that hours later
I had reporters knocking at my door
But I used to dream about the
Life I'm living now and
I didn't think I'd miss those things from the past
And I'm not afraid of leaving or letting go of what I had 'cause
I realize that now there's no turning back

'cause I'm a young heart living in a world filled with love
So when teardrops fall from me like rain from above 
I can brush my troubles away 
know that deep down inside
I've got sunshine in my life

I used to think i could do better
My girlfriends always used to get me wrong
Sent distant messages, love letters
But those kind of feelings never lasted long
'cause now the only love I find's whithin a castle made of sand
And when the tide goes out it's swept away
Though I've got my peace of mind & time is firmly on my side
So through the bad times I can safely say..

Ah... now that love's here to stay
I've found a better day to brush my troubles away

Come on
Can you fill me in (Let's talk about it)

I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in

All they seem to do is be checking up on you baby
Watchin' our every move, think some day they might approve baby

And it seems as though the writings on the wall,
Superstar you finally made it,
But once your picture becomes tainted,
It's what they call,
The rise and fall [Repeat x2]

I always said that I was gonna make it,
Now it's plain for everyone to see,
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners,
Just casualties,
I know that everything is gonna change,
Even the friends I knew before me go,
But this dream is the life I've been searching for,
Started believing that I was the greatest,
My life was never gonna be the same,
Cause with the money came a different status,
That's when things change,
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own,
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see,
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

Now I don't even want to please the fans,
No autographs,
No interviews,
No pictures,
And less demands,
Given advice that was clearly wrong,
The type that seems to make me feel so right,
But some things you may find can take over your life,
Burnt all my bridges now I've run out of places,
And there's nowhere left for me to turn,
Been caught in compromising situations,
I should have learnt,
From all those times I didn't walk away,
When I knew that it was best to go,
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart,

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over,
And it seems as though the writings on the wall,
Superstar you finally made it,
But once your picture becomes tainted,
It's what they call,
The rise and fall

Now I know,
I made mistakes,
Think I don't care,
But you don't realize what this means to me,
So let me have,
Just one more chance,
I'm not the man I used to be,
Used to be

Behind your back & that's a fact & it ain't right
'Cos he's fly guy acting like a gentleman
But back in the day I can still remember when
He'd just turn around, wouldn't look twice at you
And i'm just being straight with you
'Cos he takes you for a fool
So you should be on your guard
When he thinks you don't have a clue
And I think if the truth be know
That ypu'll end up all alone when
He gets everything he wants
So girl open up your eyes & see with me

That he loves you & won't give you up
Takes your car & it's your money that be filling it up
Look at what he's got, thinks he 's hit the jackpot & and it ain't right
'Cos your connections keep him sweet & that's so

He's only in it for himself & that's so cynical
He'd be out of sight girl if you lost it all,

Though I asked you to stay
Most definitely the finest girl
From around my way

Sexy physique, sexy for that
It was just your way
I coulda been your man
You could've been my sweet lady

Now I can't see how this could be for real
Oh, no, how you could go and leave before
I could tell you how I feel? So I sing it

Now I don't know
As I'm cruisin' in my ride
How did I let you go
Without a woman by my side?

Always stoppin' my flow
It's just my flow, give it a try
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

Should I stay? Should I go?
Well, that's just for me to decide
True playa for real
That information's just inside

What's the deal? Let us go
I wanna thank her for my pride
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?

It's just a case of 'I didn't want you to go'
I knew I wouldn't get to see you no more
Some people take it fast, some people take it slow
Just to tell you how they want you, need you


It's time to move on, I don't think you understand me
'Cause when you came to my apartment 543
'Cause it was that I was just too blind to see
You were the only girl for me

I'm sick and tired of this silly game

I don't care babe who's right or wrong
I just don't love you no more.

Feeling like a fool cause I let you down

Craig David,"[Chorus: x 2]
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over (over)
And it seems as though the writing's on the wall (yeah)
Superstar, you finally made it
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties

I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before me go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same

'Cause with the money, came a different status
That's when things changed
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

[Chorus]

I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews
No pictures, and less demands

Given advices that were clearly wrong
The type that seemed to make me feel so right
But some things you may find, can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places

And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away

When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart

[Chorus]

Now I know (now I know)
I made mistakes (made mistakes)
Think I don't care
But you don't realize what this means to me
So let me have just one more chance
I'm not the man I used to be
Used to be

Craig David,"I can sit and try to figure out the reasons why
You were always going out alone
I thought that you were meeting with some other guy
All those times you weren't at home

I was wrong but then I didn't understand
What you were trying to say to me
I thought that you were busy making other plans
None of those including me

But then I always had
Too many insecurities
Why didn't I
Just decide to let it be?

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I remember it so clear when I got the call
It was the hospital on the phone
They told me how you slipped and had a nasty fall
And would I come and take you home

Now that was bad enough but they had more to say
Felt like the words came out so slow
""I'm afraid she lost the baby but she'll be okay""
And I didn't even know

But now I see
I should've been there
From the start
Instead of letting it all fall apart

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I didn't know
What was wrong.
Girl, I didn't know

I hope you know I never meant to hurt you, girl
But I was way too blind to see
That you were only trying to protect me, girl
I wish you'd had more faith in me

Now I realize that I've let you down
And you have reasons to act that way
I thought that you were cheating when you weren't around
That's why I had to walk away

But girl looking back
In spite of all that we've been through
I'm asking is there still a chance
For me and you?

I never should have walked away
I should've been there for you babe
I know I handled this all wrong
I swear, I didn't know

Things are never gonna be the same
And I don't want no one to blame
I've gone and left you torn, baby
Well, I didn't know

I never should have walked away

I know we both need to release
But if Ludacris and people start disturbing the peace
Hands and blinds nosey neighbors peeping through the crease
Next thing you no they be calling the police and that ever we need
So I suggest we just chill come pack our bags and take a flight to Brazil
I think that will be ideal and you no we can do what ever feel
Cause I don't want to loose you for real, so girl!

When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do

Seen, it's like I'm living a dream
Nineteen ninety nine when I first came on the scene
Skinny young breh from out Southampton
With a bunch of melodies for days, know what I mean
Lean and mean, embodied the whole scene
Packin' on muscle like bars of protein
Crushin' every microphone that I be holding
'Cause you know I be training dirty but sometime keeping it clean

Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4x4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules

Seen, so let me run up on this beat
No nonsense whenever you 'round me
It don't make sense, but time I ain't wastin'
If I come to mess about, we on the mess alone ting

Craig Davis,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,2006

And how thrilling that moment will be
When the prince of my dreams comes to me
He'll whisper, I love you,
And steal a kiss or two
Though he's far away,
I'll find my love some day
Some day when my dreams come true
Some day I'll find my love
Someone to call my own

I'm always walkin' after midnight, searchin' for you

Cryin' on his pillow

And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me

In another downtown place
Simply put her face renewed my
Faith in dreams

All me best fantasies

Right there inside her eyes I found some
Peace of mind

Reminded me of someone else who looked like you
But that was long ago
And even before I knew your name
You made that feeling come to me

We falafelized on the lower east side
Me and my friend discussed the end
How it might come at any time

To find the kindest of faces
It was such a surprise
A pleasant present memory

Reminded me of someone else who looked like you

And even before I knew your name
You made that feeling come to me

The missing message on the brick wall
Reminded me of all the holes I had to fill
So I wrote a note to say
Come and see our show

Card in hand, behind the scenes

And the kind of love I chose, the implements I use
The pairs of high heeled shoes in the basement

It's a perfect down that wakes me up
A shaky hand, a coffee cup
Comin' out of a closet room
Where there ain't no mop and there ain't no broom

And the aching in my knees, the fears that makes me freeze
I feel like such a sleaze and a loser

It's not my fault I'm in this mess
I can lift my weight on the steel bench press
In a way we're all the same
In another numbered room with another nameless pain

Magic beads, beginners loves, scraped-up knees

Shining eyes, auburn hair and a backward glance
A snapshot in a penguin suit at a senior dance
Hearts getting hardened to the breakup of first romance

Nothing's ended gentleman
All the trappings, means and ends
Hudson Bay, the appointed date of a lover's valentine

Rays of light, rippled glass, a room to cross
Specks of dust drifting now and landing lost

And love
And love me for eternity

Your mighty words astound me
But I've no need for mighty deeds
When I feel your arms around me

But I would bring you rings of gold
I'd even sing you poetry (oh, would you?)
And I would keep you from all harm
If you would stay beside me

I have no use for rings of gold
I care not for your poetry
I only want your hand to hold

I only want you near me

To love and kiss to sweetly hold

Through all life's sorrows
And delights

He said he's here to share the good news
He had a smile straight from the movies

There were holes and they showed his toes
The right was left. The black was brown
And later on in the garage I couldn't find my chainsaw
In the distance I heard trees just falling down

I was underneath the city I was riding around on trains
Fell asleep before Nassau Ave.

We pulled the floorboards out

Craig Finn,"There was a party at that high-rise up on Harmon
It was dead except a couple people dancing
While our eyes were still adjusting to the dark her appetite was expanding
The dude with the long fingernails I don't think that I trust him all that much
It cost ten dollars just to get inside the building
It costs more to get in touch

I went to the SA to get some cigs
I asked the doorman to remember me
I looked up to see the moon and I saw you and him out on the balcony
It was the same thing that you did to me

Don't want to be your old man
I want to be your new man another time all over
I miss the way your eyes they used to spark when you'd look over your shoulder
The dude with the long fingernails I think he's gonna take such good care of you
I've seen him shave up at the library
I've seen him sleep behind the Caribou

I took the bus back uptown because I knew that it was over
I didn't need to know the rest of it
I know the look. I know the lines
I know the laugh from back when we first started it
Such a drunk romantic genesis
Now we've really made a mess of this

I'll put your stuff out on the driveway
You can get it when you walk back through the white light
I'll leave a sandwich in your suitcase in case you're hungry when you come back from the high-rise
I hope your dude don't break his nails when he tries to help you carry all your stuff
It costs ten dollars for a taxi. It costs a whole lot more to fall in love

Craig Finn,"Jackson was an actor 
At least he was when he was well
Stephanie was good to me but not so much to herself
We were holed up in a hotel room from August to November
It was Jackson, me, and Stephanie
The rest I don't remember

Stephanie appeared to me in the back half of the theater
We met up with Jackson on the strand a few days later
We pooled our funds and made a run
We were foolproof when it counted
It was Jackson, me, and Stephanie
And it didn't seem all that crowded

Now why you asking about Jackson?
It was a long time ago and nothing really happened
Why you asking about Jackson?

Jackson just got restless
Couldn't take the lack of action
He was sort of like a shark
He just had to keep on swimming
And the sailors kept on coming off the boats down at the harbor
It was difficult to stop
It was easy to get started

Stephanie came on strong but suddenly went weak
She seemed a little speedy and her tongue worked at her teeth
The sirens came behind us

It was a bit be fore we heard it
It was Jackson, me and Stephanie
And for a while it felt just perfect

Now why you asking about Jackson?
It was a long time ago and nothing really happened
Someone said he ended up in Denver
Someone said he went to Kansas City
Someone said he went off the deep end
Some said he was living there already
One day Jackson just didn't show up to the party
One day Jackson just didn't show up to the party

Stephanie was long on looks and short on mental health
She said depression is an ocean and it's prone to tides and swells
Anxiety's persistent
It's an ambitious politician
It keeps knocking on your door
Until you come and let it in
I think that Jackson let it in
I think Jackson let it in",Jackson,2012
Craig Finn,"Everybody's saying that the lights don't shine
But the lights shine down on me
I've got a new friend and my new friend's name is Jesus

I met him in the parking lot
He took me in his car
I've got a new friend and my new friend's name is Jesus

We rode around all afternoon
He sold me his guitar
I've got a new friend and my new friend's name is Jesus

Now people give me sideways looks
When we set up on the strand
But it's hard

I wish I was with Jesus when I met you
I wish I was with Jesus when I met you
I wish I was with Jesus when I met you
You'd be so impressed with me
You'd give yourself right up to me

Everybody's saying that it's way too warm
But me, I feel a chill
I've got a new friend and my new friend's name is Jesus

We drove around all summer long
We parked behind the bars
I've got a new friend and my new friend's name is Jesus

People say we suck at sports
But they don't understand
It's hard to catch with holes right through your hands

I wish I was with Jesus when you loved me
I wish I was with Jesus when you loved me
I wish I was with Jesus when you loved me
I would have been a better me
That much I can guarantee

Now I'm on your doorstep and you're asking me to leave
You say you don't believe I could ever change so quickly
You say you'll call the cops but even if you do
I'll just love them all the way that Jesus loves me

Craig Finn,"By the way that you picked up the phone
I could tell that you weren't gonna die
February is about as long as it is wide

I guess I've been pretty good with it
Trying hard not to get too obsessed with it
I guess I shouldn't have been surprised

I guess I was pretty much prepared for it
I was just stuck in my own sense of time
Rigid and depressed, needy, halfway pissed and resigned

The parking lots and the office talk
They punch my card at the coffee shop
I'm pretty sure we're all gonna die
I'm pretty sure we're all gonna die

I suppose you thought that I'd be shaken up
I suppose you thought I'd be gushing blood
Not true
I only died on the inside

I suppose you thought that I'd be taken out
Back behind one of those bars downtown
Not true
I'm still alive on the outside

Good old Freddie Mercury is the only guy that advises me
This time, he said if you can't beat them join them

I've been reading about Calvary
The crucifixion still gets to me
I guess Golgotha means the mount of execution

The best advice that I've gotten was from good old Johnny Rotten
He said God Save The Queen
He said no future for you
No future for me

I suppose you thought that I'd be eaten up
By the bars or the pigs or the sheep or the studs
I'm alive
Except for the inside

I suppose you thought that I'd be the first one to go
By the bars or the pigs or the sheep or the shows
I'm alive
Except for the inside

But I don't know nothing
Except for the one thing for certain
The devil is a person
I met him at the Riverside Perkins

Bedsheets for curtains
One thing's for certain
The devil is a person
I met him at the Riverside Perkins

Craig Finn,"He said I'd like to go back
But we can't go back
Man, I'd take off tomorrow if I had any cash
The cigarettes got the best of us
There's not much left of us

And there's still a little bit
And we can split it up
I can walk by the park and see if anything is up
Sometimes lonely is easy. Sometimes together is too tough
There's not much left of us

The part that remains is rotten and bruised
The soft spot on a piece of fruit
We can cut off the black and eat at the rest
And that's probably what we're gonna do

And from what I understand
He's just some boy with a band
But when I walked by the park you were holding his hand
You dropped it like it was hot to the touch
There's not much left of us

And so you went with him. Down to Birmingham
Stayed in some fancy hotel on a credit card scam
Left in a limo. Came back on the bus
With not much left of us

The part that remains is rotten and bruised
The soft spot on the passion fruit 
We can cut off the black and feast on the rest
There are nights I'm still in love with you

And the dreams they come. And they won't go away
I keep seeing the things that we don't want to say
Up on the sun and down to the bone
There's not much left of us

Because you went with him",Not Much Left of Us,2012
Craig Finn,"Just kind of living in a rented room
I've been trying to stop obsessing you
There really isn't all that much to do
When you're living in a rented room

Playing records in a rented room
Hotter than Hell into Bark at the Moon
Certain things they get really hard to do
When you're living in a rented room

I've been thinking about the things we did
The things that we talked about and the lives that we lived
When things got bad we would just drink and sit
When things were still good we would dance

Started coming here two years ago
They play the right kind of rock and roll
The drinks are cheap and they leave you alone
I go downstairs and have a drink or two

She used to take off her tights
Turn out the lights
Get into bed
She fit me just right
My pillow still tastes like her perfume
She used to wake up at dawn
Put on her robe
Walk out on our lawn all sleepy and slow
Now I live above a saloon

I bathe in the dark
It feels like the womb
I know I should be getting over you
Certain things are really hard to do

I bathe in the dark
It feels like the womb
I know I should be getting over you

Craig Finn,"Sean says he can't sit here and tell her that it's really that simple
Because it's not that simple, it's exhausting and confusing and it's scary and complex
He hates how Shannon talks about herself like she's a whole separate person
And he's still pissed at her doctors but he's mostly just sick of not connecting

What the hell are we going to do when they finally let you come home from the hospital?
Sit around the house and make fake plans and then walk down to the Wagon Wheel?
The bills are gonna come and we'll just shrug our shoulders at the notion
The numbers so far into the beyond they look a little bit surreal

Satisfaction is a funny thing
Funny enough that when she brings it up he laughs a little bit
Before he breaks down.
It was obvious to anyone
The way she took her medication at the bar
The way she crossed herself
When it's the bartender's round

He's not gonna tell her its a matter of just kind of trying harder
He's not going to tell her if you love someone then you should set them free
He wishes that she wasn't always saying that she's sorry and looking up with terrified eyes
He said I wish that you could try to love yourself the same way that you love me

Frustration is a funny friend
Funny enough that he keeps coming up
And making me do things that I don't like
When you come home from the hospital
We can't go back to the Wagon Wheel
And if we do we can't go every night

In the middle of the day, she mostly feels okay
But when nighttime comes, she just feels terrified",Terrified Eyes,2012
Craig Finn,"Someone saw something just east of here
I came up the Western pier
There's one thing you should know about
Christ is watching me right now

Someone saw something and they shot it down
I spent seven months in another town
At night I'd walk down on the beach
One night I saw them watching me

They rolled up. They put the cuffs on
Then they drove me deep into the valley
The just judge looked me over and said I'm sorry
You don't have to keep running
But you best be leaving

You can't take away all the parts of you
that make you do the things you do
The girls that live inside my heart
Keep coming up the boulevard

They roll up. They pledge their love
And then they drive you halfway to a breakdown

Love's been such a letdown
Let's proceed with the shakedown

Forgives us for our avarice and lust

The kisses in the shadow and the stockings
But as the pieces come together there's these things that I keep hearing

I consider my options
Decided to do what he said
He went through my jacket and found all my packets and matches
He lit up a cig and put the Kryptonite over my head

I was knocked out down in the mud too heavy to float off to Memphis

Made coffee over a campfire
