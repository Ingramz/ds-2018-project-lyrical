Lee Konitz,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,1959
Lee Konitz,"Never thought I'd fall,
But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Won't you please be kind,
And just make up your mind
That you'll be sweet & gentle,
Be gentle with me
Because I'm sentimental over you
",I'm Getting Sentimental over You,1960
Lee Konitz,"Each time I look at you is like the first time
Each time you're near me the thrill is new
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for
The rare delight of the sight of you for

The more I see you, the more I want you
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows
With every sigh I become more mad about you
More lost without you and so it goes

Can you imagine how much I love you?
The more I see you as years go by
I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

I know the only one for me can only be you
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try",The More I See You,1960
Lee Konitz,"You are too beautiful, my dear, to be true
And I am a fool for beauty
Fooled by a feeling that because I have found you
I could have bound you too

You are too beautiful for one man alone
For one lucky fool to be with
When there are other men
With eyes of their own to see with

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty

Love does not stand sharing
Not if one cares
Have you been comparing
My every kiss with theirs

If, on the other hand, I'm faithful to you
It's not through a sense of duty
You are too beautiful
And I am a fool for beauty",You Are Too Beautiful,1960
Lee Konitz,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1960
Lee Konitz,"I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I've come
To complicate the dead
Are you with me?
I've written out all my vows again

We're almost home
To see the silence break on New Year's Eve
We're only 17
So if love exists I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Just one more kiss
To soothe the pain exists
In a world of lies
Misery take my shame and life

And everything fails a violent death
The smile you gave
Visit me in hell tonight
And say, ""If love exists, I will fall?

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I'll wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

So I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love
So I'm, I'm not in love

I feel so alive
I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling

So alive, I feel so alive tonight
I feel so alive
I feel so alive, can't stop this feeling
If love exists, I will fall

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
And almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

I will wait for this moment
When our lips collide
Almost stop the earth
You're in my arms tonight

Lee Konitz,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1974
Lee Konitz,"Whenever skies look gray to me
And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1974
Lee Konitz,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1974
Lee Konitz,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

That beautiful rhapsody
Of love and youth and spring,
The music is sweet,
The words are true 
The song is you.",The Song Is You,1974
Lee Konitz,"The song a robin sings
Through years of endless springs
The murmur of a brook at eventide
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide
A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me

A great symphonic theme
That's Stella by starlight
And not a dream
My heart and I agree
She's everything on earth to me",Stella by Starlight,1975
Lee Konitz,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1978
Lee Konitz,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1979
Lee Konitz,"It begins to tell
'Round midnight, midnight
I do pretty well, till after sundown
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad
But it really gets bad
'Round midnight

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories
When my heart is still with you
And ol' midnight knows it, too
When a quarrel we had needs mending
Does it mean that our love is ending
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart
And I'm out of my mind

Let our hearts take wings'
'Round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing
For your returning
Till our love is safe and sound
And old midnight comes around
Feelin' sad
Really gets bad
Round, Round, Round Midnight",'Round About Midnight,1982
Lee Konitz,"I try to keep  you out of my heart
But somehow I find
Trying to keep you out of my heart
I'm out of my mind
I tell myself ""I'm through with you
And I'll having nothing more to do with you""
I stay away, but every day
I'm just foolin myself

Tell my friends that I don't care
I shrug my shoulders at the whole affair
But all know it isn't so
I'm just foolin myself

And every time I pass
And see my face in a looking glass
I tip my hat and say
""How do you do, you fool
You're trowing your life away""
I'm acting gay
I'm acting proud
And every time I see you in a crowd
I may pretend
But in the end
I'm just fooling myself",Foolin' Myself,1984
Lee Konitz,"I could show the world how to smile
I could be glad all of the while
I could change the grey skies to blues 
If I had you
I could leave the old days behind
Leave all my pals, I'd never mind
I could start my life all a new 
If I had you
I could climb the snow capped mountains

Lee Konitz,"I'm a very ordinary man
Trying to work out life's happy plan
Doing unto others as I'd like to have them doing unto me

When I find a very lonely soul
Soon be-kinda-comes my only goal
I feel so much better when I tell them my philosophy

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Life's really worth living
When we are mirth giving
Why can't I give some to you

When skies are gray and you say you are blue
I'll send the sun smiling through

I want to be happy
But I won't be happy
Till I make you happy too.

Lee Konitz,"Just picture a penthouse way up in the sky
With hinges on chimneys for stars to go by
A sweet slice of Heaven for just you and I
When we're alone.

From all of society we'll stay aloof
And live in propriety there on the roof.
Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,
When we're alone.

Lee Konitz,"Why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to nine
Bring all of your fam'ly and I will bring mine
If I should bring my brothers, and you bring the others
Then I can sing a song like Jeru, just for you

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you
just for me too

Gather around, tale to be told
Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

So why don't you come over 'bout a quarter to two
Forget all the others, just me and just you
And while we're versifying
We'd better start trying
To write another song just for me
Just for you, one more Jeru",Jeru,1988
Lee Konitz,"Ever since the lucky night I found you
I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Lee Konitz,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon

Lee Konitz,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing

How my thoughts go flashing back again to my old flame

For I haven't met a gent so magnificent or elegant as my old flame

I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eyes, some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love were only imitations of my old flame
I can't even think of his name but I'll never be the same 
Until I discover what became of my old flame

When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

Gone are the silver and gold

You know I'm yours for just the taking

I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair

I send an ""Airmail Special"" too

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

Beware my foolish heart

Then let the fire start

When you came in sight I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye my heart stood still
Once again I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now:
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Some somebody twice as smart as I

A somebody who will swear to be true
As you used to do with me
Who'll leave you to learn
That misery loves company, wait and see

I mean, I wanna be around to see how he does it
When he breaks your heart to bits
Let's see if the puzzle fits so fine

And that's when I'll discover that revenge is sweet
As I sit there applaudin' from a front-row seat
When somebody breaks your heart
Like you, like you broke mine",I Wanna Be Around,2000
Lee Lessack,"The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile can't 
disguise

The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away

[Chorus]
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you

You've got the look of love
It's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Baby be mine, tonight

Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]

Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
The look of love

Let this be just the start of
So many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow
And baby we'll seal it with a kiss

[Chorus]",The Look of Love,2005
Lee Lessack,"Some say, ""Love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""

Some say, ""Love, it is a a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love, it is a flower
And you it's only seed""

It's the heart that fears breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one, who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Life's the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose

",The Rose,2005
Lee Lessack,"How lucky can one guy be;
I kissed her and she kissed me
Like the fella once said, 
Ain't that a kick in the head?
The room was completely black
I hugged her and she hugged back.
Like the sailor said, quote, 
""Ain't that a hole in the boat?""
My head keeps spinning;
I go to sleep and keep grinning;
If this is just the beginning, 
My life's gonna be beautiful.
I've sun- shine enough to spread;
It's like the fella said,
""Tell me quick
Ain't love like a kick in the head?""

Like the fella once said, 
Ain't that a kick in the head?

Like the sailor said, quote,
""Ain't that a hole in the boat?""
My head keeps spinning;
I go to sleep and keep grinning;
If this is just the beginning,
My life's gonna be beautiful.
She's telling me we'll be wed;
She's picked out a king size bed.
I couldn't feel any better or I'd be sick;
Tell me quick, oh ain't love a kick?
Tell me quick, ain't love a kick in the head?
You're nobody til somebody loves you
You're nobody til somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess the world and it's gold
But gold won't bring you happiness when you're growing old
The world still is the same, you never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

The world still is the same, you never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
Well, you're nobody til somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love

Standing on the corner feeling blue

He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering

I've never been with anything less than a nine, so fine.
I've been on fire with Sally Field, gone fast with a girl named Bo.
But somehow they just don't end up as mine
It's a death-defying life I lead, I'll take my chances.
I've died for a living in the movies and tv.
But the hardest thing I'll ever do is watch my leading ladies,
Kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.

I might fall from a tall building, I might roll a brand-new car,
'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman that made Redford such a star.

I've never spent much time in school, but I taught ladies plenty.
It's true I hire my body out for pay, hey hey!
I've gotten burned over Cheryl Tiegs, blown up over Rachel Welch
But when I wind up in the hay, it's only hay, hey hey!
I might jump an open drawbridge, or Tarzan from a vine,
'Cause I'm the unknown stuntman, that makes Eastwood look so fine.

They'll never make me president, but I got the best first ladies
Somedayґs I gotґem as far as the eye can see - ouee
A morning dove with Jacky Smith, a crash in the night with Cheryl
But in the end they never stay with me
On my fall from the Tower Building, so Burt Reynolds don't get hurt
I might leap the mighty Canyon, so he can kiss and flirt
Well, that smooth talker's kissing my girl, I'm just kissing dirt

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes.
Oh, let it rain.

Lee Master,"[Chorus] 
Oh no, there go them Texas boys banging in a fo' do' 
Top fell out the drop, crawling on 84's 
Think of taking my slab, baby I don't think so 
My heat under my seat, and I don't love you hoes 
Living it like a G, but still I gotta lay low 
Five percent or ten, but still my screens goin' glow 
These haters be in my mix, and these boppers be on my dick 
Every time I come round the corner 

I'm from the land of opportunity, in God we trust 
But haters in my mix, got me paranoid and disgust 
I'm scoping out my side mirrors, when my car's in park 
It's after dark, and my slab is fresh meat to these sharks 
Boys thinking I been drinking, so I'm off my note 
But I got seventeen surprises, tucked inside of my coat 
See me strut through the parking lot, on 22's plus 
It's a must I make all haters, eat my dust 
Them jump-out boys, waiting trying to catch me slipping 
I ain't tripping, grain ain't the only thing that I'm gripping 
Boys jacking with these tow trucks, thinking they slick 
But take a trip to South Lee, and end up in a ditch 
They got my purple people eater once, the next day 
I bought a Range Rover cash, and a new set of fronts 
I've been on feet for months, I'm taking haters to lunch 
Paul Wall and Trae, hit em with that one-two punch 

[Chorus] 

When I flip in my slab 
I'm fin to beat they back off, like I was legs 
Sitting low and tinted on chrome, gangstafied till I'm finished 
I'm bout to diminish these haters, when my trunk start waving 
Blue over gray, side of my drop with six T.V.'s I'm displaying 
They hate that I'm shining, with the fifth wheel falling flying down the block 
But if one of these haters, wanna jack me 
Slugs goin' be flying, out the glock 
I click for no reason, this season my slab is staining they brain 
And I be known for getting reckless in Texas, gripping on grain 
Forever be pimping, 84 tipping all through the South 
Grilling boppers all through my tint, with diamonds all in my mouth 
They all in my mouth, looking stupid when I burn right past em 
Cause some of these broads be living shife, and setting up for the jacking 
But not today, cause Trae goin' be flipping on top of his game 
We guerillas I'm mobbing with, ain't no stopping me man 
When I'm in my fo' do' solo, the slab is bound to get tossed 
And if you trying to be competition, then you bound to be getting lost 

[Chorus] 
 
Make way for the team, when the fo' do' be coming round the corner 
These haters are goners, cause I'ma drop the top when I wanna 
I know these jackers, better think before they reach out and touch 
Cause in back of the car is the Excursion, full of thugs that'll punch 
I know they wanted to get me, but they don't know what I'm bringing 
I pop the trunk and swing the block, while jamming Slow Loud And Bangin' 
Trae and Paul Wall on a mission, and ain't no stopping it man 
With my hand on my heat in my seat, and the other on grain 

Mo' money mo' problems man, the legend is true 
You better stay up on your toes, when you ride 22's 
I'm rolling strapped, everywhere I go I'm watching my back 
Cause on my block, them jackers don't give a damn if I rap 
People see me being friendly, and they think that I'm soft 
But the truth is, my best friend is a sawed off 
These haters in my mix, got me losing composure 
But if they take one step closer, it ain't gon be kosher naw

You know the way it?s going to end

I do it every time and I regret it
I don?t know why I tried

I?ve heard them all, a thousand times
You don?t know it?s breaking my heart
Its tearing me apart
Let me down one too many times
This is where I draw the line
The moment I?ve decided 
This is how it?s got to be
And here?s your reason why

I do it every time and I regret it

And let you back into my life
I guess you always were, you?ll always be, the devil in disguise

You?ll only break my heart again

Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

With somebody, somewhere else

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying

Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

And he heard their mournful cry.

Lee Ranaldo,"I just saw a rainbow fall into the floor
Shattered into pieces, your eyes asked what for
These days I’m all alone out in the middle of the world
These days I’m trying to tell myself you’re just another girl

I can see the red door slamming on the stage
Chaos in the streets, these are the days of rage
These days are so uncertain satellites falling to the sea
These days its all a question of what matters to you and me

Watch me as I fall
Then scrape me off the wall
And take me home
See me as I am
Just half a man
Trying to get home

Explosions in the city, explosions deep in me
Someone in the crowd has me falling at her feet
These days are so uncommon flashing lights and siren’s calls
These days I’m trying hard to keep from falling off the wall

Its written in the sand
The life and death of man
As old as stone
Take me as I am
Take my hand
And take me home",Off the Wall,2012
Lee Remick,"Smug little men with a smug little schemes
They forgot one thing
The play isn't over by a long shot yet

There are heroes in the world
Prince's and heroes in the world
And one of them will save us
We can see, we can see

There won't be trumpets or bolts of fire
To say he's coming
No Roman candles, no angels choir
No sound of distant drumming

He may not be the Cavalcade
Tall and graceful, fair and strong
Doesn't matters just as long as
He comes on home

But not with trumpets or lightning flashing
Or shining armor
It maybe daring, he maybe dashing
Or maybe he's a farmer

We can wait, watch another day
He has lots of hills to climb
And the hero doesn't come
Till the nick of time

The vote for trumpets or whistles tooting
That guarantee him
There won't be trumpets, but sure as shooting
You'll know him when you see him

Don't know when, don't know where
And I can't even say but I care
All I know is some Meridian turn
Is having some flair

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.

He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm
In a moment or two, we can hear the stars coming through
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you

After the rain, the birds want to fly
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry
Like puddles and pools, what your eyes let me see
Are their loving reflections of me
After a while, you touch me and then
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again

I could stay for hours like this

Teachin' everyone the way to have fun
Singin' born to be wild at the top of their lungs

Someday, we'll leave this life

Was it a dream I had?
When did it turn bad

Runs from Texarkana to El Paso
And Oklahoma down to old Mexico
And there's Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antone
People in Texas sure do make you feel at home

They just want everybody to leave them alone
While they drink their whiskey and roll their own
And they like their music with a little bit of southern sound
They kick up their heels every evening when the sun goes down

And you can call them country and they don't care
And if you don't like the way they wear their hair
You can take your like and shove 'em on up the line

Don't you know if that's life the game of life 
That we abuse when we choose to fight 

If we can find a way to work things out 
The only way to start is to start now

When are we gonna stand up as people 
Realize as people we're all equal 
We don't want no world war sequel 
For the love of the god think of the people 
When are we gonna stand up as people 
Realize as people we're all equal 
We don't want no world war sequel 
For the love of the god think of the people 

I pray before I sleep at night
That ill wake to find a clear blue sky

When are we gonna stand up as people 
Realize as people we're all equal 
We don't want no world war sequel 
For the love of the god think of the people

Lee Ryan,"Why me Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you
Or the kindness you've shown.

Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
On my way back to you.

And I'll be anyone that you want

If you let me know
Where you run to
Where you go
All around the world
I will follow

Coz I'm looking for the real thing

I didn't wanna see the film tonight
I found it hard to say
She thought I'd had enough of her
Why can't she see?
She's lovely to me
But I like to stay in
And watch TV on my own
Every now and then

My girl's mad at me
Been on the telephone for an hour
We hardly said a word
I tried and tried but I could not be heard
Why can't I explain?
Why do I feel this painI
'Cause everything I say
She doesn't understand
She doesn't realise
She takes it all the wrong way

We argued just the other night
I thought we'd got it straight
We talked and talked until it was light
I thought we'd agreed
I thought we'd talked it out

She says that I don't care
She says I'm unaware
And now she says I'm weak",My Girl,2009

On the banks of the river Nile

To this desolate shore
Last boat along the river Nile
Doesn't seem to care
No more wind in his hair
As he reaches his last half mile
The oar snaps in his hand
Before he reaches dry land
But the sound doesn't deafen his smile
Just pokes at wet sand

Right here in town

We'll have Manhattan
The Bronx and Staten Island, too
It's lovely going through
The zoo

It's very fancy
On old Delancey Street, you know
The subway charms us so
When balmy breezes blow
To and fro

And tell me what street
Compares with Mott Street
In July
Sweet pushcarts gently gliding by

The great big city's a wondrous toy
Just made for a girl and boy
We'll turn Manhattan
Into an isle of joy

We'll go to Greenwich
Where modern men itch
To be free
And Bowling Green you'll see
With me

We'll bathe at Brighton
The fish you'll frighten
When you're in
Your bathing suit so thin
Will make the shellfish grin

Sail on Jamaica Bay with you
And fair Canarsie's lake

And eat baloney
On a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

Our future babies
We'll take to ""Abie's Irish Rose""
I hope they'll live to see
It close

Who's bound to make you feel that way
The moon is shining, and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer and say you'll be mine
Remember, darling, we won't see it shine

",A Hundred Years from Today,1958
Lee Wiley,"All our friends keep knocking at the door
They've asked me out a hundred times or more
But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom""
And here I stay within my lonely room
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby
Walk without my arm about you, Baby
I thought the day you left me behind
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind
But now I find that
I don't want to walk without the sunshine
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me
'Cause I don't want to walk without you

Lee Wiley,"The game of ""just supposing"" is the sweetest game I know,
Our dreams are more romantic than the world we see.
And if the things we dream about don't happen to be so,
That's just an unimportant technicality

We could make believe I love you,
Only make believe that you love me.
Others find peace of mind in pretending,
Couldn't you? Couldn't I? Couldn't we
Make believe our lips are blending
In a phantom kiss, or two, or three?
Might as well make believe I love you,
For to tell the truth, I do.

Your pardon I pray, 'twas too much to say,
The words that betray my heart.
We only pretend, you do not offend,
In playing a lover's part.

Though the cold and brutal fact is you and I have never met,
We need not mind convention's P's and Q's,
If we put our thoughts in practice we can banish all regret
Imagining most anything we choose

We could make believe I love you,
Only make believe that you love me.
Others find peace of mind in pretending,
Couldn't you? Couldn't I? Couldn't we

Built on a primitive plan.

But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.
I could be the personal slave
Of someone just out of a cave.

Has gotta wake up the gypsy in me,

Find me a primitive man.

Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,

Must reawake my gypsy blood.

Still we're often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind

Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet
He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see
I hope that he, turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key

Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

'Neath the Swanee moon to a Swanee tune they love;
Then the lady tells her gentleman down south,
""Sure it's mighty fine just to know you're mine my love!"".

Then they walk along where magnolias grow,
Two hearts sing a song that was written long ago.
When a lady meets a gentleman,
A very polished gentleman,
When a lady meets a gentleman down south.

There you learn how to smile when you live in the south.

But in that land of sunshine, it's done in a different way!

But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.

Devrait reveiler mon sang tzigane,
Trouve moi un homme primitif, vif,

Find me a forthright young lad,
Someone with vigor to spare,

Must reawake my gypsy blood.

Lee Williams,"I was walking downtown one day,
And I saw a man that appeared to be just an old wino;
Sitting on the streets, telling the people 
About Jesus as they passed by.
And because he was all raggedy and dirty,
People would just laugh and make fun
Of the old man and walk on by.
And he said because of the way I am,
No money, no fancy clothes, no fine homes and cars,
A lot of people consider me as nothing,
And say I don't know what I am talking about.
But there is one thing that he said 
That really touched my heart and stayed on my mind,
When that old man looked up and said...

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

And he said, I've had so many problems in my life,
That I just couldn't deal with so I started drinking, 
Thought it would help ease my pain.
But things got worse, so I said, 
'Lord I give up I'm in your hands', 
And that's when my life began to change,
But these people think

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

And he said, On the streets day and night,
That's my life, that's my home,
Ain't got nowhere else I could go.
So I just walk the streets,
Telling the people about Jesus
From corner to corner, from door to door;
But they all make fun of me and say...

I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody,
About somebody, who can save anybody.

I guess you find the answer on your mind
To speak no word and to be not heard
It's maybe the price you pay to modern life

This world reminds me of a land of fairy-tales
Sinners are kings in a land full of darkness
Where innocence is just a word away

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside
That's where is shadowland
Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear
That's where is shadowland

You search for an answer in the bunch full of lies
And sometimes you see a fool in disguise
What is it good for? What does it mean to life?
A stupid shareware of dreams, a colorful nightmare till your dying day

This world reminds me of a land of fairy-tales

Where innocence is just a word away

Where you are trying to hide all your feelings inside
That's where is shadowland
Where you are hiding your tears and you're sleeping in fear

And they praying heads to their foolish pride

I've never wanted someone more
You are the one I've waited for

Light of my life
You are the fire in my heart
When I am lost
I know I'll feel you burning in the dark
You're the light of my life
Every star in the sky
Shines more brightly when you're at my side
You're the light of my life

Dreaming, I feel you next to me
No, I'm not, I'm not dreaming
Cause I'm drowning in your kiss
I die in your arms
And when I hear you call my name
Baby, it's like I'm born again

[Chorus]
Your love's a lantern in the rain
Bringing me home time and again
Burning like an eternal flame

Light of my life
You're the beat of my heart
When I am lost
When you're lost I know
You'll see me shining
Shining in the dark
You're the light of my life
Like the stars in the sky
Only you can take me through
You're the only one who makes it right
Only you set fire to the night
You're the light of my life",Light of My Life,2003
Lee-Hom Wang,"If I ruled the world
Every day would be the first day of spring
Every heart would have a new song to sing
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring

If I ruled the world
Every man would be as free as a bird
Every voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word we would treasure each day that occurred

My world would be a beautiful place
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams
My world would wear a smile on its face
Like the man in the moon has when the moon beams

If I ruled the world
Every man would say the world was his friend
There'd be happiness that no man could end
No my friend, not if I ruled the world
Every head would be held up high
There'd be sunshine in everyone's sky
If the day ever dawned when I ruled the world",If I Ruled the World,2006

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Leeland,"He traded his crown for a crown of thorns
He picked up His cross and laid down His sword
He stumbled down the road bruised and beaten for me
Jesus walked the way of grief
Hallelujah!

[Chorus]
On the via dolorosa!
All my sin was carried away!
And the power of Him was broken
As He gave His life away

He knew it was to come from the very start
But his love for the world beat inside His heart
He climbed the road of suffering to the hill of Calvary 
Where the saints would be redeemed.
Hallelujah!

Jesus fixed His eyes upon the new horizon
Soon he would arise and the world would be forgiven!

Liian usein huomaat ei se totta ollutkaan
Ja joku tuskin tietää mitä etsii vailla määrän päätä harhailee
Monen vuoden jälkeen ystävälleen kirjoittaa
Ne sanat jotka sanomatta jäivät sanat joita ei kai ollutkaan
Sanat jotka pettävät kun niitä tarvitaan
Ja minä olen miettinyt jo kauan jotain josta sulle kertoisin

Typerä piski joka murisi mulle
Hölmöksi tunsin minä itsenikin
Vaikka kaikesta halusin puhua sulle

Olen hävittänyt kaiken joka sinusta mua muistuttaa
Olen myynyt levyt joita silloin kuuntelin
Ne levyt usein radiossa soivat tai ne voivat olla muitakin
Lähes kaiken sinusta jo melkein unohdin

J'ai toujours la cicatrice et j'me rends compte qu'encore une fois, j'ai bloqué tout la night
J'ai du mal à pardonner, pourtant, j'essaie
Quand tu m'as dit qu'il fallait qu'tu t'en ailles
Tu m'as tiré dessus, jusqu'à présent, je saigne

J'suis jalousé par les hommes et convoité par les femmes
Traumatisé par les flammes, j'raconte ma vie, pas des fables
Émoustillés par les sommes, les carottes font bouger les ânes
D'l'inspiration plein le crâne, j'vends des CD, pas des grammes
J'suis jalousé par les hommes et convoité par les femmes
Traumatisé par les flammes, j'raconte ma vie, pas des fables
Émoustillés par les sommes, les carottes font bouger les ânes

Vu comme un dangereux criminel lâché dans la communauté
Ces rappeurs veulent me voir face contre terre, les mains dans l'dos menottées
Ces bâtards crieront mes échecs, chuchoteront mes réussites
Si t'es l'un d'entre eux, négro, remets plus jamais les pieds ici
Empêcher l'menteur de mentir, c'est comme empêcher l'chien d'aboyer
Allez-y, mentez, c'est pas ma réputation qui paie mon loyer
Négro solitaire, négro solitaire
Dans gros bolide'zer, les reins solides'zer
J'ai beau les faire chier dans leur sarouel, la merde restera dans leur cervelle
J'arrêterai pas d'faire du sale, ouais, à contre-cœur, ils viendront m'saluer
Les chiens feront jamais des chats, non, j'peux t'le jurer sur le champ
Les suceurs usent de leur charme, moi, j'dis la vérité, j'passe pour le méchant

(Skrr-skrr!) yo, yo
C'est ceux qui parlent le plus qu'en font le moins, j'vais les calmer comme la fin du mois
Premier roro pour se faire la main, suis mon actu', négro, follow-moi
La jalousie peut faire mentir, parler pendant des nuits entières
Dois-je regretter l'fait que j'm'en tire, oh, est-ce qu'il faut que j'm'enterre?
Des pensées d'plus en plus sombres, sombres, des projets bossés en soum-soum
Ça veut monter sur le trône, à quel prix j'ai des soupçons?
D'l'argent dans les mains mais pas dans le cœur, le comportement des radins m'écœure
Les borgnes ne seraient pas rois si les aveugles pouvaient acheter leur vue comme les rappeurs
Les histoires sont vraies mais pas les narrateurs, tes ambitions ralenties par la peur
Mon pied sur l'accélérateur, mes textes sont visionnaires et fédérateurs

Lefa,"Mon gars, la vie est pleine d'intempéries
Papa, c'est vrai, c'qu'on regarde à la télé?
C'est p't-être moi, j'suis dans un délire (dans un délire)
Faut qu'j'comprenne dans les délais (dans les délais)
Toujours en plein cœur de Paris
Laisse tomber, tu peux pas comparer
La même vitesse à l'arrivée qu'au départ et
Même quand la route est barrée
T'es pas sûr de toi, j'l'ai vu dans tes yeux
Négro, dis c'que tu veux, tu peux pas nous mentir
Remets, remets-en une couche, c'que tu nous as donné
Non, frérot, ça peut pas nous remplir
Attends d'avoir assez d'pierres avant d'aller crier sur tous les toits qu'tu montes un empire
Compte sur les doigts d'ta main ceux qui accepteront d't'aider
Sans t'demander avant ""qu'est-ce qu'on en tire?""

Touché, coulé, touché, coulé
T'arrives debout, tu repars couché, touché, coulé
J'suis en deux roues, t'es en dessous, touché, coulé
J'ai troué ta dernière bouée, touché, coulé

Laisse tomber, on n'est pas les mêmes
On n'a pas nagé dans les mêmes eaux
Non, merci, j'prends pas les miettes
Rajoute des couverts, mon équipe est dans la maison
Facile d'aboyer
Quand tu navigues sur un voilier
Mais, tant qu't'as pas traversé à la nage
N'te moque pas de celui qui s'est noyé
J'ai pas l'temps d'psychoter
J'dois mettre de l'argent de côté
Prends pas la confiance, s'il te plaît
Sinon le médecin va devoir panser tes plaies
J'ai fait une pause
J'les ai soulagés d'un poids
Trois ans plus tard l'écart entre eux et moi n'a pas bougé d'un poil

Touché, coulé, touché, coulé
T'arrives debout, tu repars couché, touché, coulé
J'suis en deux roues, t'es en dessous, touché, coulé
J'ai troué ta dernière bouée, touché, coulé

En général, on rate pas nos tirs
Comme ennemi, t'as pas connu pire
T'as sucré, sucré nos dos
Quand tu nous as vu, tu savais pas quoi nous dire
Y'a l'score et la manière
Leur sang sur la bannière
J'fais des gros sons, ça date pas d'hier
J'avance, j'vois toujours pas d'barrière
Et, quand le ciel s'assombrit
J'consulte pas d''bou-mara'
On affronte les vagues d'une mer ""calme"" ne forme pas d'bon marin
J'ai pas d'calibre
J'm'invente pas d'vie, j'fais pas l'caïd
Pourtant, leur peur trompe pas mes narines
Comme la cocaïne devant la brigade canine

Lefa,"C'est vrai qu'en preuves d'amour, j'suis pas l'plus généreux
Est-ce de la pudeur ou d'la gêne? P't-être que c'est les deux
P't-être que j'ai pas vu assez d'films ou d'séries
M'en veux pas si j'te dis pas assez ""je t'aime"", ma chérie
Tu m'connais, les mots doux, c'est pas mon fort
Et j'suis pas du genre à passer mes journées sur mon phone
Je sais qu'je peux être blessant
J'dis des choses quand l'ton monte que j'regrette quand il redescend
Et t'attendais qu'je passe la porte pour fondre en larmes
Je sais qu'tu m'as haï du plus profond d'ton âme
Oui, notre flamme ne brille plus de mille feux
Mais ton retour reste mon unique vœu

Y'en a pas deux comme elle, tu n'peux pas l'oublier
Il te faut deux ailes si tu veux t'envoler

J't'ai pas fait d'demande de mariage à genoux
Nan, y'avait pas d'ça entre nous
J'espérais t'offrir un bel avenir
Avec ou sans lune de miel à Venise
Au lieu d'ça, t'as fait tes valises, ouais
En oubliant ton bracelet Tiffany's, ouais
Oublie nos disputes, c'est rien, ça
J'avais un cœur de pierre, t'en as fait des grains d'sable
Et t'attendais qu'je passe la porte pour fondre en larmes
Tu sais qu'j'm'en suis voulu au plus profond d'mon âme
Mais t'as supporté mes défauts
Pour moi, t'as fait tellement d'efforts

Oui, tu m'as brisé le cœur quand tu m'as dit qu'tu t'en allais
Retour à la solitude, après tant d'années
J'ai vécu notre histoire sans savoir qu'elle était condamnée
T'as vécu notre histoire avec le doigt sur le cran d'arrêt

I'm on the Internet - catch me on your Buddy List (I'll be in trouble, ha!)
Catch me where the money is, megas and millions (megas)

When a nigga legit, a nigga knowin' how to stunt (stunt)
Uptown, Downtown, go wherever he at (wherever he at)
Nigga make it implication, shit better be fat (shit better)
