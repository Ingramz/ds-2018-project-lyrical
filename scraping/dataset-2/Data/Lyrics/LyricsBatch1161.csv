The Monkees,"I've been standing on the corner all day
Tryin' to think of little things to say
'Cause she walks by ev'ry day about this time
And I don't think, I'll ever get her off of my mind.

Well I only met her 'bout a week ago
But the way she smiles let me know
That she could see that maybe we were two of a kind.
And I don't think I'll ever get her off of my mind.

Oh she's so pretty I couldn't believe
She'd ever look my way
But the way I'm feeling
I'm gonna be stealing
That little girl's heart today.

Well, I'm so happy I could almost fly
And I guess you know the reason why,
I'm walkin' down the street with her little hand in mine.
And I don't think I'll ever get her off of my mind.

Movin' fast and movin' slow
I'm in a crowd yet I'm all alone

I'm gonna turn around and head for home.

And I hope you're there
And you still care
And if you do,
I'll spend my life with you.

I've had all the time I need
To rearrange my mind and lead
The life I thought I wanted yesterday
I played a game that couldn't last

Have turned my thoughts around a different way.

And girl, I find
You're still on my mind.

The Monkees,"Ev'ryone in town knew Mr. Webster;
He worked at the bank for forty years.
And each week Mr. Frizby made his check out
For sixty-eight dollars clear.

And through the years he thwarted twenty-seven robberies
And each time Frizby promised him a raise.

They gave a retirement party for Mr. Webster
Everyone from the bank was there.
They had a cake and flowers ordered special
And Frizby had a speech prepared.

And a little white box that held a watch with this inscription
""To Mr. Webster, with regards.""

Then came the telegram from Mr. Webster
Said, ""Sorry...stop...Cannot attend..

The Monkees,"When the world and I were young
Just yesterday
Live was such a simple game
A child could play
It was easy then to tell right from wrong
Easy then to tell weak from strong
When a man should stand and fight
Or just go along

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray

I remember when the answers seemed so clear
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear
It was easy then to tell truth from lies
Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate
The foolish from the wise

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light
Today there is no black or white
Only shades of gray

It was easy then to know what was fair
When to keep and when to share

Goin' down
Goin' down

I wished I'd looked before I leaped
I didn't know it was so deep
Been down so far I don't get wet
I haven't touched the bottom yet
This river scene is gettin' old
I'm hungry, sleepy, wet and cold
She told me to forget it nice
I should have taken her advice
I only want to go on home
I'd gladly leave that girl alone
What a way to spend the night
If I don't drown, I'll die of fright
My pappy taught me how to float
But I can't swim a single note
He threw me in to teach me how
I stayed there floatin' like a mama cow
And now I've floated way downstream
Know this has to be a dream
If I could find my way to shore
I'd never, never do this anymore
I'll give you three, I've been down nine
I'm goin' down just one more time

Goin' down
Goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' back home
Back home to my friends
Back under the warm
And I can do with it, too

Now the sky is gettin' light
An everythng will be all right
Think I finally got the knack
Just floatin' here lazy on my back
I never really liked that town
I think I'll ride the river down
Just movin' slow and floatin' free
There's a river swinging under me
Waving back to the folks on shore
I should have thought of this before
I'm floatin' on down to New Orleans
And pick up on some swingin' scenes
I'm gonna know a better day
I'm goin' down groovin' all the way
Goin' down
Go-go-go-in' down
I'm goin' down, back, back, back
I'm goin' back, back, back home

And both of us meandered on for miles

I remember the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie
And though you never knew I did, I cried

And make you look at things that can't be seen
How the years that roll by can start you listening

Not too real to take a chance on finding out
You've really lost.
I can't see you clearly while I'm here.
While I'm here and you are in my state of mind.

The Monkees,"With the music of life, my soul is out of tune,
And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims
I got distracted with meaningless games,
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,
Doomed to find out things a little too late,
And so I must play this broken man's role,
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream,
Without a dream,

It's hard to remember to smile

Can't you say you want me to stay
I'd believe it

The Monkees,"In a long and involved conversation with myself
I saw a precious thing come into view
When I poured through the files taken off my mental shelf
I dusted off some memories of you

Then I thought about the times 
When all the world was green
How the Pheonix of our love first flapped its silver wings
All the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened
And how it all mellowed as it grew

I remember the times that our laughter would explode
And how you would turn to hide your smile
Then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed
And both of us meandered on for miles

I remember the time I said I really had to go
I remember the tears that filled your eyes
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie
And though you never knew I did, I cried

It's amazing how time can so softly change your ways
And make you look at things that can't be seen
How the years that roll by can start you listening
Not just to what they say, but what they mean

So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied
If the razor edge of youth filled love is gone
But we're both a little older, our relationship has grown
Not just in how it's shaped, but how it's shown

You think you can make it, girl, on just your looks 
But you could never bring me up

Said ""hello"" with a smile just like I wasn't there
I kicked dirt some more

He blew some silver circles,
Wound his fingers in his beard

The Monkees,"Tell me,
Just one more time the reasons why you must leave,
Tell me once more why you're sure you don't need me,
Tell me again but, don't think that you'll convince me.

Now you've said,
Before falling in love again you'd rather be dead,
'Cause when someone breaks your heart, you cry your eyes red,
But there's nothing so hard about the life that you've led.

As far as I can see,
There's no reason for goodbyes,
You're just running scared,
And that's something I won't buy.

So you lose,
I won't let you go with nothing to show but more blues,
And all this talk about leaving is strictly bad news,
So you settle down and stay with the man that loves you.

The Monkees,"She walks around on brass rings that never touch her feet.
She speaks in conversations that never are complete.
And looking over past things that she has never done
She calls herself St. Matthew, when she is on the run.

She stoops down to gather partly shattered men
And knows that when it's over it will start again.
Both the times she smiled it was a portrait of the sun.
She calls herself St. Matthew, when she is on the run.

Part of it is loneliness and knowing how steal.
But most if it is weariness from standing up, trying not to kneel.

She discovered three new ways that she could help the dead.
Sometime she must raise her hand to tell you what she said.
Then standing in a landslide she suddenly becomes
A girl that's named St. Matthew, when she is on the run.

The Monkees,"My, my, the clock in the sky
Is pounding away
And there's so much to say

A face, a voice
An overdub has no choice
An image cannot rejoice

Wanting to be
To hear and to see
Crying to the sky

But the porpoise is laughing
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Clicks, clacks, riding the backs of giraffes for laughs
S'alright for a while

And kings and things that go
With a life of style

To know what is real
Living is a, is a lie

(It hurts so bad, 'cause when I see you, I start crying,
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying

Oh, don't walk away,
Oh, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through

Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?
You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true, just spoken to help nobody but you
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ah

The Monkees,"Love in a vacuum, love in a space,
Love without even the little hint of a trace,
Love in confusion then love doesn't show on your face.

Love is a stranger, love is a box,
Love is the key that fits a million locks,
Love is a mystery when love is the devil you call.

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine.

Love at a distance, love at a walk,
Love at the limit if only people could talk,
Love for the moment it takes to its wings like a hawk.

Love for tomorrow, love for today,
Love for the hour it could be coming your way,
Love for a puzzle you need a solution to play.

Put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can see them shine,
I wish you'd put your heart and soul where I can think they're mine.

We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear

Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate
The foolish from the wise

And make you look at things that can't be seen
And how the years that roll by can start you listening

Safety runs through the target if you test me
Psycho thug, mashin' outta control
Spent too many fuckin' years deep in a hole
But still I'm a killa, feindin' for the streets
Slangin' rocks on a 9 to 5 beat
All that change, now got maggots on my face
I'm back from the dead to give yo ass a taste 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 

The grave ain't no place to be
Too much like the penetentary
Locked away in concrete
I'm buried 6 feet
Guess so, so when you roam
You can find your way home
Cuffs tight around the wrist cause I was bustin' my chrome
Dark visions in the smog when I walk with the dead
Bad dreams in the night keep you shakin' in bed
Is it all in your head cause you're locked in a cage?
And clear your mind and get shanked and live the cemetery way 

I'm sittin' in the cemetery
I got a plan to kill a pig so I placed a phony call about a bitch I buried
Fuck a cell, I won't ever go back
I got you creasin' in my pocket like a folded up rap
I look in the back, a squad car pullin' up slow
I grabbed the pistol in the hand with the glove, and let it blow
Dashin' off like a thief in the night
To me it was right
I had to end his muthafuckin' life 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket!
The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!
Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 

They can't keep a dead body locked down
In the ground
Of the pen
Came through the dirt, break free again
Leave my home of the grave, shared with the roaches
Back on the street, keep an eye on the vultures
Flip, my escape out the front gates
When the pigs check yo' friends, ain't no trace
Of a gangsta, I'm already out robbin' suckers
Pistol whippin' bitches, puttin' holes in motherfuckers
Act like you know, Psychopathic on the glock
And I gives no fuck when I'm mashin' up ya block
Empty out the chamber, so long to your family
Everybody history
Nothing left but memories
Friends start to cry and you're one with the earth
Ain't nobody cry for me, not even the church
My rebirth was greeted my a police chase
But I'm a thug motherfucker, I ain't catchin' a case 

The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa!
Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala!
The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin!

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught

On cheap talk and wine

Heard the voice, had no choice
Needed to be free

Left the earth below
Heard the line, saw the sign
Knew which way to go

Than to prove it can't be done
And it's easier to stay
Than to turn around and run

It takes somebody to help somebody

It's a new world

It needs somebody to love somebody
Oh, it's a blue world

Heart and soul took control
Took control of me
Paid my dues, spread the news
Hands across the sea

Put me down, turned me round
Turned me round to see
Marble halls, open doors
Someone found the key

And it's only what you do
That keeps coming back on you
And it's only what you say
That can give yourself away

'cause it's easier to try
Than to prove it can't be done
And it's easier to stay
Than to turn around and run

It takes somebody to help somebody

In the confusion that night
I only know what's on my mind
What's in the future, we will decide

Time waits for no one at all
No, not even you

You really thought you knew

I've shattered the illusion of fortune and of fame
But darling, now I know you

Rivers of endless tides
Have passed beneath my feet

You opened them for me
And now we journey thro' our lives to what will be

And in the morning of my life
And in the evening of my life

Only true love will see you through
And we'll stand beside you in what you sayâ?¦

Take me into your world
Alone I cannot go
For I've been here so long
You're leaving me behind

And open up that book of ages in my mind

A fleet of golden galleons, on a crystal sea.
Are you sitting comfortably?
Let Merlin cast his spell.

Ride along the winds of time and see where we have been,
The glorious age of Camelot, when Guinevere was Queen.
It all unfolds before your eyes
As Merlin casts his spell.

The seven wonders of the world he'll lay before your feet,
In far-off lands, on distant shores, so many friends to meet.

The Moody Blues,"Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing
If I can come through than so can you
And you will find there's no regretting
Things you want from your life's font
Will never let your spirit roam
Come back to Earth for what it's worth
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home

[Chorus]
I've been doing my best
What else can I do?
Is there something I've missed
That will help you through

I have reached the top of the wall
And all I've found is another way to fall

For some short time
For a while you and I were joined to eternity
Then we split in two back tome and you
Like the rain rising from the sea
Rising from the sea
We all can see what we shall be
But knowing's not really controlling
With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding
After you'd come and while you're gone
You leave me guessing, it's depressing
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing
So you just have to laugh
When it hurts so much
You're so far away and so hard to touch

I have reached the top of the wall
And all I've found is another way to fall

Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing
If I can come through than so can you

How can I tell you, love can change our destiny.

Do what you know is right

Cause they played my kind of rhythm

From traffic, telephones, and fear.
Put out your problems with a cat,
Escape until a bell you hear.
Our reasons are the same,
But there's no one we can blame,
For there's no where we need go,
And the only truth we know, comes so easily.
The sound I have heard in your hello,
Oh darling, you're almost part of me.Oh darling, you're all I'll ever see.
It's such a rainy afternoon,
No point in going anywhere.
The sounds just drift across my room,

A feeling deep inside her grows.

And the browns, reds and golds of autumn lye in the gutter dead
Remember then the summer birds with wings of fire flame
Come to witness springs new hope, born of leaves decaying
And as new life will come from death

Love will come at leisure
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure
Gives in return a wondrous yearn for promise almost seen
Live hand in hand and together we'll stand
On the threshold of a dream

No thoughts must deceive him
In life he must trust

With the eyes of a child
You must come out and see
That your world's spinning 'round
And through life you will be

A small part of a hope
Of a love that exists
In the eyes of a child you will see

Earth falls far away
New life awaits
Time it has no day
New life awaits

Here is your dream
And now how does it feel?
No words will go with you
And now what is real?

With the eyes of a child
You must come out and see
That your world's spinning 'round
And through life you will be

A small part of a hope
Of a love that exists
In the eyes of a child you will see

But it's all around if we could but perceive
To know ultra violet, infra-red and X-rays
Beauty to find in so many ways

They've got time
Take a step back out
And look in at their debt
And their time

Minds are subject to what should be done
Problem solved, time cannot be won
One hour a day
One hour at night
Sees crowds of people
All meant for flight

Peak hour, peak hour, peak hour

The Moody Blues,"When the sun goes down, 
And the clouds all frown, 
Night has begun for the sunset. 
See it with your eyes, 
Earth re-energized 
By the sun's rays every day. 
Take a look out there, 
Planets everywhere. 
When the sun goes down 
And the clouds all frown, 
Night has begun for the sunset. 
Shadows on the ground 
Never make a sound, 
Fading away in the sunset. 
Night has now become 
Day for everyone.

From this great height. 
I can feel the sun 
Slipping out of sight 
And the world still goes on

You've been drinking on your own

We will walk in peace through the garden, down the road
Where the mist of time is lifting
See it rise in the air, like the shadow I was chasing
When I looked, it wasn't there, oh, no

Just in case you're wondering
What was really on my mind
It wasn't what you took my love
It's what you left behind

Just in case you're wondering
Will it really be the same?
Will it really be the same?
You know we're only living for the day we meet again

So hold on and don't let go
Time, it heals, you know, I know

You can see exactly what to do, don't tell me

Only who is the artist, we got to agree
A thousand miles can lead so many ways
Just to know who is driving, what a help it would be

So if you want this world of yours to turn about you
And you can see exactly what to do, don't tell me

Riots by the people for the people
Who are only destroying themselves

Person who is frightened by the
People who are scorching this earth, scorching this earth

Meeting so many people, who are trying to be free
While I'm traveling I hear so many words

Music is the traveler crossing our world
Meeting so many people, we're bridging the seas

I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band

And the crashing of the sea

I took a road I'd never been.
I met a stranger by the way,
His coat was torn but his eyes were clear.

Standing in a slide zone,
Steppin' in a slide zone.

He told me where a river flows,
He showed me how the apple grows.
He told me of a magic stream,
His face was worn but his eyes were clear.

Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.
Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' through a time zone.

Around the bend, that's where they are.
I went along just for the ride,
Suddenly I began to slide.

Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' through a time zone.

The air raced by there was no sound,
We drifted high above the ground.
And then he said you know this place,
And then a smile lit up his face.

I could be steppin' in a slide zone.
Standing in a slide zone,
I could be steppin' through a time zone.

I turned my head and I looked below, Slide zone...
And there was something there I know.
Suddenly I began to fall,
I looked around and tried to call.

He had me steppin' in a time zone.

Shining on the wall

And tell me, am I dreaming
Or is someone at the door?

And winter turns to spring

To matters of the heart
I thought I had it covered
But it's tearing me apart

And winter turns to spring

That you wrote me from the heart

If I dreamed it all instead

Upon my face

To rejoin the human race

That once inspired my life

And the strength of the emotion
Is like thunder in the air
'Cause the promise that we made each other
Haunts me to the end

I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice

I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you

The secret of your beauty and the mystery of your soul
I've been searching for in everyone I meet
And the times I've been mistaken, it's impossible to say
And the grass is growing underneath our feet

I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice

I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you

I know you're out there somewhere
Yes, I know you're out there somewhere
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yes, I know it's going to happen
I can feel you getting near
And soon we'll be returning
To the fountain of our youth

And if you wake up wondering
In the darkness I'll be there
My arms will close around you
And protect you with the truth

I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice

I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you

And love you just once more

If I could hold you
Hold you, hold you
I know you'd understand
I know you'd understand

As I cross the bridge by the waterfall
As I make my way by the stars
There's a shadow walking beside me
Here in my heart

Like the restless wind in the tree tops
Like a whispered voice in my ear
I will always be there for you
I'll always be here

Back across the shore
If I could touch you now, my darling
And love you just once more

If I could hold you
Hold you, hold you

I know you'd understand

In a far off wonderland
That flashes past my eyes
The kiss of inspiration that was mine

The dust of many centuries
Has blown across this land
But love will not be scattered by the sand

Like the sunrise over the mountainside
Like the bird that has to be free
There's a part of you
That will always be part of me

I bless the wings that bring you
Back across the shore
If I could touch you now my, darling
And love you just once more

I dream of my destiny, my days in the sun
To live in the garden of our love
I search for some happiness, I search for my soul
I pray for some strength from God above

Yes, I believe in a better world
And like the rest of us, I pray
For peace on this earth and a better life
With every beautiful day, with every beautiful day

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind

It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads

Ever smilin', ever gentle on my mind

I hope to get to sleep, stayed up through the night
After seeing half of the Broadway movie
I got up there everyday, a toke of cocaine
And haven't found a snow on Forty Second street
See the thought pretending how they want you
Still I never paid for it miles and miles away from home

[Chorus x2]
Yes it was real, I love New York
Yes it was real, I love New York
Yes it was, it was a real and a lie
Could it ever break you
Could it ever make you in New York
What's the time, as I think of her
Does it make a difference on the other side
She may well be sleeping now
So cover me up with the dreams we share
If we could sleep tonight
In this heated carpet magic city
Could she ever hear me now, calling out

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart

Leaving me a song that will not die

The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms

No, she don't know what she's missing.
Can't she see I'll never give up the fight.
I'll do all I can.

Let me into your heart.
Oh. There's nothing on earth that should keep us apart.
Baby, I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone,
'cause I can't live without your love.
Oo your love.
 
So I wait, mm, here for an answer.
Wonder if tomorrow will be like this today.
I keep holding on, can't go on living this way, baby.

Bring my tears to an end, oh.

Can't find the words to tell you that I can't live without your love.
I can't live without your love and affection.
I can't face another night on my own.
I'd give up my pride to save me from being alone.
Baby, I can't live without your love and affection.
I just can't go on this way any more.
As hard as I try there's one thing that I know for sure.
I can't live without your love.

Lanterns swing in the heat of day
Old lady sings the song that I can't forget

Collects the flowers they give to you
Her eyes,her dress,the sky,the blue

My daughter dear, do not be concerned

With the grubby little hand
Who lived in Montreal
Was drooling a bit
As he reached for her tit
And he said to himself:
""This is gonna be it!""
But the girl turned around
And said: ""Go eat shit!""
And ran on down the hall.
Right on, Magdalena!

Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena, Magdalena,
Daughter of the smog-filled winds of Los Angeles,
I'd like to take you in the closet and take off your little clothes until you are virtually stark raving nude,
Spread mayonaise
And kaopectate all over your body and take you down to Hollywood Boulevard and we can,
We can walk down the streets by the stars that say Jon Provost and Leo G. Carroll together, baby.
We can go dancing up at the Cinegrill
Can't you see it: Frank Pernell and us, until dark,
Don't you understand, my baby?
I didn't mean, I didn't need, I mean, it was so hard for me, I just...
I saw you standing under the Shell pest strip late last night,
In the light,
With your little nipples protruding through your little see-thru thingie, and I just said, ""My god,
My god, I gave my sperm to this thing!"" And now I just,
Oh, you got me so hard, I just,
I don't know what to do, Magdalena, don't you understand? So I grabbed you, but,
But don't hold it against me, I mean,
Your mom will never know, baby, and I wantcha to come back to me,
I mean, do you understand me? I want you to...
I'm down on my knees to ya, Magdalena! I wantcha ta walk back to me, baby,
I wantcha to turn around by the Sparkletts machine.
That's it! That's it! In the little chartreuse hallway with the little neon Jesus picture on the wall,
And I want you to step, baby,
I want you to walk back in your five inch spike heels that you got at Frederick's,
Same time you and your mommy got that crotchless underwear last year for Christmas,
And I want you to stroll back to me, baby
Walk back, baby, don'tcha understand me, baby?
I want you to walk back
I'm down on bended knees, baby
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna take off your little training bra
Don't you understand me?
I'm gonna take off you little maroon hot pants
I'm gonna get down on my knees, baby, dont'cha understand what I'm saying to you?
Your mom will never know, she's playing bridge with the girls,
And you and I...
You and I go sucking som'thing, baby,
It's just you and I, don'tcha understand?
We can make love all night long,
Nobody will ever know,
Come on, Magdalena!
Please, little girl,
Walk back to your daddy,
What did I do that was so wrong?
My God, I was only following the sexual impulse like I heard on the Johnny Carson Show from a book or something I wrote,
I didn't know what I was doing
I got carried away
What can I say like, like...
Walk back, baby,
Come on,
Oh, please, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back to your daddy!
Come on, Magdalena, to your daddy, baby, you gotta walk back, baby, walk back,
Walk back, baby, walk back,
Your mom will never know,

Walk back, baby, walk back,

Come on down, stroll it around of me,

Never settled on a name
But the top three contenders after weeks of debate
Were Satan's Fingers, and The Killers, and The Hospital Bombers

They were headed for stage lights and lear jets and fortune and fame
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram
They stenciled their drum heads and guitars with their names

And this was how Cyrus got sent to the school
Where they told him he'd never be famous
And this was why Jeff, in the letters he'd write to his friend
Helped develop a plan to get even

Nowhere to go but down, down, down
Nothing but the ground left for you to fall to

By July
You'd made a whole bunch of brand new friends
People you used to look down on

And you'd figured out a way to make real money
Giving ends to your friends and it felt stupendous

And selling it to a cop was a worse one

Hoping not to make a sound
I pushed my bed into the ground
In time to catch the sight that I was seeking

Then this is how it has to be
If my pillow's getting wet

Make conversation with the trees
Relieved to leave reality behind me
With my commitments an a mess
My sleep has gone away depressed

And get my feet back on the sand
Because tomorrow might be all I get

The second time is always said to be much better than the first
So why does it hurt?
Could it be our smiles are nothing but wrinkles on our face
It's such a waste

Feelings were meant to be told, stand out with the cold
And truth stands aside

Breathe in, Breathe out Survive, keep my head above the water
And get my feet back on the sand

Just leave, and wipe the burn from my eyes

Don't want to be the one

I swear you'll sleep again, you'll sleep again
If it means I have to build you a bed
You'll sleep again, you'll sleep again
I'll do the best I can
I'm writing home to tell you
That I miss it all so terribly
In the way that makes your stomach ache
And your hands begin to shake
My hands still shake

And I want my family

But I wanna go home
I swear I'll sleep again, I'll sleep again

Leave the door unlocked, I'm coming home

And a kiss tasted like lies

You can try it in the morning try it out in the rain but your love won't change one single thing and you know that you can't hide it
If you try it and it didn't quite fall into place then your love may not have been right for the day but you know that you've got to move on
Yeah you know that your heart will move on

Anything you want it will be right at your door when your eyes look above you get up
Anything you need will be right at your feet if you try you can reach everyone

So, you turn your back on someone with love to spare
Try to see, it's gotta be
Lovin' one another is the only possibility
So, when you're down and losin' ground
Don't get to thinkin' love can't be found
Hey, stop, stop! And look around
Somebody wants to love you
Stop, stop! And turn around
Somebody wants to love you
Somebody wants to love you
Hey, you! It's nothin' new
Love will be around no matter what you do
Or will you try every alibi
and fool yourself some more then wonder why
So try to see, it's gotta be
When you turn your back on love, you miss the opportunity
And once again, you're at a dead end
And nowhere to turn without a friend
Hey, stop, stop! And look around
Somebody wants to love you
Stop, stop! And turn around
Somebody wants to love you
Somebody wants to love you",Somebody Wants to Love You,1989

Then I completely get all mad
And look the part and treat you bad
I've more fun laying on a bed of roses

Oh boy, I now can hardly wait
Do everything so you can hate
Behind my back imeuic
And I don't understand

Again I should be telling you
I'll do what I'm supposed to do
I've more fun laying on a bed of roses

There'll be no next time, now
I've seen the light, oh yeah
There'll be no next time, now

How can he be so mean
And he'll take everything

Am I crazy or have good luck

You're the talk of the town
So you say (oh, oh)

[Chorus]
I don't know why you're so glad
When my head's filled with sorrow
So maybe if I fade away
There'll be no sad tomorrow

My whole life is a drag

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
