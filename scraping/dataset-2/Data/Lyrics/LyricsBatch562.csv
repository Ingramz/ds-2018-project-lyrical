Krept & Konan,"Yeah, RA
(You know what time it is)
Krept, Tally
Mad ting, sad ting
Been real (maniac, cool)
(My brudda)
Greazy ting
(Play Dirty)
Every fucking time
Ready for it
How many times?
I've got dargs that pop off singles for 'em
(Fuck all these youts, gas)

Tally the madman
Any MC, I'll kalash man
Krept, Tally, badman, Afghan
Fuck anyone coming at man, what?
Spin who? Fuck that, man's on job
Sixteen spun you, sent man shop
Which yout? Come then, bet man flop
None of you mugs can tek man's spot
Long way from Gipset Tally
No BRITs, no GRAMMYs, Christians, akhis
Kids, no daddies, pissed in alleys
Spliffs and ammi, sticks and ballies
Clips and strallies, rinsing maggies
Lifting fassies, chip from cabbies
Linking baddies, gripsing Abbie
Tits and batty, dicks and fanny
Gyal move slutty, I'm ringing her for the ucky
Cats in Surrey, my niggas still in the gully
Max, no flurry, you niggas thinking it's funny
Till the rocket's out the pocket and all up inna your tummy
Where's all the Charlie you selling up in the party, nigga?
Where's the Cavalli, your money and the Versace, nigga?
Where's all your honeys? Say that you get the punani, nigga
Now we getting money, we must be Illuminati
Krept, Tally, deep within the streets, miss him
G, listen, I eat riddims, I'll keep spinning
Sneak dissing, keep digging, I'll Meek Mill him
Peak for 'em, keep killing, I'll reaper 'em
Best in the country, beg someone touch me
Skets wanna suck me, text me for uck, G
Feds on a fuckery, tek 'way my young G
I don't give a fuck if Metro trust me
I can't believe this shit
They compare me to wack MCs, neeky pricks
I'm from that south side era, man are G for dis
That RA gangster grime, that greazy shit
It's all real
They can't tek man's sauce still
Free up Fems, Weeps, Snap, Goddy
Fam, they're all hill

RA is R-A-W
You know that, that had the road mad
No metaphor, just smack and know facts
When I clap MACs, it's bags and dog tags
So don't rap back, just clap your own back
Yeah, the akh's back, it's that, it's all mad
Way back from Pac-Man to [?]
Had that one a moped in a backpack, man
Ride up, jump off the bike and bap-bap
And I still ain't taking no backchat
Nowadays, man think they're bad on Snapchat
I'll back out mad straps and snap off snapbacks
(Kaboom) Cuh when I go to the function
Big hand ting, whip it out like a truncheon
Three .45s like a bus going Junction
Yeah, them man there rap, but they lie about their dumpings
I just know if I let the MAC go
Suttin's getting fried like a dumpling
And it's proven
Everybody you see me with, they're movers
I'm the real deal, they're YouTubers
I was on smoke, they was on computers
School days, badness, badding up tutors
Riding with hand tings hanging off scooters
Never been a has-been, banging on Judas
Real life shankings, claret on Pumas
Real life cabbaging characters and Lugers
Steel pipe damaging faggots and losers
Real life, managing havoc and rumours
Jail life, mad ting, whacking up shooters
So don't let me let off
You was on a train, I was on a sweatbox
I was in the rain, you was on your Xbox
Cocaine, tryna network to a next spot
Dem times dere, my cousin caught a next shot
Out in yard, tryna line up a headshot
Flew back home tryna get it by the headlock
I was getting boxes, banging it in Z shots
Then I see a .44 peel back a headtop
Seen a MAC mek a man twist like a dreadlock
Switch it

Ain't top three? That's an insult
These neeks don't bang, they ain't involved
Black bag full of ink notes
PCs had me getting out windows
In banger whips doing petty runs
Got savages that ain't 21
Nearly got grabbed from the firearms
I was living with Ma's, now I'm buying yards
Palace to Heath, I've got gang in the streets
Free Snapper and Weeps
These rappers are neeks, they ain't clapping on heat
They're just rapping on beats
Put a akh in [?] with a passion for beef
Got your slag on her knees
I was chatting to T while I sat in the heat
With crack in my jeans
Wrap scarf or a black mask, wap parked in a cat's yard
Black heart, never act soft
[?] in a packed dance, better act fast
If that barks, that's your hat gone
And I was tryna bag plants
Dash past in a cab car
Blacked-out with a fat arse
Splash large when I'm at Shard
Rap star wearing Trapstar
All I see is nerds and fakers
Your Rolex ain't got papers
Normal weed in a medicine bottle
I don't wanna hear about flavours
Crack in a [?], rap like a freestyle
I was sixteen with the MAC at Monique's house
Flat with my feed out, stack in the meanwhile
Neeks on the net, I'm [?] on the rebound
They're only bad when they login
Think you're sick till you're cold in a coffin
Rudeboy like Rihanna
Before all this, I was robbing
For a Kilo Echo Yankee
Bro will Papa Oscar Papa
At your Bravo Oscar Yankee
Put him to Bravo Echo Delta

My don's in Huntercombe, shit's still active
I want a hundred Ms quick like Gatlin
You would think my G's from Mozart
Selling [?] had the tings dem rattlin'
All this bread and you think
I never bought no tings for the Gs dem? Blud, don't even
You'll see nuttin' but trackies, TNs
My niggas are able to end your weekend
Too cold
You're better than who, bro?
I phoned up Abz, he got two bookings
He's moving too sho
Get my cards out, unlock the Wraithe
I change my suit, I cop some Ace
I took your girl, don't be so mad
I'd put anything on it, your queen's a slag
There's no reversing like a king
When it gets on top 'cause man, I'll pitch in
Three twos, you'll hold six when it hits him
Three eights will have man skipping
None of these MCs are levelling
You think these jokers are anything?
Play your cards right, streets are mad, akh
Hold your own or be another blackjack
What, G? Top three niggas, know Krept is
Ain't old school? Then you probably won't get this
Madman Femz had it out all reckless
Banger and the mash and he done it with breakfast
Sprayed in the crib, man done it with Westwood
Out of the blue like bruddas in Deptford
Real Artillery, nuttin' was censored
Locking off raves, man are running through entrance
Got Gs in the ends too
My Gs, we offend too
You ain't buying no arsenal
Now you're who the docs need to attend to
Come a long way from me and Snap Capone
Tryna go country
Feds took the whip on a fuckery, left man stranded in Wooly
I could've strangled 'em, pussy
You ain't grabbed no shotties, clapped nobody
Catch no bodies, wrap no Bobby
Not my brudda, don't @ nobody
She sat pon cocky, no back, no doggy
Dead
Comment on my man's pics? You're a beg
Click-clack-blaow, watch niggas go death
Fuck that, right now, nigga, I'm vex
Contract signed, six-figure, no less
Stop holding your fist like Arthur
Like bro ain't got a ting for the drama
Switchblade get your wig shaved
Believe in your bloodclart barber
Black nigga chilling with corporates
Fuck who's feeling important
You brag 'bout whips, that's awkward
Your whip probably cost my insurance
I've lost my insanity
Bought a chain, I've spent your salary
My darg on savagery
They nicked my chargie for battery
Tally's back, it can't be
You just brought back the dark me
You just brought back Tsunami",Khalas,2017
Krept & Konan,"I've come a long way from flipping an ounce
Money hid in the couch
Got your chick in the house
With my dick in her mouth
I'll bet you're listening now
Police sniffing around
'Cause I'm big in the north and I'm big in the south
Bring my tour to your town, make you sit in the crowd
My pockets filled up with pounds
Just like my business account
'Cause I grind like I'm broke, flight to the show
Done about five in a row, mind on my dough
But I still slide in your hoe like I didn't know
You can get it right off the boat, right from my phone
Let me just type in a code, life on the road
Go ahead, try it if you want, I bet you won't
And I've got a knife in my coat I hide on the low
Round here, it's do or you die, die if you don't
And they talk like they're here but they're never in the bits
We've got it locked from the 7 to the 6
I know I shouldn't be telling you this shit
I know you're friends but it's better when you kiss
So fuck all the talk, get straight to the action
Party in the 6 and I'm drunk in a mansion
Canadian girl said she loving my accent
I left with your girl but I came with the mandem
I go to shows from coast to coast
In Novikov, propose a toast
I'm known to win, I go for gold
She home alone, she phone my phone
I'm like her drug, she overdose
They know the ends, they know I'm road
They know I'm street, they know the code
My head's hot, my shoulders cold
I roll with Muj, smoke the doj'
Big spliff, roll the roach
Slick Rick on the code
Tick tick, Roley's gold
DSTRKT, loads of hoes
Mixed with gold Patr√≥n
Big tits, show me those
Quick dick, drove her home
Biscuits, Toblerone
Flip bricks? No, you don't
Big whips? No, you're broke
Click click, holy ghost
Switch kicks, throw my clothes
Calling my name, that's a real risk
I've thought about it and I'm still pissed
'Cause I don't care if you're new or a legend
You saw what happened to Will Smith
I'm the wrong one to start off
All they've sold is a half oz
Now everybody thinks they're Escobar
Looked at my DJ like nah, Cos
They're taking this ting too far, Cos
They want the throne but it's ours, Cos
If they want, we can swing it out
Just know I've got the ting parked off
You're talking tough but you need to stop
You don't put in work, you need a job
Look, I ain't even been on Breakfast Club
But they envy when they see the god, oh

Can't talk to me, talk to my PR
These dickheads think that they're cowboys
Till they end up in the ER
Summertime in my fur coat
7 sides on these dirt roads
We went from having scraps to 9s
While my big bros went down the church roads
(Jesus Christ!) 
Went from a road yout to a rock star
Got bread, now I get Pop-Tarts
The ends is fucked and they blame us for it
So, you know what? I made a foundation to make up for it (fuck off!)

I know that shit just went over your head as well, man
It always does, man
I don't wanna hear these niggas talking about bars anymore, man
It's fucking embarrassing, fucking draw-out
You know who runs this shit, man (come on, G!)
(Play) Look out for the boy Golden  Muj (come on, G!)
(Dirty) Tally, I see you, my bro (come on, G!)
Play Dirty every time (that's all I think about)
Oi, Misch, lock that off, man, I'm finished

Yeah eh, so Konan, when are you gonna come back to Canada?
From the 7 to the 6 baby, come on, G!",Last Night in LA,2017

They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke
They don't want no smoke

My actions on alert, savage ain't the word
Twenty niggas deep, man ain't getting searched
Acting like a bitch, panties and a skirt
I bet you suck your mum, you prick, and go and mash your work
Chatting in your verse, you rappers got a nerve
Knocking niggas out, man are on the verge
I know you seen the whips, call me Matt when I skrrt
Bitch, what you doing? Get your hand off the Merc
Whole ends screaming free TK
Man was really in the ends where the Gs stay
Had Amazon her, she was surfing eBay
Boy, boy, shot sounded like a replay
Better call me Matt now
I'm like vroom, whip's worth like a flat now
They're like hmm, clap nigga with the plaits, how?

They can't cope, they don't want no smoke
Catch him on the road, be like ""fam, I ain't involved""
Comfy on my own
Looking at my watches like ""I could've bought a home""
Free the mandem, sipping Magnum
In the dance with a big spliff, Buju Banton
Fuckboys throwing tantrums, on my Samson
Not my fault that your babymum thinks I'm handsome
On a stage with a hundred man, better understand
Tryna book us for your festival? That's a hundred grand
Niggas think they're in wonderland with a couple fans
Till we have you in your Air Max doing the running man
Buss your head with an E&J, now I can see your brain
Had this nitty on my penj line, looked like Peter Kay
I brought weed with my EMA, fuck Theresa May
I brought weed with my EMA, fuck Theresa May (kaboom)

I talk to dead people on a daily basis
Everyday I look around, same familiar faces
Multicultural gang, million races
Fuck mid Brexit, them niggas is racist
I bought my dad a house, that's what niggas do
Mum got jealous so I got her one too
Told that boy I don't wanna kick it, I don't wanna learn kung fu
But if your girlfriend texts me, I'ma tell her come through
Give her that anaconda, I'ma give her that Jake the snake
Put her to sleep, in the morning, give her that wake and bake
Think you're a big boy now? You stay up late?
I was in the lion's den when you was playing Snake
Such a fucking snake, you love to hate
I still have my asthma pump, and I ain't never tucked my chain

And just like a carousel, round and round you go,
My patience runs out the door,
When you tell me all the ways you love me,
But still ain't never been to my show.
Oh, oh oh

Why do you pick me up to watch me fall?
You say you're so in love,
Then turn around and screen my calls?
Foot on the gas
The car keep stalling.
A passionate kiss
With eyes wide open.
Cold then hot, you go then stop,
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me not

You keep me out on a wire,
Somewhere between the ""you"" and ""you and I"",
My legs are getting so tired,
From hanging on your every word,
Making up excuses why
You can't make up your mind.

Whenever she is lonely,
Or after watching a girly movie
Or she just needs a hand to hold
He loves me
Whenever it's convenient,
Told myself each time he means it,
I happily play the fool.

I go changing my ways
And I wait till the moon is out
It's just part of my game

This is a cautionary cry to you
Before you figure out what I've gonna turned into

Just close your eyes and try to think it over
You realize I'm not the man you know, girl
I hypnotize ya, I paralyze ya
Go on and scream 'cause nobody's gonna find ya

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me
Maybe I should wear a warning that says that there's danger
If you ever get too close to me

I've been telling you to run away
But you say you're not scared
But when I break your heart some day
Girl you need to be prepared

So listen close I got a dirty little secret
The kind that takes away the air you try to breathe in
You won't believe it
Until you feel it
If your love is blind I guess that's why you didn't see it

Did I ever think to tell you that I am a monster?
You have never seen this side of me

Kris Anaya,"Please take a seat. 
Let me tell you both a tale of love and hope. 
It's a story that you may have heard before, told as mythical lore. 
But this translation is clear, unlike the embellishments that have reached your ears. 
There was a boy who shared your bones, your eager blood, your affinity for love. 
He had it all in his hands, and he watched it all turn to sand.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
Then I was truly meant to leave the Dark, 
Down this path set out in front of me. 
I will reunite this world's divided halves. 
Fulfill my history. 
This is more than divine decree, it's my destiny.

Digging 'round the deep, only missing out on sleep. 
Chasing 'bout my head like the wolf that found the sheep. 
Don't go digging 'round there, you be slipping bit too much.
Milling muck and mud with the mind that lost its touch. 
I been traveling 'bout in time, never stepping out for much. 
Deepest of the deep with the wolf that lost those sheep. 
Because it's more than a little but less than a bunch, 
Found their way around with the blind that lost its touch.

The choices he made that day to burn down the world he'd helped create. 
Don't be scared, kid. 
You're gifted. 
Follow this stream, and live out that prophecy. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones. 
Beware of the medicine before you lay your head again. 
Watch out for the wicked ones who call themselves beloved ones.

So they arrived at the doctor's camp, his crude shack. 
A shanty with walls of broken glass, 
Light leaking through the shattered cracks. 
And through he was cordial, the young couple was doubtful.

If this boy they speak of sincerely sits atop my family tree, 
I was truly meant to leave the dark down this path set out in front of me.

For the longshoremen had warned them to keep a close eye on their adored ones. 
But they had journeyed for a reason, they were here for the medicine. 
To cure the infection. But nothing could prepare him for the events that would ensnare them. 
All he could do is trust what he knew. He would listen to his gut and live for his love.",Holy the Sea,2008
Kris Barnes,"And it came to pass on a Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
Outside standing, a lonely boy-child
Cold and shivering in the night

On the street every window
Save but one was gleaming bright
And to this window walked the boy-child
Peeking in, saw candlelight

Through other windows he had looked at turkeys
And ducks and geese and cherry pies
But through this window saw a gray-haired lady
Table bare and tears in her eyes

Into his coat reached the boy-child
Knowing well there was little there
He took from his pocket his own Christmas dinner
A bit of cheese, some bread to share

His outstretched hands held the food
And they trembled, as the door it opened wide
Said he ""Would you share with me Christmas Dinner""
And gently she said, ""Come inside""

The gray-haired lady brought forth to the table
Some glasses to their last drop of wine
Said she ""Here's a toast to everyone's Christmas
And especially yours and mine

And it came to pass on that Christmas evening
While all the doors were shuttered tight
That in that town, the happiest Christmas
Was shared by candlelight",Christmas Dinner,2006

With all the love I've thrown away
Make some golden tomorrow
With everything I left today

And you could make a mountain of excuses
Find me any reason to stay
But it's too late for making offers
Too late for anything that anyone might say

I got open road ahead of me
And it goes as far as I can see

Once you had everything to teach me
Once I had everything to learn
Now you can stand beside me one more time
And watch these pretty bridges burn

And then you can take the high road
Way up there where every thing's so clear
And I will keep wandering around these back alleyways
I will try to find my own way out of here, try to find that

Open road ahead of me
'Cause it goes as far as I can see

And if the truth be told
I'd live my life that way
With an open road, nothing to hold
Nothing standing in my way

And I will leave this sweet new England
And I will leave these ghosts of you
I will climb onto that train
Find a seat that's got no view

And I will take what I need with me
I will not take what I don't
And I will say that I'll be back here
But I'll know that I won't

And I will live with empty pockets
And I will live with empty sleeves
I will know that there is nothing in this world
I cannot leave

And I will tell my friends I love them
I will hope that they know
That I need nobody beside me
On this open road

Make it happy ever
Make it happy ever
Happy ever day

Make it happy ever

So don't pin your hopes on me
Do not try to tie me tree to tree

I make such a bad clothesline
I would not pin nothing on me
'Cause when you come back for it
You might find it's gone in the breeze

And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
What else you expected me to say
'Cause I know you know, I told you long ago
That it would always be this way

I'm not a good lighthouse
'Cause I don't always shine
I make a safe shore so hard to find

I make a really bad anchor
Just like I told you so
Because I tend to get dragged
And then I tend to let go

And I make a really good lover
When there's a clear path to the door
Make a really good listener
When I can't talk no more

I make a really good friend
When there's an end in sight
I make a really good wrong to your right

You say I live like I'm on ice skates
Going down a frozen hill
I say, ?Baby, it has always been like that
Maybe it always will?

And when I said that to you
I did not mean to cause you pain
But you can go ahead and blame me
Like you blame the weatherman for the rain

And I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
What else you expected me to say
'Cause I know you know, I told you long ago
That it would always be this way, yea

Just like I said I would
Full of holes and I do not stay put

Both be soaking wet, both be soaking wet

I think we're gonna be soaking wet

You're the only one who's never seen
The way I can light up in shades of gold and green
I'm just a little firefly, I want to shine for you but I'm too shy
So when you come around I hide my light
But when you go away I shine for you all night

All night, all night, when I shine for you all night
All night, all night, when I shine for you

Out there in the sun, I'd open up for anyone
You're the only one who closes me
Because I want to be the brightest thing you've ever seen
I'm just a little dandelion, I want to blossom but I'm scared of trying
I hide my head when you come into the room
When you go away I come right into bloom
And I can't look down, because I'm way too high
I can't look up, into your eyes

Well I never was afraid to sing out loud
In front of anybody, any crowd
You make me lose my nerve
Feel like something more than I could ever deserve
I'm just a little hummingbird, I want to sing but I can't find the words
So when you come around I just go still
But after you move on, when I know you're gone
I sing for you the way I always will

Lay me low, lay me low in your old way

It?s a wrecking ball afternoon, leave everything where it fell
And the things that were said
Still ring in your head

you'd give anything to be wrong
But there's no turning back, too late?s come and gone

Now it?s Somerville Avenue rain and the night?s coming down
And you're looking for someone to blame in an innocent town
On the road all alone
Getting further from home

Every step that you take feels so long
But there's no turning back, too late?s come and gone

I remember the light in your eyes put the neon to shame
And the smoke hidden deep in your throat when you'd whisper my name
Oh, the road is so rough
It?s all been enough

I got no idea how we go on
But there's no turning back, too late?s come and gone

The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone

Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home
Standin' in the corner Casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by

Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

To provide her with material possessions.
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone.

And the silhouette was seen for miles around.

Though they shared a common bed, there was precious little said,
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'.
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms he'd yet to build,
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.

And he traced it to her door and turned the handle.
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room,
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.

And my only set of clothes was gettin' closer to the bone

And I can see it's time for me to make my last request
Won't you fill my grave with whiskey when I'm laid away to rest
So the boys can say I drank myself to dead

When the mornin' came, her tears had changed to laughter
And before the night her heart beat close to mine
And I thought as she lay sleeping all the secrets she was keepin'
Hidden somewhere in the silence of the shadows of her mind

That I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first, and watched a small kid cussin' at a can 
That he was kickin'
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell 
Of someone fryin'chickin
And it took me back to somethin' that I had lost somehow, 
Somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishin' Lord that I was stoned
Cause there is something in a Sunday, makes a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy, 
With 'w(?)' laughin' little girl who he was swingin'
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,
And listened to a song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams 
Of yesterday

[Chorus] 
On the Sunday morning sidewalk, wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there is something in a Sunday, make a body feel alone
And there is nothing short of die'n, half a lonesome as the sound
On the sleepin' city sidewalks, Sunday morning coming do",Sunday Morning Coming Down,1970
Kris Kristofferson,"A couple of years back I come across a great and wasted friend of mine in the hallway of a recording studio.  And while he was reciting some poetry to me that he had written, I saw that he was about a step away from dying, and I couldn't help but wonder why.  And the lines of this song occurred to me.  I'm happy to say he's no longer wasted, and he's got him a good woman.  And I'd like to dedicate this to John and June, who helped showed me how to beat the devil.

It was wintertime in Nashville
Down on Music City Row
And I was looking for a place
And to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
Keep the chilly wind off my guitar
My thirsty wanted whiskey
But my hunger needed beans
But it had been a month of paydays
Since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty
And a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually I'd guess you'd call it a tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling
And sawdust on the floor
Friendly shadows
I saw that there was just one old man sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
And he turned and said,
Come up here, boy, and show us what you are
I said I'm dry, and he bought me a beer
He nodded at my guitar and said,
It's a tough life, ain't it?
I just looked at him
He said, you ain't making any money, are you?
I said, you been reading my mail
He just smiled and said, let me see that guitar
I got something you ought to hear
And then he laid it on me

If you waste your time a talking 
To the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying
Who do you thinks gonna hear?
And if you should die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Who do you thinks gonna care?
There were other lonely singers
In a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
‚ÄòCause the truth remains that no one wants to know

Well the old man was a stranger
But I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out
On the wrong side of the door
When no one stood behind me
But my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
If you don't want to join him
You gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil
But I drank his beer for nothing
Then I stole his song

And you still can hear me singing
To the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying
Praying someone's gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how
The things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing
Hoping someone's gonna care
I was born a lonely singer
And I'm bound to die the same
But I've gotta feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel
I won't ever die ashamed
‚ÄòCause I don't believe that no one wants to know",To Beat the Devil,1970
Kris Kristofferson,"The clubs are all closed and the ladies are leaving,
There's nobody nobody knows on the street;
A few stranded souls standing cold at the station,
An nowhere to go but to bed and to sleep.

Now that you're here, ain't you
Proud of your peers

That you've thrown it away for a song'
Boy, you've sure come a long way from home.

Kris Kristofferson,"I have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
Aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
Turning on the world, the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
 
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together
With a feeling that I'd never known before in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
I don't know the answer to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
But dreaming was as easy as believing it was never gonna end
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
 
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I""ve been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we had to spend
",Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again),1971
Kris Kristofferson,"See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans,
Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style
And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
Searchin' for a shrine he's never found
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down

He's a poet, he's a picker
He's a prophet, he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
And all he ever gets is older and around
>from the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
The goin' up was worth the comin' down

He's a prophet, he's a pusher
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned

Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.","The Pilgrim, Chapter 33",1971
Kris Kristofferson,"Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walking down
The stairway to the subway in the shadows down below;
Following their footsteps through the neon-darkened corridors
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul.
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dying
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain.
But casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clickin' of the turnstiles and the rattle of his chains.

Oh! she said, casey it's been so long since I've seen you!
Here she said, just a kiss to make a body smile!
See she said, I've put on new stockings just to please you!
Lord! she said, casey can you only stay a while? 

Casey leaves the under-ground and stops inside the golden crown
For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bone.
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for any thing they can to keep from goin' home.
Standin' in the corner casey drinks his pint of bitter
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
Then he stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly, or the tear that's in his eye.

Oh! she said, I suppose you seldom think about me,
Now she said, now that you've a fam'ly of your own;
Still she said, it's so blessed good to feel your body!

Grieving together
Sharing the blame.
But when she was dying
Lord, we let her down.
There's no use cryin'

The party's all over
Drink up and go home.
It's too late to love her
And leave her alone.

But he don't pray to be no Christian soldier anymore

And she wasn't good at conversation when we were alone
But she had a way of making me believe that I belonged

She seemed to be so proud of me just walking holding hands
And she didn't think that money was the measure of a man
And we seemed to fit together when I held her in my arms
And it left me feelin' warm, when I loved her.

And a cross He never made

And He's sadder than He's wiser,
And a longer way from home,
And He wonders why His Father,
Left Him bleeding and alone.

Because, you know, it never was too far from love to make believe
And I'll be leavin', if it's all the same to you

It's hard to lead a friend in need of somethin' hard to face
'Cause simple truth ain't simple when it's sad
And misery loves company, but, Lord, it's such a waste
To go on throwin' good love after bad

Yes, I'll be leavin', 'cause it's all the same to you",If It's All the Same to You,1975
Kris Kristofferson,"It started when the neighbors saw my fancy new T.V
That opens up the gate outside my home
And let's me let in anyone I really want to see
And keep out all them other dudes I don't

Then one by one they started comin' over to perform
And someone played ""Temptation"" on kazoo
Nellie got as naked as the day that she was born
And it sure was all over Baby Blue

[Chorus:]
I've got electric eyes, two big dogs, and a mine-field
And miles and miles, and miles of barbed-wire fence
But the biggest show in town is in my driveway
And we ain't had a good night sleepin' since

Orville Baker's showin' us the fastest draw in town
Cora Lee's clackin' on her spoons
Ol' Jesse's trick dog sure does look dead lyin' on the ground
And Jesse's wife is a-howlin' at the moon

Charly's ugly daughter sure can tap dance
Mable Thatcher's walkin' on her hands
And just as I was leavin' for the kitchen for a snack
Ol' Lulla Bell amazed us with her fans

[Chorus]

Froney's got an act that's hard to follow
Norman plays a nimble tamborine
You should see what Sara Lee can swallow
And ol' Billy does a wicked ""Mr. Clean""

Good Lord, if I'd've known this future when I started
Believe you me, I'd never change a thing
I got a closed circuit circus in my bedroom
And a world full of whackos in the wings
Get 'em Burt!

Kris Kristofferson,"Silver was a rounder with a wicked reputation
Music was his magic and his madness rolled in one
It's said he charmed the fairest hearts of this world's fairest maidens
Quick as silver mercury and slippery as a song

Winding like a river through a thirsty world of strangers
Carving out a legend in a dream-forsaken land
Silver took his pleasures just as freely as he gave them
'Cause hungry eyes weren't quick enough for Silver's flashing hands

Then, once upon escaping from the world of silk and shadows
Sudden growin' sicker of the secrets and the shame
He stumbled onto something real that beckoned like a candle
And never lookin' backwards, he surrendered to the flame

[Chorus:]
Because Hunger, is the surface of a darkened pool of sadness
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness
Sacred as the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul

Silver moved instinctively within her soft defenses
Soon unfolding mysteries he'd never seen before
And wakening an ancient need, she slipped inside his senses
And Silver took it easy as the closing of a door

Then soon he touched the secret fears she'd hidden with her sorrows
Darker than her raven hair and deeper than her eyes
And dared to try to lead her to the sunlight from her shadows
Following the line between her laughter and her lies

But Silver left his magic with the legend he'd abandoned
Love had stripped him naked of illusion and it's charms
Then one long night her changing mind took kindly to a stranger
And morning found her moving in the golden stranger's arms

[Chorus]

Silver stared in silence at the tangled scene before him
Time was burning frozen in the oceans of his eyes
And sadly turning backwards to the world that he'd forsaken
He donned the shining mantle of deception and disguise

Slowly, with the patience born of silent desperation
Silver worked his way into the darkness of her mind
Weaving through her conscience like a chance she might have taken
Sadder than the shadows of the love she'll never find

And Silver's spell was stronger than the softly smiling stranger
Whose star was burning smaller in the naked light of day
And Silver took her hand again, a wiser man, but sadder
Ready for the stranger who would steal her love away

Because Hunger, is the surface of a darkened pool of sadness
Silver pale reflection of a deeper need below
Mystery and magic are the holy forms of madness
Sworn to free the ecstasy that slumbers in your soul",Silver (The Hunger),1975

Life is a promise nobody keeps, lay yourself down girl, rock me to sleep

We were the wild ones, proud in our prime, me and the stallion Lord, one of a kind
See how we run Lord, see how we fall, ridin' for moonlight we done it all
Well the daylight was dyin' rooks in the wind, she stood before me, stripped to the skin

Next to my stallion she purely shown, glidin' the moonlight, starlight and stone
The moonlight is silver, starlight is cold waking to laughter, shaking my soul
She was running my stallion, naked and free, ridin' for moonlight, gone like the dream

Well I don't give a damn when I choose to, no it don't hurt so bad when you're high

It's the fly she seeks
You may be her lover but you never will recover
'Cause she ain't had a bite for weeks
You think your the same, 'cause you got the same name
But the widow has a mobile home
Remember what I told you, she got eight arms to hold you
And she's never gonna let your roam
She'll tuck in your head, then she'll wrap you as a midnight snack
So if you see a spider, don't you slide up beside her
Why'd you think the widow's wearin' black?
Queen bee, baby
Pray that you may be left on your own, uh huh
Nothin' she'll give you, gonna outlive you
But the queen bee's never gonna be alone
Long before Atlantis there has been a praying mantis
And you knows why he's on his knees
He may have religion but but he's just a sittin' pigeon
If a woman even stars to tease
He won't even quibble if she has a little nibble on his neck, what a way to go
And now you done and torn it!
You been messin' with a hornet
She's a blue-blood wasp, you know
And just as you do it
She'll inject yiu with a fluid that you ain't even got but none
You're the meat on the plate, not even first rate
She's gonna feed you to her seventh son
The queen bee's story, is the power and the glory
Of the women who have ruled alone
Little Nefertiti used to consummate a treaty
In the bad as much as on the throne
Everyone was urgin' Queen Elizabeth the virgin,
Just to try a man but she'd refuse.
Queen Isabella was the one who said
This fella named Columbus ought to take a cruise
Didn't Cleopatra try to gratify and satisfy
The men she held within the grasp?
The pyramids where shakin' from the peace that she was makin'
But she ended with a stupid asp
The queen bee, no way, and even tho' they think they're the kings
(escatological things)
Who are they foolin'? Playin' at rulin'
It's the queen behind the scene who pulls the strings
So, in conclusion, it's an optical illusion
If you think that we're the weaker race
Men got the muscle, but the ladies got the hustle
And the truth is staring in your face
The mother bear stalks, and the queen of the hawks
Is the one who brings home the bread.
The lion that is regal, and the bald headed eagle
Need a woman just to keep them fed
But come the evenin', we're like adam and his eve,
Inside the garden. hear the serpent's song?
It's so frustratin', when you're really into martin'
And there ain't a lovin' man around

Throw out the glory
Bring in the men (give me them an I'll swing)
Write me a sequel

Honey, don't feel lonesome if you do
But if you wanna make a young man happy one more time
I'd sure like to spend the night with you

Shut out the light and lead me
Somewhere - shut out the shadows, too
And while we lay there, makin' believe you love me
Stranger, could I believe in you

Maybe you got all you got together
Maybe you keep rollin' like a stone
Maybe some old lonesome song'll take you by surprise

It was simple then like the freedom when you fall
And we were smaller then, you see, but soon we gathered like a storm.
They don't understand what that thunder meant at all.
Was he crucified? Was he done in by the lawman?
Are you satisfied that he'll never ride again?

Squeeze a little pleasure from the gold love and glory
We can take it easy when we're old

We swang into the saddle sick as breathing
And slapped 'em once for pleasure with the reins
The horses snorted frosty in the moonlight
Somethin' dark was singing in my veins older than the voices in my brain
He said this place you're gonna see is why they live and breathe
And sink down a little bit deeper everyday
And sometimes at night when the wind is running right
You can hear it suckin' thirty miles away
Then the light was crimson and I found her all naked and eternal and insane
Secred as the mysteries around her like a veil nothin' but her prison was profane
All we had in common was our chains
Oh burn it down boys burn it to the ground boys burn it on down
Feet hit the ground feet leavin' town quicker than a bullet or a knife

Kris Kristofferson,"When I look out over a green field of clover 
Or watch the sun set at the end of the day 
I get kind of moody when I see such beauty 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 
When I see a fountain flow from a mountain 
Or see April showers bring flowers to May 
I can't help but ponder; life is such a wonder 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way 

When I see the clouds form a black summer windstorm 
That uproots the harvest and hurls it away 
In the midst of such anger, destruction and danger 
The storm's even beautiful in its own way 

When I see leaves drop off from the treetop 
Or see the snow fall on a cold winter's day 
My thoughts seem to wander into the blue yonder 
God made all things beautiful in their own way 

Words can't describe what I feel inside 
When I see the beauty in each coming day 
What my eyes behold can't be bought or sold 
And everything's beautiful in its own way, in its own way, in its own way",Everything's Beautiful (In Its Own Way),1982

Although you're with somebody new 
Thought I'd drop a line to say 
That I wish this happy day 
Would find me beside you

Seems like years ago we met 
On a day I can't forget 
Cause that's when we fell in love 

Do you remember 
The names we had for each other 
I was your pretty 
You were my baby 
Oh, how could we say goodbye

Then suddenly I realize, I only hold a pillow
You're not there, you're not there

I call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
To return alone confirming all I've known for so long
I'm alone you're still gone

Still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
My footsteps match my heartbeats, funny heartbeats on linoleum
The sounds all wrong you're still gone

The sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
And understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
You're on your own all alone, she's still gone

Kris Kristofferson,"She would meet me in the mornin' on my way down to the river,
Waiting patient by the China Berry tree;
With her feet already dusty from the pathway to the levee,
And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees.
I'd pay her no attention as she tagged along beside me,
Trying hard to copy everything I did;
But I couldn't keep from smiling when I'd hear somebody saying:
""Look a-yonder; there goes Jody and the kid.""

After we grew older, we could still be seen together,
As we walked along the levee holding hands;
For as surely as the seasons, she was changin' to a woman,
And I'd lived enough to call myself a man.
And she often lay beside me, in the coolness of the evening,
'Til the morning sun was shining on my bed;
And at times, when she was sleeping,
I would smile when I'd remember,
How they used to call us ""Jody and the kid.""

Now, the world's a little older, and the years have changed the river,
'cause there's houses where they didn't used to be;
And on Sundays I go walking down the pathway to the levee,
With another little girl who follows me.
And it makes the old folks smile to see her tag along beside me,
Doing little things the way her Mamma did.
But it gets a little lonesome, when I hear somebody saying:

The kind of attention that she's never known
He's a helper, he'll help her
To open the doors that she can't on her own
He's a lover, he'll love her
In ways that she never has been loved before
And he's a getter, he'll get her
By gettin her into the world she's been hungerin' for

'cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted
Then he'll take off and leave her
Takin' all of her pride as he goes

Yes, he's a taker, he'll take her ...

He's a charmer, and he'll charm her
With money and manners that I never learned
He's a leader, and he'll lead her
Across pretty bridges he's planning to burn
He's a talker, he'll talk her
Right off of her feet, but he won't talk for long
Cause he's a doer, and he'll do her
The way that I never
And damned if he won't do her wrong
'cause he's a taker, he'll take her
To places and make her fly higher than she's ever dared to
He'll take his time before takin' advantage
Takin' her easy and slow
And after he's taken the body and soul
That she gives him, he'll take her for granted

Kris Kristofferson,"Billy Dee was seventeen when he turned twenty-one
Fooling with some foolish things he could've left alone
But he had to try to satisfy a thirst he couldn't name
Driven towards the darkness by the devil in his veins

Gettin' by on gettin' high on women, words and wine
Some folks called him crazy, Lord, and others called him free
But we just called us lucky for the love of Billy Dee

Busy goin' his own way and speakin' his own words
Facin' and forgettin' every warnin' that he heard
Makin' friends and takin' any crazy chance he could
Gettin' busted for the bad times and believin' in the good

Billy took a beatin' from a world, he meant no harm
The score was written in the scars up on his arm
Some felt he was payin' for the life he tried to lead
But all we felt was sorry for our good friend Billy Dee

It may be his soul was bigger than a body's oughta be
Singin' songs and bringin' laughter to the likes of you and me
'Cause the world he saw was sadder than the one he hoped to find
But it wasn't near as lonesome as the one he left behind

Yesterday they found him on the floor of his hotel
Reachin' towards the needle, Lord, that drove him down to Hell

But we all called it crucified when Billy Dee O.D.'d",Billy Dee,1992

Pushed me 'til I had to take his life

Along the coach roads I did ride
With sword and pistol by my side
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
But I am still alive

I was a sailor
I was born upon the tide
And with the sea I did abide
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
But I am living still

I was a dam builder
Across the river deep and wide
Where steel and water did collide
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
But I am still around
I'll always be around and around and around and around and around

I fly a starship
Across the Universe divide
And when I reach the other side
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain
But I will remain
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again",Highwayman,1993

""Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do.""

On weekends sellin' tobacco and beer
And his dreams of tomorrow, surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here

He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball, old Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the 7th when Custer went down

And Louis Lamour has told us his tale

To a bar called the Green Frog Cafe
There were old men with beer guts and dominos
Lying 'bout their lives while they'd played

And I was just a kid

And there's brown tobacco stains all down his chin
To me he's one of the heroes of this country

Kris Kristofferson,"I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern,
To buy me a bottle of beer.
And I sat me down by a tender young maiden,
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair.
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle,
For something un-foolish to say.
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows,
And smilingly stole her away.

I said: ""Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil.
""He's everything that I ain't.
""Hiding intentions of evil,
""Under the smile of a saint.
""All he's good for is getting in trouble,
""And shiftin' his share of the blame.
""And some people swear he's my double:
""And some even say we're the same.
""But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose,
""I'll only live 'til I die.
""We take our own chances and pay our own dues,
""The silver tongued devil and I.""

Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him,
She knew in her heart that he'd lied.
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her,
No matter how hard that she tried.
'Cause she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger,
Of somethin' that she's never known.
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger,
Who'll love her and leave her alone.

And you know, he's the devil.
He's everything that I ain't.
Hiding intentions of evil,
Under the smile of a saint.
All he's good for is getting in trouble,
And shiftin' his share of the blame.
And some people swear he's my double:
And some even say we're the same.
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose,
I'll only live 'til I die.

Ah ha ha ha.

Kris Kristofferson,"Lord, his Daddy was an honest man, just a red dirt Georgia farmer
His momma lived her short life having kids and baling hay
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander
So he hop a freight at Waycross and wound up in L.A.

Well the cold nights had no pity on that Waycross Georgia farm boy
Most days he went hungry, then the summer came
He met a girl known on the strip, San Francisco's Mabel Joy
Destitution's child born on an L.A. street called Shame

Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy
Laughter found their mornings to be the meaning to his life
Now the night before she left
Sleep came and left that Waycross country boy
With dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife

Sunday morning found him standing 'neath the red light at her door
A right cross sent him reeling put him face down on the floor
In place of Mabel Joy, he found a merchant mad marine
Growled, 'Your Georgia neck is red, Sonny you're still green'

So he turned twenty-one in a gray rock federal prison
That old judge had no mercy on that Waycross Georgia boy
Staring at those four gray walls in silence, learning, listen
Midnight freight he knew could take him back to Mabel Joy

Sunday morning found him lying 'neath the red light at her door
With a bullet in his side, he cried, ""Have you seen Mabel Joy?""
Stunned and shaken someone said, ""Son, she don't live here no more""
Nor she left this house four years today, they say she's looking for
Some Georgia farm boy

Kris Kristofferson,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile--
Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
Which he spent like they was goin' outta style--
And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
Searchin' for a shrine he's never found--
Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down--

He's a poet, he's a picker--
He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.

He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
And he's traded in tomorrow for today--
Runnin' from his devils, lord, and reachin' for the stars,
And losin' all he's loved along the way--
But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
And all he ever gets is older and around--

With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt

And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet for my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt

And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something that I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone

And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy with a laughing little girl who he was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song that they were singing

Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk

Kris Kristofferson,"Duvalier was a bitter man who cursed the morning sun
That brought a new betrayal every day.
He shunned the world of mortals and the sound of human tongues
And blessed the night that chased their sight away.
A disillusioned dreamer who would never love again
Who'd tried of it and found that it was rotten.
Preferring perfect strangers to the company of friends
Because strangers are so easily forgotten.

Oh, it's hard to keep believing when you know you've been deceived.
To face a lie and dare to try again, but there's nothing like a woman
With a spell of make believe to make a new believer of a man.
Duvalier took the fickle turns of fortune in his stride

Expecting next to nothing out of life.
Till fortune found a girl who fanned a flame he thought had died
Whose burning beauty cut him like a knife.
She touched him through the senses that his mind could not control.
Then smiling stepped aside and watched him fall.
Betrayed by his own body and the hunger in his soul
Duvalier was a dreamer after all.

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain
That's where we came from

Two boys playing in the burning sun
One with books, one with guns
Mama calls but just one comes
The other one runs

In a crystal sense of wrong and right
We were born and raised in black and white
One learned to pray, one loved to fight
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Brother took to the gospel road
Spent his whole live saving souls
When he looked at me his blood ran cold
He didn't even try

I had no dreams, I had no plans
But a gun felt good in my right hand
The warden asked, ‚ÄúHow come you killed that man‚Äù
I said, ‚ÄúI don't know why‚Äù

Welcome home said the hot moonlight
We were born and raised in black and white
One lives to pray, one prays for life
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Someone handed me a cigarette
They offered me my last request
I asked my mortal soul be blessed
By someone close to me

He came to me with trembling hands
He swore he'd never understand
I said it's just what life had planned
It's destiny

Don't waste your tears on me tonight
We were born and raised in black and white
I chose the dark, you chased the light
We were born and raised in black and white
We were born and raised in black and white

Makes some people go insane
While others quietly pray for rain

Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said

Kris Kristofferson,"Morning moves shadows, across the room with clothes scattered,
To a bed where two lovers lay entwined.
The one that he's tied to is the one that he's lied
To and his home and his family seldom cross his mind.

Love makes a fool of us all;
It makes liar, cheaters, and beggars that crawl;
Sometimes even the strongest will fall;
Look at us now, love makes a fool of us all

Dreams are forever, or just words in a letter,
When goodbye is all that they say.
She packs up a few things and slips out of her ring
And into the arms of a man twice her age

But, love makes a fool of us all;
It makes liar, cheaters, and beggars that crawl;
Sometimes even the strongest will fall;
Look at us now, love makes a fool of us all

For the San Jacinto line,
The desert is my brother,
My skin is cracked and dry
I was ridin' on a folk coach
And everything was fine,
'Till we took a shorter road
To save some time
The bandits only fired once,
They shot me in the chest
They may have wounded me but,
They'll never get the best
Of better men
'Cause I'll ride again

I am a river gambler,
I make a livin' dealin' cards
My clothes are smooth and honest,
My heart is cold and hard
I was shufflin' for some delta boys,
On a boat for New Orleans,
I was the greatest shark they'd ever seen
But the captain bumped a sandbar,
And an ace fell from my sleeve
They threw me overboard,
As I swore I didn't cheat
But I could swim
And I'll ride again

I make a livin' off the land,
I ride a John Deere tractor,

The bank man says he likes me,
But there's nothin' he can do
He tells me that he's comin',
But the clouds are comin' too
He ain't my friend
And I'll ride again

I am an American Indian,
My tribe is Cherokee
My forefathers loved this land
They left it here for me
But the white man came with boats,
And trains and dirty factories,
An' poisoned my existence with his deeds
Nature is our mother,
We are suckling at her breast
And he who tries to beat her down,
Will lose her to the rest
They'll never win

There's a bum from down on Broadway and a few quite well-to-do's
Who have withdrawn from the rat race and committed to Parkview

There's a girl who cries above me, loud enough to wake the dead
They don't know what she has taken that has scrambled up her head
There's a writer and a singer who has tried and tried and tried
They just brought him in this morning, an attempted suicide
There are those that never made it, those that did but now are through
Some came of their own good choosing some committed to Parkview

They wake us about 6:30, just before the morning meal
While they're taking blood pressure, they ask us how we feel
And I always say ""Fantastic! There ain't nothing wrong with me.""

I went to bed late but I didn't think late would EFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP -  so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad 'cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8:00
Jumped in the shower and I know I was late
Stepped out put on my jeans and my uni'
And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined
But I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED
I ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS
Now I'm hopin to myself everything is cool
Standin on my block like a fool
But (1) I'm all alone and (2) the bus is gone
(3) if I miss school this weekend I'll be at home
Can somebody come real fast to my rescue

Thinkin I could chill 'til the time came around
And I did - HE DID - but a little too long
Cause when I woke up yo the bus was gone
I almost broke my neck, tryin to get out the door
And I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore
On the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up
I guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck
Cause I lost my lunch money, book bag busted
Scuffed up my sneakers and I'm really disgusted
And when I got to school it was the same old thing
Stepped in the class and the school bell rang
It was nothin I could do, I tried to explain
But the teacher treated me like I was playin a game

He goes to sleep with a head full of anger
And wakes up involved in a child's gang banger

I'm talkin' about a tisket, a  tasket
Not knowing next day he'll be laying in the casket
So what you think of that, son?
In the arcade they playin', the games ain't fun

Something like Pac-man
Same name but the game as you put it in the sack
And running to the next board
And gat down the fools standing in the way of the door

There's no board and no points
And in this game, then he saw Pac-man wants
The game that goes for always blowin'
Then you'll slip up and they'll smoke you

Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame

None of this exist with the word peace
(Brother)
You gotta do more than two fingers, man, please
Get a game that they gotta go by
Instead of 'Watch out quick, I send him to the sky'

There ain't nothing to be playin' with
So listen what I give and what I be sayin', kid
Take it from a kid's point of view
'Cause on my way to school, I'll be watching you

Big, big daddy in his caddy with all of his boys
It only had weeks, it's a joy
That's the first part, second part has havin' hard
But when you get count, you know how to restart

You gotta know how to watch your back
'Cause if you're slack, huh, you're going in the sack
I advise y'all all watch out or the game
'Cause the game ain't nothin' but a

Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame
It's a shame, it's a shame, alright
Shame, it's a shame
Shame, it's a shame

Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party
Ooh, party, ah, party

I was at this club, this place called Roy's
I snuck in past my curfew trying hang with the big boys
There were hands swingin', people singin' and others on the wall
Disco lights blinkin' and people big and small

Security finally caught me, talkin' 'bout ""Son you're kinda young""
I said, ""Beat this Mr. Officer I'm just trying to have some fun""
Now on my way out, this girl said, ""Whuddup shorty?""
I broke away from the officer and then said, ""Girl, it's time to party""
You know

Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party

Next I went to a club to see what he said I was missin'
Snuck through the back door, it was like ""Yeah, I can get with this""
A whole bunch of cuties surrounded by a bunch of moles
With dreadlocks, bell bottoms and a couple wearing Afros

Now I was Krossed Out, totally fly to the T
Getting all the girlies then I got caught by security
He grabbed me up and said, ""Yo, I just kicked out your friend
And I don't want to see you and him around here ever again trying out""

Oh, party, ah, party
Oh, party, ah, party

Okay party people in the house
Yeah, part

One night we both decided that we would go together
Totally Krossed Out, into more Krossed Out leather
Now I was lookin' fly from head to toe
And all we both could think about was reaching the back door

We were lookin' diggy diggy doe ready to rock
You know?
But when got to the back door
Oh, the back door shouldn't have be locked

Now Kris was getting mad, but I had other thoughts
Of ways of getting in,
When I was getting caught
So we could

Kris Kross,"The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
I went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirt and some Khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, See
The bell rang and I got my dash
Feelin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No mom's trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride, ain't you da Mac I
says I am what I am that's who I be
And Ya'll should have seen how they were tryin' to get to me
Kool, cause dissin' them don't pay they're the reason why we are
who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Kris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's Alright

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one's that used to do the dirt done turn good
Lil kids tryin' to be like me, with the braids, the shades
Some pants like nike's gee
Ain't nothin' mo better than a letter sayin'
I'm your number one fan, can you write me back man
Yes I try not to pass on an autograph, I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood and ain't nobody
dissin' sayin' the nigga thinks he's too good
Cause, I'm down like four flat tires
Just a til nappy headed kid from the briar showin'
I can do right and not do wrong
Representing the Bee Gee's comin' up strong
and we ain't got no love for the other side, we only live this that
love us back right.

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast, cause I'm always on
the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know really doe the pressure it is for some kids
tryin' to make it in this here biz
Early morning interviews, then we step to school
Step from School, back to interviews
then it's on to other dues
So warm it up Kris, I said warm it up Kris
That's what I was born to do

Now throw your hands in the air and wave 'em from side to side if
the feelin' that ya feelin' is a feelin' that's right
See I ain't come out wack, I came out right
Unlike those moes that chose to pass the mic
It's the Daddy Mac, Big Baby everything is real
but you want to want to diss because
A nigga sold a couple of mil
Look here
You can't say nothing if you're last in the line
So when ya diss it just let's me know I'm on your mind
And it's Alright",Alright,1993

Some funk for the trunk by this nigga named Kris 
See, I ain't into the game

I'm poppin' your thang til the party people swing 
Cause I'm a little rough neck 
Tiffy-tiffy tough neck 
Cause what gettin' 'nough respect

I'll be coming around the mountain when I come droppin' a bomb 
Creepin' up on those Romper Room suckas who wanna get some 
So feel the wrath of a brat with the Mac pack 
Walkin' away you're like the bottom of a door mat 
I didn't gain props cause I was a suckas daughter 
I had to earn them droppin' dynamite like Jimmy Walker 
I can pay Donny Mars in a sticky cage 
Give me 30-30 half-caliber half-gauge 
And if you don't know what I'm talkin' about 
Test me out 
We're in the big part of in The Last Boyscout 
Scopin' a needle is like a needle in a haystack 
Press the new rookie breakin' rims down like Shaq 
You think you're dealin' with a weak boy step back 
Cause I'm comin' up like a Veteran on a phat track 
I'm bein' all I wanna be so you tell Uncle Tom

Now no longer am I small
See got me a ballme of women, huh I keep 'em wall to wall
See cause mackin' ain't easy (easy)
But I had to do it, get into it, and plus they love to please me
Over age, never under
Wonder in the words of Aaliyah, Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number
So I takes 'em, shakes 'em, show 'em the ropes
Let 'em get a little taste and then they never let go
They say (Daddy Daddy), they call me, it gets major
Surprise visits and blowin' up my pager
Asking for favors that I don't do
That's for a nigga in love, all I'm doing is mackin' you

I push a drop-top Benz and a baseball cap (say what?)
I, keep the pad full of women, bad bodies in bikinis on deck
For when I wanna get wet
I tell Chris all the time I more of a mack than he is
And it's been this way since we was real little kids
I, got women saying 'baby tie me up'
I got 'em going to mall, shop and buying me stuff
Now with me it's like the old days ain't gone no where
A light skin-ded nigga with real long hair
Perm, corn rowed, individuals, afros
No matter what, I'm fresh head to toe
So who's the mack?, daddy mack
Seeing all the women in my stable watch my back
From these, player haters trying to salt my game
And snatch my hoes, it ain't a possible thing

You know what I mean?, ain't no need to bullshit
These niggas in love, You know what I mean?
Talking about how fast
There ain't no players, I'm drunk now, You know what I mean?
I'm kinda, (I know, I know), but I'm cool (I know)....
(The rest is unintelligeble to me)
You what I mean?

Now tell me who's the mack

Mr. Black, and we can do whatever
Flossin' in the Benz, decked out in the leather
Never slippin', just sippin' on this champagne
And I'll be spittin' pure game to this pretty young thing
My aim, to control
Mind, body and soul
Have her on the stroll bringing me the flow
Pimp stylin', stay smilin', profilin'
Presidential suite, gang of hoes sippin' Crystal-in'
Yeah we puffing real La
Laid back to the funk flows I prescribed
I could write a thesis on the dime pieces
Gotcha on her, didn't flaunt, when I grab your nieces

Cause niggas they don't know how to act

It's Monday night and I'm out
Chillin' with my girl, top down
500 SL pumpin' some sounds
Now me I'm in Versace from my head to toe
Lookin' for a place to go
So I can spend my dough
I found a spot, jumped out
My girl was hot, no doubt
And that was all I heard these bustas talkin' about
Now I ain't payin' no attention to this high school skit
And I ain't even tryin' to fight over this here dip
I kept walkin', but all they did was follow
Tryin' to flex
Talkin' about ym girls titties
And the jewels around my neck
Now I can feel a confrontation bout to jump on off
And I can see these little bustas
Tryin' to play me for soft
I heard ""stick up, stick up, get down and don't look up
Nigga give me all your money and your jewels cause you're stuck""
I said ""What?"" Fightin' back hit my mind
But it's a waste of time cause I ain't got my nine

So I can be the man
Fresh to def, twenty grand in a black sedan
Not knowin' I done had some homies watchin'
Steady clockin', plottin' to put da drop on me
Cause I'm flossin', hit the streets left and right
Sittin' swoll, lookin' for me a party that's tight
I heard somebody yell ""112"" that's the spot
So I hit the parking lot
Not thinkin' of gettin' got
Cause it's mack, players, pimps, and dips everywhere
But niggas don't know how to act and they don't care
I heard ""freeze"" from these four niggas
That I knew, that I knew from back in grade school
I said ""What's up?""
He said ""What's up?"" It's on
Give it all up and then he showed me his chrome
I said ""Homes, you ain't even gots to trip
Cause I ain't even tryin' to die over materialistics""

Y le digo, no me caen lose viejos rabos verdes

Me saluda con una sonrisa

Y me contenga una guerra
Y mi corazon se quiebra

Que humadera que nos viente ahogando

Me saca como reina

Kris Menace,"Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I got a chainsaw motor that's filled with rain, proof
When it sings like bach with eyes all bulging
When the pink sun drops the eyelids fold
While I'm in deep REM sleep or twilight zones
I take a freight elevator and press fast forward
I get to grind these teeth and beat through time
If I could bring things back they'd be that WILD

When I saw the future the Geeks were right

Egghead boys with thin white legs
They got modified features with software brains
But that's what the girls like, the geeks were right

When I saw the future the Geeks were right

Predator skills, chemical wars, plastic islands at sea
Watch what the humans ruin with machines

Eyeballs float in wet green grass
I'm in a chainsaw choir and dreams 
That bend that let me cut through time and stretch out bach
I make the dry eyes roll and wet eyes cross
While I'm in deep REM sleep or twilight zones 
I take the freight elevator and press fast forward
So I can grind these teeth and beat through time
If I could bring things back they'd be that wild

I only want to say
If there is a way
Take this cup away from me
For I don't want to taste its poison
Feel it burn me
I have changed

I'm not as sure, as when we started
Then, I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
Listen, surely I've exceeded expectations
Tried for three years, seems like thirty
Could you ask as much from any other man?

But if I die
See the saga through and do the things you ask of me,
Let them hate me, hit me, hurt me, nail me to their tree
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
I'd want to know, I'd want to know, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God
Want to see, I'd want to see, my God

Why I should die
Would I be more noticed than I ever was before?
Would the things I've said and done matter any more?
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
Have to see, I'd have to see, my Lord
If I die what will be my reward?
If I die what will be my reward?
Have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord
I'd have to know, I'd have to know, my Lord

Why should I die? Oh why should I die?
Can you show me now that I would not be killed in vain?
Show me just a little of your omnipresent brain
Show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die
You're far to keen and where and how, but not so hot on why

Alright, I'll die!
Just watch me die!
See how I die!
Then I was inspired
Now, I'm sad and tired
After all, I've tried for three years, seems like ninety
Why then am I scared to finish what I started
What you started, I didn't start it

But you hold every card

Kris Stephens,"Ay, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She want to hang with us, we want one thing
Just penetrating that throat dog
She choke on it like Smoke Dog
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefa'
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can pay to put a ""69""
And I know what time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean damn these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid, this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
Then never call back, I still fuck""
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds till' it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name because she married now

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then

She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kick it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watching just to see if the police coming
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was going back and forth with these flights
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her ""hurry up, meet me at the room""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
And my common sense neglected
And two months later next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
That's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested, damn!

When the lights go out and I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head oh
All of the things that I did back then
Oh when I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had oh
All of the things that I did back then

Wait, hold up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 3-0-5 had gave me high five
When I said I‚Äôm in hot pursuit
You said I won‚Äôt ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv'
But no freestyle I never do
You looking for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlooking every nigga that ain‚Äôt quite ready
To make it rain on you like about to break a levee
Hold up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain‚Äôt got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas
Fuck you and Mitt Romney
I‚Äôm grown now I‚Äôm on my own now
I‚Äôm po'ppin'
Change my phone now
When I get home now
I got o'ptions
Fast forward, wait is that you?
With them big old thighs after school?
And your 3 kids and 3 baby daddies
And car note that‚Äôs overdue? I know

Up on the Killbuck River edge

And his brother's his closest friend

And never saw him again

The shirt I'd sewn with my own hands
They found the basket I'd pack the biscuits,

I think I'll take up throwing stones
I think I'll cry until I'm finished

They tore down the cursed wall

The favorite snack 
Of Winnie the Pooh

I can't get enough
Of lots and lots of
Pots and pots of
Sticky licky stuff

Oh, what a sight
Oh, what a dream
Dive in the wonderful honeyful stream

Swimming in the honey
Swimming far and wide
Open up my mouth
And let the honey flow inside

Ooey and gooey and very sweet
Eat and eat
Then repeat

Suddenly I'm in a honey boat
It doesn't matter to where we float

Whooaaah!

'Cause everywhere is honey
There's a honey Pooh
He's just made of honey
So, I guess I'll eat him too

And I am what I eat
I must be made of honey

And forget who's wrong
Okay!
Why don't you stay, there's room for family in my court

So you'll come back, then.
Back?

What?! I just assumed that you would have to...
That I'll shove on the gloves, that's how your story ends?!
It does ! It's just like it was, except for we'll be best friends
So that's in your plan to force me back in a cage

Whoa, whoa! 
Don't get upset let's get back on the same page

Gee, thanks for coming up to see the place
And showing off your mastery of tact and grace, okay!
Run down the hill and spill my secrets, make a full report!
Bye-bye!

Wait!

'Cause life's too short

There it is! The door you'd love to slam in my face!
You did well there for a spell, but now you're back in the same place
Kick me out if you want, but I'm the only one who is
Not one hundred percent convinced the prophecy's you!

You can think whatever you want 'cause I don't care
You're a fool who married a stranger!

That is so unfair
I swear I'm through with taking your unshaking sisterly support! 
HAH! Life's too short!

To let you treat the people down there just as coldly as you always treated me

Life's too short!
To listen to a reckless fool who only ever sees the things she wants to see
You don't know
You have no idea

What I've been through
Because of you

Life's too short to even have you in it

I'm not part of the town, not born to be queen
Just somebody hopelessly in-between
She's the scholar, athlete, poet
I'm the screw up, don't I know it
But then who could ever compare
Of course they're gonna think I'm just the spare
Well, I won't care

So I'm the extra button on a coat
In case another one comes loose
But if I have to be a button
Why can't I be a button that's of use (oops)
I may lack style and I may lack grace
And once in a while I fall on my face
But this little button deserves a place in the sky
This button wants to fly

Wait, buttons can't fly, it doesn't make any sense

So I'm a rusty horseshoe hanging up
Over somebody's old barn door
And I'll be hanging there forever
Just wishing the horse had one leg more
And maybe I can't be the perfect one
And maybe I err on the side of fun
But horseshoes need a chance to run somewhere
This horseshoe is more than just a spare

Someday I'll find my thing
A thing that's all my own
That thing that makes me part of something
Not just all alone
If only all this feeling I have in my heart
Could mean something to someone, how I'd love to play that part

So I'm just the second-born sister
Who most of the town ignores
Like a button, like a horseshoe
Like a girl who's bad at metaphors

Maybe I don't have a magic touch
And maybe I don't have a talent as such
Just this heart with much too much to share
So I'll never be the heir

In and out, every breath divides
My eyes to your head, I can't go the distance
But when you go you take me in an instant

But in this life
I'll give it time
Cause it's always spinning up from behind
It'll be alright, it will be fine
'cause it's nothing more than an ordinary life

So I show you my sins, show me all your scars
As we settle in, it's written in the stars
Your watery eyes got me send me floating
And my weak heart is swimming with devotion

I'm wondering what your family does at that time of year
Love and joy and peace on Earth and tidings of good cheer
Do you have tradition things
For that time of year

Well, we hang up boughs of evergreen on every single doorway
Bake a giant cookie in the wavy shape of Norway
Go from door to door to door while singing with our choir

Hang up all your giant socks above an open fire
(That sounds safe)

So happy, merry yuletide carols, faithful friends are dear

Hi, shalom, happy solstice, fancy chandelier
I'm looking for tradition stuff
For that time of year

Well, we make our decorations out of flotsam and jetsam
Bake a yummy fruitcake, and you can't leave till you get some

(That went right through me)

Buy each other presents and then hide them very nimbly

Wait up for a chubby man to shimmy down your chimney
(Breaking and entering, ok on Christmas)

Oh, happy, merry, muletide barrels, faithful glass of cheer
Thanks for sharing what you do
At that time of year
Thank you

We knit scarves and sweaters and we wear our matching mittens
Don't forget the jammies that I knitted for my kittens
Eight nights in a row we light menorahs on our mantels

You cut down a tree and then you dress its corpse with candles

Long points of white turned the earth with sparkling hums.

The continents seemed a little fuzzy
As they throbbed in their green pattern.
I stretched my arms to their expanse,
So round, so bold,
So feeling and yet small.
Through this night I could fly
Past all wintery fences high,
Alone for miles around.

Am I too far above ground?
The motion pulled, so where‚Äôs too far?

My elbows leaned on the tile
I forgot there was tile for a while
And soaked in absence of time.
The steam gathered dew in mind.
So, light and dark spin their fight
Or agree to what they are
All at night outside my window",Dark Glass,

Kristen Lawrence,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door;
Only this, and nothing more.""

Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore,
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,
Nameless here forevermore.

And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me‚Äîfilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;
This it is, and nothing more.""

Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
""Sir,"" said I, ""or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you.""  Here I opened wide the door;‚Äî
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into the darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?""
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""
Merely this, and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before,
""Surely,"" said I, ""surely, that is something at my window lattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore;
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;
‚ÄòTis the wind, and nothing more.""

Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door;
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door,
Perched, and sat, and nothing more

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no craven,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly shore,
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore.
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""

Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as ""Nevermore.""

But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he fluttered;
Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before;
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""

Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bore,‚Äî
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
Of ‚ÄúNever‚Äînevermore.‚Äù

But the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking, ""Nevermore.""

Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore!

Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee‚Äîby these angels he hath sent thee
Respite‚Äîrespite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore!""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!‚Äîprophet still, if bird or devil!
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted‚Äî
On this home by horror haunted‚Äîtell me truly, I implore:
Is there‚Äîis there balm in Gilead?‚Äîtell me‚Äîtell me I implore!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore.""

""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil‚Äîprophet still, if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us‚Äîby that God we both adore‚Äî
Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore‚Äî
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore?
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore."" 

""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked, upstarting‚Äî
""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken!‚Äîquit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!""
Quoth the raven, ""Nevermore."" 

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming;
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws the shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted‚Äînevermore!",The Raven,2012

Drawn to wake me if I'm asleep

Who is very inspirational
He is very inspirational because of many things

I come in at 8:11
And he smiles and says: ""How are you?""
When he smiles and says: ""How are you?""
I could swear my heart grows wings!

So today at 8:11
I decided I should meet him
I decided I should meet him
In a proper formal way

So today at 8:11
When he smiled and said: ""How are you?""
I said: ""Fine, and my name‚Äôs Kristin,""
And he softly answered: ""Hey.""
And I said ""My name‚Äôs Kristin
And thank you for the extra foam...""

And he said his name was Taylor
Which provides the inspiration for this poem:

Taylor, the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy!
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

So I‚Äôd like to get my nerve up
To recite my poem musical
He would like the fact it‚Äôs musical
Because he plays guitar

So today at 8:11
Taylor told me he was playing
In a band down in the village
In the basement of a bar

And he smoothly flipped the lever
To prepare my double-latte
But for me he made it triple!
(And he didn‚Äôt think I knew)
But I saw him flip the lever
And for me he made it triple
And I knew that triple-latte meant
That Taylor loved me, too!

I said: ""What time are you playing?
And thank you for the extra skim...""
He said: ""Keep the $3.55,""
Because this triple latte was on him

Taylor, the latte boy
Bring me java, bring me joy!
Taylor, the latte boy
I love him, I love him, I love him

I used to be the kind of girl
Who‚Äôd run when love rushed toward her
'Til finally a voice whispered: ""Love can be yours
If you step up to the counter and order,""

Bring me java, bring me joy!

I love him, I love him, I love him

Who‚Äôd have thought that love
Could be so caffeinated?

I think of a place where there's love overflowing

I wish I was back there

Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back
Now that I have some direction
It sure would be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
Yet I've watched it glowing

Please don't make it hard to know

Tell us, should we try and stay
Or should we run away?
Or would it be better just to let things be?

Living here, in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy, oh
But it taught me to love

Fifty miles to go, and she was running low on faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind, and she didn't pay attention
She was going way too fast
Before she knew it she was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared
She threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
'Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
And save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat sleeping like a rock

She said, ""I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change

And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me

Somewhere over the rainbow bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow. Why then, oh, why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow why, oh, why can't I?",Over the Rainbow,2014
Kristin Chenoweth,"You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered
Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could
Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem for you the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years fighting back tears
Why can't the past just die?
Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say, ""Goodbye""
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try
No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say, ""Goodbye""
Help me say, ""Goodbye""",Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again,2014
Kristin Chenoweth,"My darling, while you sleep
All is well, we are friends and that's swell
But the truth is that I have a secret to tell
I love you
People say it's wrong, it's absurd
That a frog and a bird
Are in love, but I know in my heart
This was so meant to be
'Cause I love you so much
Too bad we can't touch
If we did you would die
And that would be such
A really big drag
If only we could could hug and could kiss
Be in heavenly bliss
But your lungs would explode
And you'd look just like this
As you'd hemorrhage and gag
Oh excuse me
Romeo, juliet
Were in love but I bet
It was nothing compared
To the feeling I get
Around you
You don't even know that I'm there
You don't see that I care
Could it be that for me
You're not even aware?
That I'm perfect for you?
'Cause I'm never-ever mean, never lie
And I'm sweeter than pie
And I'm thoughtful and gentle
And timid and shy
And tender and loving
And true
But darling, protect you I will
Don't worry, just chill
'Cause there isn't a bird that I wouldn't kill
For you
Can't you see
Oh, we were destined to be?
For we have love
Poisonous love
I know
Yes, I know
That you can't hold me (feel me close now)

Standing here
You're so near and yet so far (like a star)
Here we are
What to do (to do)

You're my romeo, I'm juliet

Argued with my mother too

Don't you wanna be evil like me?
Don't you wanna be mean?
Don't you wanna make mischief your daily routine?

Well you can spend your life attending to the poor
But when you're evil doing less is doing more

Don't you wanna be ruthless and rotten and mad?
Don't you wanna be very, very good at being bad?

I have tried my whole life long to do the worst I can
Clawed my way to victory
Built my master plan
Now the time has come my dear for you to take your place
Promise me you will try to be an absolute disgrace

Don't you wanna be evil like me?
Don't you wanna be cruel?
Don't you wanna be nasty and brutal and cool?

And when you grab that wand that's when your reign begins
Who wants an evil queen without a sack of sins?

Don't you wanna be heartless and hardin' as stone?
Don't you wanna be finger licking' evil to the bone?

This is not for us to ponder
This was preordained
You and I shall rule together
Freedom soon regain

Your baby's running faster
Count the times I left my clothes out
Count the tires one more time
Count the times I let the air out
That firepile's your home
And you're mine",Firepile,1994
