Chrystal Monee Hall,"A sleepless night in the city 
No peace and quiet's in the city 
It's hotter than the water from a boiler in the basement of hell 
In this low rent walk of broken down hotel 

Countin' the cracks on the ceiling 
Flat on my back and I'm feeling 
Lower than the roaches in the tunnels of the one and the nine 
And the clock says that I'm half past losing my mind 

Through the tick-tock-tick 
I can hear the faucet drip 
When the neighbors brawl 
I can hear them through the wall 
But I'm waiting 
I keep waiting 

Cause I want you 
I want you back again 
I can't remember when 
You and I were one 
And I want to 
I want to change your mind 
So I'm gonna bide my time 
Bearin' my misery 
Till you come to me 

High noon, same room, this is when it 
Gets so suffocating. The air sits 
Heavy like the weight of my regret forever letting you go 
And it don't matter whether the windows are open or closed 

There's a beep-beep-beep 
From the traffic in the street 
And a bang-bang-bang 
Like a hammer in my brain 
As I'm fading 
Going crazy 

Cause I want you 
I want you back again 
I can't remember when 
You and I were one 
And I want to 
I want to change your mind 
So I'm gonna bide my time 
Bearin' my misery 
Till you come to me 

Cause I want you 
I want you back again 
I can't remember when 
You and I were one 
And I want to 
I want to change your mind 
So I'm gonna bide my time 
Bearin' my misery 
Till you come to me 

Hey 

Just you wait and see 
You'll come back to me 
Just you wait and see 
You'll come back to me 
Oh no no 
Just you wait and see 
You'll come back to me 
Baby, just you wait and see 
You'll come back to me",Till You Come to Me,2011
Chu Berry,"I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you
And ""I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!""
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming
I know I must be dreaming",A Ghost of a Chance,1993
Chu Berry,"We leave home expecting to find a blue bird,
Hoping ev'ry cloud will be silver lined.
But we all return as we live wo learn,
That we left our happiness behind.

When they sing you ""Look for the Silver Lining,""
It is silver dollars they're looking for.
You will find my friend that the rainbow's end,
Is somewhere around your kitchen door.

The bird with feathers of blue, is waiting for you,
Back in your own back yard,
You'll see your castle in Spain, through your window pane,
Back in your own back yard.
Oh you can go to the East go to the West,
But someday you'll come weary at heart back where you started from,
You'll find your happiness lies, right under your eyes,
Back in your own backyard.",Back in Your Own Backyard,1995
Chu Berry,"How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
Why do you try to make me feel so blue?
I've done nothing to you.
Do me right or else just let me be.
'Cause I can beat you doing what you're doing to me.
How come you do me like you do do do?
How come you do me like you do?
",How Come You Do Me Like You Do?,1995
Chu Berry,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 

Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me. 
Oh lady be good to me.","Oh, Lady Be Good",1995
Chu Berry,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for the very taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul",Body and Soul,1996
Chu Berry,"Love makes me treat you

The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you

There's nothing in this whole world too good
For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you
The way that I do
Gee baby, ain't I good to you","Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You",
Chu Berry,"So you're back at my door
The one you walked out
You made a mistake
You know that now
Will I let you in
You're begging me,""please""
What's in it for me

[Chorus]
What's in it for me
I've got to ask
If it's only more tears
Then I'll have to pass
If you'll open up
Then I can see
Deep in your heart
What's in it for me

Well,I have to admit
I'm glad that you're here
But I can't make the past
Just disappear
If you're back for good
I want you to be
Just let me know
What's in it for me

[Chorus]

Am I a fool
To think you've changed
Some people do
Is that so strange
Our love was good
It just got off track
Is it worth the risk
If you come back

[Chorus]",Monday at Minton's,1996
Chu Berry,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1996
Chu Berry,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds

Tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words",Too Marvelous for Words,1996

Chu Berry,"Listen to the melody entrancing
Blending in a soft and sweet refrain
As around the floor, dear, we are dancing
Swaying to a fascinating strain
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow
Strains of a mellow 'cello
When lights are low 
Dear, we're so close together I love you so 
Why think about the weather 
When lights are low 
Two hearts revealing
Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low
 
Listen how happy hearts are beating
Like the ocean beats upon the sand
And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
Ev'ry little movement of the band
 
Sweet music soft and mellow
Soothing and slow

When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep

To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step

For a boy so sweet and true
Gee, baby ain't I good to you

Bought you a fur coat for Christmas
Diamond ring
Big Cadillac car and everything
What makes me treat you
The way that I do

Chu Berry & His Jazz Ensemble,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunnyside of the Street,2011

Left all alone

Chubb Rock,"This is an introduction
To music that just be pumpin'
While hits just be dippin'
The intention is for humpin' the floor
Shinin' the wood with our jeans
If it's denim, don't worry
It's hip hop, don't hem 'em
Money earnin' concernin'
I'll be teachin' and learnin'
Gettin' hot from my rhymes and my looks
Not from bourbon
No solution, no remedy
No cure like a deodorant
Yo, you have to be sure
That if you talk up or walk up into myface
That wouldn't become a big public disgrace
'Cause I'll ban you, burn you up, and tan you
Treat you like the elephant
And man you will be hocked and locked in a jar with a lid
Hangin' on a wall in Michael Jackson's crib
'Cause I'm bad, in fact I'm a thriller
I drink milk, that's why I'm a top biller
Like a funeral home, I'll make a killing
I'm not Giz even though I'm still chillin'
Guys say I'm scary, girls say I'm cuddly
Rough like bark but dark and lovely
This ain't no game and I'm no toy
And like Anita Baker, I'll bring you joy
With my word when I open my mouth
Ask Oliver North to go and break south
A homo is a no-no but you know I'll smack a faggot
Boy, you got to see me, I'm rich like Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a loon and ya know, comin' soon
A rhyme kicked to this Popeye tune
This is hip hop with a little be-bop
And I won't flop 'cause I can't stop
I will mop up the slop and then go to the top
'Cause I'm not Robocop, I'm Chubb Rock

I'm Chubb Rock risin' and I'll break your leg
And I'm more than a forty ounce, I'm more like a keg
And I'm the big dipper, rippin' like Jack the Ripper
And if you want the proof, the proof is in my liquor
So you knew it and you blew it, let's get to it
Gonna run you over with a rhyme that's like a big Buick
And since you think you're slender, I'll slap you with a fender
And bind you up, wind you up, and grind you up in a blender
And then I'll serve you with coffee and cake
Oh damn, I should've had a V-8, oh well
I'll put you on a plate so it looks a little neater
You're a tramp, so I'll sprinkle salt and pepper
And paprika on your face, like mace
So you can taste immediately
Just like the base that went up your nose previously
So it seems you're too zooed to battle
Word's up chump, acne bump, skidaddle
You're a nine, I'm a ten
Victory is mine agai, this Bud's for me
So here, take a Heineken
With your self-esteem, you will never redeem
Like Martin Luther King, you have a dream
That maybe you will beat me, maybe defeat me
But you're too illiterate, so I won't consider it
Weak is the word and the rhyme is identical
This is not the late show
And I'm not Arsenio Hall
But quite tall with the gall
And I have magic and I can play ball
And guys won't boo this, girls will just screw this
It's ludicrous but we can dothis
'Cause you're new to this, Brutus
I'm so smooth that I'm the smoothest
I'm not handsome but I am the cutest you ever had
That's why I'm so glad that I'm so good I'm bad",Ya Bad Chubbs,1989

Chubb Rock,"[Verse One]
Now here comes the one on the scene to redeem, a dream
seen a couple of years ago when I was just a teen..ager
The need to come off at that particular time wasn't major
Now I have to wear a pager
on my waist just in case I have to go someplace
somewhere can't bear to be late, cause the race is on
for all with the ruffneck song
Even though they weren't born in the Caribbean like me
And others that were all brothers there's a lot in the pot
Floridian(?) Sibian(?) to be Divvian(?)
I waited for a few for mine, I knew the time was gonna come
You can bet I'ma collect the whole lump sum
of the green, the revenue, the ducats, the monies
is whatever you call it there's some complementary honies
I'm just the ultimate Don Juan nig-Jacabozi(?)
Never fell, I can spell, F-E-L-L like Yahtzee
For each I'm gonna reach and teach with the speech
If you riff, I'ma flip like Nadia Comaneci
Win the gold; the bronze is for Hans and Franz
I'm not (?) on no dirty hoes, I know the pros and cons
which will enable me to wear a cable
and collect large sums of funds
and here he - here comes - The One

[Verse Two]
Now here comes the man - the man that had the plan
that in one year he will gain a million fans
Heh - and if you map it out he did
accomplish and astonish, grabbin the hearts of every kid
Yes I've created a realistic mirage in my garage
that one day Chubb'll be large
Not large in the sense that I'll be immense
but my financial status and my pockets'll be the fattest around
with a boomin sound which bounds
to give Hitman Howie Tee a royal crown
on his head or his noggin I don't how be loggin(?)
or the simple sounds you hear in your Walkman when joggin
or toboggan down the hill with a few minutes to kill
You flipped in the tape you just barely escaped
that tree in your way you just realized that hey,
you have to be very careful of the tape that you play
If it's one of mine, you have to sit and relax
and max and prepare to hear funky tracks
and the lyrical storm cause when it rains it pours
into retail stores, a little comedic and yours
But you know, deep in the gut, the nut
was you-know-what, all over the cut
Yes we worked real hard to make it def and it was fun
And made it suitable to be ripped by - The One

[Verse Three]
The One - has the mentality of
an ignorant ruffneck, but then to get loved
is in my heart even though externally I rarely show it
I'm not the guy you want to go wit'
If there's beef, I'm the butcher that will go and settle it
I don't preach their rhetorhic
The One hates when you say he's number two
or number eight on the countdown - my sound
is unique, you sleep, you'll weap
You'll wreak of my words dangles in your cheeks
So spit em out now, read about thou - take our your camera
Take a flick of the man with the stamina
to get your girl Tabitha to have a crush on this
I don't use Nautilus - cause I don't pump no weights to get dates
The One is the only one
and I shall not have no other one but this one - word up!
Yo Howie, flick on the beat, show me where the rhyme at
and then the jam will kick like Timac(?)
Howie takes a style when he's developing my track
so you'll have the feeling of the flavor to buy that
so your audible appendages will be numb
And say, ""Where did hip-hop get 'em from?""
Long live the ANC, Walter Sisulu
from South Africa, Mr. Mandela you're the real one",The One,1991
Chubb Rock,"Extremeties excite pulses and in turn different entities
Won't break bread or split the peas
But in the soup the mixture of several racial groups
Minority troops flavors the broth of Wall Street suits
Armani or maybe Versace
Monetary gain can't stop the White House frolics
Judicial alcoholics
Cover up versions of death in the Persian
Now a right angle equals eighty degrees
The Haitians brought the AIDS disease -- NEGATIVE
The scapegoat becomes a raging rhinoceros
Bush is steady watching us
How can we kill their Asiatic crew
Ahh develop a harsh addictive brew
Flood their beighborhood and let their leaders debate it
Part one of the hatred

The sequel the birth of many Uncle Tom's
I myself I can't stay calm
I shake in Bensonhurst rest in Bedford-Stuy
School in Sheepshead Bay, move to strong LI
But my self inner-self breaks North
And like Moses I'm judged by the cloth
Of my heritage who will bring forth the people
In all people there lies that certain evil
The enemy within spreads to the next of kin
A baby's no longer cute, here comes David Duke
Bring a halt and with a wound sprinkle salt
To the black -- lock them in a St. Ide's vault
Burp up the progress, the agony, the pain
Put down the brew have a brain
The freedom ice is thin and we're the first ones to shake
Then comes the real hate

Why should you hate me?  What have I done?
We all have eight fingers and two thumbs
To feel the oppression so every studio session
I try to kick a positive lesson
U.S. coverups are neat like Tony Randall
Brotherly love is melting like a candle
Humanity without human beings
They even said Chubb was against Koreans
I just wanted to state the facts
It seems that no one is against Blacks
Uhh, what should we do?  Should we run?
Uhh, if we run we'll succumb
They're mad so don't you know they're scared of the dark so
And the dark so rule the bank so
So you know that they're mad so
This style developed by Shabba Ranks so
And with that I want to give thanks so
To the temperament of the strength of Miss Parks
But even now in the nineties we will spark and respark
The hatred",The Hatred,1992
Chubb Rock,"What you're trying to tell me G
If I walk down to the corner and shop I'm a goner
A Bodega is a no-no so where should I get my grub

You take me out and you might get some clout
Anger is driving around in a red Wrangler
Looking for all you black stranglers
To squeeze your reasoning try to find the answer
You try to rob you'll get a Jolly Rancher

Put away the gun son, run
for cover, seek sanctuary with your mother
Ahh my brother

My brother four times
Take the time to check the clock and don't smother
Other being when both are already fleeing
From the same oppression, the lesson
here has been ignored for many years and years
Fears has created many hostile years
Hoover sustained the first hate maneuver
Jiggaboo and now I have to also be afraid of you
Think like Brown or Franklin and be thanking
The one you pray to, they're after you too
Don't try to switch, they're not after no other
But us my brother

Mississippit Burning gets my stomach churning and yearning
I d on't care how much we're earning
Each year we dissipate in the air yeah
Change our line of thought put away the damn quart
of brew the intoxicated crew knew
We couldn't come hither if we're destroying our liver
So what should we do earn our little pittance
And act real ignorant just like the Buttmins
Put away our t hings and sing a different sound

Down down down you won't touch no other
Why not no other, my brother",My Brother,1992
Chubb Rock,"Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
with a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, ""What...
kind of music is this for you to dance to?""
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Or the vile and the nine; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
and ignore temptation, sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking
You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep
Jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it
And party people, sing it

Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
""Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
""I'm his number one fan, yes I am""
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all time; ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene
Always say hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star that's hollow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens - and plus naked
So we owe them, to pull out your pen
Sign an autograph; you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the man rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ev Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Well coming back
To nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene with a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, and definitely lead you right
Just treat me right

Not saying that I am, but I'm the jam
I'm going to kick a little not a Dr. Seuss riddle
No cats in hats, fox in some socks
But to the DJ jocks check your clocks
Half past what?  Time to bust nut
Not a pistachio; he uses a Casio keyboard
And a Tascam board
To kick in the P-50, get nifty
Born with the gift, time to get riffed
Not with the manufacturing of a spliff

Chubb is not a man to get souped like Campbell
I'm the man with the plan and my jam sells
Like a whore, in the store, hardcore and more
On the tour makin money you never saw
I don't like dreaming, never ever beam and
Never involved with girls like like scheming
Or skiing or toboggan sledding, cause I'm shredding
Any thoughts of a wedding, so Helen, Keller

I told her I loved her and then she did a solid
Did it real good like a nice girl should

She got all Vanessa Del Rio on me
But after she slept cause I had nothin' left
On the Martin Butler tip, yes half step

He said a damn crack fiend just went and took his mama's life
And now the kid's over there smoking the pipe
I said, ""Guilt will let him know what he did
and you don't need to go to jail, you're just a kid.
Give me the gun little G, just cool it down.
You've got a lot to live for you're college bound.""
And so he screams and cries, we start huggin
On the corner in Ft. Greene, we're buggin
Tears drip as we walk to the crib
And I'ma try to be there to comfort the kid
I woke up it's a brand new day
Little man blew himself away
And I'm scorned, an emotional thorn
And I'm lost in the storm

Well back in the hood, understood, I mean understand
The conspiracy upon the first man
Death to the Klan pump the fists that's connected
To the elbow joined by cartilage to the dark hand
And the plan to conserve this confused violent land
Different races, faces share the same spaces
Sewed by arrogant laces
Taste t his peace is real sweet
Extra reasoning seasoning to the weak
Will be done before the sun starts to nova
Or we'll be over
Reveal the passion button now hit it
Cause no one is born a bigot
Delete what you have engraved in your mind
And throw up the peace sign
And maybe be reborn or be lost in the storm

Well it's ninety-two we will make it to ninety-three
With no P-E, A-see-E
It won't happen so stop your damn finger tappin
Find the music of peace and start rappin
The answer lies in your hearts then your minds
And maybe then we can save human kind
Put away the guns and have fun was a strong motto in ninety-one
But a Woodstock ninety-two the many join the few to delete the racist crew
Without death cause that will be illogical
Peace will cover every newspaper article
So now then, where do we start
Everybody knows they have to play a part
Open your minds and clear your minds
And throw up the peace signs
Cause to scorn, be reborn, everybody let's be reborn
Or be lost in the storm",Lost in the Storm,1995

6 foot 3, 260 and change
?? ?? a little comedic and strange
Because we can have many friends, at least people that they call that
They use your brain but they're insane because I ignore that
No ego, cause I will be no, platinum big-headed rapper
that don't realize there's two directions on the ladder
You want to go 'head, walk straight, walk good
Don't blame your sales on retails, thinkin that the store should
think of reordering about five-hundred thousand
Just be glad of the success you had and you're arousin
Somebody's brain out there, your year's gonna come
You didn't live by the pipe or the gun to be like me
Waitin for my turn to burn
and get a million-five, and a tax return
that be reapin up, and no keeping up with the Jonses
Long live P.E. and ban Guns'n'Roses
New Kids on the Block, stick to pop
No more making black songs, wack songs please stop!

The Chubbster, a man that came out about 1986
with the help of Dr. Ice in the mix
And even then, kickin lyrics that was quite potent
Howie by my side, with his pesticide for the rodents
I'd flow - get on the mic and say, ""Yo one two""
Test and MC's start fessin
Jettin cause my weapon among the children was my gung-ho attitude
to use my tongue and lash and lick them up
then pick them up then just fix them up then mix them up with
a knowledgeable man that went to college and astonished
racist teachers with all the modern preachers
Crack beepers, yes knowledgeable preachers
but that didn't effect, The Chubbster
I'm from Brooklyn, so I have a little hustler
in my blood, when I kick the scam, they all will flock to it
Get my music and bop to it
Gassed my head but I was goin for my doctorate
or my Ph.D in P-A-I-D, see
I got into the business to get paid not sprayed
with BS which is an acronym for a much larger word
and if preferred, I'll say it
But then again; radio won't play it
cause they're cracking down on hip-hop
but it will not slow down or stop
Every year it creates a sellout tour
and this year has room for The Chubbster

Conceited I'm not, but convinced I am
Slam a jam that'll scare even the Son of Sam
In Sing-Sing he will sing simple songs to bring
tears to your eyes, because you deny he's a king
such as myself, cause myself is on his shelf
As for myself, I went for self cause myself needs financial
health and wealth like ki's for G's
cause cocaine ki's is for those who have morphine needs
Veins all ripped up, capillaries all stitched up
A grand a day, hey you slipped up
The Chubbster doesn't believe in the drug scene
Able to make me feel hip?  I'd rather wear Gabberdine's
My quarter fill will be my thrill
My Clyde's will collide with my grill, as for drugs that's nil
Not or no, cause Yo! MTV will never see me smokin rocks
and ban me from The Box with Disney
Cause drugs can't assist me or assist you
Blood on your tissue that's ill so chill
And when you come back you better come back even harder

chillin countin shillings livin it up is a must
A Benz is not needed to portray my wealth
A Jaguar is not a symbol for a star

Long live the ANC, Walter Sisulu
The rest of the people involved, the problem isn't solved yet
but you can bet..

I arrive from the steps of Sinai cause I'm fly
When you're high from the lye
You see me mingle in the sky
The dim light superceeds the street cock fight
Straight heterosex, but I still dig Van, ya dyke
From the mic flip, metronome time skip, who will high-ship
The Brooklyn base scholar and them niggas past Islip
And ooh-ooh, I curse you with that Fugee-la voodoo
Will do you like Italian deli kids slicing prosciutto
I barb you like Bobbito, the airport, right through Heathrow
Release murder niggas like Ito
Pure hatred, cause he picked who he picked to mate with
Then laced it, bourgeois player two-faced it
Hey revamp the swing to parlay
How black power went sour, where's Brother Jay?
Where's the 'pink Cadillacs protected by' whoever?
The red and the black, green, Hilfiger nigga
Indians want to protect the Lone Howling Chief
So kids create beef

Back in the days when we had nothin but beef
At the end you may lose nothin but teeth
That's fly
But nowadays ask kids
When they have beef, you might die
Why?

While niggas beef about this and biggedy-beef about that
I'm with my soldiers in the Rover, never sober, fuck that
Yo dun, I run with wild Crooklyn niggas with gats
Pigged-push wigs back on corner spots full of criggedy-crack
My niggas click back, kid, that's why we hold somethin
And break your punk ass down just like you stole somethin
When I rock with Chubb you block show me love
Nigga what, want beef, we drawin first blood

[ Krazy Drazy ]
Well, it's the riggedy-rhyme dropper, the hip-hopper, you know the name
I ciggedy-can't explain (why niggas beefin in the game)
You see, I niggedy-never get shocked when a nigga get wet
Tiggedy-talk that shit, I guess you're bound to get hit
The rap zone's now a war zone, we fight on sight
We wiggedy-wildin out, provin all these white folks right
We like some crabs in a barrel tryin to get on top

Well, when I first dropped the bait back in 1988
I couldn't wait to get straight and dominate state to state
Went to feud, bullshit evil, exterminatin flows
Check your grip, don't slip or get a dose on how it goes
Jealous niggas, gun triggers, fuckin up the game
But me you can't tame, an outlaw like Jesse James
We got east versus west, bullet-proof tef' vest
Who's the best? But let it rest, because there's no contest
Temptation, accusations need to stop

Now my man Common on wax slayin Ice Cube - anyway, that's cool
That nigga somewhere 'higher learnin'
And of course there's that famous beef between Parrish and Sermon
And that's cool, both those niggas killed Jane
And now there's Nice without Smooth - that's insane
And I heard they squashed that, and that shit should cease
Cause black mutha-uckas shouldn't beef

Whether you straight hit or you go strictly Dyke

And I point to the sister, and yes I can can

While, biblical words don't need to ra-hyme
I said, ""let there be a light,"" and there was light
And the breeze (?), like that kid who made ""I-ight""
But men took mad dominion, over men
Hard bondage with backs and, knees that must bend
But only in prayer, I make your head need ibuprof'/bayer
Call me, the number one player
But hey.. the one pharoahes, parlayed
In the land of egypt, when that slave shit behaved
Bythia(?) drew me, from the nile to smile on the people
After me there will be a sequel
And I'll praise my name, in the jam
Call me what you want, but I am what I am

Hehe, I live in the souls of men, and women
And pilgrims and children who wiggle, to the rhythm
Just go, the people have corrupted themselves
They toke the devil's smoke, puffing their l's
I'll send, my only son down, to bless you
And observe how you know him, and that will test you
Years, of sufferation, will burn the nation
With adultery, skirt-chasin and crotch-blazin
You never learn - look how many times I kilt ya
I burnt ya, I drowned ya, I froze ya
I stripped your land and destroyed ya culture
Next time you better give me some

Another quaalude, and she'll love me in the mornin

You can't bug, when you want to play real life cocoa
When you're ""down and out in beverly hills"" with oprah

Like Prince no shame for that past few Sheila's I've dated
Made it, with only one but I'm foreshadowing the rhyme
Like a nice Pirollo(?) wine, life takes time
I'm, one of two and to see it a one who's part of many
The quarters of my thoughts will cost more than a damn penny
Any debate we can correlate as to my release date
A nine-seven slate, New York state will have to check me
It's been some time since the break of the dawn

Well in the past black men used to work for (?)
My age group was plotting to obtain Dead Nixons
The plot, had three vectors for young prospectors
School, entertain, or become Hannibal Lectors
Stressors, used to stress the best, cess wine
But at that particular time I chose to use my mind
Goody too, size twelve shoe the Troy Ave grew
Waited 'til, after eighteen to introduce the brew
Downed the suds and gave a street buzz
High in the +Forrest+ but stupid is as, stupid does
And, that's all I have to say about that
Flipped a Pulitzer prize script and started rap
Simplistic at first, and the knowledge came later
Rob-ski, Dave Wit, and Swanny on the fader
The struggle was on but the fame was in sight
And the tunnel had a light that distinguished my life

[Chorus]

[Chubb Rock]
The low point was mad low when I lost James Los
Spent eighteen years livin next to this high-pro bro
And that's all I got to say, about that
While I give thanks to the man that my brother and I'm back
Onward, to the medals while the boys aged the mix
To the mental utopia, so walk past the six
And the rhyme and the flow, must stay real tight
Like it's always been in my li-I-ife, my life

Now toys are for boys, men don't need mattel
Objects to manipulate and sell
The women or the girls whichever name flip your curl
Acts for nonsense delivered by the boys of the world
But I!! i.. am.. totally ignorant to that type of pride
Yell, when your groin starts to rebel
Yo l, I told you that we would sell
Oversell to the point now, that the pockets, start to thicken
How in the world did women become chickens
Is it the, alize or the weed
Shredded on the tray, that make the queens flow this way?
Me, I don't need none of that.. type.. drama
No typical style, for the man who rules the genre
The opera, no choir boys, I'll direct your band
Change your tune for the man, and..

Ghetto curses, ends up in front of nurses
The yo-g male, the bourgeoise male
The two-car male and the male that needs mail
The woman start to, get empowered by alice walker
Waiting to inhale the fumes of the new yorker
Question - did you trust her, in front of pimps players
And hustlers, does she need a benz or a duster
End of question, start of answer, contradiction
Exhale, dangle in romance fiction
The love test, is like do you need to understand
Don't cram, you need a real man, and..

While the light gleams in her aspect
Does that mean respect, voiced by franklin, ignored by the inept
Baggy pants wearer, million man march bearer
All those who suffered through the agent orange era
Do we really maim the beautiful ones
The sons similak by anger, while the women get shunned
It's above me, another cop out, another rot out
Swapping +tears for fears+, while we +shout+ out
Past pain, that reverberates the claim
That the disrespect started when we, were in chains
Could be - but should be, it wouldn't be, if we

And even then, women must know which is which
When their groins itch, for the rich damn
There's a lot to try, to somehow understand
Boys will be boys, but find a real man and..

'Cause his skin was black and his mind was strong 

But we need to all stand together though 

And let the red, black and green show 

Become aware of yourself before it gets too late 

Another message from King Tee the great 



Chorus 



(Grand Puba) 

Yo bust it 

Hung wit the flip, got a ?dooby? wig 

Now she thinks she's all that shit, her man got zits 

Hon living lovely, Miss Gouchi 

Even got a Benz when she drives around wit all her friends 

Ugn, miss quick fast in a heedy 

Speedy, speedy, speedy, the bitch is greedy 

Spend so fast, she got caught wit 4 kids 

And the man caught a nice thick bitch 

Now the bitch is on skid 

Screaming how she hates her kids 

The move for the bitch is a thing quick and easy 

Think slick, she better get wit the wick 

'Cause foul, foul, foul is your style 

You tried to run the race but you lost by a mile 

See it everyday, it's the same old sorry song 

How long must this go on 



Chorus 



(Def Jef) 

Power now or never, together forever 

And ever, sever make it endever 

To enlight your brother when 

I recommend to extend a hand 

Expand it then wish strength to fend 

Black women and men from the white power structure 

They stucked ya in, stoled your culture and fuked ya 

And you gave birth to a nation 

You freelabel laid America's economic foundation 

Blood, sweat and tears and fear for years 

But now here was a peer to give you shift in the gears 

The turn of the tables, knowledge and ables 

Us to escape the sterotype wit the labels 

And years of classroom fables, fiction 

Fallacies all sorts and fabrications 

?For sarge? even fuss 

Star Spangled story, stigma and stunts 



Chorus 



(Chubb Rock) 

I know this 11 year old kid named Jeffery Cowen 

And knowing his father slowing 

And his mother is hoeing 

And now should he be growing 

He's too young to be sewing 

he should just chill and be flowing 

I know he was being malested and sold 

And his mom for being infected 

Never check it, so I invested 

My time and made sure little bro was looked at 

Pops got evicted, not a smack 

Pumped his fists and being that I'm a ?fugiless? 

The bum got done by the one 

And little Jeffery, no more tears left and drip 

Mixed wit seaman on his lip, emotional trip 

It confuses and bent ill thoughts 

In the soul of the youngster 

Is daddy a monster 

That raw creates lip songs and heartache pain 

Drys and open your eyes for the insane 



Chorus",Keep Control,2001
Chubb Rock,"""No one can do it better""

[Chubb Rock]
You see that black man over there, bring him here
You see the one with the blunt, put him in the front
cause it's time to prepare, some kind of strategy this year
It's only been about ten million months
that we were lost in the sauce 
but of course with the help of the boss
we prevail and now we're on this positive scale
But now it's time to take it one step further
Preferably without any obvious murders
If you don't ?? I don't give a shit
If you do it to a man of our shade
you definitely played, yourself and us
and then the heritage crust will be crushed to puss
cause of your lust that you must just bust
a man of your own kind, you must be blind
Archie Bunker and Joey's gonna snuff ya from behind
One day - cause we easy prey to get
It's not a threat place a bet recollect the terms met
many years ago that we're inferior
and inferior people shouldn't know they're really superior
And yo - it's time to listen, tick-tock, tick-tock
Comin from Chubb Rock so check the clock and organize!

[Malcolm X]
Anytime you look at yourself
Be you black, brown, red or yellow
A so-called negro
You are you represent a person
who poses, such a serious problem for America
because you're not wanted

	""No one can do it better""

[Chubb Rock]
If the battle of the races was a basketball game, who'd reign?
Look for the blacks we have
Strickland Ewing Magic course Jordan is the don
Isiah Dominique Barkley and Akeem Olujawon
For the whites Bird ?? McHale and Paxon
Shouldn't go any further you know it's gonna get wack son
But if the black players have an ego, and won't let go
the rock no matter how nice they are they're gonna flop
Look chop - in a sold-out capacity crowd
The upsets will be so loud
Yes teamwork, yes y'all teamwork
If a jerk wants to go for self he gets hurt, and now
Dinkins is the man, so Magic form the plan
Yo Strickland run the point, Jordan is the guard and
organize!

[Malcolm X]
So we are all black people, so-called negroes
Second-class citizens; ex-slaves
You are nothin but a ex-slave
You don't like to be told that - but what else are you?
You are ex-slaves you didn't come here on the Mayflower!

[Chubb Rock]
I shall not have no other one but this one
That is description now here's the full picture
Frame it, aim it, name it proclaim it
To be a Chubb Rock original.. ain't it, funny
That four years ago I wasn't making an inkling of money
Had to put four chicken wings on layaway
and had to come back the next day for the fried rice
The price you could let me chill with a quarter
but I oughta just order, a lettuce sandwich
with a large water, drink it down
until I can make up a Chubb Rock sound
that will end all this, then I take the risk
And if I fail I won't do a fishtail, in the abyss
That's a diss, I'm strivin not Drivin, Miss Daisy
and Patrick Swayze don't amaze me or faze me
Me look up to these stupid clowns - you're crazy!
My mama raised me on Mama Mabley
Dorothy Dandridge crossed an ill bridge
The media got involved into her shit
Gashed her grill and boggled up her wit
Took her name like a crook
And how long shall they kill our prophets
while we stand aside and look?
Here's the hook - open your eyes
and organize

[Malcolm X]
And we unite - on the basis of what we have in common
And what we have foremost in common is that enemy;
the white man; he's an enemy to all of us
I know some of you all think that some of them AREN'T enemies!",Organizer,2008
Chubb Rock,"Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock

The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, ""What...
Kind of music is this for you to dance to?""
The man with the plan and the man demands you

Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Or the vile and the nine; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation, sent by the nation

Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking

You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done

No time for sleep
Jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it

You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it
And party people, sing it

[Chorus]
Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
""Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
""I'm his number one fan, yes I am""
All these kids realize that I'm the man

Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on

Next to me at all time; ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene

Always say hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star that's hollow
'Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens - and plus naked

So we owe them, to pull out your pen
Sign an autograph; you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

[Chorus]

Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the man rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ev Lover, Dinky

Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace

And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

[Chorus]

Break

Well coming back
To nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene with a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic

Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
'Cause authority, seniority goes far

My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, and definitely lead you right
Just treat me right
Peace

Treat me right
Treat me right

Chubby Checker,"Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens...
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode...
He never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar like ringing a bell.

Go Go
Go Johnny Go
Go Go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineers used to see him sitting in the shade,
Playing to the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my that little country boy could play

His mama told him someday he would be a man,
And he would be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around
To hear him play his music when the sun go down
Maybe someday his name would be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight.",Johnny B. Goode,1963

Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine

Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore

Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Chucho Valdés,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1991

Porque el sufrir que me ha tocado lo he agotado

Bajo la tibia sensación de tu mirada
Entre palabras que yo sé que ya se han dicho
Que tú al decirlas me parecen renovadas

Cuánto me queda, yo no sé
Ni me interesa descubrirlo
Si es mucho o poco, no lo sé
Sólo me importa que ahora hallé
Lo que era todo mi delirio

Lo que me queda por vivir será en tus manos
Está en tu fe, está en tu ser, en tu sonrisa
Lo que me queda por vivir es sólo el tiempo
Que tú le puedas dedicar a nuestra dicha

Cuánto me queda, yo no sé
Ni me interesa descubrirlo
Si es mucho o poco, no lo sé
Sólo me importa que ahora hallé
Lo que era todo mi delirio

Lo que me queda por vivir será en tus manos
Está en tu fe, está en tu ser, en tu sonrisa
Lo que me queda por vivir es sólo el tiempo
Que tú le puedas dedicar a nuestra dicha

Lo que me queda por vivir es sólo el tiempo
Que tú le puedas dedicar a nuestra dicha

Chucho Valdés,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Chucho Valdés,"Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant for me
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality 
Let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverie

Chucho Valdés,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2003

Chucho Valdés,"Uno se despide 
Insensiblemente de pequeñas cosas

Lo mismo que un árbol 
Que en tiempo de otoño se queda sin hojas

Al fin la tristeza es la muerte lenta de las simples cosas 
Esas cosas simples que quedan doliendo en el corazón

Uno vuelve siempre a los viejos sitios donde amo la vida 
Y entonces comprende como están de ausentes las cosas queridas

Por eso muchacha no partas ahora soñando el regreso 
Que el amor es simple y a las cosas simples las devora el tiempo

Demorate a ti, en la luz solar de este medio día 
Donde encontraras con el pan al sol la mesa tendida

Como tu a mi me pides perdón y yo que ya estoy loca de amor yo voy y te perdono

Ni tan verdaderas tus verdades favoritas
No fueron tan callados aquellos silencios

Y habré la ventana que da al paraíso
Olvidame si puedes que yo no he podido

Sure enough, girl, that you wouldn't be true
Well, I can't stop myself, from singing this same old song

I love you, with a love so powerful
So powerful that it's wrong

I could tell myself, I don't want you any more, oh, baby
Then I turn around, and say goodbye, oh, baby
Walk straight on out the door
But you know I'll be back, on my bended knees
Before you can count to 10

Because I love you, with a love so powerful
Oh, so powerful, it's a sin

I guess I'm a prisoner ,and you got the key, baby
I know I'll never be happy, till you love me, and set me set me free
So, baby, try it my way, oh, and please
Don't make me wait too long

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

It proves to me I'm a loser again

I am bound with so many sweet memories of you
What more can a poor loser do ?

Chuck Berry,"When he was a child, just a baby boy
He wanted to play rock music and sing some songs of joy
When he started school, he just could pat his feet
The first song he ever learned had a strong boogie beat

Come on now
Rock it, rock it, rock it along
Roll it, roll it, roll it on
Git it, git it, git it on
Got it, got it, got it and gone

Then one day it happened, they hauled him off to war
Way over there in no man's land, just him and his guitar
Nobody near to love him, nobody ever sent him news
What could a poor boy do at night, but to sit down and sing them blues

Early one morning they called him, oh, what a beautiful day
They packed him in an old army plane and flew him back home to stay
He landed in Clark Air base, but didn't have no place to go
So he sit down with his guitar in the middle of the street and gave everybody a free show.



",Got It and Gone,
Chuck Berry,"Hello, I'm just a fan who had to call you on the phone
Someone you won't remember of the many that you own
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown

I know I'm only someone else in love with you in vain
I wish I could have helped myself, but love is so much pain
It makes me feel that there is still a chance that may remain
That you will someday surely come and give me love again

I knew your love would never be as deep as mine for you
And I knew that these many nights I'd be alone and blue
And lie awake while you forsake the only love I knew
And never learn that you'll return and we would live it through

Each time I dream a dream, I dream we're cuddled arm in arm
It seems you're looking straight at me, when I see you perform
Sometimes I think you see my face become so shy and warm
I often wonder if you know the power in your charms

Please, let me say I still love you before you hang the phone
And I am proud to once have shared the beauty that you own
I'm just a name within your past you met while all alone
Someone who shared a love with you and stayed behind unknown



",I'm Just a Name,
Chuck Berry,"I saw you when you came in this morning
All chummy with somebody new
And I was all alone this morning
In sorrrow still loving you

I know it shows, I'm broken hearted
This feelin' just won't go away
I've been so lonesome since we parted
And I'll be blue again in school today

Lonely school days do I have when you
Come to school with someone new
In my deepest sorrow over losing you
Lonely school days keep me blue

I saw you eating in the lunch room
Right where we used to sit and dine
With someone snugged up close beside you
Enjoying pleasures that were mine

You talk to them along the hallways
You walk with them to classes too
You leave and go with them of evenings
And I go home alone and blue



",Lonely School Days,
Chuck Berry,"When I build my home,
That I shall have some day;
It'll be like I want it
Oh - and I mean that in every way.

I have yet to see any
That would cope with the style -
Of the house that I dream of;
That I'll build after a while.

The roof of it will have peak lines,
And contours that dip;
And form shadowy eaves,
Where the little raindrops can drip.

... That sweet pitter patter,
Of raindrops at play -
Is such a beautiful sound
On a quiet gloomy day.

You know, when the wind is high,
And the storm gods race,
And I'll be snugged up
By my fire-place.

Maybe feeding my little dog,
Or playing with my little cat.
But unconsciously yearning,
And wonderin' where you're at.

But when the meadow is shadowed
By that old sinking sun;
And the roses are bowing
For the dew drops to come;

At my old upright piano,
With pure ivory keys,
I'll just plunk out some vibrations
Of whatever I please.

Sometimes it'll be classics,
Sometimes lullabies;
But mostly rock n' roll
- that I'll surely improvise.

And with my favourite guitar,
I'll be just strummin' away
And bidding goodbye,
To another beautiful day.

A portrait of my angel,
That I love most of all -
I'll have painted from a snapshot
Onto my bedroom wall.

Where the suns warm rays,
And the moon's cold beam
Will cast her reflection,
As I lay there and dream.

You know, I can't deny
- but it makes me so sad,
When I think that I've lost
All that I could have had.

It was best for her -
And I guess I, I know;
That she measured my love -
And then asked me to go.

Then Finally my house,
I will have it complete.
And I'll take up a smoke,
Sitting by the window sill.

And I'll read my many books
That I'll have in my bachelors nest;
While the sun goes drooping
- down in the west.

And I'll feel that gold,
Warm light on my face;
And then I'll start trippin'
To some far off place.

That through all of my travels,
I must have missed somewhere -
A place that I might find
My angel someday.

And I'll leave all that I have
To the gods, up above;
And go spend my life searching
For the angel, that I love.

For all of my dreams,
Would be but a souvenir;
Compared to the one
That I love so dear.

He goes to all the dances and they call him cha-cha King
He cha-cha's when the band is playin' rock and roll
He tries to keep in time but the beat leaves him cold

Because he's too pooped to pop, too old a soul

And every time his feet get to go in one way
Here comes a new dance and it's goin' to stray

Till a cramp caught his leg and he had to change his style

Tell it just like it is, every word.

Yeah! I was living in St. Louis
In the year of nineteen fifty five
Mama didn't have no great mansion,
Just a little old country dive.
Papa worked all week long,
Tryin' to keep us six kids alive.

So I hitch hiked to Chicago
Just to hear Muddy Waters play
I sat and listened to him sing
Until the early hours of day
I asked him what I could do to make it
And it was he who showed me the way

I went back home and wrote a song
And made a record I could claim
The little tune jumped on the charts
And rode me right on up to fame
It netted over ten thousand dollars
And added glory to my name

I was standing at the airport
With my guitar in my hand
And a first class ticket
Destination movie land
I will be in Hollywood, Mama
Before the roosters crow again

When I first started playing music
Over sixteen years ago
Every big town in the country
From St. Francisco to Baltimore
Trying to bring some happy hours
Doing the only thing I know

Can help it, but I love it

Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford

Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road
T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford
Jaguar setting on ninety nine
Tryin' to beat the Bird to the county line
Just a half-a-mile from Newtonville
There had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill
It said : ""35 miles, and stay in line""
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign

Chorus

Ludenville was a real small town
Had a hundred and two
And nine acres of ground
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise
Told him ""Park down in Newtonville
And catch 'em guys""
Sheriff laid down, half hid in the weeds
Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road
Said ""Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford""

Chorus

Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine
If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that county line
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat
But if he aimed to get 'em
He'd have to do more than that
Crest of the hill, he's about a mile behind
There wasn't but two mor miles to the county line

Chorus

Old Sheiff was countin' on the downward grade
With the tall wind pushin', he had it made
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed
And waved ""Goodbye, Jaguar"" and pulled in the lead
Jaguar said ""You ain't won the race yet""
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind
When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line

Slow down little Jaguar,
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford

 But what could I do?
 I couldn't stand and stare
 Or come and talk to you
 And it is always fair
 To formally be introduced?

That you were so lonely and blue

Chuck Berry,"A stranger lying on a bar room floor
Had drank so much he could drink no more
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain
To dream that he rode on that down bound train

The engine with blood was sweaty and damp
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans

The boiler was filled with lots of beer
The devil himself was the engineer
The passengers were most a motley crew
Some were foreigners and others he knew

Rich men and lost beggars in rags
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags

As the train rushed on at a terrible pace
Sulfuric fumes scorched their hands and face

Wider and wider the country grew
Faster and faster the engine flew
Louder and louder the thunder crashed
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed

Hotter and hotter the air became
Til' their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain
Then out of the din there came a yell
Ha ha, said the devil we're nearing home

Oh, how the passengers shrieked with pain
They go to Satan with this down bound train

The stranger awoke with an anguished cry
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high

He fell on his knees on the bar room floor
And prayed a prayer like never before
And the prayers and vows were not in vain
For he never rode that down bound train",Down Bound Train,1957

You, from the start never lifting
I fight it but it downs me

Fall will the night, still I wonder
If I'm the only or are you as lonely
Come home to me tomorrow

Why should the past so change, how you feel
Oh, but I ask you forgive, if you will
These lonely hours are so hard to bear
I don't deny that I was unfair

You paid enough to be gay
Who made me love you this way?
So give me the chance to renew our romance

Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear

Between a doctor and a lawyer man

She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match

Rounding third he was headed for home

Then I went into a dancing motion

And she danced with more devotion
When her cheek came close to mine
I could hear her softly whisper
She said ""Habla solo la langua de Ingles
Why no comprenda Espanol""

Chuck Berry,"It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C.
Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree
Hanging on a branch up under the sun
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne

Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive

Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me

An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge
Coming all the way from India on a local barge

Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den
But Jo Jo bet him ten bucks the elephant wins
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds

Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw

Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day
He couldn't understand how Leo got away

Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos
A hoot owl reported everything he saw
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw

Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground

Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize

Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds
Leo got back to the square of the fight
Jo Jo took a leap and jumped out of sight",Jo Jo Gunne,1959

Dancin' and hummin' a rock-roll melody

Who taught her how to judge and understand
Since she became a rock-roll music fan

Her daddy don't have to scold her, her mother can't hardly hold her

And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed, she screamed and yelled ""Hooray!""

Five thousand tongues were screaming ""More! More!""

Where we've never been before

Let's throw it on a weekend
We two, you two, no more
And lounge away a holiday
Like we've never done before

We'll bring the rounds and some jazzy sound
To play by a cozy fire
You two roast wieners and we'll toast the buns
And we'll chow till the night grows nighter

We'll call for you on the weekend

And ride out somewhere in the country air

Chuck Berry,"So few years ago her daddy held her in his arms
Snugged the blanket around her feet to help and keep 'em warm
When he kissed her tender cheek, oh, how her eyes would shine
His ev'ry dream was built around his daughter Caroline

He remembered ev'ry time she'd turn another year
And, at the birthday parties, when he'd shed a happy tear
Thinking of the wedding dress that she would wear someday
When he'd have to give his daughter Caroline away

He thought of what he saw the night they called her from the roll
A silver graduation ring and engagement ring of gold
It seems as tho' twas yesterday he met her valentine
And now she's grown and here to wed his daughter Caroline

Maarching on his arm she whispered, ""Pa, I still love you""
Those words remained within his ears when she vowed, ""I do""
Cheer was sparkling from his eyes, but tears were in behind
When he gave his heart away, his daughter Caroline



",His Daughter Caroline,1965
Chuck Berry,"You came a long way from St. Louis, you climbed the ladder of success,
I've seen the town and country cars that were parked out in front of your fancy address.
You came a long way from St. Louis, you broke a lotta hearts between,
I've seen a gang of gloomy gals who were doing alright till you came on the scene.
You came here from the middle west, and certainly impressed the population hereabouts.

Well, baby, I got news for you, I'm from Missouri too.
So naturally I got my doubts, you got 'em dropping by the wayside,
A feeling I ain't gonna know.

Chuck Berry,"It's you I'm in love with
It's not what you are
It's not how you treat me
Or your fancy car
But there's something about you
I keep yearning for
I, I do really love you

Just thinking about you
Gives me such a thrill
Let alone to be with you or know that I will
And know that I'll tremble
When I should be still
Um, um, I, I do really love you

Give me what I live for
Your sweet lips pressed to me
And transform this yearning into ecstasy
And send me, oh, send me - most humbly
Um, um, I, I do really love you

Chuck Berry,"Now darling, you should know
That I'm really, really in love with you
Although you don't belong to me, darling
My heart will always belong to you

There are many, many things all around me
That will always remind me of you
I know I'll never forget you darling
My heart will always belong to you

Since you've been gone, darling
Life for me has been so blue
I guess I'll have to go it alone
Because my heart will always belong to you

Although, although I cannot see you
I could never, never stop lovin' you
I just hope and pray you'll come back to me, darling
'Cause my heart will always belong to you

Or where to call you on the phone

And miss your love since you been gone

Said she was blue and oh so lonesome
And would I try to understand
I didn't know till this morning
How much my woman means to me

This morning when I got home, she was not there
I noticed her clothes were gone
And a little note lay on my shelf
Said as you read this, I love you still
But I'll be gone, I don't know where

Today I got the blues and I got 'em bad
Last night as I lay sleeping
My conscious will not go to rest
Yesterday I lost the best woman I ever had

It may be in a place I've never been
But I'm gonna find that fine woman

I got to go, push my pirough way down the bayou
They got a band up on the stand and a beautiful light show
Au revoir, Jean, dig the show from up on the plateau

In my pirough, with my Bordeaux, out on the bayou
Creeping along, singing a song, see'est, see'est bon, bon
Playing the music on my acoustic Spanish guitaro
Having a duet with my coquette out on the bayou

It's growing night, we've got no lights out on the bayou
Beautiful trip, think we'll sip some of my Bordeaux
Two more miles going wild to play my acoustic
See them stand to clap their hands to hear my music

One more mile, we rested awhile and sipped on some Bordeaux
While we's grooving, a fog was moving in on the bayou
On my knee, just couldn't see the front of my pirough
We didn't mind, we just reclined and sipped some more Bordeaux

Ay-ay, Jean, I missed the show up on the plateau

Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh, the engineers would see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by, they would stop and say
""Oh my that little country boy could play""

Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go

I's just a child when mother told me
It seems your father's gone away
It's not his fault, my child, forgive him
I should have known he would not stay
You're so much like him and he loves you
But now his love's for only you
Although he forced himself to leave you
Forgiving me he could not do

Rain eyes that cloud the hope of sunshine
When everything is seen through tears
The whole world seems as though it's crying
Rain eyes, that's how my world appears
It rains all evening into nighttime
Then rains all night and through the day
My mother's eyes are weak from crying
Forgive her, she just lost her way

Since you've been gone her eyes have clouded
And darkness reigns her weary view
She'd see again from your returning
That God knows she's in love with you
One rainy day in Louisiana
The trade winds blew the clouds away
A mother heard her boy shout, ""Father""
My God, 'tis him, he's come to stay

So we both decided to take a stroll

I would be waiting at the garden gate until you came fluttering by
Maybe you'd stop on a red rose top and then we could talk to each other
Oh, but we cou'd flutter up so much fun being in the garden together

But I'm just an ordinary guy and I love all the things you do
You seem such a talented, beautiful girl and I'm afraid to even talk to you
If I were as bold like some guys, hearin' them talk to each other
I'd come over and ask you if we could go out together

But if you were a Mercedes-Benz, I'd have to be a Fleetwood Brougham
And ev'ry time I saw you rollin' on the freeway I think I'd have to follow you home

I will wake up in the morning and do the same sweet things
Rockin' with the record that the same sweet people sing
All the clouds from the west go east, you confess it is spring

Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill
I want you to want you to love you of your own free will

Baby, you're so beautiful to want me here to stay
I would be here forever but I gotta die someday
But I will be lovin' you, baby, when I pass away

Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill
I will love you like a lover loves a lover always



",Oh What a Thrill,1979
Chuck Berry,"(Recitation)
Once in Persia reigned a king who upon his royal ring carved these words so true and wise
Which when held before his eyes gave him counsel at a glance of his life of changing chance
Solemn words and these are they: ""Even this shall pass away""

Trains of camels through the sand brought him gems from Samarkand
Fleets of galleys through the sea brought him pearls to match with thee
But he counted not his gain nor his treasure, mine or main
""What is wealth ?"", the king would say, ""Even this shall pass away""

In the revel of his court, at the zenith of his sport
When the palms of all his guests burned with clapping at his zest
He among his figs and wine would cry, ""Oh, loving friends of mine
Pleasures may come, but they cannot stay, like even this shall pass away ?""

The most beautiful woman ever seen was the bride he chose his queen
Pillowed on their royal bed, whispering to her soul he said:
""Though a bridegroom never pressed dearer bosom to his chest
But mortal flesh must come to clay and even these shall pass away""

Towering over the village square, thirty meters in the air
Rose his statue, carved in stone, as the king stood there alone
Gazing at his sculptured name, said to himself, ""So what is fame ?
Fame, it's but slow decay, even this shall pass away""

Fighting furiously on a battlefield, once a javelin pierced his shield
Soldiers with a loud lament bore him bleeding to his tent
Groaning from his tortured side, ""Pain is hard to bear"", he cried
""Oh, but with patience day by day, even this shall pass away""

Sick and sore with cancer; weak and tired and old, just minutes yet to go to pass the gates o' gold
Spake he with his dying breath, ""Life is done, so what is death ?""
Then in answer to the king fell a sunbeam on his ring
Reflecting words he failed to say: ""Even this shall pass away""



",Pass Away,1979
Chuck Berry,"Old boy he ran a little stop sign in the south
And he got in deeper trouble with his mouth
They wouldn't let him phone or make a bail
Just let him sit there in that Delford County jail

It wudn't me, it wudn't me
I'm so glad it wudn't me
No phone, no bail, no plea
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me

He had to break out of that Delford County jail
They put a Grand Dragon posse on his trail
And seven Alabama bloodhounds in a line
Buckin' and barkin' for a bite of his behind

It wudn't me, it wudn't me
I'm so glad it wudn't me
Hung posses ain't my cup o'tea
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me

He was streakin' through the Delta double three
But them hungry hounds was gainin'on his lee
His feet was playin' ""Louisiana Bound""
Lord, you help me pick 'em up, I'll put 'em down (Amen)

It wudn't me, it wudn't me
I'm so glad it wudn't me
Prayin' ain't no sure guarantee
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me

He was streakin' through the Delta, stridin' wide
But that leadin' hound was meters from his hide
Lord, bless my feet, don't let 'em go corrupt
I'll lay 'em down as fast as you can pick 'em up

It wudn't me, it wudn't me
I'm so glad it wudn't me
Just meters from a canine jubilee
Oh, I'm so glad it wudn't me

He reached a highway through the ticket on the side
And a trucker came along and let him ride
But as he settled down to thank him for no harm
He saw a swasti-KKK band on his arm

That's when he knew he had to get on help his self
'Stead if sittin' pinnin' it on somebody else
He hung a left into that thicket 'cross the fence
And ain't nobody ever sawed or seen him since

It wudn't me, it wudn't me
I'm so glad it wudn't me
It ain't quite my kinda cup o'tea
Jeez, I'm glad it wudn't me

It wudn't me, it was not me
I'm so glad it wudn't me
It just ain't my kinda cup o'tea
Jeez, am I glad it wudn't me

Everybody wants to take, nobody like giving
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama
The only clothes I got left that ain't rags is my pajamas
No brotherly love, no help, no danger
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers

I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better
But today, my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter
Son, come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama
You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner

I'm going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station
I've got just enough money to pay my transportation

Chuck Berry,"Well, down in Tennessee, close to Mississippi
'Bout a mile out of Toulouse, on the way to Memphis
There's a road turning south that's rather rocky and tricky
But it dead-ends right up to the Club Nitty-Gritty

The Watusi
The Hully Gully
The Mashed Potato
And oh-oh they started Twisting
They did the Shimmy
Ah! They were Jerking

As flighty as a Bumble Bee

I believe I was born to travel
The open road is gonna bring me close
You come to know some way-out people
To say the least, I dig the most
Who live and love across both borders
Trip, East and West from coast to coast

I only have one cradle to rock now
I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go
From St. Louis to San Francisco
Ah! From Canada to Mexico
I'm gonna let my cradle rock now
'Till it just won't rock no more

Detroit, Chicago, Chattanooga, Baton Rouge
Let alone just to be at my home back in ol' St. Lou

Did I miss the skyscrapers, did I miss the long freeway?
From the coast of California to the shores of Delaware Bay
You can bet your life I did, till I got back to the U.S.A.

Looking hard for a drive in, searching for a corner cafe
Where hamburgers sizzle on an open grill night and day

She remembered taking money out from gathering crop
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
As long as he would play it by the railroad side
And wouldn't get in trouble he was satisfied
But never thought that there would come a day like this
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss

Going, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye

She finally got the letter she was dreaming of
Johnny wrote and told 'er he had fell in love
As soon as he was married he would bring her back
And build a mansion for 'em by the railroad track
So every time they heard the locomotive roar

It's not too far back off the highway, not so long a ride
You park your car out in the open, you can walk inside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am
Every time you make the scene you find the joint is jammed

I'm gonna learn to dance if it takes me all night and day

And if you want to hear some music like the boys are playin'
Hold tight, pat your foot, don't let 'em carry it away
Don't let the heat overcome you when they play so loud
Oh, don't the music intrigue you when they get a crowd
You can't dance, I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby, 'cause you dance so good

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true?
You've started back doing the things you used to do.

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Maybellene in a coup de ville.
A Cadillac a-rollin' on the open road,
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford.
The Cadillac doin' 'bout ninety-five,
She's bumper to bumper rollin' side by side.

Me and that Cadillac neck by neck.

I knew that was doin' my motor good.

What I'm asking for
Is by the next semester
Can I get another car ?
This one here is sick'ning
On a wide dual road.
I might as well be walking
As to drive this old Ford.

Almost everytime I try
To go and pass a truck,
If I ain't goin' down hill,
Dad, I'm, out of luck.
And even if I get by,
It's still a rugged risk,
The way this old Ford
Keep a hitting and a miss.

Last week when I was driving
On my way to school,
I almost got a ticket
'Bout a freeway traffic rule.
It's now a violation
Driving under forty-five,
And if I push to fifty,
This here Ford will nosedive.

Dad, I'm in great danger
Out here trying to drive.
The way this Ford wiggles
When I'm approaching forty-five/
I have to nurse it along
Like a little stubborn pup,
And cars whizzing by me,
Dad, look like I'm backing up.

She just don't have the appetite
For gas somehow,
And Dad, I got four carburetors
Hooked up on it now.
I tried to hook another
To see if I'd do a little good,
But ain't no place to put it
'Less I perforate the hood.

Well Dad, send the money,
See what I can see,
Try to find a Cadillac,
A Sixty-two or three.
Just something that won't worry us
To keep it on the road.
Sincerely, your beloved son,
Henry Junior Ford

Chuck Berry,"A stranger lying on a bar room floor
Had drank so much he could drink no more
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain
To dream that he rode on that down bound train

The engine with blood was sweaty and damp
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans

The boiler was filled with lots of beer
The devil himself was the engineer
The passengers were most a motley crew
Some were foreigners and others he knew

Rich men and lost beggars in rags
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags

As the train rushed on at a terrible pace
Sulfuric fumes scorched their hands and face

Wider and wider the country grew
Faster and faster the engine flew
Louder and louder the thunder crashed
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed

Hotter and hotter the air became
Til' their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain
Then out of the din there came a yell
Ha ha, said the devil we're nearing home

Oh, how the passengers shrieked with pain
They go to Satan with this down bound train

The stranger awoke with an anguished cry
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high

He fell on his knees on the bar room floor
And prayed a prayer like never before
And the prayers and vows were not in vain
For he never rode that down bound train",Downbound Train,1988

If I go buy a Cadillac convertible coupe
And all I got at home to eat is just onion soup
It's my own business, it's my own business
If I would rather ride around
In my own Cadillac convertible coupe

If I's a dignatary on Capitol Hill
And up and married me a waitress in a hot dog grill
It's my own business, it's my own business
Because I am not a juvenile
And I can go out at my own free wil

After workin' on my job and then drawin' my pay
If I want to go out and have a ball and throw it all away

Then we'll discuss the future for us,
And I'll whisper love words to you.

To see your new bathing suit.
It must be a â??gasâ?? 'cause one you had last,
Gee! Was' it cute!

So we will dance and bypass romance,
Right now they say we're too young;
But I shall (will) marry you my love
As soon as you (we) reach twenty one.

When bells ring out the summer free
Oh baby doll
Will it end for you and me?

We used to have so much fun

Chuck Berry,"Up in the mornin' and out to school
The teacher is teachin' the Golden Rule
American history and practical math
You studyin' hard and hopin' to pass
Workin' your fingers right down to the bone
And the guy behind you won't leave you alone

Ring, ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunch room's ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom, open your books
Keep up the teacher don't know how mean she looks

Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Close up your books, get outta your seat
Down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and 'round the bend
Right to the juke joint, you go in

Drop the coin right into the slot
You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance,
Feeling the music from head to toe
Round and round and round we go

Drop the coin right into the slot
You're gotta hear somethin' that's really hot
With the one you love, you're makin' romance
All day long you been wantin' to dance,
Feeling the music from head to toe

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

As I was motivatin' over the hill
I saw Mabellene in a Coup de Ville
A Cadillac arollin' on the open road
Nothin' will outrun my V8 Ford
The Cadillac doin' about ninety-five
She's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side
Maybellene
Why can't you be true
Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford
The Ford got hot and wouldn't do no more
It then got cloudy and started to rain
I tooted my horn for a passin' lane
The rainwater blowin' all under my hood
I know that I was doin' my motor good

Oh Maybellene, why can't you be true
You've started back doin' the things you used to do

Oh, Maybellene
Why can't you be true

You've started back doin' the things you used to do

The motor cooled down the heat went down
And that's when I heard that highway sound
The Cadillac asittin' like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten half a mile aheadv The Cadillac lookin' like it's sittin' still
And I caught Mabellene at the top of the hill

Chuck Berry,"It was a teenage wedding, and the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell,
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell

They furnished off an apartment with a two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale,
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell

They had a hi-fi phono, boy, did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records, all rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down, the rapid tempo of the music fell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell

They bought a souped-up jitney, 'twas a cherry red '53,
They drove it down to Orleans to celebrate the anniversary
It was there that Pierre was married to the lovely mademoiselle

You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle

And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues, yeah

Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standin' right beside me Lord, through everything I done
And every night she kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find

Trifle further, then reel and rock it

Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle, I'ma play my fiddle 
Ain't got nothin' to lose

Dance like a spinnin' top
She got a crazy partner
Ya oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime the music will never stop

Rock and roll music,
Any old way you choose it;
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it,
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music,
If you want to dance with me,
If you want to dance with me

I've have no kick against modern jazz,
Unless they try to play it too darn fast;
And change the beauty of the melody,
Until they sound just like a symphony,

Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree
Hanging on a branch up under the sun
Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne

Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain
To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain
Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive
About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive

Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail
Got mad and went roarin' through the jungle trail
He ran upon an elephant beneath a tree
And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me

An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight
Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight
A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge
Coming all the way from India on a local barge

Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den
But Jo Jo bet him ten bucks the elephant wins
Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down
He don't outweigh you but a thousand pounds

Leo left wailin' with a left upper cut
The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut
Leo fired a beautiful short back cross
That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw

Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in
The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in
The buzzard said, they fought furious all day
He couldn't understand how Leo got away

Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news
To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos
A hoot owl reported everything he saw
Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw

Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised
Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues
Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down
Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground

Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat
Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet
Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes
Said, please mister Leo, I apologize

Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground
I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds

Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin' two miles about

Everybody's scrambling, running around
Picking up their money, tearing the tee pee down
Foreman wants to panic, 'bout to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blows the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train, gotta let it roll on",Almost Grown [#],2009

I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay.
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women shed a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself

That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match

Rounding third he was headed for home

And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop

When she would have to give her son a goodby kiss

Chuck Berry,"In the wee, wee hours
That's when I think of you
In the wee, wee hours
That's when I think of you
You say, but yet I wonder
If your love was ever true

In a wee little room
I sit alone and think of you
In a wee little room
I sit alone and think of you
I wonder if you still remember
All the things we used to do

One little song
For a fading memory
One little song
For a fading memory
Of the one I really love
The only one for me

Chuck Berry,"I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat,
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street, 
I shouted to the driver hey conductor, you must slow down
I think I see her please let me off this bus

Nadine, honey is that you?
Oh, Nadine 
Honey, is that you? 
Seems like every time I see you 
Darling you got something else to do

I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back
And started walkin' toward a coffee colored Cadillac
I was pushin' through the crowd to get to where she's at
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat

Downtown searching for her, looking all around 
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town 
I caught a loaded taxi, paid up everybody's tab
With a twenty dollar bill, told him 'catch that yellow cab

She move around like a wave of summer breeze,
Go, driver, go, go, catch her balmy breeze 
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear",Nadine (Is It You?) [#],2009

To have my fortune read
I didn't what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head

Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said ""Son, do you feel kind of warm?""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love""

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
Said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes

I left there in a hurry
Much to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies

So I ran back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Told her I didn't see nobody
How she made a fool out of me

'Cause my uncle took the message and he wrote it on the wall

Help me, information, get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis Tennessee
Her home is on the south side, high up on a ridge
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi Bridge

Help me, information, more than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
And tore apart our happy home in Memphis Tennessee

Last time I saw Marie she's waving me good bye
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
Marie is only six years old, information please
Try to put me through to her in Memphis Tennessee",Memphis Tennessee,2011

Since she became a rock-roll music fan

And the famous singers sang and barred away
When the stars performed, she screamed and yelled ""Hooray!""

Five thousand tongues were screaming ""More! More!""

I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile

Crusin' and playin' the radio
With no particular place to go

I was anxious to tell her the way I feel
So I told her softly and sincere
And she leaned and whispered in my ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow
With no particular place to go

No particular place to go
So we parked way out on the Kokomo
The night was young and the moon was gold
So we both decided to take a stroll
Can you image the way I felt

Ridin' along in my calaboose

So she can hear my man await a sax,

Man they were going like a hurricane

Way down South they gave a jubilee,
The jockey folks they had a jamboree,
They're drinkin' homebrew from a water cup,
The folks dancin' they all got shook up
And started playin' that

Wearing a form-fitting vest that was, whoa, all there

Who would betray you twice and you know you'll still forgive

Chuck Comeau,"I fall asleep by the telephone
It's two o'clock and I'm waiting up alone
Tell me, where have you been?
I found a note with another name
You blow a kiss
But it just don't feel the same
Cause I can feel that you're gone

Can't bite my tongue forever
While you try to play it cool
You can hide behind your stories
But don't take me for a fool

You can tell me there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie
It's nothing but a lie

You look so innocent
But the guilt in your voice gives you away
Yeah, you know what I mean
How does it feel when you kiss
When you know that I trust you?
And do you think about me when he fucks you?
And could you be more obscene?

So don't try to say you're sorry
Or try to make it right
And don't waste your breath
Because it's too late, it's too late

You can tell me there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want
But I know
I know your love is just a lie, lie
It's nothing but a lie, lie
You're nothing but a lie

You can tell me there's nobody else
(But I feel it)
You can tell me that you're home by yourself
(But I see it)
You can look into my eyes
And pretend all you want

All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigger
How the fuck do you figure?
That I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killer goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored- they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a niggas neck
Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Cause we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went ""pop"" to the temple
""pop pop pop"" was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical, I stole a 5.0
I let it go, drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucker'
The shot-gun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the dark side

Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
+Ebony+ can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Sayin my rhymes with a Ph.D.
Who's black, don't wanna role, sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin'?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist

Huh, and even if you're down with my crew
Yo Chuck man, I dodn't understand this man
You got to slow down*
I jack them too
And then we'll freak it
Kick that bass, and look what we did
Fade the grade, played, and made a few mil
And I keep stealin
Ice Cube'll make it funk
But right about now let's get up in the hump
But I don't party and shake my butt
I leave that to the brothers with the funny haircurs
And it'll drive you nuts
Steal your beat, and give it that gangsta touch
Like jackin' at night
Say hi to the three fifty-seven I'm packin'
And it sounds so sweet
Ice Cube and the Lench Mob, is jackin' for beats

Ice Cube, will take a funky beat and reshape it
Locate a dope break, and then I break it
And give it that gangsta lean
Dead in your face as I turn up the bass
I make punk suckers run and duck because
I don't try to hide cause you know that I love to
Jack a fool for his beat and then I'm Audi
So when I come to your town don't crowd me
'Cause I know, you're gonna wanna kick it with me
But I know, none of y'all can get with me
So you think you're protected
Well you are til you put a funky beat on a record
Then I have to show and prove and use your groove
'Cause suckers can't fade the Cube
And if I jack you and you keep comin'
I'll have you marks a 100 Miles and Running!

Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And 'Fuck tha Police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cause there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cause it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside

You wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh
Cause we ain't got it too good in America
I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over a key of cocaine
It was plain and simple
The 9mm went ""pop"" to the temple
""pop pop pop"" was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun
It's gettin' critical, I stole a 5.0
I let it go, drive real slow
I yelled out 'Ice Cube sucker'
The shot-gun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
When I got a sawed off, bodies are hauled off
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide
But to me its just another tale from the dark side

Standing in the middle of war
In the middle we flex
When we die, we won't make Jet
+Ebony+ can't see to the light side
The term they apply to us is a nigga
Call it what you want, cause I'm comin' from the coroner
Sayin my rhymes with a Ph.D.
Who's black, don't wanna role, sells his soul
Watch his head go rollin'
Who the fuck are they foolin'?
Nobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes
Matches the color of the one on my face
As they wonder whats under my waist
Standin' on the verge of them gettin' brown
That's a fact got a fear on their bozack
Run, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide",Endangered Species (Tales from the Darkside),1997

So yo check this out
This is Ice Cube from the Westside Connection
Callin all the way from Johannesburg, South Africa
The world has never seen a million black men in one place
But on October 16, in Washington, D.C., a million black men will gather

""This is a mission, not a small time thing"" (sample repeats)

Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Windows 95 updated high tech lynchin
Crosses of the colored man who claims he holds the keys to the safe
Secrets of the world, blow him in his face
Who's the master of the universe, galaxy and planets
Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in two thousand)

[Ice-T]
Brothers gonna have to put themself in check
Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck
Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone
You tell me brothers got no options today
You best to listen to the Ice closely fool, crime don't pay
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent

[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene knahmean
But I've been knockin em out the box like ??
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo

Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear

In unity there is power, none can devour
Hour after hour, we shower

[RZA & Killah Priest]
Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth
Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge

[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO

[Chorus]

[DA Smart]
Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march

[KAM]
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause why'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day

Chuck D,"A-yo Ice, man. I'm working on this term paper for college. 
What's the First Amendment?
   
Freedom of Speech, that's some motherfuckin' bullshit
You say the wrong thing, they'll lock your ass up quick
The FCC says ""Profanity - No Airplay""?
They can suck my dick while I take a shit all day
Think I give a fuck about some silly bitch named Gore?
Yo PMRC, here we go, raw
Yo Tip, what's the matter? You ain't gettin' no dick?
You're bitchin' about rock'n'roll, that's censorship, dumb bitch
The Constitution says we all got a right to speak
Say what we want Tip, your argument is weak
Censor records, TV, school books too
And who decides what's right to hear? You?
Hey PMRC, you stupid fuckin' assholes
The sticker on the record is what makes 'em sell gold
Can't you see, you alcoholic idiots
The more you try to suppress us, the larger we get
   
[You have the right to remain silent]
Fuck that right! I want the right to talk
I want the right to speak, I want the right to walk
Where I wanna, yell and I'm gonna
Tell and rebel every time I'm on a
Microphone on the stage cold illin'
The knowledge I drop will be heard by millions
We ain't the problems, we ain't the villains
It's the suckers deprivin' the truth from our children
You can't hide the fact, Jack
There's violence in the streets every day, any fool can recognise that
But you try to lie and lie
And say America's some motherfuckin' apple pie
Yo, you gotta be high to believe that
You're gonna change the world by a sticker on a record sleeve
Cos once you take away my right to speak
Everybody in the world's up shit creek
   
Let me tell you about down south
Where a motherfucker might as well not even have a mouth
Columbus, Georgia, said they'd lock me up
If I got on the stage in my show and said ""Fuck""
So I thought for a minute and said ""No,
I wasn't even gonna do a damned show""
Cos for me to change my words from my rhymes
Is never gonna happen cos there's no sell outs on mine
But I vowed to get those motherfuckers one day
They even arrested Bobby Brown and Cool J
Yo, they got their's comin', cos I'm mad and I'm gunnin'
Homeboys, and there's no runnin'
I'm gonna tell you how I feel about you
No bull, no lies, no slack, just straight fact
Columbus, Georgia, you can suck my dick
You ain't nothin' but a piece of fuckin' shit on the damned map
   
Freedom of Speech, let 'em take it from me
Next they'll take it from you, then what you gonna do?
Let 'em censor books, let 'em censor art
PMRC, this is where the witch hunt starts
You'll censor what we see, we read, we hear, we learn
The books will burn
You better think it out
We should be able to say anything, our lungs were meant to shout
Say what we feel, yell out what's real
Even though it may not bring mass appeal
Your opinion is yours, my opinion is mine
If you don't like what I'm sayin'? Fine
But don't close it, always keep an open mind
A man who fails to listen is blind
We only got one right left in the world today
Let me have it or throw The Constitution away
   
What they're trying to do with radio, with this, uh, McCarron-Walter
Act and a lot of other ways, is start by saying that they're
protecting the public from wicked rock bands, or girlie magazines, or
whatever. But, if you follow the chain of dominoes that falls down,
what they're really trying to do is shut off our access to information
itself.
   
If they can't do it by law they know there's other ways to do it.

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so-so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ha-ha

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""you want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, say what?

Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Till one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

It is the soul, the spirit

It is our mind that creates the definition of the beauty

I'll always remember, that moonglow gave me you

It must have been moonglow, way up in the blue
It must have been moonglow that led me straight to you
I still hear you sayin', ""Sweet child, hold me fast""
And I keep on prayin', ""Oh Lord, please let this last""

There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,

Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Only thing I got left is this gun on my belt, If I can't feed myself how I'mma feed you?
How I'mma ride with this tank on empty, sellin yola hoping that the jakes dont get me

I couldn't tell by the looks on yo' momma face
Now everytime she look at me I see a look of disgrace
She disappointed by the dreams we was lookin' to chase
Cause we was cookin' the base and we was flippin' the spinach

Hopped in, dropped the top, pushed start
And we off, she wanna get down at the party (Disco!)
She wanna cat walk like a model (In Vogue!)

The distant moanin' of a train

Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing
 
Love is a many splendored thing
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living
The golden crown that makes a man a king
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing",Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,1995
Chuck Jackson,"Help me escape this feelin' of insecurity
I need you so much but I don't really think you need me
Well if we all stand up in the name of love
And state the case of what we're dreamin' of
I got to say I only dream of you

Relight my fire, your love is my only desire
Relight my fire, cause I need your love

Turn back the time to the days when our love was new
Do you remember?
No matter what was happenin', I was there with you
Well if we all stand up for what we believe
And then eliminate the possibilities
The world would be one broken dream
So baby don't turn away, listen to what I got to say

Got to be strong enough to walk on through the night
There's a new day on the other side
Got to have hope in your soul
Just keep on walkin' yeah, yeah
Just keep on walkin' yeah, yeah
Just keep on, I'll keep on
I'm strong enough to walk on through the night
And I see day on the other side
And I got hope in my soul, so I'll keep walkin' yeah
Keep walkin' yeah

Relight my fire

Chuck Jackson,"I think that you don´t care, 
And it´s more than I can bear, 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind, all in my mind.

I know that I´ve been true, 
But honey sweetie baby what about you? 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind.

We´ve been going steady so long, 
I´d never dream you would ever do me wrong, 
I knew I was yours and I thought you were mine, 
And that every little thing was so fine.

Whoa darling, I´d hate to see, 
Someone else with you other than me, 
I don´t know baby, 
Maybe it´s all in my mind, all in my mind
Oh yes, it´s all in my mind.",All in My Mind,1995
