Slam Stewart,"Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
Yes
everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!

I'm his sweet Judy
and he is my loving man!
No time to do his duty
loves me like no other can!

Everybody loves my baby
but my baby don't love nobody but me
nobody but me
Everybody wants my baby
but my baby don't want nobody but me
that's plain to see!

Now when my baby kisses me
upon my rosy cheeks -
I just let those kisses be
don't wash my face for weeks!

Everybody loves my baby...",Everybody Loves My Baby,2011

Woher du kommst und wer du bist, ist mir sowas von egal, auch wenn 
Gefährlich ist geht mir dein Dummgelaber voll auf den Sack, du machst rum 
Wie ein Pimp, der 10 Dinger laufen hat! Doch deine Augen verraten innere 
Daten, ich seh immer noch, wie sie dich von Garten zu Garten 
Jagen, deine Straßen waren für kleine Hasen gemeiner Schaden, 
Deswegen gabes keine Fragen alleine wagen war jetzt angesagt, also wurde man Soldat, 
Machte den Schritt über'n See, wurde dann voll stark! Obwohl die 
Nachbarschaft noch lacht, wird einfach in einer anderen Stadt der Chef 
Gemacht!

Es macht keinen Sinn, wenn man noch weiterspricht!

Alter spar dir dein Gelaber
Weil ich keinen Bock drauf habe und wage dich 
Ja nicht mich nach meiner Meinung zu fragen! 
Ich sage dir die Wahrheit 
Direkt in die Fresse, in deinen Texten fehlt der Flow und in deinen Beats 
Fehlen die Bässe! 
Auch wenn ein paar von deinen Stories in den Charts stehen, 
St es klar, dass die erfunden sind, wie die von Mark Twain! 
Außerdem ist es irrelevant, ob du leidest
Entweder du fightest oder du  meidest eine Welt, 
Die voller Neid ist! du wirst verlieren, während wir expandieren 
Und die andere Seite wird die dicken Schecks kassieren! 
Yo, unser Untergang wird net passieren
Weil wir wie Soldaten über fette Track marschieren!

Du bist eh besser alleine mit deinem Frust! 
Gib mir net den Alle Männer sind 
Schweine-Stuss! Wenn du eine bist
Die auf meine Scheine guckt, es gibt bei 
Dir für einen ohne Cash kein Genuss
Darum ist klar, warum du immer wieder weinen musst! 
Du willst wie alle Schnecken Diamantenketten, würdest du mich 
Retten, wenn ich überhaupt nix hätte? Die nette Silhouette ist nur eine 
Fassette und von denen gibt es eine ganze Palette!

Slaner,"Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise
Once forgotten soldiers come to life
Fallen mercenary, dormancy is done
Not content with wars we never won

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war

Target assassinate, time of your life has expired.
Hatred victimize, gaze in their eyes as they die
Violence inflicting of pain, savage morticians deny
Drive in the salt in the wound, arouse the subconscious to lie

Memories can't ignore
Anguish of before
Satisfy the scorn
Rise ghosts of war

I deal in pain
All life I drain
I dominate
I seal your fate

I deal in pain
All life I drain
Memories can't ignore
Rise ghost of war",Ghosts of War,2009
Slank,"One by one, ticking time bombs won

One by one, baby, here they come

He wants it easy he want it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that
Two steps forward, then three steps back alright

Won't you take a walk outside? Oh, no
Can't you find some other guy? Oh, no
One-nine-six-nine, what's that sound? Oh, no
Keeping down the underground, oh, no

The end has no end, the end has no end

He want it easy, he want it relaxed
Said I can do a lot of things, but I can't do that
Two steps forward then three steps back, it won't be easy

Slapdash,"Just as words are nothing worth
When kept unspoken
All love given was gone lost and left
Crippled and broken

Crippled and broken
All love given gone to waste
All tears shed turned to liquid hate
All feelings lost their taste
'cause no love, no love lasts

No love-no love left
No love-(love)-no love lost

Truth hurts and time heals slow
I'll cry unseen
All love given gone lost only alive
Within a dream

Within a dream
(each drop served soothes the pain
I'm done with crying
each glass emptied fills my brain of memories
of my self-denying)

No love, no love, no love, no love

Slapdash,"Morning sun sets another day
Lights up my world ten shades of gray
I find no strength I've lost it all
No one's around when I take the fall

Day by day all moulded gray
It's all the same not much to say
You spoke to me with silvertongue
Spoke of times to come as past begun
Tope my soul with velvet lies
Then buried trust under pale bruised skies

I'm on my own
I can't count anymore on you
I'm on my own
All the lies that you told I've seen throug

I can't take another day
All the colours turned to gray

I'm leaving everything behind
I'm so fed up there's nothing more to find

Walls closing in on who I used to be
Whithin my mind rage roaming free
Insomiac state of inebriety
Turned my back on what's sanity

I'm on my own...
I can't take another day
All the colours turned to gray
I'm on my own leaving everything behind
So fed up there's nothing more to...find

I'm leaving evrything behind...
I'm on my own
I can't count anymore on you
I'm on my own

Slapp Happy,"Waitin' for a sign from you
Waitin' for a signal to change
Have you forgotten what your love can do?
Is this the end?

Walkin' through the city
Your boots are high-hilled and are shinin' bright
The sun was sparklin' on the shaft of your knife
Flower in the morning rain
Dying in my hand

Was it all in vain?
Superstar in your own private movie
I wanted just a minor part
But I'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart

You're the keeper of the key
Nothing seems to bring you down
It's not that cool when I'm around
Flower in the morning rain
Dying in my hand

Was it all in vain?
Superstar in your own bright movie
I wanted just a minor part
But I'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart

Slapp Happy,"He used to wear fedoras
Now he sports a fez
There's cabalistic innuendoes
In everything he says
Sucking at a cigarette
Picking up a thread
Underneath the Casablanca Moon

He lurks behind a paper
In the shadow of a mosque
He can't count all the continents
He's crossed
Trailing party-members leaving
Footprints in the frost
Underneath the Acnalbasac Noom

His cover was broken somewhere
In Hoboken the man said his
Case was lost
He was sent to the Orient
A double agent double crossed
There's a cocaine stain on his moustache
The pieces of his puzzle just don't join
People in high places want to stamp his
Many faces on a trans-caucasian coin
He'd better watch his step 'cause sooner or
Later they'll find his headless body in 
A ventilator

Lines of sweat like tinsel start to smart his eyes
Neurosis seeps like cement through the cracks in his disguise
In a dark bordello he cracked a mirror with his cries
Underneath the Casablanca Moon

Yesterday evening he finally lost his mind
The walls fell in & all mankind
Was standing before him all raising their hands
In a significant gesture which he didn't understand

His cover was broken somewhere
In Hoboken the man said his
Case was lost
He was sent to the Orient
A double agent double crossed

He used to wear fedoras
Now he sports a fez
There's cabalistic innuendoes

Slapp Happy,"Get in line, keep in time with the Drum
And don't forget you're nothing yet but water.
Are you coming to or coming from
The understanding that I'm handing it to you?
Or is that a job you don't dare do?
Hey, my pretty flower, there's a letter for you
(you'll find it on the shelf)
Though it was posted in Calcutta
I know it's just another that you've written to yourself.


We watched a distant drummer flashing
On the beat in all his parrot fashions.

Get in line keep in time with the Drum
Don't move your feet until the next beat comes -
One of the laws says pause between
Though I would hate to make the game seem mean
Hey my pretty flower can you guess where I've been?
Can you guess at all?
Well I've been to your rooms and learned
You have all the mirrors turned against the wall.

I've watched a different drummer flashing
On the beat in all his Parrot Fashions.

Listen now to the sound of the Drum -
And don't forget we're nothing yet but water.
It won't be pleasant when the present time is done
Testing nightly 'neath a sprightly summer moon
Your spirit like a jelly in a spoon.
Hey ma jolie fleur there's a cat in the room
And it's not the type you're used to
Though I think I led it to the sink
And tried to make it drink
It refused to.",The Drum,1973
Slapp Happy,"He's only half-way there
He's only half-way there
Told me my fortune was enough for me 
That I would rather be
Lying lonely in the houses
Than stand along the river-side
Wearing nothing but the ruby
Bequeathed to me by him when he died

He's only half-way there
He's only half-way there
If I hadn't disappeared
In spring that year
I'd have sent him home again

He's only half-way there
He's only half-way there
A large courtege of mourners all agree
That it was really he
Huddled in a blanket
Chewing on a ball-point pen
They stood him up against the wall
& set him off again
Around the karmic wheel big deal 
You can't get me that way
I read between the lines
Of the notice in the Times
& this is what they say
He's only half-way there
He's only half-way there
Half-way there",Half-Way There,1973
Slapp Happy,"Here's a little something for all you lovers - snuggle deep down inside your covers - make yourselves at home & I'll sing you a song about Love.
It can start with just a chance encounter - he doesn't know a single thing about her - a casual thread, but Lo! it led to love.
It takes too long to see what it takes two to love for it's soon to be.
And you could easily forget to get upset & set it free.
Sitting in a window at a table alone
Watching dancers circle to a saxophone - they get up to go, now they know it's love.
It couldn't be a nicer situation,
Setting off on a long Vacation - the passage is booked & they're both hooked on love.
From the tip of Alaska to the edge of Spain - in every long & latitude you'll find it's the same - put one & one & one to?get?her & you're not to blame if it's Love.",A Little Something,1973
Slapp Happy,"Casquette de moire,
Quéquette d'ivoire,
Toilette très noire,
Paul guette l'armoire,
Projette languette sur poire,
S'apprête baguette et foire.

His silhouette rancid with diamonds
Splinters like a stone in the palm of your hand,
He's rigged with a nebula's sine qua non a festival of bones on a table of sand.

Casquette de moire,
Quéquette d'ivoire,
Toilette très noire,
Paul guette l'armoire,
Projette languette sur poire,
S'apprête baguette et foire.

He's jerking like an angel on the ladder of crime,
Diluting syrup ditties at the peak of their prime,
He's spun like a ghost in the radio cool?
He's everybody's child but nobody's fool,
He's cool like the breast of a radio ghost,
His name is Mr. Rainbow and tonight he's your host.

Projette languette sur poire,
S'apprête baguette et foire.",Mr. Rainbow,1973
Slapp Happy,"There he goes,
My hero in wonderful clothes - passing me by,
Giving me the eye - he's my guy
& he really keeps a secret.
From the start his message went
Straight to my heart & over my head -
It was heavy as lead -
I'd tell you what he said, but I swore
I'd keep it a secret.
There's something hypnotising
'bout the way he walks -
There's something supernatural
'bout the way he talks -
Coming from another world I know
He doesn't find it easy -
Keeps me up every night telling me
The same old story -
I told him it's alright no matter
What he does he never really bores me.
Strike a light!
He's making my daze into night -
Mercurial man, he does everything
He can
& my only plan
Is to keep his secret secret.

Slapp Happy,"Tell of the birth
Tell how war appeared on earth

Thunder and herbs
Conjugated sacred verbs
Musicians with gongs
Fertilised an egg with song
Asleep in the sphere
Her foetus was a knot of fear
She butted with her horn
Split an egg and war was born
A miracle of hate
She banged her spoon against her plate

Upon her spoon this motto
Wonderfully designed
""Violence completes the partial mind""

Tell of the birth
Tell how war appeared on earth
Musicians with gongs
Fertilised an egg with song
She butted with her horn
Split an egg and war was born

Stacking the bones
On the empty aerodrome
Tinted turtle green
Haunts the slender submarine
She shakes her gory locks
Over the deserted docks

Come follow me
Out of dark obscurity
Follow my torch
Pilgrims at the double march
Through meadows and seas
Abattoirs and libraries
The pilgrims increase
Boasting they are led by peace
They gut huts with gusto
Pillage villages with verve
War does what she has to
People get what they deserve

The moon may be high
But I can't see a thing in the sky

Has risen to a scream

And you walk away from us
One minute your as calm as can be
But the next you make a fuss

Your emotions at bay

From the left to the right

You try to start a fight
You'd better get your acts together
Or you'll be out of luck

Now you've slipped away And found a place to stay Who do I congratulate But I'm happy for you Where are you today I sense that you're afraid And I don't know what to do

I miss you, but what does it change This confusion feels the same Forget you and let you leave But I'm still thinkin' it through it's been the conflict between us That's kept me from sinking before You drove me crazy and I let you Come do it some more Put the past to bed, we've done it before

Now we're back and forth again Can we help this pointless thing Swingin' like a hinge To the place we always meet

There's nothing to say Except loneliness is strange Cause you wear the face That I never can leave And I know you're gonna call Cause you know just where I'll be Once you come and find me here I'll be happy for me So happy to be Not alone anymore We've done it before

Now we're back and forth again Can we help this pointless thing Swingin' like a hinge To the place we always meet

It's such a shame how little things Can change your minds Don't just sit there filing your nails And passing the time I can't let you bottle it up And take it too far Carrying all of that weight Is the hardest part

Through the tunnels in the maze

But we got the Stones cranked
As fast as the orbit takes us
Is just how fast we'll play
Around the bumpers and
Down the drain
We're so out there, we feel no pain

Be the ball - You'll never get it right
Be the ball - Gonna see the world tonight

Has now become the same thing

I've finally become what you want me to be

I still remember all the stupid things that I've said and done
But still, you stuck around with me when all your friends said, ""Run!""
Givin' me a name; I found myself inside all the flames
Becoming everything for you again is...

I was never popular, this I'll admit, fuck school never liked me, Goo!
All the kids would always beat me, until I'm half-dead
Make fun of the size of my forehead
But that shit never bothered me, Mama and Mother
They had a lot of property
They had a science lab in the basement
And that's where my free ti...well, my time was spent
I made a mouse with a chicken head
It clucked three times: CLUCK, CLUCK, CLUCK!
And then it was dead
I made a lot of things though, like a frog with a turkey neck
gobblegobblegobble, it was the shit (yeah)
But I'm still lonely, I need a homie
So I collected limbs and made a zombie
I could've made a girlie friend
But fuck that, I got my girlie right here...yeah!

You can call me Mad Professor
I will make a friend for me
You can call me Mad Professor
We will rule eternity

I used so many body parts it was crazy
I killed a whole bunch of mother fuckers , like what, eighty?
They all chipped in on my special friend
Everything helps, Even if you got a finger to lend, come on
I hear the other children playing outside
""Keep it down you little bitches, I'll skin your fucking hides!""
?Stressful?, this part is wack
Some how I gots to attach this nut sack
Shit! Fuck! I'm sawing off an elbow
Looking at the meter I'm like ?Quasar and Ziphalo?
Or better yet look out the fucking window
I see a storms coming, almost time to roll
Screw the head on, come on, come on
It's the thuggish, ruggish, bone
Okay it's time, hit the switch, turn it up a hert
Fuck! Shit! Didn't work

(Chorus)



It wasn't always easy (Hell no!) let me tell ya
But fuck that, cause I ain't no failure
I put the shit with the ?things? and this with that
Wait a minute...(brrrt) did you hear that?
It's alive! I just gotta wake it up
Hand me that ?rocky rye?  pour it in a cup
It will do exactly...hold up, pause
I ain't cleaning his draws man, fuck that
Get him fat, get him ready, it's almost time
Paint his ugly face up just like mine
I see him twitching, I'm on a roll
He can help me tell the whole world about the carnival
Turn the hertz all the way up for this shit
And just wait for that lightning bolt to hit

with finding who's to blame.

While it can seem so hard now,
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way.

Don't tell me it's too late,
cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
and let others lead the way.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still we push further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

Some feel that life's a favor,
While some don't have the time.
Wash up and kiss the alter,
All hail the mighty father,
but love will keep you blind.

Same questions we keep asking,
Won't hear the answers cause we're scared of what we'll find

We try and compensate through our troubled faith that should keep us safe
and keep searching for a sign.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still still we march further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

There wont be another day, the (no?) changing of the seasons,
And no one's gonna save us from the lies.

The greatest story ever told,
Is only what you make it.
There will be struggle and fear,
All by design

And still we march further away (We've been so logicated)
Singing our songs of yesterday (Nothing's got all the point, the blame?)
While so much still stands in our way (Yeahhhh!)

Now you've slipped away And found a place to stay Who do I congratulate But I'm happy for you Where are you today I sense that you're afraid And I don't know what to do

I miss you, but what does it change This confusion feels the same Forget you and let you leave But I'm still thinkin' it through it's been the conflict between us That's kept me from sinking before You drove me crazy and I let you Come do it some more Put the past to bed, we've done it before

Now we're back and forth again Can we help this pointless thing Swingin' like a hinge To the place we always meet

There's nothing to say Except loneliness is strange Cause you wear the face That I never can leave And I know you're gonna call Cause you know just where I'll be Once you come and find me here I'll be happy for me So happy to be Not alone anymore We've done it before

Now we're back and forth again Can we help this pointless thing Swingin' like a hinge To the place we always meet

It's such a shame how little things Can change your minds Don't just sit there filing your nails And passing the time I can't let you bottle it up And take it too far Carrying all of that weight Is the hardest part

Through the tunnels in the maze
We don't know where we're going
But we got the Stones cranked
As fast as the orbit takes us
Is just how fast we'll play
Around the bumpers and
Down the drain
We're so out there, we feel no pain

Be the ball - You'll never get it right
Be the ball - Gonna see the world tonight

Lady Faye back in '52 was a fiend for fame
Not a lick of talent, paid dues, got fucked by John Wayne

Crown her the Hollywood queen, she gives head in every scene
Did anybody stare
She said-she said

Stars laid out on the Hollywood Squares
Going 'round and 'round like musical chairs
But be ready to rumble
Be ready to fight, if you wanna live through the boulevard night
Get ready for problems, get ready for pain
If you wanna play the L.A. game
Where you got to hustle and nothing is fair

It goes on and on, 'til the tail lights reached my head

Is he movin', movin', movin', movin'
Or does he lie there and just play dead?

I said hey, I said hey, to what the old man said
So we hopped in his truck, went for a ride
He talked about things before I was alive
Ya know, that used to be a big mining town
My brother and I brought that mountain down
My oh my, look how they built over there
Have ya ever thought about cutting that hair
Ya never told me what do ya do
Tell me kid, are ya just passing through
You say hey, you say hey, from what the old man said

So I tried and I tried and I tried and I tried
Yeah, I tried to break on through

You're the world to me for eternity

So I'm looking back on yesterday
And how we laughed until we cried
And we feel it as we're all growing older
It's so hard to say good-bye
Once again it's hard to say good-bye

As I stare into the hourglass of life
I think of how I left you then
When my life is over and all is said and done
You can hear me sing this song again

You know you keep me hangin' on
It's our love that makes me strong
You're the world to me for eternity

So I'm looking back on yesterday
And how we laughed until we cried
And we feel it as we're all growing older
It's so hard to say good-bye
Once again it's hard to say good-bye

Embers fallin' down from the fire above

The flames will not set you ablaze""

Rather switch places with the child mom's aborted, kill me
My skills be on point like a flyin' dart
Sometimes I feel like the messiah of a dyin' art
A whole 'nother animal, not the kind that departed on the giant ark
But a vulture with a lion heart
I eloquently breathe fire
I speak for the Eastsiders like I got a Long Beach speech writer
And I could teach riders how to do they thang
So they won't ruin the game for comin' off lame
We could be birds of a feather, what does it mean?
Think about it, that mean I put you under my wing
Or I'ma leave this hip-hop thing to all you wack dudes
Cut you loose (you're no good I have to) cut you loose
Call me a hater when I'm tellin' the truth, expect it
SoundScan is unveilin' the proof, respect it
Here's somethin' you could never dispute
The last time I spit a rhyme the roof fell in the booth, I wreck shit

Man I feel ruined inside
Somebody tell me what to do, I'm a guy
That loves music but I am truly through with the vibe
Sometimes I wish it was dead, rather than look this stupid alive (word)

But what's my single? Ask dude in the suit and a tie
Who stole the whip? Man I'm losin' my drive
I 'member when singles used to have cuts on it
Nowadays the rewind button got mad dust on it
Can't bring it back if it's wack, when they come back then it's crack
I'm fiendin' for somethin' good so I can puff on it
Y'all don't even give me a buzz
I can't enjoy a glass of beer if it's really just suds

Man I'm fed dawg, I had it up to HERE (done!)
I'm cuttin' you loose, fuckin' abuse
I can't believe they in your talks when you discussin' the truth
These dudes suck and they bad liars
This is not what I expected when I was 11 steppin up in rap cyphers
(What's goin' on?) I thought you had to be mad nice
But apparently you could be trash as long as you look good and have ice
I ain't complainin', I'm just sayin' though
There's no reason a musician should wanna watch a television 
Instead of be listenin' to the radio

What you really think of me, you disgust me
I twelve-step my addict itch
So Method Man, you could have that bitch

We-we, we lyrical murrrrrrrrrrrderers
Man, we own these streets
And the freaks they love us
We ain't worried 'bout you fuckers (Slaughterhouse)

Lyrical murderer, blame Rakim
I'm a sniper shootin' my way into your lame top 10
Pistol at your head if I ain't next to Eminem
Then I bust in your face like I'm fuckin' Lil' Kim
Niggaz better pray to the lyrical lord
That I fall off like the umbilical cord before I fill up the morgue
This is how a killer record
With the double-edged triple syllable sword, I'm iller than all
Dineri, see I'm a literary genius
Bury niggaz with words, a cemetery linguist
Most rappers are comedy gold
They like they boyfriend's sodomy hole, they full of SHIT!

Now you could walk through the shadow of death next to that shady street
Where the verbal cocaine business and 80's meet
Where them niggaz is backwards
I'm ridin' with my daughter in the front with the A.K. in the baby seat
We them copycat killers, unleashin' venom
Commit them lyrical murders and then we re-commit 'em
Lyrics be high quality
Bitches be givin' me brain, my dick be deep in they heads like psychology
Independently pennin' the best words that were ever said
The mixture of Leatherhead and Everclear
You can't hide, we everywhere
Now, picture a grizzly standin' next to a teddy bear

[Chorus]

Yeah
Hello hip-hop, I am here, you dyin yeah and I'm aware
A beast so at your wake I'll cry lion's tears
And that's no disrespect to the pioneers
If we ain't who you tryin' to hear
Somethin' either wrong with your eyes and ears
I came in this game screamin' Jers'
Ain't an MC in our lane to try and merge
Try and run with our wave
But I'm cool with bein' Eddie Levert seein' my son on stage
Gun gon' blaze, act up in this joint
And I'ma be Nate Robinson and back up the point
Your run's over, run with us or get run over
I'm here to save this shit, and I brung soldiers

This is lyrical murder
Me and every track have a physical merger
When I stab it in the chest I'ma bit of a curver
So it bleeds to death, like the middle of a unfinished burger
Or sometimes I wrap my hand around his throat
Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
To hang the piano keys when they hittin' every note
I'm what no beat's able to withstand
If you suffer from writer's block and your label got big plans
Listen to this fam
Slide a little dough out that budget, and hire the instrumental hitman

Yeah, yeah
Too many Indians and no chiefs
I pull out the pistol when I pull no piece
I'm the blueprint, I have your clothes
Lookin' like they was designed by bullet holes and shoe prints
When I bless a joint, it's like Spock
Came up in the spot and grabbed the beat by the pressure point
I got the voc' in touch
I tell my bitch I'ma, give up drinkin' when she give her emotions up
Too many enemies and no killers
Too many that hate snitchin' but know squealers
I get stacks (stacks)
I blam hard with the click-clack, that Antarctica wrist wrap
I spit crack for yard niggaz to get dope
Y'all gotta wait for the transporter to get back
So who's the illest, what you talkin 'bout?
(Die Hard) like you Bruce Willis when I shoot to kill it
Too many hood guys, not enough good guys
The way you say pussy in plural, is puss-I
I don't be fuckin' around on that microphone
When I'm kickin them flows on that microphone
The illest nigga that's holdin' that microphone
I put my heart and my soul in that microphone
I put it down on that (microphone)
Turn up the motherfuckin' sound on that microphone

But turn it down if you weak on that microphone
Lame niggaz shouldn't speak on that microphone
My ultrasounds show me holdin' a microphone
That's on my momma, I was born with a microphone
Groupies love Crooked I on the microphone
Like James Brown I'ma die on the microphone
Too many rappers need to leave this mic alone
They on the same bullshit that Mike was on
You're lookin' at the unseen, missin' and to the unheard
I kill your career with one word (Slaughterhouse!)
You're verbally flirtin' with murder, you got some nerve
I lift your skirt like a young perv, knock 'em out!
We the mob, homie who need a job?
Plus I'm so fly tell Derek Fisher I need a lob
Too many in this industry I need to rob
And if eatin' niggaz made you obese, I be The Blob!
Fuck props, nigga this a different conquest
Listen this hear me spittin' think it's a pissing contest
I'm in it for power, if cowards try to stop me
They better off usin' a fishin' pole to reel in the Lock Ness
Yes! I got a barrel that'll spot wussies
If you are what you eat, how come I'm not pussy?

You lil' niggaz better come off that microphone
I'm educated but I'm dumb on that microphone
Don't even bother, you'll be done on that microphone
I turn a father to a son on that microphone
I'm a revolver in the slum on that microphone
And tell his are's I don't need no microphone
Too many critics tend to be silly
Too many frogs go ribbit but never leave lillies
I get it poppin like a ineen milli{?}
Now I'm havin' a whale of a good time, I'm a (Free Willy)
Y'all lip singers take a pic, click, cheese really
Fans, who their man, I'm they quick pick easily
None of you kids spit evenly
You body my verse is like a thick bitch leavin' me
Ha ha, too many fantasies and no fame
Too many claimin' insanity and they so sane
Less than wack Scooby Snack lack flow game
Rappers everything I do be that crack cocaine
Your career is doobie wraps, slap Joe name
In any one of them verses say hello to the hearses
Too many monkey see, monkey doers
I slaughter pigs on my tail like Punky Brewster

Niggaz know I get it in on that microphone
Y'all don't know where to begin on that microphone
I don't see how y'all could win on that microphone
A pioneer, I set trends on that microphone
Decide who you wan' be on that microphone
I see a bunch of lil' me's, micro clones
Too many 20 milligram Vic's I'm on
Killed the web, it don't matter what site you on
Save his mouth 'fore he's runnin' off
I tell 'em bridge or a tunnel, give a fuck how I come across
All these wanna be tough guys, son is soft
Gun go off, havin' like a good show, just spun 'em off
Treat old-timers like fags who drop the soap
They mic got Alzheimer's, forgot that they was dope
Too many dogs, not enough barkin' yet
Too many blueprints, not enough architects
Rhyme ain't started yet, still every bar's a mess
Fuck record sales or who the machine markets best
I'm the last muh'fucker that y'all should test
I'm the sharp shooter, you the nigga I target next
Too many frontin' like y'all that fly
Reach it, cause we set the bar that high (fool)

I don't be fuckin' around on that microphone
You lame niggaz shouldn't speak on that microphone
You lil' niggaz need to come off that microphone

Slaughterhouse,"(Ohh!) Yeah (let's go!)
I said once upon a time in a city that's mine
There was a nigga named Nickel that spit like Big in his prime
He got a fifty two box, original tick in the mind
Listenin to 'Pac and them drop with a prestigious design
My niggaz is dimes, my bitches is dimes
I came up behind Eminem in '99 and I took the baton
I been runnin' shit ever since then, slaughtered MC's
Sit and watchin 'my green grow, like I'm waterin' seeds
The problem with me is I'm the heart of the streets
Niggaz callin' for peace, they can't even call the police
If I ain't better than you I'm harder to beat
Probably cause I live by the art of for-keeps
I get indicted after my product's released
We a different form, a different centrifugal force
Every line is like grippin' on a stick shift in a Porsche
My niggaz asked for direction to go on this track
I said fuck a direction, spaz out! Get 'em up high!


And for them wack songs that you made
I want you to throw your pin, but hold the grenade
Explode to your grave, and go straight to hell 
When your soul is enflamed for the road that you paved
The role that played, in fuckin' up hip-hop
You owe so you paid, the fo'-fo' close to your brain
Closer than the close shave of a low fuckin' fade
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with J-O-E
With Nickel we gon' make more cheese
Heavy hitter, call me Joell David Ortiz (what up!)
I point a burner at the plaque on your teeth
On some leftover shit, it's a wrap on the beef
I'm one in a mil', comin' to kill
It's like you wanting a pill, my gun put your back on the streets
Spine on the concrete lookin' at the sun
Eyelids heavy, ""Why did Crooked have to come?
He was full of 'gnac and rum, like a bully actin' dumb""
Fully-automatic umm, that's Crooked havin fun
Listen, don't make a nigga find your dame
And make the dime give me brains 'til my mind is drained
Listen, don't make me grab a nine and aim
And how your dime did me, do yo' mind the same
But different, the West Coast king Crooked I
I'm a kamikaze pilot, I stay fly 'til I die, get 'em up high!

Here we go again, you know I'm him, Mr. Ortiz
Soon as I hold a pen I co-defend the sickest MC's (Slaughterhouse)
Pick a disease we got it, I vomit sniffle and sneeze
Lyrics squeeze, listen please, Lord help get rid of this fever
I'm like a hundred and fifity degrees
sixteen's used to be sweet, now they're a bit of a tease
A nigga need a infinite instrumental just to be pleased
Used to dream about livin' now I'm livin' my dreams
The bitches fiend, made my dick a machine
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am just as fuckin' big as I seem
When I'm spittin' this mean, me and government intervene
A couple presidents, literally live in my jeans
I give 'em residence, they just let me pick anything
When I'm in the mall, they show me the latest kicks on the scene
And I get 'em all, I ball like the nigga I am
Niggaz hate, bitches (Cheer) like Norm, Cliff and Diane
I'm in a state, of mind that should be the fifty verse
I run radio, but I don't use them itty bitty words
I ain't shabby with the nouns, I ain't shitty with the verb
When I reach heaven I want the nigga Biggie to be like ""Word""
City slicker, New York delivery when I swerve
Hold that mic like the Statue of Liberty, I deserve

E'ry year, let's be clear, put some fingers in the air
And hold 'em up high! [echoes]

Work on your half-court shot, I'm money from far
Get 'em mad, see a ape on your monkey bars
And that's rate, gettin' hate from the wannabe stars
And that's great, mean he feel it and know he numb
See that bullet comin' from around the corner 
Like a shot from Angelina Jolie's gun; think Joey the one
I'm a fake? Ain't your run-of-the-mill
I'm from where they kill you for one of your bills

He Mel Gibson, all that shit he believe, gon' get his son killed

No good straight jacket, all I did break the match
They say he talk tough with his fake ass
Four pounds put me in another weight class

Took the jumpsuit off my naked ass and ate the mask
You diss me, you wanna be a great that fast?
Take a fully-automatic and spray at gas

They say you the 'Ultimate Warrior', I agree
You die and come BACK, won't nobody know it

For those mornings that I was havin' trouble breathin'

Eastside Long Beach, I'm only pushin' four words
I organize a street massacre
You haters know I broke bread with at least half of ya
Out of town, hundred pound weed trafficker
Got niggaz rockin' Long Beach fitteds in East Africa
I been stabbed, I been shot, a imperfect part
Like my Grape Street niggaz I got a Purple Heart
I kill your bitch at the beauty salon on Windham
They take a nap on your lawn on a Louis Vuitton pillow
Waitin' for you to run out and say somethin'
Come out your face frontin', dumb out and spray somethin'
Bloaw! So move now

[Chorus]",Salute,2009
Slaughterhouse,"You herbs we merged, we're an alliance
We fight fire with flamethrowers, why would you try us?
We an outfit, equivalent to voltron's
That boy crooked I is equivalent to four arms
Joell Ortiz is the body
The cannibal slash killer, kill you then eat your body
Joe Budden is the pair of legs
He runs shit alongside I, the apparent head
I am the general, bow now
Fuck saluting!
I don't really think y'all niggas get it
Run up on your with a army it is
On until it's done, finished
You got a problem with any one of my slaughters
Then y'all niggas can come with it
Me and joey, we a perfect fit
He like starting shit, I like ending shit
I don't squash the beef, I don't bend a bit
It ain't intricate
I'm gon' shoot your stupid ass
You too could laugh, you gon' die smiling
Try wilding, I get hostile then I'm violent
I don't make threats nigga I promise
My style is stalin mixed with sick lyrics
If you hear it, it'll lift your spirit
Turn your appearance into a disappearance
Di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, di, ding

I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but my clique
Nothing but hot shit, follow me, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!
I put my money on my clique, hot shit
Coming out the barrel of my fifth

I got a raw flow, and I stay hungry more so
Guess that's why I'm the torso
I pour sweat when I perform shows
What I record goes down as the best, but the vets won't let that torch go
Y'all could keep it, they got flashlights now
And flamethrowers, and I got one on my back right now
Remain focused, that's what I tell myself now and then
Don't want to go back to that block like when variation defends
Uh-oh, my stomach growls again, I ain't none of you cowards friends
Every human out of my sight before I count to ten
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
I'm hungry like I never ate
Set a table up with knives, forks and spoons, I'm 'bout to get a plate
All these sweet dummies looking me like a pepper steak
Means we never separate, we ain't married
Jab it every time I touch a pen, I sort of set a date
I'll devastate your career, look I'm a demonstrate
Let me get a good breath take before I regulate
(takes breath) okay, bye bye you guys, don't try to rhyme
Cause line for line
What I design is mine and mine
My joint's divine, meaning right behind
And thank god it shines all the light in mine
So my eyes can find a nice dime to grind
Come here girl, toma, toma, take that, take that

I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but my clique
Nothing but hot shit, follow me, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!
I put my money on my clique, hot shit
Coming out the barrel of my fifth

You rappers chasing popularity by any means, doing silly things
Buying too many size twenty skinny jeans
The west treat me like I'm really king
I'm pacquiao in the Philippines, illest thing niggas seen
You rappers dressing like you fittin to sing Billie Jean
I got to intervene, fuck you I'm a intervene
You loud talking, wouldn't kill a thing
Matter of fact, where's your head nigga? I got the guillotine
Fuck your Hollywood limousine and rented bling
I give you three red dots and I call it a triple beam
I'll put your pad on your property, fag
Properly rob you and hop in the jag
If you stopping the profit, the glock will be popping your body
You'll rock a colostomy bag
Shot in the abs, moms will be sad
Pops will be mad, doctor be glad
Possibly be stopping the plasma dropping
Clock running out and the outcome bad
Any one of you niggas fuck with my team
Pretty ass thing with the infrared beam
Sleep on that and get killed while you dream
Fuck a rap group slaughterhouse a machine
Slaughterhouse, a regime
I'm gooned up if you know what I mean
Everybody want to be down with the king
No, no, no, no, no fly zone.

I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but my clique
Nothing but hot shit, follow me, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but gangstas

I put my money on my clique, hot shit
Coming out the barrel of my fifth

My one goal's to astonish
Tell the President, VP, (you could) notify the congress
They say I'm arrogant, pompous, but I'm honest
I tell them keep an accomplice away from the accomplished
They still making threats on your highness
But I tell them where I be, they just ignore the compass
I think all your mans' play dough, I don't buy that movie, fandango
Fans they know that what you a soldier to a general
Baby steel, got it in a bag, airtight navy seal
Tell them little dudes I ain't mad at y'all
College kids like Asher Roth
Y'all just trying to put food on the table
While I'm a just come and try to snatch it off
If it ain't for me
Most young dudes would be angrily
But anxiously awaiting bankruptcy
Wonder what makes little motherfuckers think they the same as me
I'm synchronized you and your men should die
Learn certain shit you ain't meant to try
Got the ground covered with some niggas in disguise
Best bet is to attempt to fly
Shit's a game, you down, you in for life
Fuck y'all, I ain't got to generalize
Y'all enabled to write what the pen describes
So when he asked what I meant and why, I tell him

I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but my clique
Nothing but hot shit, follow me, sound off, sound off, hut!
I fuck with nothing but gangstas
Nothing but hustla niggas, sound off, sound off, hut!

Slaughterhouse,"Check the scene boppers
Slaughterhouse, still standing
There was a murder last night
And the shit didn't really sit right with me
So I had to tell a story, oh, baby!
Blood on the walls, street life

America's worst nightmare, ahead by light years
Hip hop's only shining star in the night's air
Right here, don't fight fair, what I write, yeah
Might there, throw 'em off like they Bobby Knight's chair
I been where you tryna be, I'm already hot
All about cake, Betty Crock' and spit ready rock
They know my bar came venom in a bezzie rock
Kicks from Fight Club, outfit from Eddie Brock
I'm going for the kill, focused on a steady plot
John Wilkes the Booth like when he dead aimed his nezzie shot
You listening to hip hop's finest
You rewind this, Slaughterhouse behind this

I like rap, this shit is cool, I'm better than mad niggas
But I'm just as good a crack pitcher as a pad ripper
I say that to say this, don't let mad liquor
Turn me to a bodybag zipper and not a ad-libber
Couple joints ago I was right on that ave with ya
Mad bigger than the catch David Tyree had last winter
I'm not a made-up character, that's a Puerto Rican Brooklynite
With two kids y'all see in them mag pictures
And however I gotta feed 'em I will
All they ever gon' need in life is just, me and my will
Interfere with that it's gon' be more than a beat that I kill
Disrespect with an indirect and you will see if I'm real

Fuck you blood-sucking parasites
I'm bringing the terror right in front of your parents' sight
You parents' eyes and yeah, I wear a pair of pipes
I wear 'em like cellulite on a pair of thighs
I'm Eric Wright, I'm Ruthless, I terrorize
You'll either perish or be paralyzed, I'm a thousand degrees Fahrenheit
I'm even keeping them heaters when we perform
On stage rocking like we from Korn, the people roar
What they don't know it's a secret war
Inside of a rider I'm seeking revenge on the world for bein born!
And the desert eagle is mi amor, she'll fuck you to death
Blow your brains, either or cause she a whore

Allow me to reassure your stripe's worthless
Like a pair of Diadora's when it leaves the Adidas store
Don't be comparing us to rappers
Compare us to the Arabs, this a terrorist attack, uh, boom!
Lord have mercy, we here to destroy everything
You niggas is butter in front a fucking machete swing
Mothafucka I'm fly, I ain't no scary goon
Try me and I guarantee you I'mma see you very soon
Leave a nigga ass out like Prince, take his bitch
Put my Graffiti Bridge right Under Her Cherry Moon
We notorious, pushing them Porsches
Y'all niggas the orphans us? We the warriors

Oh, wait a minute boppers
Royce, slow down baby

This rap shit is a workout on my legs
A nigga going hard on his bike but too many dudes is jumping on the pegs
They know when that raw shit get recorded
Either let your speakers enforce it or lay down in a moshpit
Of course it's the bosses, acting like officers
Running in these corporate offices
Hungry looking for a four-course dish no matter what the cost is
Like the world's lawless so we don't know what remorse is
Cause the V need like a thousand horses
Slaughterhouse hoodie on, that's my new couture shit
It's Jumpoff! He be the best
Computers rank me number one, blame the BCS, it's they fault

Ask about your boy, I'm nice with my hands
Maybe that's why, every last thing I write is a jam
Minus the fans, the flights to Japan, I am the man
Anyone who feel they could see me is in dire need of a eye exam
My mind expands wider than the fanbase of a fire band
And what I release from my diaphragm, sticks to you
Like the wrists of Spiderman, fool a average listeners
What you liars can do but you will die a scam
When I die they will retire my entire hand
For years of scripted whoop-ass, making intruders try a can
I guess the moral of the story is Joell's victorious
And everything's all gravy like Notorious

I left a nigga dead cause he said he was ready for I
Let the Beretta give him wings since he said he was fly
I'm in my Chevy riding to ""Bar Exam"" and ""Mood Muzik""
They the closest to ""Reasonable Doubt"" and ""Ready to Die""
Crooked I, watch for snitches and wire devices
My 45th, fire in crisis, lift you higher than prices
All my ice, and on the mic, I am the nicest
Me and my bitch ride for life like Osirus and Isis
Yeah, word to Run-D.M.C. I'm Tougher Than Leather-face
Never threw a gun in the trash but they call me Weapon Waist
It's like you moving from the projects to the Hamptons
The way my hammers be sending bastards to a better place

Let me set it straight, they fans been led astray
Niggas keep gassing with guns with unleaded spray
They don't know they one flow, one medic away
From being taken away from here in the leaded state
I handle all of my serious issues with metal
I stick you so deep in the earth your zipper can tickle the devil
I'm skipping the pick and the shovel, I'm picking you up
And I'm shoving your head in the mud 'til your kickings is level
Pardon I live for the moment, you rhymin I give the atonement
Like the Indians, I scalp and I wig the opponent
But I'm a chief, matter fact I'm a beast

Slaughterhouse,"We’re so furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

Death by lyrical injection
I kill you rappers
A lot of green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay packer
I pack the zeros
Meaning mucho deniro
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades and they all get Knicked like Melo
Hello, Luda!
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumping, or playing double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

Let me tell this to the people not understanding my moxie
Animal, watch me
If you think it’s tangible, stop me
But then I hit ‘em with a flow, that they can’t even copy
See, we don’t play that
Where I’m from it’s like fantasy hockey
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for?
While you cuffin ‘em all, I’m stuffing her jaw
Then leave em for you to rebound Kevin Love on the boards
Dog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad
I put you on a crash course in a smart car
Gon' speeding not relying on the brake pad
The car you should only drive on the race track
So the lyings bout your feelings and your Maybach
Are ghost tails for the Phantoms face facts
We ruin hip hop, slaughterhouse and payback
In the shape of a tat, you done faded to black
Go

Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

I went from eating top ramin to being top rhymer
Check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind in the wrong direction
Now it’s time ya bow down and rep ? in my honor
Writ in my honor cause bitch I’m bonker, plural
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous girl
She on E, feeling on me, singing on key
While I’m bumping We Are The World
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn’t did he
“We run this town”
No he didn’t did he
I feel like tinting the glass,
You take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson
I call her Mississippi, that was pretty witty
Your man like a black man tryna' get re-elected
He ain't get it, did he?

Sticking it to the pedal
Pedal to the floor
Just whipping it through the ghetto
Metal in the door, case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I’m settling the score
I don’t know what ya'll hating for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don’t know what you’re waiting for
I ain't finna say nothing, turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneakers spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in his ear going na na na na na
Just when you think it stop na na na na na
Everything I speak is hot
But don't be mad at least everything you speak is
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay

Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I’m launching manure
Lord of the underground, God of the saw
On Hennessy black, ? to the jaw
Yeah I’m off the block
This ain't work, homie, I’m off the clock
I’m a syllable, Hannibal, killer cannibal
With a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West till I walk with Pac
We the two point 0 boys, Tiz, Crook, and Joe, Royce
New ghost Rolls Royce, pulled off the lot
Cock me, the only way you can stop me
I’m top seed, I pop green at mach speed
So watch me, if you haven’t seen the phenomenon
I spit fast as Lamborghini’s and Ramadan

We’re so furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

I suggest you shut it down
Pack your ‘ish and turn around
Because tonight, we run this town
So let your feet, still swiftly hit the ground

Sitting in, writes on my window sill
Making sure everything stays on chill
? wearing all white ? Sayin' pay yo bills
So that raw metaphor that I thought of before
I don't remember no more cause I just ran out the door to meet a fiend by the store
And I heard 'so you off touring?'
I turn and seen his whore that I used to fiend for that aint never let me score
Looking at me like I'm something she aint never ever saw

Guess who, what's happening guys?
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot
Hopped right back up on that crapper and I
Said ""fuck it"" with a capital I
Look who's back to antagonize
You don't like it? You can eat shit, fuck off little fagot and die
You right back like a maggot on my dick grabbing at my shit,
Better get to the back of the line
You wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that

Would I be before I let another rapper think he's hot
I'll bury my face in his stinky twat and go ala la la la
Girl my head space is limited, ain't even room in the back of my mind

How could you possibly stop the Apocalypse
When I'm atomic bombing the populous
Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid
Popping the Glock at his moms and his pops
Then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking the Slaughterish
Documentation and lyrics I write with confidence
Write like a columnist slash novelist

And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
Cause she couldn't handle my shit, wait I sweared

One, two I'm coming for you, I'm a big old (big old) nightmare!

After that I'll slap your ass again
And tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up
And that's how you body a fucking beat

Corner me, shit belong to me, two choices, you can get along with me
Or sit your fagot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all you missing is heels to be Ru Paul
Ain't nobody that's real ever knew y'all
Second to none and I'm dealing with Marshall
This time I never come down, deal with the blue balls
You ain't gotta fear me but you'll respect me

Take a piss, make it rain, I'm the American dream
Make it rain I ain't Pacman Jones

If you in that man zone, how you figure to gain
Can't bowl a 300 in another niggas lane

I don't touch guns I draw with telekinesis
No finger prints on Crooked's mag

I'm about to be a rich nigga, and waste the whole last bar screamin'
You ready? (screams)

Y'all know what it is, cause we do it often

Slaughterhouse,"Alright, look
I seen these guys backstage, I'm gonna say it right now
There isn't a group in the rap game today, that lyric for lyric
Can out-rap these next dudes. I know it for a mother-fucking fact
I know it cause I'm from the west coast and I was there when Crooked I
First came on the scene, when Joell Ortiz first came on the scene
When Joe Budden first came on the scene, and one of the illest lyricist
In the game, when Royce Da 5'9 first came on the scene!
Welcome to: Our House, give it up for Slaughterhouse!

Everything you been asking for, yes, I'm about to give it to you
You ain't gotta worry no more, cause I'm about to put one through you
I got a bullet with your name on it, coming through the radio
Sounds like I got an AK dumping straight to the radio
If you trying to be target practice, you finally found a shooter
Soon as I pull my gun I know that someone's gonna die, die, die, die
Someone's gonna die-ei-ei-ei die
Tonight

Nigga, this that shooter music
I'm about that life so much I might go touch my rifles butt
And my dick just might go up
Nigga, that nostril on that rifle'll knock the snot right out you
Try me and I try out ya
The drum on the gun is Beta like Phi Alpha
But there ain't no frat niggas in the hood be calling me Tackleberry
And if he's iron, he will have him a easier time trying
To put on some pads and go in and try to tackle Barry
Then he go against this got damn G4 buying, Detroit lion
I'm about that life so much I might go golf
Trying to get me a hole-in-one to remind me of life when I go off
Homocidal thoughts, bodies outlined in chalk by the time it's dark
Dahmer signing his name on a dotted line with a bloody body part
I don't give a fuck if they wilding, I got a clip full of fucking Ray Allens
Selling that Sarah Palin, in broad day, a Letterman Fallon
When I shoot this iron, all you hear is hooping and hollin' like
(Bombs away) Bootsy Collins

They shot my nigga three times, as his abdominal bled
They robbed him for phenomenal bread, that domino led
To other dominos fallin' in his clique, off with their heads, sick
Saw him in that hospital bed, leaned away from the doctor and said
They'll all be dead soon, and I'm talking before that nurse can change the IV
I'ma put em in the dirt, leave em leaking raspberry flavored ice tea
My G, kill him and take his ID
I'm a renegade like E-M-I-N-E-M and Ja-Y-Z
Bitch it's karate, it's Mr. Miyagi mixed with Issey Miyake
Smell that chopper kicking when it's lifting ya body
Quick as Bugattis, then I'm hitting the Omni
With a chicken licking my dick in the lobby; this New Edition, I'm Bobby
Fast laner
I'm speaking the truth, put 3 in the coupe
I'ma wet your head like a leak in the roof
Then I'm leaving the booth for gas chamber
My granny calling me a rap singer
But she don't know I use my strap finger

Look, this a whole nother ""Ether""
Hop out, black mask, low Caesar
Tell the goonies keep it low with the reefer
New bodies on old heaters
We ain't rapped too tight
Starving, they thought Jeffrey Dahmer had appetite
I'm detail, not derail
Don't lay your head if you shit by it
Got skeletons, but my shit private
I paved the way, y'all misguided
So try it, I'mma send a threat
Tie her up don't end her yet
Bullet go through your wife's eye now we know you ain't on the internet
In my head I see amateurs, can't retain a memory
All I'm left with is images
With that I'm putting emphasis
And in parentheses
Put he's hated by large percentages
And all my nemesis won't even let 'em on the premises
One shot, change him for life, he'll be belligerent
Even his text messages are gonna read like he's whispering
Bulletproofed the hoodie for Trayvon Martin
Then go to war with the cops, even they aren't pardoned

Didn't care if we ruined each other

I was on weed, I was on dust, might have tried coke when I was on pills
My pockets had rabbit ears, my mind gone, wasn't on bills

To any person that listen, now I wanna' kill a hater
A middle finger by the 'fridgerator, flip a bird in the kitchen

Just to get traffic for his site, should've did him like MMG
But instead I called up Sway and we cleared that up on MTV
And now I'm back (in the kitchen) but should I be
Cause I heard that Slaughterhouse, is about to cop that Shady deal

An then placing the crack in 12 12's
I ain't play with the crack, I was making up stacks

First thing I can remember is an evening years back
The four of us was together even then
And from that time on, nothing was ever gonna be quite the same again

G-G-God given, I'm killin' this bomb bidniz
I'm calling rap that because I put my time in it
I-I don't mind being ready to die as long as this is at an arena
And we did it and my momma seen it
This is my arm swinging and my alarm ringing
Fighting against time but writing is on
Singing the light on my wall or just look how the mighty have fallen
You fell for it, say bye to them, say hi to Ryan mature
I can't (lose) 'cause God won't let me (lose)
Bet against me you can go (lose)
Anybody can tell you (nah) nah
I knew the cats knew I was down so I fell back
Hit the ground, landed on my feet vertical, fell back too, so you can (lose)
I will never lay down and (lose), I was definitely about to (lose)
Then Eminem came like (“nah”) “nah”
This shit is entertaining, listen to the shit they saying
Venom is spraying which is why all I know is
I'm on a all time ultimate high inspired by all time low

And this game is like a sport, comp'll try to pen you
I leave the stage on life support when I rock a venue
If you ain't got a knife and fork you're probably on the menu
If I ain't make history before I left
It will be like using my last important breath before my death for snorting meth
More or less, I'm, Jordan-esque, I ignore the refs
I son you like you morphed into a Orphan yes
Nah, I never (lose) yeah, you said I would (lose)
My destiny said (nah), homie you went against me
Foolish as Judas, nigga you're lost
Now I'm feeling like Black Jesus, wrong nigga to cross won't (lose)
If I refuse to (lose) the fact that I used to (lose) is making me say (“nah”)

Took the idea of a group and re-imagined it without planning it

From front of the stage all the way back to the door it's thick
Like secretly filming a mob, we recording hits

(Lose) Man, I ain't about to (lose) I don't know how to (lose)
You beating the yaowa (nah) Mr. Ortiz I got you
Can't find a reason not to, my ink, take 'em to church

Slaughterhouse,"I remember it like it just happened
I could've sworn it was a dream
But in reality it hit me like a nightmare
Or at least that's how it seemed
I just got a grip on our relationship
We was ironing things out, started picking up steam
And when we didn't need it is when it all got heated
And we both said some things that we probably didn't mean
Then God intervened, guess more was at stake
Thought we left nothing over, He put more on the plate
She came home from the doctor with news I've been wanting
Says family was incoming, she's pregnant, twins coming
But that's gotta be a lie
She sighed, couldn't stop the tears coming from her eyes
That birth control she on, for them it's suicide
As long as it's still inside, two of them wouldn't survive
Hard turn from memorable to cynical
Picturing clothes for what would've been identical
Similar outfits, similar names
My deceased kids' ultrasound in a frame
So I'm deprived of my chance to be a better dad
Staring at my twins that I never had
I shed a tear, looking up in the sky
Even though y'all just got here, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

My biological sperm donor, didn't wanna be a daddy
So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us
Turned on us out the clear blue
His last memory of his son is seeing me through his rearview
I still love him yo, but I love his brother more
My uncle showed me love no one could know
Young and poor with a tougher road
To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc' would hold
Us down, help moms lift the motherload
I got grown and
I used to wonder what it would be like to speak to pops as a grown man
He provided that feeling, told me to take my career into my own hands
He was there when I had no fans
My cellphone rings, and after I answer
A voice says ""Your uncle's been diagnosed with cancer""
Worst news in my life
Him and chemo going 12 rounds with a disease and they both losing the fight
I'm rushing up to Cedars-Sinai
Praying for a miracle, I don't wanna see my idol die
Before he did, the look in his eyes
Said ""Even though you just got here, goodbye""

Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife

I'll see you again in the afterlife
Someday in heaven we will reunite
The flesh disappears but the soul survives
Till next time, my friend, farewell, goodbye

I walked in your daughter's house, knowing that you gone
But still looking out the corner of my eye, hoping you on the couch
That call felt like I was beef that had got shot up
Ironic, I was on tour with Tech N9ne and Slaughterhouse
D tried to talk to me, Crystal rubbed my back, as they was pouring out
I caught the next thing soaring out
Now I'm in the air, in the midwest somewhere
They said turbulence was severe, I don't know what they talking bout
I ain't feel a bump, body numb, mind drifting
I'm sniffling, asthma acting up, I'm whistling
I'm wishing my mother's face looked so much different
I'm kissing my son, my aunt pacing in the kitchen
My vision blurry, still I saw your face clear
What a loss, this time I did more than waste beer
Michelle's strong, she held on, we got all the way there
Then we walked in, she fell on the floor, this ain't fair
You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that ain't clear
Hey granny, I was fifth row at the Grammy's
An award they ain't hand me, but I sat behind Will
And right in front of Wayne, and got seen by the family
I miss the early morning convos, believe me
Regis on the TV, and the best baked ziti
But you had an all white affair, grandpa's all fly
Even though you been got there, goodbye

Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B

You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here

When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life, so wipe your feet before you step in

Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passes by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa

In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, 
If you can hear this sound inside my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsight, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad well I got-ta go mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bother me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back, to working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'm gonna go hard grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck themselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash Of The Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron

Dear mister end all be all of an opinion
Fuck what you’re saying, you’ve got fans but we’ve got minions
Plus Eminem got Stan's like an arena, I went and seen it
From abroad to back home, y'all ain't got to clap
We’re gonna make this track clap, clap, clap for him
Let me take your back, we turn one song to a group, to a concert, to a record deal

I got house gang, hood swag
I'm a Crook that'll Jump Off with five 9's or a good jab

As a poster child for Photoshop my whole image was wrong
Straight out a movie, took a pill and all my limits were gone
Now you mention the best and you gotta argue, son
Clothes I used to borrow some now it's name brand drawls
Just so my dick can see how far I've come
Changing the topic to women they know me to keep mine in labels
That's how they drape judging of shapes I should keep mine in stables
They left him for dead, took him to watch me resurrect, that shit's pathetic
Shouldered the blame it's a shame it took hindsight to give me credit
I got kitchens in the masters, the fish tank is a wall
I got couches in the closets, my estate is confused
We say that blatantly for the fools that missed with a blessing that steal
There’s no other outcome when you question my will

Get over yourselves, fucker

Now can you truly say that you made it? Your Way

They say I’d never make it, never make it
My rhyme scheme is a crime scene, dog I yellow tape it
For lyrical murder, I’m on the verge of my next merger
Had to crawl before I walk so after I ex Gerber
I took it a step further
I took over the web servers
I took over the west word to these fresh words
And rode the wave of web surfers
A circus- that’s what this industry makes me think about
Cause selling out's a shortcut integrity's the scenic route
But you have never seen a crew or better team
While you forever sleep we’re doing everything you fuckers dream about
Sucker Slaughterhouse is what they scream and shout
Not the crowd, I mean your bitch now

Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me, from me
Can you rescue me?

I was losing my mind like I was trying to lose it
Using my time for using, abusing my grind
This is my own honest view of who I am behind this, music
Ryan the whole bottle of patron Connoisseur
At a point in time I thought I blew it, doing crime
I would've washed a pill down with a shot of my own spinal fluid
And my momma knew it, she saw especially right through it
That I wasn't protected because peer pressure be like (do it)
But I couldn't fight through it, the beef started
The streets caught up, at least we didn't get involved in deceased orders
It's Slaughterhouse, cause Shady, me, Porter
Sat down and made peace over Porterhouse and Pies porter

Some stupid bitch done turned my girl against me
Should've tattooed the earth on my arm feel like the world's against me
Soon as I paraded, here come the rain falling the name calling
From the cuz I never met with his hand out like I'm straight balling
Feel like I knocked the 8 ball in
Every time I shoot a move I literally can't call it
Am I afraid of success? Let me think on it
I just got nervous, let me drink on it
Think I just answered yes but not on purpose

I pass the church and through the Son, Father, and Holy Spirit
But I'm only near it, man I need the pastor's service
I'm drowning cause I'm so tired of treading
So Lord when you get a second please

So can you rescue me
Because my ship is sinking
And I'm drowning at sea
So can you rescue me, from me
Can you rescue me?

I wake up and my shirt is leaking, covered in sweat
I'm dreaming of being murdered when I'm sleeping
Picture a person beefing, with himself
And it's even, worse when I'm drinking
It hurts when I'm thinking, me versus my personal demons
I'm reaching for my nine
If I point it at myself will it help to quiet the demons screaming in my mind?
And if I go, to the other side
Just tell my mother it was her prayers that kept her young'un thugging son alive
Plus my daughters and my butterfly, tell my son that I, love him
Tell my nieces and nephews their uncle tried
To take this music to the fucking peak
But I'm still a drug dealer as we fucking speak, that's fucking weak

Behind the tours and fanfare, hospitals and cat scans
Shoulder, when they call him bipolar, happiest mad man
Don't know my story, my struggle, the demons that I combat
Or how I'm starin' at them waiting for eye contact, beyond that
I got a soul mate that's naive, so the thought of me is prison to her
Baby momma that's crazy and a ten year old that listen's to her
My fam and friends think I'm the bank
And the way they keep coming back you think I'd got thanked
To you it's a dream, to me it's labor, these aren't monsters, these my neighbors
And we watch each others back, I guess its favor for a favor
Sometimes they even save me, when my wrist is to that razor

Slaughterhouse,"I guess you could consider it poetry
But with me it started out with just words just words
They started looking like puzzle pieces so I started
Connecting them to each other 'til they started to resemble blank canvases
By this time I was an artist so
I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer)

Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Sayin' I'm a killer
Did you ever think we would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams

I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in the class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head, ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off
Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick tot
To my inner enemy in a rush
I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams
With anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun
I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard
Every award show, we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical
To a kid that wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?
Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit
Beef on me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit
We put the world onto it so watch how you say ""fuck me""
You just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time
I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity
And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer

(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever see a mothafucka get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Goin' automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller
Knowing nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

It's an elite drinker, mister ringleader
I'm a deep thinker, I'm a street preacher
With a street sweeper full of heat seekers
In your Jeep speakers I'mma keep ringers
I don't need heaters, I got the meat cleaver
Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Niggas try to tell me I spell too much
Capital S to the laugh to the T-E-R
Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word
Making work disappear quick as magic
Abracadabra, the trafficker blacker than Africa
Can you imagine a nigga flipping bread for the blood?
Money like Dracula, hand him some spatula, ask me a question
Am I the best with the flexing?
Fuck yes with the goon talk
I just moonwalk all over the beat then I'm lightin' up the street
Crooked going Michael Jackson on Thriller
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer

Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire with a soldering iron
What up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
I'm hopin' to fill up your opening
Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the isle and
You've probably already been with all the slaughter and I am in
No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
With no strings attached
I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein' brought up so brought up inspired
But I don't know why, it's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool
Not an appliance, but applyin' this science, I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talkin', the twine like a bean's talkin' and buyin'
But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause
In the fabric of our modern society
Now Catholics are panicking cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Dammit the pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican with that mannequin
Singin' ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" again
In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in, a glad bag
Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance, like that again
You thought I was lyin' when I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again?
I've lost my mind, caution oh God I think I've thought of another fucking line
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak
Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony tryin' to sneak by it
So please don't follow me while I revive rap
I'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
Boston, across the marathon finish line and I
Put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life, worse than Dzhokhar's
And I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife with a fucking swiss army knife
A saber that's Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight
With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song so it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all I'm just ridin
Like I'm locked up inside a shot of Bonnie and Clyde called
Uncle Ronnie is driving, 'bout to burst in through the side door
Fuck up an asylum and park in the dining room

But y'all know where I'm from, B-R double O
You know the rest pimpin', yeah, I was bred different
Here come pops with the NY bop, you know, the leg limpin'
My ice mug frozen till it's stiff
Grimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch
I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women
Let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em
I might just throw 'em a gold fronts
Pour up a cup of E & J and light up a dro blunt
I was never soft, never saw me flinchin' when they lettin' off
Never had to retaliate cause I set it off

Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse

Ya'll know my name, bitch, never change up my language
I'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt
First we take oath
Then I'm pulling turquoise strings in my Lebron corks In Turks and Caicos
I came from wicked chair fame wearin' short sets
I learned that money can't buy happiness
But I decided I'd rather do all my cryin' in the Corvette
Make a dollar, buy a suit
Have a child, and have 'em follow suit
Wavin' that weatherchange things
Make the winter fall, coming through with everything to lose
Taking everything from you know
Let him finish his fall in his draws
And pray that he land on that minute hand in my Hublot
I'm about that Art Of War gospel
That Basquiat Picasso drawing a roscoe
Using the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow
Your money on me, bet it all, you know I'mma set it off

Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse

Let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth
Truth is I give a fuck, but it's right to myself
Fuck fame, keep the shit I write to myself
If what I do is therapeutic, man, the slightest shit helps
Made angel dust my freshman year
Gave it a try, cool, little did I knew
Had the wrong meaning of high school
Teachers called him a sociopath and a liar
Fuck them, only went to class for the cyphers
Now I'm gettin' bills for
The same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for
They said I needed a wrench, I'm a loose screw
Vital, suicidal, said I would kill mi amour
Wasn't speakin' in French, said I'd let it off
Never know who or what you might get
Main reason they never want me to set it off
You now dealing with four niggas that's never off
All bets off, so nah, you won't be better off

Decapitated Impala
Heavy lack from the weight of the llama
Still bear arms like a shaven koala
How you thinkin' like a faded neurology student
Is prudent when chasin' a dollar
So never mind, a clever rhyme
I'd rather find a better grind, forever times
Sittin' behind me because I'm ahead of mine
In this era I'm livin' outside of the paradigm
I'm comin' outside with a pair of dimes
Sharon and Caroline
Share a line then they share a 9 inch, never mind
I probably shouldn't even keep going

When a nigga ran up on that bicycle, with his hand on that Glock
Tryna get his blast on with that mask on
But I thank God it ain't pop
Thank God it jammed on him, jammed on him
Pay for havin' that drop
If he was in our shoes, he woulda killed us too

See you when you come home, you get a time wait
None of my niggas gon' tell on you
We'll turn anything 'fore we turn snakes
That's real shit, O's around
No sausage party, keep hoes around

Tell her 'bout that money we throw around

Cause he think his kick is slick or his little snare is dope
Shoot the bass in the face but sometimes I carry a rope
To hang the piano keys when they hittin' every note

Eyelids heavy, ""Why did Crooked have to come?
He was full of 'gnac and rum, like a bully actin' dumb""
Fully-automatic umm, that's Crooked havin fun
Listen, don't make a nigga find your dame
And make the dime give me brains 'til my mind is drained
Listen, don't make me grab a nine and aim
And how your dime did me, do yo' mind the same
But different, the West Coast king Crooked I
I'm a kamikaze pilot, I stay fly 'til I die, get 'em up high!

Here we go again, you know I'm him, Mr. Ortiz
Soon as I hold a pen I co-defend the sickest MC's (Slaughterhouse)
Pick a disease we got it, I vomit sniffle and sneeze
Lyrics squeeze, listen please, Lord help get rid of this fever
I'm like a hundred and fifity degrees
sixteen's used to be sweet, now they're a bit of a tease
A nigga need a infinite instrumental just to be pleased
Used to dream about livin' now I'm livin' my dreams
The bitches fiend, made my dick a machine
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I am just as fuckin' big as I seem
When I'm spittin' this mean, me and government intervene
A couple presidents, literally live in my jeans
I give 'em residence, they just let me pick anything
When I'm in the mall, they show me the latest kicks on the scene
And I get 'em all, I ball like the nigga I am
Niggaz hate, bitches (Cheer) like Norm, Cliff and Diane
I'm in a state, of mind that should be the fifty verse
I run radio, but I don't use them itty bitty words
I ain't shabby with the nouns, I ain't shitty with the verb
When I reach heaven I want the nigga Biggie to be like ""Word""
City slicker, New York delivery when I swerve
Hold that mic like the Statue of Liberty, I deserve
A shot at the title, 'Spitter of the Year'
E'ry year, let's be clear, put some fingers in the air
And hold 'em up high! [echoes]

Work on your half-court shot, I'm money from far
Get 'em mad, see a ape on your monkey bars
And that's rate, gettin' hate from the wannabe stars
And that's great, mean he feel it and know he numb
See that bullet comin' from around the corner 
Like a shot from Angelina Jolie's gun; think Joey the one
I'm a fake? Ain't your run-of-the-mill
I'm from where they kill you for one of your bills
For me it's fun, your man think we evenly skilled
He Mel Gibson, all that shit he believe, gon' get his son killed
Play with a match, fuck what you take it as
No good straight jacket, all I did break the match
They say he talk tough with his fake ass
Four pounds put me in another weight class
(Great Escape) the (Pad)
Took the jumpsuit off my naked ass and ate the mask
You diss me, you wanna be a great that fast?
Take a fully-automatic and spray at gas
Me? Body a whole shit with a verse probably atrocious
In your whole camp, nobody focused
They say you the 'Ultimate Warrior', I agree
You die and come BACK, won't nobody know it
Drive by, screamin' it's a new crew reppin'
Hangin out the window, like it's ""227""

Tear drops in the pillow on my bed
Still trying to keep my head up

I'm the product of when a nigga's mama gives up
Crying lying in the trash with the lid shut
Ain't got no family my mind is tender my
Daddy's invisible my Mom's is Brenda uh
If I survive I'm grow into what
Society considers trash the rope is to us
That means I'm hanging myself by living
The noose is getting murdered that or going to prison
My minds controlled before I learned mind control
What you call living life I call dying slow
I'm genetically predisposed
The reaper the only thing that can ease my soul freezing cold
Feeling like I was given life and if I take it at least I choose
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I'm hearing is wind and rain drops

[Chorus]

(Cause this is my pain)
Dear auntie I still feel your timeless sorrow
Before you died it's like your body was mine to borrow
Like I jumped in your physical shell
While you was going through miserable hell saying goodbye to tomorrow
Everyday it make me sad, angry, mad how you were sent to heaven sacred path
Duct taped and gagged plus raped and stabbed body draped in blood what a faith to have
Such a pitiful end I'm popping Ritalin like they skittles cause
When I sleep I can feel it again and again and again it's difficult
Killing is the wickedest biblical sin I'm talking about momma's identical twin
I see your face when I look at her
Her reminder of how I've been in the cold
Since 14 years old
Swear to God I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I'm hearing is wind and raindrops. (Rest in peace Chacha)

[Chorus]

Nah I ain't move bricks on the peter pan
No father around to teach me how to be a man
We was too high didn't know when we would land
Scraping coke on the weed til' niggas didn't see a plant
Alcoholic's child raise off of sugar water
Headed to you and just thought about how good he was brought up
Coulda woulda outta one track mind
They say man of many hats buys a hooker for a quarter
And now I'm writing a book and the hoods the author
Called the ""Obvious Poker Face The Look of Torture""
Teach you how to climb your way out that ditch then
Me all I need is this pen and thick skin
Being so bright could mean you lit then
Cause you start trying to figure out a figment
I'll probably be in heaven when the pain stops
Til then all I hear is wind and rain drops

[Chorus]

(Check it out)
I'm still waiting on my did to get back
He went to the store in 84 and I ain't seen him after that
Another single mom public assisted the rent wasn't consistent
So they had us back and forth to court in the months of the blizzard (Freezing)
My sneakers leaned the rubber was missing
No one on ones they always jumped me no brothers and sisters to hold me down
Along with headphones plugged into a cheap Walkman that ate tapes
Gun shots and me sleep walking I hate weights
A whole lot of crying police chalking that fate tape
Ambulance never on time they like a day late
My cousin ain't had to vacate my best friend since age eight
Sometimes I can't hold them I kid you not
Eyes get swollen holding on that tissue box
Somebody get a mop

Never give somethin' that's not respectable
Never spit somethin that's not incredible
Never sold my soul for numbers left of the decimal
I done fucked up movements like cerebral palsy
You don't know me, don't pause me, I'll throw lead at you
Mean I earned e'ry stripe and you know it
When you see me put yo' hand on yo' head and push it forward

Before shots land on your head and push it forward
Eastside Long Beach, I'm only pushin' four words
I organize a street massacre
You haters know I broke bread with at least half of ya
Out of town, hundred pound weed trafficker
Got niggaz rockin' Long Beach fitteds in East Africa
I been stabbed, I been shot, a imperfect part
Like my Grape Street niggaz I got a Purple Heart
I kill your bitch at the beauty salon on Windham
They take a nap on your lawn on a Louis Vuitton pillow
Waitin' for you to run out and say somethin'
Come out your face frontin', dumb out and spray somethin'

Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

Furiously dangerous

Death by lyrical injection
I kill you rappers
A lot of green with a yellow complexion
Women call me the Green Bay packer
I pack the zeros
Meaning mucho deniro
So paid, rappers is waitin’ on trades and they all get Knicked like Melo
Hello, Luda!
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waist but I call it a tummy tuck
My every records jumping, or playing double dutch
I shit on rappers every verse just got the bubble guts

Let me tell this to the people not understanding my moxie
Animal, watch me
If you think it’s tangible, stop me
But then I hit ‘em with a flow, that they can’t even copy
See, we don’t play that
Where I’m from it’s like fantasy hockey
Sup with the dog, thugs want a war
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for?
While you cuffin ‘em all, I’m stuffing her jaw
Then leave em for you to rebound Kevin Love on the boards
Dog, you and your skill retard hard from of our squad
I put you on a crash course in a smart car
Gon' speeding not relying on the brake pad
The car you should only drive on the race track
So the lyings bout your feelings and your Maybach
Are ghost tails for the Phantoms face facts
We ruin hip hop, slaughterhouse and payback
In the shape of a tat, you done faded to black
Go

I went from eating top ramin to being top rhymer
Check full of commas
No regrets except for the drama
I remember a time when my only perfection was my momma
My mind in the wrong direction
Now it’s time ya bow down and rep ? in my honor
Writ in my honor cause bitch I’m bonker, plural
In a whip with my Ivanka, pompous girl
She on E, feeling on me, singing on key
While I’m bumping We Are The World
Got a sniff from Britney, no he didn’t did he
“We run this town”
No he didn’t did he
I feel like tinting the glass,
You take a sip with me
She from the city of Jackson
I call her Mississippi, that was pretty witty
Your man like a black man tryna' get re-elected
He ain't get it, did he?

Sticking it to the pedal
Pedal to the floor
Just whipping it through the ghetto
Metal in the door, case I gotta throw some lead into ya, boy
Referee mind state, I’m settling the score
I don’t know what ya'll hating for
Wait, wait, know what, matter fact
I don’t know what you’re waiting for
I ain't finna say nothing, turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneakers spot
See I was a little kid with his thumbs in his ears
And his tongue in his ear going na na na na na
Just when you think it stop na na na na na
Everything I speak is hot
But don't be mad at least everything you speak is
I can’t think of nothing nice to say, you’re not nice okay

Rapper, hustler, entrepreneur
My shit fly like I’m launching manure
Lord of the underground, God of the saw
On Hennessy black, ? to the jaw
Yeah I’m off the block
This ain't work, homie, I’m off the clock
I’m a syllable, Hannibal, killer cannibal
With a mechanical mandible to deliver the flammable
Ammo, lyrical animal off the top
Rep that West till I walk with Pac
We the two point 0 boys, Tiz, Crook, and Joe, Royce
New ghost Rolls Royce, pulled off the lot
Cock me, the only way you can stop me
I’m top seed, I pop green at mach speed
So watch me, if you haven’t seen the phenomenon
I spit fast as Lamborghini’s and Ramadan

We’re so furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous
Furiously dangerous

I suggest you shut it down
Pack your ‘ish and turn around
Because tonight, we run this town
So let your feet, still swiftly hit the ground

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

Just acts of fear and love'

He had the weight of the world on his back
He loved the birds and the sun
He would make quick money
Settle scores with his hands
But little did he know back then
That there were flaws in his plans
Things went a little too far
Got lost in his own design
Lost his footing on the ladder
He carelessly continued to climb
Fell down from a great height
Into the hands of the law
He got sentenced to eight long years
But he'll be out in four

If you are on our side you're right, if not you're wrong

Is our guilt erased by the pain that we've endured?

Hey look it's time to pledge allegiance
I love my dirty Uncle Sam
Our country's marching to the beat now
And we must learn to step in time

Where is the questioning? Where is the protest song?
Since when is skepticism un-American?
Dissent's not treason but they talk like it's the same
Those who disagree are afraid to show their face

Let's break out our old machines now
It sure is good to see them run again
Oh gentlemen start your engines
And we know where we got the oil from

Are you feeling alright now?
Paint myself all red, white and blue
Are you singing let's fight now?
Innocent People die, uh oh
There are reasons to unite
Is this why we unite?
If you hate this time
Remember we are the time!

Show you love your country, go out and spend some cash
Red, white, blue hot pants doing it for Uncle Sam
Flex our muscles show them we're stronger than the rest
Raise your hands up baby, are you sure that we're the best?

We'll come out with our fists raised

Stay away from the burning house
Once you get inside you'll never get out
We'll die together before the flames go out
Did it burn you baby make you scream and shout?
Build it up just to tear it down
There's nothing left but ashes of doubt

Put it in the ground sing a funeral song
Have the neighbors over and they'll sing along
Lowering the coffin on a love gone wrong
Hey there now what did you bury today?

You think there's something here for you
Go out and buy yourself a clue

In Hollywood where all the lights are low
And truth's as rare as the winter snow

Where her only job was never to grow old

I'm packaged in

Sleater-Kinney,"Let's meet in the city where

Let's go float down into the stream
Of rich and poor pioneers

Wants to be seen, and go out

Let's stay out all night up there
And Burnside will be our street
Where the kids and the hookers meet
Diners and strip club junk
Bookstores and punk rock clubs

I'm as green as this blade
In the grass that bends
In the wind that blows
On the long weekends
Where I cross the bridge
To the water fountains
And drink in the hope
That the city brings

Big Oregon city draws you in
A promise fulfilled or not
Just hang on until the summer, it's hot)

We'll make our home water-tight
Work all day, play all night
And hope we're not washed away
By deceit or tragedy
And Joan of Arc rules northeast
Where the poor and the hipsters meet
The grid that divides us all
The river makes final call
Out at the edge of town
Where airfield runs water down
Coyote crosses old tracks
And hops on the Light-Rail Max

And if you wanna be a friend of mine
Cross the river to the east side
Find me on the eve of suicide
Tell me the city is no place to hide

We're closer to Heaven than we'll ever know

But strip away all of the technology
And you will see
That we all are hunters
Hunting for something that will make us okay

Here we lay alone
In hospital beds, tracing life in our heads
But all that is left
Is that this was our entrance and now it's our exit
As we find our way home

And all the blood and all the sweat
That we invested to be loved
Follows us into our end
Where we begin to understand

That we are made of love
And all the beauty stemming from it
We are made of love
And every fracture caused by the lack of it

""You were a million years of work""
Said God and His angels, with needle and thread

They kissed your head and said
""You're a good kid and you make us proud
So just give your best and the rest will come and we'll see you soon""

All the blood and all the sweat
That we invested to be loved
Follows us into our end
Where we begin to understand

When the credits have rolled and the tears have dried
The answers that we have been dying to find
Are all pieced together and, somehow
Made perfectly mine

In the streets with no fear of them being taken away

That's just the truth

And make you whole again

And I'll watch you fade away

So why don't you just fire me down
So what if you could fire me down
I've been medicated for way too long
So please please why don't you fire

I cannot breathe
I can't make a sound
I'm already sick of this town

Rico used to tell me when I turned nineteen 

That Imma be big in the south like buffalo wings 

And I been blowing up the spot since the single came out 

And I'm starting to make a lil money it's getting hard to count 

And if I carry any with me it's in a small amount 

And I keep the rest in a stash by my auntee house

Sleepy Brown,"What does love look like?
Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of please we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love
Till ain't nothing but Stankonia

Damn, what a difference a year and a hundred and 12 days makes
Came the longest country mile, thanks to nothin they gave me I made breaks
Basically baby, I've been great, this ain't no recent development
But now it's official I'm the doo-doo, and you ain't gon' keep 'em from smellin it
Do you have a speaking impediment bitch, or are you just at a loss for words
Oh-no actually I'm monogonous, all that talk was false you heard
So don't stall betty just slurp, of course I'ma tell you when
Oops my bad that's my mistake, I was just gonna tell you then
I just bought me 5 new Polos, 'cause see I'm partial to that logo
That horse is just so Bubba, that means rural like you don't know
Regardless though I'm gon' glow, even in my birthday suit
And when it comes to that soft, yes sir'ee I circle that too
So when you feel it poundin in yo' chest and it causes a slight pain
Just shake it off and smile I got'cha, doin the white thangs ok

Bartender, send me Remi, Henny or straight shot
Then see me flee, high speed from eight cops
Leave 'em floored, showin how I'm opposed, y'all can't stop
Jumped the fence, went down the path, came out by Ms. Dot 'partment
Ay, ay Bubba Sparxx shoot we down to the spot
Them young G's up on that corner, done made the porch hot
Them folk say they sweepin, seekin 'He who hold stock'
Ay, run tell shawty, cut off, close shop
I told them boys down there, homes in the van was a NARC
Tell 'em ""Naw we don't sell that shit round here doc""

Go West, South, and East, whatever the way
Let's make a move, hurry up lets go now
You got to believe we can get away
I'm tired of doing what the devils say
We got nothing to lose, take my hand lemme help ya
I want to be free, see man brother
I want to be free, help each other
I want to be free, love ya sister
I want to be free, don't you miss her
I want to be free I want to be free

Master say being born colored was the worst disease
And we the worst to bread, worse than flees
As long as I work for he, I work for free
He beat me like a dick in jail and cursed at me
I'm certain we, weren't put on this earth to be, Bustled
Nobody deserve to be, hustled
Look here, run I dare ya
I catch ya, I'ma give ya more lashes than mascara
If its pride or die, I'm choosing respect
I saw my daddy hung dead, wit a noose on his neck
My niece got raped pregnant, won't tell she scared
Master done it, but she blaming it on drop dead Fred
But one day, things gon' change for better
Lord knows it can't rain forever
that's what I told my momma
Two days later master sold my momma (master sold my momma)

Through all seasons, Winter, Fall, Summer, and Spring
Picking, pushing, pulling, cutting the field
Sweating bout to dehydrate, stuck in the heat
and when its cold, joints lock up barker than trees
Rest, I don't get enough of my sleep
cause master got us working late night, and then waking up in the wee
Hours of the morning, stacking stalks of hay
Hoping the rain from dawn til shower day
Wishing I could walk away
But then I think about Hardaway
Master cut off his hand
cause you can't talk or sing or speak from your mouth
If it ain't what master talk or say
But I was taught to pray to the Lord and have faith
Please take me away from this awful place
cause you can be so off today

Gotta spend my time off the destructive by getting by doe bubbling
can't risk stumbling, fumbling
So I'm bout taking my life, dice tumbling
I drop down the road, trying to get that pot of gold
Still out in the field, mobbing with Sean and Smoke
9 times, nine to five, I'm troop serving
Nine, you bout trying to eat well, get in line
'cause momma got laid off, the lil' sis need shoes
My brother just got popped back in his county blues
and Pops been made it off, there was no money, no food

To see who wants to come and be with me
I'll take you back to the flat so I can show you where it's at, c'mon
Ohh, wee - look at me
Movin 'cross the floor so easily
Oh, my, can't deny
This funk starts high in the sky
I'm 'bout to get my groove on
Uhh, I'm 'bout to bust a move on 'em
Uhh, there's no-thing you can do for 'em
Uhh, cause I'm checkin the spot if you really like it or not

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I know you hate it, I'ma say it to you anyway
I'm 'bout to throw them 24's on that Escalade
Still I got the Mickey T's on the Chevrolet
Z-7-1, the mere sight'll take your breath away
It's today but I'm still on it like it's yesterday
Throw me the ball, this the game that I was bred to play
And pass the cooler with this stewardess named Desireé
You ain't no concern, I'ma wait and see what Heaven say
I got a brother by the name of Snicky Ricky Wade
He said - Bubba, real careers ain't quicky quickly made
My other brother by the name of Patrick ""Sleepy"" Brown
Said that our +Noize+ is the type that you should keep around
They led me through the forest, took me to the wizard Ray
He told me that tomorrow won't be what it is today
I said, ""Damn, that's just what my brother Tim would say""
I'm back at home, just how long have I been away?

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm the type that you might see with Petey Pablo
Chasin fielder's dream with corn and three Diablos
And I'll be blessed to death if I see tomorrow
But I'ma live to get my son a lead that he can follow
I might can't flip a brick but bet that I can move a pound
And if you call yourself the king, well then there's two in town
Regardless where you from, what you do, or who you found
You best to get to practice early for the shoot-around
Cause Bubba don't play, do them thangs you won't say
Be damned if I even pull my {dick} out and don't spray
Daddy told me just to do them thangs he never did
Breakin broads, get money, live your life and treasure it
And that's the least that I can do, for the man who
raised me up and through his faults helped me understand you
And now I'm certified, New South pioneer
Born and raised down here, best believe I'm dyin here

[Chorus]

Sendin' you, flowers and candy to your family 
And I think it's cute how you used to live wit yo granny, maan (Luv me baby) 
Work in the mornings, school in the evening, weekday to weekend 
Teachin reasons I'm the one you believe in 
Demolish ya def, acknowledge yourself 
Now you rock a small belt from my nutriential belt (Luv me baby) 
I'm the god mami, teach you what you need to be taught 
And these feelings that I brought, ma they all in ya thoughts 
You can't love nobody 'til you love you

Spoil me mama, back rub oil me mama 
When I'm left over aluminum, foil me mama 
I'ma be therre when you wake up hungry 
You can call me your homie 
I'ma be therre when you straight up lonely (Luv me baby) 
And I ain't tryin' to get mushy ya dig? 
And all pushy ya dig? I just like the fact ya tushy is big 
Can I touch it, touch it? maybe caress it and rub it? 
Take advantage of it, show me your private booty in public (Luv me baby)

Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat!
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack!
As we strut skip the line through the glass window glance
We look fine, right on time
As we step in the place the nursery's crunk we've come to play
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me! Throw your hands up if you feel me!

The girls all pause with glee, turning left turning right are they looking at me?
Cause I was looking at them, there, there on the dance floor
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore
Specially the big girl, big girls need love too no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks, and let me study how you ride the beat
You big freak!
Skinny, slim women got the camel toe within them
You can fuck them, lift them, bend them, give them something to remember
Yell out timber when they fall through the chop shop
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend, boyfriend was boring as hell

Think I'ma try something that I ain't, that I ain't never did before on this one
Let's go

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).

Got a lil' bit of blueberry yum yum, and I never would of thought that it could taste this good,
Thank God for the man who put it in my hood,
It's got me singing melodies I never thought I would.
I'm feelin' sorry for the homies who be smokin' wood.
Chop chop, break it down for a player like me ye ye ye ye ye ye,
I'm 'bout to find me a woman that skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet,
I'ma keep smoking 'til I reach my peak peak peak peak peak peak peak peak peak,
Or 'til I'm stuck, and my body feels weak weak weak weak weak weak,
Headed down to the dungeon, wonderin', if they got some more,
Well, if they don't, then I'ma have to settle fah some dro.
But it just ain't cool 'cause right on afta, I'ma have to go
And continue on my mission, fishin', for the yum yum, but I'm movin' slow.

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).

(Yes) Fire, fire got me so tired, I'ma stop, drop, and roll,
Put a wet towel under the door.
Don't pass it, I can't take it no more,
Somebody take a trip down to the store.
Hurry please 'cause I need some snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks snacks...
And how long will it take to get back back back back back back?!?
Yes indeed, I'm a lil' off track track track track track track track,
Off this beat and I'm full of dat Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak Yak,
Get on in that stankin' Lincoln, crank it up and ride,
And it ain't enough room to fit the, other chicks inside.
I'm so hungry with the munchies I'ma eat everything, in sight.
Me and my blueberries together and everything's, alright.

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).

Get the propane, rollin' things and let's blow this place up,
You already know what's up.
I might f had to pay some extra bucks,
But I really don't give a fuck.
Cause a brother feels great great great great great great great great,
But I'm barely awake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake wake,
All bent outta shape shape shape shape shape shape shape,
So stomp on yo' brake brake brake brake brake brake brake,
If you toting good, then all the smokers, let me see ya flame.
Don't know what you got, but my bag'll, put yo' stuff, to shame.
All the different kinds and other flavors, they don't mean a thing,
You can't compare it, don't stare, 'cause I got the ultimate Mary Jane.

Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).
Got that blueberry yum yum and it's that fire (It's that fire).
Get your lighters, roll that sticky, let's get higher (Let's get high).

Sleepy Brown,"I come, they go, I run, they slow
I ain't ashamed that I did what I did
I just live how I live, you don't like it, say so
Ain't a singer on my payroll

I'm platinum, they're probably that gold
Buckhead bouncing, move a little ounces
Talking out loud, but I ain't low
Wait for the day that Bubba can't blow

And get them fo?sho, bitch can't blow
S.V. style, you know what I'm talking about
Mo?fucking bank account, you say Os
These hoes better stay on their toes

The big play threat, I just may go
87 yards in the blink of an eye
It really don't matter what you think of the guy
'cause I'm eager to try this style, and that style

And stack piles of cash, while sayin' something
Dudes agile, hear that? Wow, a bad child that turned good
Now, I've earned good, but I've burned better
That cush, please just sush, wuss, I'm the team captain
Get your first letter, bitch
(Pussy)

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

I remember when we used to carry them things
Back in the days
Hot as a flame and I'm setting through the blaze
Homey, full of hate

Dollar bill full of cane
It?s the mister motherfucker with a hundred different names
Ain't fuck with nobody
Can't roll no problem, diamond

Never could quite understand a man that never talked how to
Stay to himself, quiet as kept
With a coldness in his eyes that will scare you to death
I was on my way, man I had one foot in the grave

Motherfucker, I stayed contemplating about my last and final day
I'm supposed to be nothing, they were supposed to give me life in prison
Last pick, misfit, probably did a full twenty, hey, I'm right here, head up
Got the whole world shaking for me, I said

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

Maybe death and taxes ain't the only thing certain
To come unnerved from out behind the closed curtain, bubba skirting
What's the word? You must have heard a lot of BS was asserted
Since none of us is perfect, wonder who it was unnerving

Not me, not you, grin and bear it? Got to
If they ain't worried about you, then they ain't worried about you
Hear, hear, get it clear, disappear from out my hemisphere
If indeed you've got some business here, then state it crystal clear

All this fake innuendo from little minnows
Is gonna make the big goldfish unload on the fish hole
Fuck Cane and Nate, baby tell me that it is so
I?d rather watch my momma get low than quit this, fo? sho, yo

You thinking, you dead, boy?
Know where I'm at, boy?
I'm on the other side of the room, your lady feel frisky
Tell her come get me, I'm on the other side of the room

If you came to party, let's go get it started
I'm on the other side on the room
Whether you with me or you're against me
I'm on the other side of the room

We spent summer dreaming, when we could be leaving,
I get wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up
I guess I'll get you in your dreams
I guess I'll get you in your dreams
I get wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up
I guess I'll get you in your dreams

The moon's around my sun, and my nights around my days
Nocturnal creature by habit Bruce Wayne know what I mean
I mean I'm in between sunset and sunrise
As its on type of nigga for the home invasion surprise
Mother fucker pow-pow lay the fuck down now
Now no, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non violent, positively vibing
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you,
Why? I don't know, I don't even understand it
But it's simply overstood how you really suppose to handle it,
Pardon me one moment I just went off on a tangent

[Chorus]

Typical day off in the A, aye
But nicks up the Chevrolet, aye
Nigga wanna rob okay, okay
Where he stand is where he lay, aye
Keep looking at me with a gangsta grill,
I'm gonna give your ass a gangsta's pill,
That's a little piece of lead, taken to the head
That nigga ain't live, that nigga there dead
Taken dirt naps, sleeping with the fishes,
Done like dishes, this a wrap like Christmas
Big Boi, you say the word I'll make these niggas dreams a nightmare
I will bust there motherfucking head, ha ha ha ha ha ha

Your ridin', killin', feelin', straight chillin',
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up

We roastin', boastin', flowin', straight coastin'
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up

That's the way a

Keep spinnin', we grillin', bendin', straight pimpin'
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up (yeah)

Now we know when, (know when), holding, (holding) showing, controlling,
I feel wild and don't give a fuck, see you when the sun come up (oh)

Sleepy Brown,"Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony, then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids, the minivans
Standin' in the stands, like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball, and everytime you see the family they look happy
Got her mama and her daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride, decide not to divide
Kept the yam and the pie the spouse in the house
Boy, it's cheaper to keep her, you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog, cuss words flow like
(Motherfuckaer shit gotdamn asshole)
Took my shit (beitch) fuck!

Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

It was the night that they did dipped and all throughout the palace
That didn't do us part, heartbroken, no more marriage (beitch)
When it happens you'll be slappin yourself rememberin'
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you sittin' in the courthouse plaintiff and defendant
Pleadin' to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid, see she was grinnin' and spendin'
All of her time wit the kids an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove, it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late
But now we just debate like some candidates, damn I hate
Friction, wishin' I had paperwork on the misses but I didn't
Damn, fuckin' around

Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows what I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend

Girl you have to remember
I gotta provide for the family and future
So please stay down and please stay around 'cause you know
That I'm tryna change but it's hard 'cause I've been this way
(Man you already knew that shit)

Or are all y'all bored?
It's good to have y'all back now
Ladies and gents
Y'all already know what it is
God don't make no mistakes
God don't make no mistakes

Little do they know when I was brought up into this game
Point ain't always in a vibe for spitting I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kind of, sorta
'Cause when I saw her I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared dog
Back in '94 that was the motherfucking year homeboy
Then that southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen we was practicing
Reciting rhymes to sharpen minds now lets deliver to the masses

[Chorus]
It's been a good long road
Now its time for me to go
I say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Time to spread my wings
And high up in the sky
I can fly, I'll fly, I'll fly, so high

Welcome to my life I think its time I take it back
I got to give you all the facts so you can see what type of cat
That you dealing with now on ATLiens we was killing it
And then my auntie pass she was like my mother I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and grandaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's yo birthday even on your worst day
Live it like the first day I'm Antwan Andre
Or General Patton if you know bout Purple Ribbon or Got Purp
I, I be on that kryptonite that means I can't be hurt
Gotta leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

[Chorus]

Even on the train
Should've asked two free mans
I'll be back again
(Know we been though a lot I ain't perfect but I swear
To you I'm a changed man)
Even on the train
Should've asked two free mans
I'll be back again
(From the caboose)

Now it's time to say goodbye they should've turned me loose
I was all about my team but now I call upon my crew
I'm a family type of person but I'm deadly dolo too
And you can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock
The nigga big still hit the stage by himself and still rock
Cause when your faith is in the right place see he ain't gon let you flop
You can say whatever you want (Bet you can't do it like me) Boy stop!!

Before you can say you can't get going
There's no excuse this time don't be afraid to fly
You never know what day the doors will close
It's time to say goodbye time to pack up and ride
Got to leave this place it's been cool but I gotta go

One time, one time

Easy, that cook shit got me sleepy
Rollin' down 85, leaning but I ain't weaving
Man, you should stay a day in the A
A parade of them Chevelots, colors of flavor aid

Can you, believe I got it made
Impala in the garage, got forces and all the J's
I'm leaning bad, ride shotgun in the Chevy
With the homeboy burning sacs

We heading to the spot where we get down
Where the bitches at, they talking right, acting right
Walking right, now to take flight, they ain't gotta go home
They can stay the night

You don't have to go home
You can stay right here, put one in the air
While we are in the, corners of my chrome
Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere, wait a while

Nigga hold up, hold up
Make sure they see you when you roll
Hop out that truck all ready fucked up
Tore up from the motherfucking floor up

From the floor up, to the ceiling
Smoke kiss in the walls in the top of the building
Little momma's on [unverified], sitting next to me
She's catching a feeling and I'm feeling, like I'm 'pose to

I'm as fly as a Jordon poster, I'm leaning hair breathe
Smelling like hen and a mix of hydroponic by the the time
My click find me in VIP I'm lost in a cloud of chronic had sex
With the best, got head from the rest, motherfucker believe I done it

You don't have to go home
You can stay right here, put one in the air
While we are in the, corners of my chrome
Same shit another year, in the southern hemisphere, wait a while

Hot tub tony sucka free and still bublin'
Truck still rattling and bumping now move something

Hold up Big Boi, I'm still weed crumpling
Sac keeps shaking and block keep jumping
Lay back, lay back, treat this eight six cut like a Maybac
Hey, show these suckas that after 50 million sold
Daddy fat sacs is still where the hood at, hood at

Hood rats and decoy be-boys understood that
Wheater its creme de la creme, where the good at
I got it in that 1.5, I had to put the swisher down
'Cause my lugs got tired, now let's ride, let's ride

Back down 85, five
With the click in the truck
Full of chick in the back of the 6
Nobody going home tonight

Everywhere that I seem to go, all people they know

There goes that man
Girl this ain't no kind of allusion, it's really that man
There goes that man

Hey, when we step up out the play man
We bring that monster A game
Switchin or say through lanes
Green on my shirt like Tulane
Drunk and drivin in two lanes
Dirt Reynolds, that's the new name
Dip out and handle a few thangs
Bet I come back a rich man
Some of these cats is bitch made
My shift be like a switch blade
The doors, open this way
That man, went that a way
Chase cheese like a rat race
Push my button like there
And that's gonna get you nowhere
Just like you fuckin yourself
I've been all over the globe and hit a lot little spots (spots)
Met bitches that love the nigga, that's if she fucked me or not (not)
Trappin what's in my spot (spot)
Not movin, just got me no dough
It's like my money was slow mo'
I bought a car and got Mobile
My city's up on my shoulders
I'm takin life as we know of
Tranformin into a whole 'nother world and time
Beat up tracks and murder rhymes
Don't dare close the curtain, cause I'm just beginnin
Bubba was the beginnin but bitch I'ma end it
Hey, I'm that man, man

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit, I'm a Dodge Rammer, god damn if I ain't two and 0
I'm competin and momma's eatin, so am I losin? No
But shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up
Destiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up
But Bubba ain't no cream puff
In my life, I've seen much
Held the thrills and the spills
Through it all, I kept it trill
Guarantee I never will ever feel as helpless
As I did these last couple years, I know you felt this
Really don't expect no forgiveness for ""Deliverance""
Then again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit
Cause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it
I'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit
Watched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits
I'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six
Pussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on
If you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]
Duddy! Haha
Uh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play
I just came with ""Me, Myself, and I"" like Beyonce
Let these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest
Country motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it
Everything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed
Three albums supplied, once I have not lied
That should mean a lot right?
Maybe when they open up the books, I can get a look
You must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much
Of my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up
Sorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional
That shit ain't no bull
Ain't no bull that I can't pull, I am him
That'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them
Bubba baby, more trouble baby, ha I love you hate me
Ask your lady, is it maybe her that I've been pluggin lately

We all on the get up to come down

We back at it one mo' gain'
Cranking my motor, revving my engine
Chilling the AC til' it's colder than a breeze in Alaska
Sun shine like the winter time just passed us
Watching for laws and jackers
Cuz', this shit here too clean to be taken
I keep it tucked off in my clothes you never catch me out her bucket naked
Fresh drawls, them desktop Js for the caskets
Pressing up on these bastards that owe me and I gots to have it
Wake up and cake up 'cause' it's only right
Soon as the sun go down, the freaks come out and they gon' dress in summer tights
I'm tryna dig deep, Ginger-ale and Hennessy
It keep me in the zone, I'm like long til' the clock strike twelve
One mo' then I'm out of the front door

If you ain't eating with you squad, you's a hoe nigga

A wild young nigga off on Calverton road
I was raised on Kings ridge where there wasn't no rules
Robbing niggas for they Starter jackets and shoes
Yeah, I've done some real things, family full of fiends
Forty ounce of Old English, and new some Newport kings
Pocket full of pieces and 74' Caprisces
Europeans in a crib in Buckhead, thank you Jesus
Boy, I'm sweet James Jones when I'm whipping up a ritz
I'm really on my wrist and a super bad bitch
And you know it's southside, you can tell by the parlor
Give it a good look cuz' there'll never be another
Hoes, a hundred spokes, what you expect?
Trust me, money can't buy you that respect

I just had to call ya

Big T and I'm from Chicago
You know I gotta represent the city doe
A nigga fin' to shoot a new video
So I'm fin' to take a trip out to Cali yo
Took a flight, ten of us in a group
Hit the West coast, now I'm fuckin' with Snoop
Told a few hoes to come up to the shoot
And she was lookin' so cold pullin' up in the Coupe
Pretty skin tone, a nigga got y'all
Soon as I took a look at them big brown eyes
Fat ass, my dick got hard
Soon as I took a look at the big brown thighs
Too sassy, bet you doin' nasty
And I can tell it when I'm lookin' at the way you walk
Thick lips, ready for suckin'
And a nigga wanna fuck you when I listen to the way you talk
I'm a do it like this when I drop at you
Let you know that I'm the Twist' when I pop at you
Comin' at you in the Mission Impossible
Let's go to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles
Then as soon as we leave we gon' have to go and get naughty
Then when I come back (chirrp) (hello?) Whassup shawty?

Had to call you, comin' through,
Me and you, I had to holla,

Girl hook up the phone, pick it up quick
It's Snoop Dogg, you know you gotta get wit
the game that I spit, the way that I rip
Let's, go and do, this
Ride, ride, slip and slide
I'm comin' by, let a nigga inside
What we gon' do, it's all upon you
What I say, what it do?
Do, no not you, you know I got to
And if you got me, then I got you
I'm a player, youse a player
We some players, so we should play a
game, do yo' thang
Ain't it man, turn the lights off
Hit the right spot (oh)
Make me feel how I wanna feel
But it can't happen if you ain't real
Don't, you, play with me
Come and spend, the day with me

Mirror mirror on the wall
Who's the dopest of 'em all
Gots to be Big Snoop Dogg
So pick up the phone and answer my call

How, long, has it been
Since you had that thang up in

I miss that love
Really cause, I miss that bitch

And I love it when you hit that switch
Shorty tell me how you get that thick
Where the fuck did you get that fit
Come and fire the 'dro up let me hit that shit

That when I had went home
I was thinkin' 'bout you so hard

Stack o' dollars
Stack o' dollars
Long as I am tall
Hey now, mama get some

Stack o' dollars
Just long as I am tall
If you be my woman
You can have them all

I heard a-rumblin'
I heard a-rumblin'
Way down in the ground
Hey now mama, an I
I heard a-rumblin'
Way down in the ground
Must of been somebody
Slowly jumpin' down

See two women
See two women
Walkin' hand by hand
Hey now mama, you see
See two women, they
Walkin' hand by hand
They just spinned up something, Lord
Out to fool some man

Went on the mountain
Went on the mountain
Looked down in the sea
Hey now mama, an I
Went on the mountain, an I
Looked down in the sea
Little girls had my womans
Lord, an the blues had me

Baby done quit me
Baby done quit me
Ain't said a mumblin' word
Hey now mama
Baby's done quit me
Ain't said a mumblin' word
It were nothin' that she know'd, Lord 
It's something she had heard.

",Stack O' Dollars,1997
Sleepy John Estes,"I went back to Ohio 
But my city was gone 
There was no train station 
There was no downtown 
South Howard had disappeared 
All my favorite places 
My city had been pulled down 
Reduced to parking spaces 
A, o, way to go Ohio

Well I went back to Ohio 
But my family was gone 
I stood on the back porch 
There was nobody home 
I was stunned and amazed 
My childhood memories 
Slowly swirled past 
Like the wind through the trees 
A, o, oh way to go Ohio

I went back to Ohio 
But my pretty countryside 
Had been paved down the middle 
By a government that had no pride 
The farms of Ohio 
Had been replaced by shopping malls 
And Muzak filled the air 
From Seneca to Cuyahoga falls 
Said, a, o, oh way to go Ohio",You Shouldn't Do That,1997
Sleepy John Estes,"Now, I'm goin' to Brownsville an
Take that right hand road
Now, I'm goin' to Brownsville
Take that right hand road
Lord, I ain't gon' stop walkin'
'Till I get in sweet mama's do'

Now, the girl I'm lovin' 
She got the great, long, curly hair
Now, the girl I'm lovin'
She's got the great, long, curly hair 
An her mama an her papa
They sho' don't 'llow me there

If you catch my duffel
Hangin' upside yo' wall
If you catch my duffel
Hangin' upside yo' wall
Now, you know by that, babe
I need my ashes hauled

Now, what cha' gon do, babe
Yo' doughroller gone?
What you gon do, babe
Yo' doughroller gone?
Go in yo' kitchen, Lordy 
Cook until she comes.",The Girl I Love She Got Long Curly Hair,1999
