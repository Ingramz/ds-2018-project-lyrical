Oh yeah, yeah

Where there's no sun, there is that girl
She is the one, that spins my world
When I am down, she makes it better
When there are clouds, she change the weather
Not wishing well, oh my peace and my glory
As a fairytale, then she is my story
When I feel drained, her love is like a fountain
And when I'm weak, she can move mountains

I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy this way
Till my lady Sunday came

Oh I am her crown and he is my sky
If life is a road, then she is my ride
When I'm in pain, she's my good feeling
When I am sick she brings me healing
Whenever I call, she is right there
And when I fall, she says a prayer
When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it
Introducing Missus Music

I never felt a love, no, this way
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy this way
Till my lady Sunday came

La da da da, Miss Got-Ge, Miss Righteous, Miss Hallelujah
Take my hand and be my Missus Future
'Cause your loving makes the groove much better
As long as we got music, as we got music
As long as we got music, we'll dance forever

I never felt a love, no no no no, this way
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy this way
Till my lady Sunday came

I never felt a love this way, no
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy this way
Till my lady Sunday came

I never felt a love this way, no
I never felt a kiss no, this way
I never felt joy this way
Till my lady Sunday came

I'm so glad, yeah",Lady Sunday,2012

R. Kelly,"How he makes her feel
When he look her in the eyes and tell her
I love you, yeah

When he whispers and says
I'll never leave you
And he speaks them words to her heart
And make her feel like she on top
Of the world, yeah, oh my
Then turn around and break her heart
And make her feel like the whole world's on top of her, whoa
And now some other man can talk about it

When a man lies, he pierces the very soul of that woman
Yes he does, yeah
I'm just telling the truth
When a man lies, he kills every reason
She ever had for loving him, yeah
Mirror I'm talking to you, yeah

How he promised her things
While he's making sweet love to her mind
Selling big dreams, yeah
That's what he do, or he can paint the scene
With every word out of his mouth
Make her wanna believe, oh she believes
That everything that he says is true
Now all the dreams she bought and the tales he told
Cinderella to the old pot of gold
Broke up for a heart and stole the glory
And he left me here to tell the story

R. Kelly,"I don't know how to make it stop, no

I got a phobia when it comes to heights
Even if it's a first class flight
And as a kid, I never really liked to climb
If you pushed me hard on a swing, then I'd cry

If I had a dream that I was flying,
Then I'd wake up in a panic, screaming

And now you take me up and away with you
Push me out of the plane with no parachute
And now I'm gonna need somebody to catch me
It's like I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
I'm falling from the sky (sky, sky)
It's like I'm falling form the sky (sky, sky)

When I come down (down, down, down)
Will you catch me?
When I come down (down, down, down)
When I come down

I never ever wanted to climb a ladder
And I never wanted a house in the hills
I'm comfortable living in a big high rise
'Cause in nightmares of getting killed
I never wanted to swim, the water there was too deep
Put me up on the roof, you couldn't pay me to leave
Even if I was bummin' on the streets
You couldn't pay me to leave

And now you take me up and away with you
Push me out of the plane with no parachute

R. Kelly,"This song goes out
To all the people out there that be running they mouth
And they don't know what
The hell they sayin'
Shut up!

Now that I've got my voice back let me start off sayin' that
I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back
And I just wanna thank God upstairs for keeping His hands on me
And keeping all the doctors focused through my surgery
Now, there's a couple of things I gotta get off my chest
Some serious issues that I must address so
Well, let's just get right to people said that I was done
Said there was no way this time he's gonna over come
And even before the doctors was done and I could awake
A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away
After twenty two years of a blessed career
Had me lying in my hospital bed crying mad tears ooh
But just as I have many people hatin' me
Had so many people loving me
And let's not forget the hood around the world covering me
And to everybody that be calling me
Telling what they've been sayin' about me
Bringin' all of this negative s*** and
Y'all the ones I ain't f***ing with
It's time for me to evaluate the people that I let up in my space
Can I get a witness for all of this
When people all up in your business

Tell 'em shut up, tell 'em shut up
Tell 'em shut up!
I'm talking to you
Tell 'em all shut up,
Tell 'em all shut up
Tell 'em all shut up
And tell 'em, I'm talking to you

He's washed up, he's lost it
He ain't gotta no more
Well I'm here to tell you today boy you haters are so slow
And it saddens me to know
Some of y'all want me to go away
Well when it's time for me to go
My God is gonna orchestrate
Until then I will accept the stones
Pray and try to get along but sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong
See I got kids and I'm tryin' to love 'em
So many things that I'm tryin' to juggle
But I never thought this music would become my struggle oh
The news said I lost my house my own people put me down
And my friends no longer around no
But you see deep underneath the surface
I feel something's working in my behalf a victory is near yeah
See my future ain't my past it's not the end of the hour glass
Who said it would not last
Fans sick they a**

Tell 'em shut up, shut up, shut up
Tell 'em shut up, I'm talking
I'm talking to you, shut ooh, shut up, shut up, shut up y'all
Shut up, if you talking 'bout me I'm talking to you

Now seriously after all these hits and melodies and memories
You compare me to someone else O-M-G
Now no offense to the other artist but come on dawg
Let's be honest how many babies been made off me O-M-G
Seriously you gonna act like that
Sit there like it ain't no truth to that
Looking at me like I ain't talking stats O-M-G
Every boy, every girl, every child around the world
From the 90's up until today was made off me

R. Kelly,"Oh, welcome to a day of my life (day of my life)
The memoir of an imperfect angel

Woah, welcome welcome welcome to a day of my life
The memoir of an imperfect angel oh

Though the lights were low, I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still, I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows, just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara running
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this, happen in my own bedroom

Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when I get you back)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels (when we fade to black)
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse

Before we both get loud, I'ma break it down
And let you know what happened for real
I was over her house, me and her on the couch
And the whole plan was just to chill
And then it got hot, after taking some shots
The time must have slipped away
Because all I know, I woke hungover
And girl it was the very next day
With the sun in my face
I woke up in a rage
Screamed, ""What have you done to me?""
And I'm telling you babe
I know it sounds crazy, she must have put something in my drink, uh
I know you don't believe it
And you think I'm dead wrong
Standing there butt naked
With nothing but a sheet on
Then she come down
With nothing but a robe on
And that's when
I put my damn clothes on
Got the fuck up out of there

Girl you know I know how it looks
(See I know how it looks)
Baby you know I know how it looks
(But baby it ain't like that)
Girl you know I know how it looks eh eh eh eh
So don't go accusing me of something
That I didn't really mean to do

This is for real, for real, for real (no)
Oprah Winfrey whole segment, for real, for real (no)
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real (no)
60 Minutes for real

(Baby)
I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through
(You got me all crazy) (this is not my fault, no know it baby)
Somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk
(Your were supposed to save me) you were supposed to save me (I'ma love you)
Oh sweet baby (I don't love her, no)

The definition of a hotti
R. Kelly is born into the 90's
You know what I'm saying
With the new shebang swing
The definition of a hotti

This track is going out to all the hotties out there
You know what I'm saying
To all the fellas that don't know what a hotti is
I'm here to define the definition
So check this out

Yo here's the definition of a hotti
A girl with Noxema skin and a V-8 body
She can relate with your wildest dreams
By wearing a short skirt or nice tight jeans
She'll put you in shock
And clean you up with Clorox
And then you'll say
Damn, the hotti body is bare box
Lipstick shining
Ear rings glistening
Yo listen to me
As I kick the ballistics

Last night
I went to a club, to a club
To see if I could have myself some fun, yeah
All the ladies
Standing on the wall, standing on the wall
I'm not leaving
Till I catch me one, till I catch me one

Cuties, all the cuties
So fine, so fine
We could spend some time
You are, you are
The one, the one for me
Can we have some fun

Hey Hotti
Come on yeah

Don't too many fellas turn her on
But if you're kicking the funkies
Then her word is born
Its best to blend in with the program, yo
Play the same game
And then say thanks ma'am

Some hotties like to pose
But they warm you up
Just like a hot buttered roll
Some hotties don't carry a purse
Yeah it gets worse
Check the second verse

Last night
I took her out, I took her out
To see what we could get into
What we could get into
She showed me what she was all about
Hotti go it going on
What's a man to do, what's a man to do

Like when you got with your fame
They sit back
Act like they don't even know your name

R. Rell,"Now don't push me away 'cause when the first time I met you
Girl, you shook me in ways
You know the life of a nigga's cookin' up yay
And because you knew the pitfalls and the tumbles of the game

You've seen the spotlight watch niggas fallin' to the fame
And all the time you tried to tell me to stay hungry and maintain
When I was like let's go half on a baby
And if not then lets go half on a 'cedes

Drop top coup while we pumpin' sweet sadie
Flyin' up Lennox, doin' us, pushin' 80
The road trips, the late nights got you pissed
The road trips, the late nights got us rich

The clothes that we wear, the place that we piss
Run and get shot, we ain't what we sit
So if I don't get a chance to tell you
Now too often lately girl how your hand so helpful

In this cold world girl every man needs help too
So baby, I'ma ride and no plans to fail you

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

I had enough of the shucking and jiving, duckin' and hidin'
I'm tryin' to get to conversation and ridin'
'Cause I'm feelin' your essence your presence
Is just enough to let me know that it's destined

And since the day that I found you, there's something about you
That makes me want to lose it and pounce ya
But it's not just your body, it's your mind
Your spirit, everything combined

And while I got a chance, take my hand
And let me show you something real, that love you can feel

Please, baby, don't push me away
I want you
Please, baby don't push me away
I need you

Uh, now two years done passed, few cheers, few laughs
Coppin' Vs, shoppin' sprees gears in the bags
And who cares who's near 'cause most of the bitches
Would just say you was there for the cash

And I ain't scared of your past, I prepare for the future
The one thing I ask is just don't tear a nigga coup up
You brang the bail when I was caged up
And back and forth the court to the lawyer now we case shut

You found the numbers in my phone, you was my face but
You know what they say the break ups to make ups
And I admit I'm getting better with the flirtin'
You know you dead sexy when you yellin' and you cursin'

You such a hell of a person
So when I get home I'm gonnna tell you in person
Face to face, I'ma run base to base
And then I'ma slide home safe till I make yo body shake

You tell me every night that life comes with a twist
That I'm in the spotlight and I'm runnin' the risk
Hey, you always say love don't come with a kiss
It's hard soakin' up game when it's comin' from a bitch

But where's my manners, never take you for granted?
Never take you advantage, most people don't understand it
Is you happy? Look inside humor
When you and I together what the fuck they gonna do wit us?

Say ya prayer 'cause we destined for glory
And when the credits roll it's Harlem's West Side Story

My vision of the lovin' is close
That's how I want us to be when we doin' our thing
Kissin' ya, lickin' ya, touchin' ya, rubbin' ya
Tell me how you want me to bring it?

Because I know he got limits
But baby I don't, and my feelin's they won't
Let you get away from me, come stay with me
Baby, baby, please, baby, don't push me away

When the sunshine turn to rain
Baby, I can take away your pain
Just call me up when you need some time
I'll take you out, break you off like daddy come on

You don't have to settle for less
And baby, I can give you what you want
Just call me up when you need some time
And you can get it from me just like daddy come on

Shit, so don't push me away

I'm breakin' loose, it ain't no use
Holdin' me down, stick around

But baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women and their fortunes
Who just want to mother orphans
Are you gonna cry, when I'm squeezin' the rye
Takin' all I can get, no regrets
When I, openly lie
And leave only money
Believe me honey, that money
Can you believe, I ain't no saint
No complaints
So girl go out
Hand it out

And baby (baby)
Remember (remember)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But some day I'll treat you real fine

(It's my life and I'll do what I want) Don't push me
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want) It's my life
(It's my life and I'll do what I want) And I can do what I want
(It's my mind and I'll think what I want) You can't tell me
(It's my life and I'll do what I want)

R. Stevie Moore,"If you've found another guy
Who satisfies you more than I do
Run to him, I'll step aside

If you think his lips can kiss you
Better than my lips can kiss you
Run to him, forget my pride

If someone else's arms can hold you
Better than my arms can hold you
Go to him and show to him all your emotion

If someone else can make you
Happier than I can make you
Run to him, my tears will dry

Better than my arms can hold you

Then run to him",Run to Him,1981
R. Stevie Moore,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

R. Stevie Moore,"I hear music when I look at you,
A beautiful theme of every
Dream I ever knew.
Down deep in my heart I hear it play.
I feel it start, then melt away.

I hear music when I touch your hand,
A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain:
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song
My heart would sing?

Of love and youth and spring,

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

I miss my childhood and all I've known

Is this wanting all I need
I know I'd find the answer

If I could only see, if I could only see
The answer lies in me

Chorus:
It's all too hard to force a change
We fret too much about this world
Just be your own and face each day
Answers will slowly come your way

I'm so full of purpose, but void of means
I can't be certain of anything

Has this wanting taken me
I know I'd find the answer

If I could only see, if I could only see
The answer lies in me

Repeat Chorus

I would like to make things perfect,
But I can't seem to get it right
Only steps away from the answers,
But I can't reach them
Now, I realize the answers will come to me in time
I cannot reach them
They can reach me

R. Terrance Barnett,"Gotta get on my job
Take it back to the warehouse
Plot back in

A late night escape, hit me on the script
On the hip, gotta dip
Hollering, calling me out like a Girl Scout
Better go ahead and sell your cookies later
Fuck up out my face, rookie
Took me on a trip away
Chopping trees, eating grits with runny eggs
I'm always tripping on the beggars working the same corner
Trying to vamp me with the creases in your clothes
Sticking cuffs up in my face, don't act
Fumbling, pretty scared like tailbacks they flow
Knees and elbows got drug in the parking lot
So jellybeans (where ya at?) come clean
Come on in, sit down, relax and catch your wind
Some pretend but this man don't bend
Limping like Willy, turning bunks face down
On the military campground
And I'm out, nigga

Yeah, all this goddam grinding ain't shit
(Ho hustling) Cause I ain't got nathan to show
Except small quantities of blow
And enough flow to keep my lil boy belly full
But when that little bit run out
Pray your card don't get pulled
Should my path ever be crossed
On my family-feeding missions
Missing persons lives lost, inside edition
Kissing ass on nine-to-fives ain't gon keep me alive
Had to do without a lot still I seem to survive
Tried that straight path with the bow lean
Better with this new world, fitting in
Like a buzzard in a bed of swirl
Pearl handle on this firearm
Partner stay calm, now pass me your bomb
I thought your moms
Had told you about them niggas in the slums
(East Point, smoke something)

I wish you were me and I was you
Maybe then you would see what I go through
Each and every day, making up thangs to say, to speak
Uplifting words from my soul to keep
And my niggas that fantasize how wide the ride get
The concert, never the need to rob or car jack
The fact is to keep a cool head and chill
And get your Bible, it says thou shalt not kill
We do it anyway, and focus on short-lived enjoyment
And blame it on the white folks cause they supporting it
360 degrees of emcees from the Tree
To from one fourth of the MoB (SWATs)

Yeah, smallest predator on the Georgia plains
I'm about to take your mind on a journey
Uh, seeker no sleeper
I walk the streets, God keep me safe
Evil's raped this planet, damn it
I can't stand it, come travel to South West Atlant-ic
With me, there will be no stops in the bluff
A motherfucker sniffs his snuff
Sometimes it's tough to cope
Came a long way, and with so far to cover
Let me drank with why'all Gs
Moether Nature's seeds keep your eyes open
The seven seas rumbling, bullets they coming
Uh, the devil's shot it, human beings robotic
I'm got my chrome, man
When niggas start disappearing about cloning
Sometimes I feel weak
Mentally I'm one of the firest niggas in the street
With this rap shit I paid my dues
I never thought that I was better than you
Uh, niggas want to die you'll get your wish
Goodbye, you outta here, never coming back
Niggas dying with their straps, uh
I can't adapt, I want a free life
I'm in the dark throw me a light
Blaze ?em high, let's expand
Rule the land, invest with a vest
If you catch a slug to the chest

So much sin each of us has slept in

Suttin's getting fried like a dumpling
And it's proven
Everybody you see me with, they're movers
I'm the real deal, they're YouTubers

Riding with hand tings hanging off scooters

Real life cabbaging characters and Lugers
Steel pipe damaging faggots and losers

I was in the rain, you was on your Xbox
Cocaine, tryna network to a next spot
Dem times dere, my cousin caught a next shot
Out in yard, tryna line up a headshot
Flew back home tryna get it by the headlock
I was getting boxes, banging it in Z shots

Seen a MAC mek a man twist like a dreadlock
Switch it

Ain't top three? That's an insult
These neeks don't bang, they ain't involved
Black bag full of ink notes
PCs had me getting out windows
In banger whips doing petty runs
Got savages that ain't 21
Nearly got grabbed from the firearms

Palace to Heath, I've got gang in the streets
Free Snapper and Weeps
These rappers are neeks, they ain't clapping on heat
They're just rapping on beats
Put a akh in [?] with a passion for beef

With crack in my jeans
Wrap scarf or a black mask, wap parked in a cat's yard
Black heart, never act soft
[?] in a packed dance, better act fast
If that barks, that's your hat gone

Splash large when I'm at Shard
Rap star wearing Trapstar
All I see is nerds and fakers
Your Rolex ain't got papers
Normal weed in a medicine bottle
I don't wanna hear about flavours

Ain't old school? Then you probably won't get this

It's all about you faggot-ass motherfuckin' rappers
Thinkin' y'all dope, drivin' Lexuses and shit like that
""Every Record Label Sucks Dick""

But yo, yo, but but but you be suckin' on your record label's dick
Word up! This is just a little somethin'
For motherfuckers to let them know I didn't fall off the earth
You know what I'm sayin'?

Don't care if I'm dead or if I'm bleeding
I'm not succeeding, they turned my mindstate into evil

'Cause I want everyone dead on this fuckin' earth
It really hurts, cause if music doesn't work
I got nothing left to live for except dyin' in the poorhouse
And bitches hate my fuckin' guts

Those sluts loved me more than Patrick Swayze
When I had my steady income
I need a spot that I can sin from
Suicide, never, but I got plots of taking out the other people

And I ain't doin' jail time, that shit is wack
Ain't no comin' back, once I lose control my shit is finished
So don't get in this, you record label people gonna die
And your family gonna die too, motherfuckers!

Hahahaha, yo, yo
Yo, that's just a verse, one verse
You can't buy this shit, this shit is not for sale
That's for the real rap fans

But see, real nowadays is just a fuckin' gimmick anyway
I'm keepin it real, I'm stayin' real, all this bullshit

[R.A. the Rugged Man]
Aiyo, give it up, rush you up, no fuss, blood rush
Cuss much, what's mine? You bust nuts, crunch crunch
Spark the bud, what's what, the white King Tut
Out in so-fuck, look who they dug up, yup, it's the Rugged
On the record with J-Live, I could hardly believe this
I never thought I'd be rapping on no record with school teachers
Hair flinch from the eighties, library, lies bury
TV, tell lies visually, kid you wit me, hostility
Humility, hillbilly, gorilla, he mentally illy
Still is he, actually, really killed me, billy
All that stuff you heard about me, is probably true
Heard I got the AIDS virus, I probably do
Ammunition spitting is him, is it, you listening
Littering written, it's in slippers, get the rebel in him
Sticking it with sinners, sizzlin' rhythm, verbally hit him
Did he did it, or did he didn't, admit it
Pretend he ain't offended, the men and women
Every minute they in it, don't be
Every illiterate ignorant critical dissed it
Every idiot that ain't live it, they talking shit
I'm R.A. the Rugged Man, get off, my dick

[Chorus]

[J-Live]
Give it up, for the Gods & the Earths, ladies and gentleman
All the human families, the wicked can't stand me
The righteous man hands me the mic, it's uncanny how
One man's penalty's, is another man's boo-whore
The label pun's ironic, courtesy of this sport
Still can't stop a grown man, from pressing report
A free man can either be freedom or free label
When you spent, what you make, to keep making, you can't save
A damn thing, no savings, that's how life'll enslave ya
That's why I strive daily; to be my own savior
I know when shine glows and reflects in my behavior
So caught in between checks, I spilled it in respect
So give it up, if your mission's belittling my position
As a microphone physician, making you listen
Me and Rugged Man relate, through a previous poem
Like he said, I'm mad famous, for being unknown
On records for ten years, I can hardly believe it
Never thought I'd be perceived, as just some rapping school teacher
Just some dude, that can cut and rhyme, same time
Just some conscious kid, that's try'nna save the world through rhyme
Just another underground, hand-to-mouth microphonist
Stop your mirror rap, just to stop you in your tracks
This will stomp you on your track, justice is not just
Another ordinary rapper, I'm the crown royal block
With a velvet bag, matter of fact, and since the swagger is back
And backed by, a whole nation of millions
You can't hold me, my new floor is my old ceiling
That's why I'm guaranteed, to leave you with something you lack, so just

",Give It Up,2005
R.A. the Rugged Man,"I walk in the Pentagon with a blood soaked hatchet
Leave the president's nose shattered
Stretch his neck like go gadget, and toe tag it

You a stone cold faggot
I hold the chrome in a jacket
Go toe to toe with a savage
And roll you over a cactus

Funeral's are closed caskets, coke addicts
Chrome ratches, the whole package
I'll beat Moses on the head with them stone tablets

I killed Kennedy, brains blown all over Onassis
I'll hold my own with the axes
And turn the pope into ashes

Designed frequency, I'm a holy divine lyrical deity
Even atheists and heathens and non-believers believe in me
The punk-ass devil was born soft
I'll piledrive you like Paul Orndorff
Steal his pitchfork and rip his horns off
I'm the born force

Sick fuck, I'll skin you alive and then carry the bones
Load the ruger up and shoot you up like I'm Marion Jones
Vinnie is out of his dome
Guinea that carry the throne
Gimme, it's that or be stoned
Trinity, that'll be home

We bout to spaz, R.A. and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck

New jack pussy, young rappers think their rapping is good
Young rappers get treated like fetuses in planned parenthood
This ain't no Mickey Mouse, zip-a-dee-doo-dah Disney
It's the claws of a grizzly
It ain't Wayne and Drizzy, it's Thorburn and Vinnie

And R.A., that’s my brother there, anyone who unaware
I'mma leave em stumbling as if they had a ton of beer
I'm from Philly, it ain't a sucker to ever come from here
You a pussy, you see confrontation and you run from there

What kind of dirty bitch did your daddy put his sperm in?
Kiddie porn web searchin', pervert jerkin, you serpents is Satan's servants

You get slain for certain if you put your faith inside of Satan serpents
Stick the blade in you while I embrace you like my favorite person

Stay in Hell burning, slaves with chains on your brain like a turban
I make Abel kill Cain and get bible pages reversin', brains burstin'

It takes a taste of bourbon for me to rape a virgin
And Vinnie deal with mathematics like an Asian person

We bout to spaz, R.A.Annotate and Vinnie Paz
We don't give a fuck

Hands like Roberto Durán, it's the flight 103 Pan Am
It's the Gulf War between Iraq and Iran
Treat you like Indians I'm snatching your land
I'm more dapper than Dan, I'm Rakim I master the plan
I bring the roots without having a band

Without having a fan I coulda never took care of my fam
I coulda never done all the tours on the shores of Japan
Still would've slaughtered your man, still would've aborted the plan
Still an apostle from Sham, still I'm like God in Sudan

R.A. the Rugged Man,"Little ones listen, learn from me, see, you could be the best
But sit in your room depressed and you'll never progress
My sister Dee-Dee was born mentally retarded
She was a beautiful woman at 26, but now she's dearly departed
This May Tenth she suffered from a heart attack
The depletion of oxygen in the head left her in a coma braindead
Her internal organs was failing, her body no longer releasing excreations
My parents wouldn't pull the plug cause she was still breathing
Black, white, let's unite us, never divide us
X-Clan, Professor X died from spinal meningitis
So many like us are in Riker's suffering, struggling, slumming
A few years ago you was sucking your thumb
And now you're busting your gun
And dumbing, an innocent man is done
And enough of your bluffing, your thugging
And enough of the ruckus running, the roughest is coming
It's a miracle just being born
Learn to enjoy life, it ain't that long
Sing the words to my song, come on

Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Away, away
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway

Living ain’t a breeze, please, life’s full of tragedies
We see our friends die, some get murdered, some die by disease
Got your finger on the trigger, don't do it
Contemplating suicide, just put the gun down, we've all been through it
An infant in his crib sprayed by straight bullets and dies
He was a future genius, he would have won a Pulitzer prize
The racist cop shot an innocent black
An 8-year old prostitue hoing getting mommy money for crack
A little boy molested by his step-father, hopeless
The little boy grew up now, he's molesting his own kids
The government watching you from a satellite like you ain't had it right
Your best friend snitching on you, that's animal-like
It's horrible watching your loved ones die and having to bury them
To seeing my cousin found dead, she overdosed shooting heroin
My family dying from sickening disorders
We found my brother Maxx
He was blue and purple and he was stiff with rigamortis
My father got spots on his lungs, they think it's cancer
I'm praying every night, even if God don't ever answer
We can do it together, women hold your mans
Men hold your women, everybody let's hold hands and sing

Wake up, don't cry
So sad inside
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway
Wanna give up, feel like hiding
Yeah, I get down, but keep fighting
I still get through the day
I'm gonna make it anyway

Yeah, ah, yeah, aha, yeah, what, only you baby, only you

I reminisce, and think of how it used to be, a park, roses,
We were kissing, you were holding me, walking down the streets of our hometown,
Getting down, wasting money, just fooling around, we felt free,
Like birds in the sky, I want you all to get everything,
If I should die high on hopes on our own dreams
And scenes gotta ticket for a ride to reach the bright side baby,
There's a better life, no tears, no fears, no hate, no strife, no pain
Yo, I'm the golden first,
You'll write me a letter that will ease my thirst
And then, sweetheart after you follow me to the city of love,
Where we'll both gonna be with a shine goodbye
We made our own choice as I sat on the train and I heard your sweet voice

All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew, only you
(You and me)

I found a good job and a place to stay,
But luck's been missing since you left my way,
But I hold you on the phone, you spoke so sweet,
Of love, devotion, faith and now you miss me
But in the instance I begin to feel that my mind's
Been played like a game on the wheel
Stealing my heart, I see a man by your side, giving you the love I tried,
But I couldn't provide
Please, dreams we shared are just souvenirs,
Yours, for glad laugh, said tears,
Last night we talked,
And you didn't say much, I told you that I love you,
You said ""We'll keep in touch""
I sit back and remember how it used to be back than,
You and me together again those dreams and wishes are where they belong, son,
In my heart and in the rest of this song

All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day, and all I ever knew, only you
All I needed was the love you gave,
All I needed for another day,
And all I ever knew, only you

Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

R.E.D.,"Poor you, I'm sorry you're not me, for you will never know what loving you can be.
Poor you, you'll never know your charms,
You'll never feel your warmth, you're never in your arms.
When it is you I'm kissing, I pity you constantly,
You don't know what you're missing, 'cause you're only kissing poor me.
Poor you, you live your whole life through,
And yet you'll never know the thrill of loving you.",Poor You,1999
R.E.D.,"Look, I'ma get in the game you heard me
Women, over here come listen, tell em
If you ain't been with a nigga, its too late
In the game, for a nigga to be making a bitch feel lead
You'll want to get it right, and when you get it right
You'll want to keep it right, look
A real nigga is hard to come by, believe it

Girl I can't believe you, how you gone
Turn around and bite the hand that feeds you
The way I break my back, good as I treat you
I keep saying this, I'ma really have to seat you
I'd hate to see the outcome, if I leave you
But its cause I want to be, its not because I need you
You don't want to be careful, why should I try to keep you
Nigga gon fuck, then he gone in a week or two
Them same hoes you be repping' to, believe it or not, the same hoes
Behind your back, run and tell me, each and everything you do
You better wake up, and pay attention
Realize your partners want to ask you out, to get to your position
I guarantee they got they man cuffed, if he say no that mean no
They can't go there, ain't gonna' huff and puff
That's a done deal, you better keep it real
You better, realize who pay your bills

Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gonna' make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gonna' fuck around
And leave this bitch in handcuffs

Now see this is what I'm talking bout, you out here running round
With them knuckle head, fucking give head hoes
Bring em to your house, then walk around in they bad clothes
You sneaking to the club with em, when I be on the map, that's cold
But its cool, cause my mama never raised no fool
We was in school, you had a nigga when I played on you
I should've seen it, but I was too caught up on the grind
In the blind, you knew I stayed with other shit on my mind
But all it did was take time, to show me the light
No I can't put this one behind, so you can go head and kite
So tell them hoes that there, and see what they say
They can't fuck you, but I can knock them off any day
So get your hand out my face, 'fore I bat you in yours
You should of, stayed in your place now the tables done turned
And everything I gave you, bitch I struggled to earn
Get your purse you gotta skate, you lucky you don't get burned

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough
Man I'ma leave this bitch in handcuffs
I say you hoes be acting up
You gonna' make a nigga bat you up
I'm sorry bitch, but we done had enough
We gonna' fuck around
And leave this bitch in handcuffs

Girl don't play dumb, you know who made you
Everything you want you get, everything you got I gave you
I took you from hard times and saved you
In the best of everything I laced you
Made it where no one could fade you, sometimes I hate you
I love you to death, but the way you act
I know that's not the way, that Lil B. Gizzle raised you
I'm on the verge, about to shake you, don't forget
I'm a paid nigga getting sick of you trying to be slicker
Tripping, trying to build fake cases, a house
Your clothes, your feature and supplied transportation
And that's how you gonna' do a nigga, mentally abuse a nigga
You gonna' regret trying to use a nigga, you this close from bout to lose this nigga
Man they got hoes all over the world, that wish they knew this nigga
See one time threw with you, I'm threw with you
Ain't nothing that I could do with you, but try to be cool with you

Them hoes be acting up
They gonna' make a nigga bat 'em up
I'm sorry bitch, but I done had enough

Loin de ces Mc's qui s'déguisent, qui médisent et qui s'méprisent

Zappe la prod' et les potos savent que les propos font trop mal
La voir regarder les bobos dans les blocks dans la foule ou dans les bacs
On a que des bacs dans les locaux avec des têtes de bosniaques
Avec une technique on pose grave qui peut que te plaire et te faire taire
Des rafales de phases que rêvent d'avoir les plus gros chefs militaires
Des tonnes de vagues t’inquiète mon rap en aura bien des plus belles
Des phases qui gardent les pieds sur terres pour éviter les plus belles chutes
Avoues qu'c'est débile
Dis moi comment donner naissance à ton succès si ton disque est stérile?

R.E.D.K.,"J’ai la peau couleur pétrole donc tu connais ma richesse
Beaucoup trop loin sont mes Comores donc tu connais ma tristesse
Même si j’ai poussé loin de la terre de mes ancêtres
Dis-toi bien que mon archipel, c’est la racine de mon être
Yes, j’suis français et fier de l’être
Mais quand je reçois ces lettres, j’ai le tsunami sur mes pommettes
Dans ma tête, des images refont surface
Le visage de mon grand-père, les mariages au village
Sache que je n’peux oublier l’odeur du poisson grillé
Quand j’allais me promener avec ma mère sur le marché
Pour me réveiller, l’appel pour aller prier
Puis sur un champ on trouvait des cannes à sucre à mâcher
Comment éviter, toute cette pauvreté que leur humilité essaye sans cesse de cacher
Je te vois encore pleurer les douleurs du passé
Pour te soigner, écoute tes enfants chanter

Afrika, gravée dans ma peau et dans mon cœur à tout jamais (À tout jamais)
Afrika, malgré les apparences, t’es présent dans mes pensées (À tout jamais)
Afrika, Même en feux de détresse le monde ne t'as pas compris
Afrika, tes atouts sont tes faiblesses, tes richesses t’ont appauvri

J’ai le cœur et la tête remplis de souvenirs
Après chaque passage au bled, j’m’enrichis grâce à nos terres, j'me le dois de vous le dire
Tout n’est pas si facile ici, mais les gens sont cleans
J’en conclus que la vie n’est pas difficile, on s'la complique
Loin de tristesse et peur, et des visages renfrognés
J'cotoie la richesse des cœurs et les sourires de la pauvreté
Je vois des cicatrices, des plaies dans tous les domaines
J’comprends qu'mes petits caprices sont la solution à leurs problèmes
A l’abri dès mon retour, recommencent les vas-et-vients
Et la vie de tous les jours reprend ses droits en me volant les miens
J’accorde aux miens que des coups de fils les jours de fêtes
Et mes souvenirs les plus précieux sont tous punis dans un coin de ma tête
Comment t’expliquer, j'me sens là-bas comme ici
Pas de regard inférieur, je suis à l’extérieur comme à domicile
C’est ça l'époque fils, des fois la vie nous piège
Français ou Comorien, j'ai le coccyx entre deux sièges

Afrika, malgré les apparences, t’es présent dans mes pensées (À tout jamais)
Afrika, Même en feux de détresse le monde ne t'as pas compris
Afrika, tes atouts sont tes faiblesses, tes richesses t’ont appauvri

Je suis l'résultat des sacrifices de mes parents
J’me dois de réussir pour que leurs larmes n’aient pas coulées pour rien
J'vis le rêve africain, et je me dois de l’honorer
Afrika est une reine et j'suis là pour la couronner
L’histoire ne t’as pas fait de cadeaux

J'ai vu d'la lâcheté chez ceux qu'on croit célèbre
Leur bassesse quand les élus nous rabaissent aucune de leur voix s'élève
J'ai vu un décor apocalyptique
Et des potos vendre leur âme au diable quand les enchères sont diaboliques

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe
Même si c'est dans la douleur qu'on écrit son histoire
Ne vois-tu pas que le monde est fait de rire et de frayeur
Oui on y voit le pire et le meilleur

Va dire aux extraterrestres de ne pas se fier à nos cartes postales
Pour les accueillir y aura que des cris d'singes au stade
Révise l'histoire si t'as pas compris
Qu'ici trop regardent le monde avec l'œil de verre de Jean-Marie
J'ai vu l'anorexie, des complexes car ici
Trop regardent le monde avec l'œil d'un paparazzi
J'ai vu des jeunes prêts à tout pour réussir
Ici trop regardent le monde avec l'œil de Secret Story
J'ai vu des armes de l'Est dans des sacs d'écoliers
J'ai vu Superman voler mais qu'sur les pays pétroliers
J'ai vu en en Suède un mec jouer à GTA
J'ai vu le bling-bling de Nicolas nous coûter le triple A
J'ai vu le diable jouer ses gammes
J'ai vu Islam et terrorisme devenir un amalgame
J'ai vu des propos politiques avec une moustache hitlérienne
Le monde est conduit par des mecs au taux d'alcoolémie de Sue Ellen

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe
Même si c'est dans la douleur qu'on écrit son histoire
Ne vois-tu pas que le monde est fait de rire et de frayeur
Oui on y voit le pire et le meilleur

J'ai vu de l'injustice à Guantanamo
Mais pas de nucléaire sous le sol irakien
J'ai vu des politiques qui souhaitent la mort à nos
Semblables et pas d'élus pour sauver les miens
J'ai vu des hypocrites qui nous mènent en bâteau
Et puis nous couler pour nous éloigner de la rive
A l'heure où tout le monde oublie les liens familiaux
Qu'il y a entre Isaac et Ismaïl

J'ai vu tellement de choses défiler dans son regard
Sourire et larme amour et haine là où les gens passent
Là où les hommes recherchent la paix avec les armes
Naissances, tueries, bravoure et peine et des meilleurs j'en passe

J'rappe comme ça me chante, je chante comme ça me rappe
Inspiré par le beau temps et puis parfois par l'orage
J'suis sorti de vos rangs, j'refuse les cases
Rappe comme ça me chante et puis chante comme ça me rappe
Vas-y Sopra chante:
Rapper ou chanter, l'important est d'être vrai
Avec tes idées, viens pas me menotter

Perché sur ma planète paraît que l'critiques fusent
Rien à péter j'prépare mes missiles scud
Mec loyal cherche pas d'similitude
J'plane comme un aigle royal pendant qu'les pies discutent
Avoue qu'c'est dingue et puis qu'c'est bien nous on progresse sans arrêt
Je vous préviens j'viens prendre un flow com-com-complètement barré
Quoi ? Le client est roi? C'est pas moi qui vais l'avaler
J'lui vole sa couronne et puis transforme ton auditeur en valet
Les rappeurs ont chopé le virus du manque de cash mais
Cette maladie se soigne qu'avec du liquide et un cachet
Après cette phase on m'dira qu'j'suis un moqueur né
Pourtant c'est cette même ordonnance qui a soigné les finances du Dr. Dre
J'me dois de le dire, je m'en tape de leur bla-blas j'ai vu pire
Je fais sauter tous les barrages, pas besoin de kalash, ni-même de famas
Mes tires sortent de ma bouche et parfois je fais pire
J'suis venu pour faire un carnage et puis fuir
Je n'ai pas besoin de bla-blas, ni même de leur passe-droit

Ne m'demande pas de me freiner, non poto ne me demande pas de changer
Quand je commence à rapper ou à chanter tu découvre la météo de mes pensées
Dansée, pleurée ou révoltée, ma musique a toujours été celle des opprimés
Je les vois jalouser ma liberté, derrière les barreaux de leurs street débilité
Ça fait des années que j'ai aiguisé ce style de fêlé
Ils sont fascinés, puis t'es déprimé face à mon CV
Rendez-vous après l'été, ce n'est pas près de s'arrêter
Bientôt le nouvel album de ma Psykatra! Ok
D'accord je reprends le débit sans limite mes gimmicks font crier
Les zéniths et l'Europe et l'Afrique et les blocs et publics par milliers
A l'heure où les ventes de disques sont pathé-thé-thétiques
Qu'on prend des-des risques avec mon équipe
Ça chante et ça kick, ça-ça ti-ti-tirs donc fuyez
Je les vois tous bâillonnés par les commentaires de Booska-P
Je les vois tous complexés par ces connes en pleine puberbté
Si être vrai c'est se mentir, hey, laisse-moi être faux pour être libre

J'fais d'la musique comme un vrai schyzo
Que j'rappe ou chante, le biz' perd les eaux
Je les entends parler de Soprano
Normal mon dernier album les traite d'tous les noms d'oiseaux

Je débarque, et déboule, me démarque des fous
Pas de doute et pas besoin de les pomper
Ils divaguent, sont tous dans le vague et le flou
Rien à foutre, je ne fais que dans le concret
Non je ne marche pas à tâtons, soyez pas cons
Mais bon partons, laissez tomber
J'rappe comme ça me chante, rappe comme ça me tente
Ce n'est vraiment pas la peine de me dompter

Poto je chantais bien avant l'époque de Da-Daddy K
Des styles différents comme les types du groupe de Ma-Manu Key
Ton Beats by Dre est plastiqué quand je commence à kicker
Entre deux styles j'suis à cheval, mais t'inquiète j'suis un bon jockey

T'inquiète j'suis dopé, j'évolue
Mais si le flow est méconnu
C'est pour choquer qu'on est venu
T'as plus qu'à monter le volume

Pour donner le tournis à tous ces fous qui disait que Marseille avait coulé
J’viens leurs rouler dessus les rouer de coup de fouets et de flow de fou
Vas-y le couz’, à toi

Bienvenue là où les flow sont dévoilés sans arrêt
Déballés sans cesse on ramène des phrases complexes
On amène des phases qu’on n’peut comparer
Des fois même complètement barrées décalez-vous ça va faire boom
Allez couz’, à toi

Bienvenue là où les flows sortent d’Édouard Toulouse
Où les coups de blues et les coups de boules s’écoutent
Là où le fond et la forme roucoulent sur des prods lourdes
Où ça dégoute la concurrence qui veulent en découdre
À toi

Bienvenue dans notre labo loin des traitres et des collabos
Loin des mecs qui mènent en bateau pas de cadeaux

Tous les micros, toutes les prods et tous les mythos, tous les faux
Avec des punch’ et des proses, aussi rapide que Busta, pour les mecs en Lacoste
Ou bien les beaux-gosses en costards
Oui c’est un simple constat
Les partisans de la paix reçoivent des bombes et les gosses cannent
Car pour baiser les pauvres, ils sont malades à la Strauss-Kahn
Prix Nobel de la haine et de la guerre qu’attisent de grosses flammes
Artistes dans le massacre ils mériteraient des oscars
On bosse tard et on s’bat, les obstacles
Mais n’ose pas aller là où l’innovation est devenue un obstacle
Un instant, je m'installe, mon instinct est bestial
Oui quand il s’agit de mettre du MC dans mon casse-dalle
Quand il s’agit de rapper, taffer, frapper sans compassion
Mais dans les règles de l’art tant que c’est fait avec passion
Pas de cadeau ni de vieux récit dans le labo, (Quoi?)

R.E.D.K.,"J'ai pas de p'tites coupures, ils me comprennent par crainte du Seigneur
Et vu la tournure que les choses prennent, je crains le pire, espère le meilleur
Une fois parti dans ma lancée, le mal me ronge
Quand j'suis plongé dans mes pensées, j'ai tendance à m'noyer dans mes songes
C'est ça le malheur
Y'a rien de comparable, les hommes n'ont plus de valeur
J'regrette celui qui valait cent carats
Ils se croient imparables
Puis s'imaginent qu'on n'y voit rien quand ils considèrent nos pays comme des boîtes à rats
C'est ça dans l'rap on parle on kiffe la rime
Pour l'oseille on se bouge mais les oreilles on s'bouche quand les estomacs crient famine
Je le dis et le pense
La beauté de nos paroles
N'a d'égale que la laideur de notre indifférence
Y'a pas de confusion pas même un peu d'ivresse
Je donne mon opinion, tire des conclusions du haut de ma petitesse
Motivé comme pas deux je manie vos verbes
Mes couplets vous font des baisers baveux avec la langue de Molière
Je mène mon combat jusqu'à l'épuisement
C'est la richesse de notre culture contre la pauvreté de leurs jugements
Si parce que je m'appelle Mohamed le statut de français je le mérite pas
Dites à François Hollande d'aller se présenter aux Pays-Bas
Avant tout sachez qu'à défaut de l'avoir à l'extérieur
Je la recherche à l'intérieur la paix
À l'heure où la violence prolifère
Je repense à Zied mort dans un braquage à cause d'une balle policière
Le chant des bastos nous berce écoute
La violence est une drogue dure dans les rues de Marseille beaucoup de nos frères se shootent
Si t'as pas le cran d'aller au bout fais pas le bourreau
Faudra assumer le fait de te faire fumer comme une Marlboro
Je m'interroge sur la cécité de la justice
Et me dit qu'elle est loin d'être aveugle
Elle ne voit que ce qu'elle veut voir c'est triste
Y'a trop d'anomalies
J'annonce la couleur et ta défaite comme ce jury raciste qui sourit à Bonaly
J'te jure c'est fou tout ça me sidère
Mate bien ce qui m'énerve plus que tout c'est qu'ils nous considèrent
Comme des moins que rien
Et toutes ces merdes m'énervent
J'aimerais que sur leurs canaux nos paroles aient du poids comme celles de Pierre Ménès
Tu connais je suis le mec le plus cool de la Terre
Homme de raison j'peux devenir le plus fou quand j'la perds
Je suis ce gars sans doute têtu qui n'adore pas la thune
Man pour l'instant ma bouche s'est tue parole à ma plume

Désolé pour le dérangement ce soir ma plume est ivre
Non pas de cellule de dégrisement ce soir ma plume est libre
Libre de dégueuler ses sentiments sur la place publique
À l'heure où la liberté est une expression zemmouristique
Noirs sont les désirs quand il s'agit de leur justice
Celle qui met chez nous le stress du clip de Justice
Pourquoi j'suis si triste
Comment ne pas l'être quand je vois que les hommes cherchent le Paradis sous les pieds de Iblis
Cherchent l'armistice
Intérieur auprès d'une femme qui n'a pas les neurones d'Afida Turner
Ouais comme Will Smith
J'suis à la recherche du bonheur pour enfin prendre de la hauteur
Ou pire, atterrir comme Taïg Khris
Mec en temps de crise faut faire des sous
L'Afrique crie famine
La crise a fait qu'on est encore plus sourd
Ça crie au secours car le pouvoir d'achat baisse
L'Euro c'est le régime minceur de l'Europe voilà pourquoi on n'a plus de Grèce
Je presse la détente de ma plume à chaque fois que je stresse
Ou quand la Une entoure la vérité d'un peu de brume
Oui j'ai mis dans l'urne un bulletin SOS anti Jean-Marie
Ils ont mis l'Afrique en cloque et se prennent pour Cheb Mami
Non ne pleure pas Mamie je suis là pour vous honorer
Les darons étaient des kings
Les colons des Conrad Murray
Et j'ai juré que ma plume n'aurait jamais d'Alzheimer
Si la vérité est une mode j'suis son designer
Comme Teddy Riner
J'suis venu remporter des médailles
Et que ma famille ne soit plus sur la paille
Et grâce à mes bails faut qu'elle graille
Braille, rage, autant que tu veux
Rien à foutre de ton rap jeu
Faut du liquide, liquide chez moi pour pouvoir éteindre le feu
Ouais ouais poto j'ai grillé tous les feux
Que les puristes ont mis sur ma route
Je conduis une ambulance alors vos codes rien à foutre
En plus, ici ça joue les Pablo
Ils portent tous une chemise hawaïenne
Pas comme Tony mais comme Gbagbo
Ras le bol de ces clichés qu'on a sur le dos
Déjà qu'ici on a les mains sales même avec lodo
Marre de voir nos darons investir dans le Loto
Pourquoi ça coupe?
On est à l'époque du serato
Merde, je crois que ma plume a bu un coup d'trop

Du fond d'ma crique, putain d'nègre, j'passe le bonsoir
Derrière ma plume, niggas, j'ai planqué la foudre
J'voulais parler d'amour mais dans nos rues y'a comme une odeur d'poudre

Dix piges, ça pense à l'argent aussi jeune ?
Résultat on a plus de péchés que dans Seven
On s’entre-tue à cause de frontières imposées
Et Place Vendôme, ils exhibent nos diamants en guise de trophées
Nous voir ça les rend malades
Ils ont dû attraper cette rage avec la viande hallal

J'viens en temps d'guerre, parce que la paix s'trouve six pieds sous terre
Oublie la trêve j'me trimbale avec une pelle, j'enterre mes rêves
Vu les risques j'vise l'essentiel
La chance s'fait rare y'a plus un rond au pied de l'arc-en-ciel
Ici les blessures saignent, quand les temps sont sales
Les temps sont barges, on nous parle de plan social
C'est grave comme si c'était si simple, on récolte ce que l'on sème
Plaide coupable et victime du système

D'ici j'les entends parler tout bas, trop de méfiance et de coups-bas
De propos vides de sens, mon innocence ne peut être coupable
J'me méfie des traîtres, une personne qui manque de confiance en soi
Par définition pourrait être la pire des traitres
J'suis venu rapper tout haut car mon phrasé est pur
Ceux qui parlent dans leur barbe ne sont juste bons qu'à raser les murs
Averse de sincérité sur le sillon
J'arrive et crache mes vérités le rap s'abreuve de mes postillons

J'ai toujours visé le crâne quand ma plume crachait du plomb
Plutôt San Goku que Gad quand mon flow devient blond
J'rappe le fond de Gandhi avec la forme de Cassius Clay
Dans l'game les bandits c'est comme Bernard qu'ils sont musclés
Comme Wesley je snipe tous ces suceurs de sang
J'suis l'haut-parleur de ceux qui rêvent de milieux décents
J'fais pas l'apologie des polos chics ni des gros logis
Mes étoiles sont aux Comores pas sur le short d'Apolo Creed

R.E.D.K.,"C'est dans un monde où règne le clinquant, chapeauté par le fric et l'flouze
Qu'la graine de délinquant, arrosée au liquide, pousse
Couz, pas de fine bouche, on grandit dans une époque mytho
Où les petits s'retrouvent, en dépit de tout, dans les comicos
Dans des blocs si pauvres, loin de tout le gratin
Où comme tout un chacun ça vise le top niveau
Là où ça shoote les potes, tout ça pour des fautes, idiot
Là où ça joue du glock face à tous les blocs rivaux
Drôle d'époque amigo, où même les liens amicaux sautent
Quand il s'agit de coke, les potes sont des animaux
Les jeunes sont si tentés de faire le million qu'ils braquent et rusent
Car dans cette jungle cimentée, le lion est celui qui palpe le plus
À qui le dis-tu? Tout se dégrade aujourd'hui
Vu le genre d'individu que la société actuelle produit
Immondes sont les faux concepts qu'ils défendent sans soucis
Dans ce monde, je possède, je dépense donc je suis
Inconscient ils vivent du mal sans connaître les causes du massacre
Adolescents ils veulent déjà que la virgule Nike ponctue la sape
C'est nos valeurs qu'ils piétinent, ils sont bêtes, entêtés, têtus
Formatés depuis la tétine, à vouloir être pétés de thunes
On est vu comme des parias, ils refusent le mariage
On a le statut de victime, gosses illégitimes de Marianne
Derrière les barricades, rien ne change j'te rassure
Oui c'est toujours la même merde, derrière l’énième dernière couche de peinture
Les mêmes infos qui ne sont en fait que des leurres
Quand la grande délinquance se sert de la petite pour masquer ses erreurs
En scrutant la paille qui est dans mon œil ils font erreur
Car j'pourrais jouer l'équilibriste sur les poutres qui sont dans les leurs

Graines de délinquants, qu’espériez-vous?
Quand devenir quelqu'un c’est forcément avoir des sous
Ici, les gestes vont avec, ça joue des coudes, et puis
La poudre parle et la mort ne connait pas le doux répit
Qui donne l’exemple? En tout cas pas les élus
Par feintes illégales, sans passer par les cellules
Les p'tits analysent et disent pourquoi pas moi?
Ils chargent les valises là-bas à Malaga
Et on dit, il m'a dit, tout ça ouvre les routes
Aux schmits la langue pendue, les envoient sous les verrous
Passer une nuit au calme frérot c’est le Pérou
Pour le fric ça tire comme les 80's à Beyrouth

Charles Surratt introduces his own composition ""On Calvary For Me""
""The Joy of Knowing Jesus"" is a song of pure delight featuring John Barbee

The pure tenor quality of the voice of Harold Montgomery
Gives a special interpretation to the grand old hymn ""The Old Rugged Cross""
Chill bumps appear and I am frozen in the web they weave as they reveal their
Innermost selves with the outpouring of their hearts
On and on the songs roll and soon you are caught up
In the sermon in each rendition as you come to feel
The devotion and dedication that is poured forth
Suddenly, you know they are real, they mean it!

""Let your light so shine""
Could not be more aptly applied
As there shines a light from heaven on your heart
Through their singing
As an artist, Rhonda Montgomery
Exemplifies piano artistry
That's Rhonda! An artist!

Or to straighten out your life through the sincere testimony

R.E.M.,"I sit at my table and wage war on myself
It seems like it's all, it's all for nothing

Let me make it good
I raised the wall and I will be the one to knock it down

I demand a rematch
I decree a stalemate

Hold that memory
Let my machine talk to me, let my machine talk to me

This is my life
And this is my time
I have been given the freedom
To do as I see fit

R.E.M.,"I've watched the children come and go
A late, long march into spring

I will try to sing a happy song
I'll try and make a happy game to play
""Come play with me"" I whispered to my newfound friend

Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting
Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
Watch your heel crush, crush, uh oh

R.E.M.,"I found this photograph,
Underneath the broken picture glass.
Tender face of black and white,
Beautiful, a haunting sight.
Looked into an angel's smile,
Captivated all the while.
From the hair and clothes she wore,
I'd place her in between the wars.

Was she willing when she sat
And posed the pretty photograph?
Save her flowering and fair,
The days to come, the days to share.
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

I found this photograph,
Stashed between the old joist walls,
In a place where time is lost,
Lost behind, where all things fall.
Broken books and calendars,
Letters script in careful hand,
Music too, a standard tune by
Some forgotten big brass band.

From the threshold what's to see
Of our brave new century?
The television's just a dream,
The radio, the silver screen.
A big smile for the camera,
How did she know?
The moment could be lost forever
Forever more

Was her childhood filled with rhymes,
Stolen hooks, impassioned crimes?
Was she innocent or blind
To the cruelty of her time?
Was she fearful in her day,
Was she hopeful, did she pray?
Were there skeletons inside,
Family secrets, sworn to hide?
Did she feel the beat that stirs,
The fall from grace of wayward girls?
Was she tempted to pretend,
The love and laughter, 'til the end?

R.E.M.,"Hey there now young holy
Swing along, quote the scriptures
Keep them guessing which pit you crawled from

Just defy it, just deny it
Was it fun?
Your time has come
What have you done?
What have you done?

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chime in, the Greek chorus
The machine of God singing

It's the poison that in measures
Brings illuminating vision
It's the knowing with a wink
That we expect in Southern women
It's the wolf that knows which root to dig to save itself
It's the octopus that crawled back to the sea

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chime in, the Greek chorus
The machine of God ring!

Hammered, shooting plywood in the backyard
Laughing cause the racket makes the blackbirds sing
Write the holy terror
Suck the marrow from the bones
Singe your own wings burning books
You got the chorus and the ring

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything
The chorus chime in, the Greek chorus
The machine sings

That's when the insults start to sting
You can't remember anything

R.E.M.,"I dragged my feet across the seat
Jumped out the passenger side
The only thing worth looking for
Is what you find inside
But that had not yet appeared
Lost, invisible here
Tel Aviv and Agadir
Tone deaf or almost
Before I learned to see
The vanishing point appeared

I looked for you everywhere
I looked for you everywhere

There is a calm I haven't come to yet
I spent half my life figuring what comes next
I telescoped in, I finally win
I finally win the prize
That now my eyes see comets
Perfect timing squeeze
I'm head-first fighting everything
The crushing force of memory
Embracing all I've been
The vanishing point appeared

I looked for you everywhere
I looked for you everywhere
Tell me why you're here
I came to disappear

Look at this face
Can you believe it?
Am I living in the beautiful vacuum?
Because I can't see it

Fades to memory

I loved you then

You laid me bare
You marked me there

That if I hold
I'd hope you'd fold

I'll sing along
I've searched its still refrain
I'll walk alone
I've given this, take wing
Celebrate the rain

I just needed to believe

So I dive into a pool
So cool and deep that if I sink I sink
And when I swim I fly, so high

All I really wanted
Just to live my life on high

I know you want the same
I can see it in your eyes

Of recklessness and water

If I look I'm not sure that I could face you.
Not again, not today, not today.

There's a voice in me that says you will not win.

And if I ignore the voice inside,
Raise a half glass to my home.
But it's there that I am most afraid,
And forgetting doesn't hold.

And love, love will be my strongest weapon.

But you're disfiguring your own.

The worst joke ever, I never.

Memory fuses, and shatters like glass

From a sword to a set
To my people on the picket line
Who's sicking of getting treated like them aliens in District 9
I juxtapose my business model with my spirit
What, I'm just supposed to keep you comfortable with the lyrics?
I know the flow's disturbing
I know for certain just because you know all about the artist
Don't mean you know the person
You don't know me
I run labels
These unstable rappers is so phony
I try to listen but they're boring as missionary position
So I'm shitting on these niggas like dysentery conditions
I'm sitting on the throne, you dreaming that it's empty soon
Nobody feeling you, you're screaming in an empty room (Holla!)
The tree that fall in the forest, nobody hearing you
Even though you fall the hardest
Don't get me started

Listening to instrumentals
Thinking about all the things I've been through
The music is just a peek into my life, it's a window
It's so high tech and it's also simple
Even if I'm knocked down, I don't stay down
Even if I get down, I don't lay down
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground
Hotter than the tar on this empty playground

Yo, I built up my defenses
When I'm left to my devices, time gets suspended
More than DMX's driver's license
My music's steady, not affected by the higher prices
People having sex in the streets like Dionysus
You know what my advice is?
Fuck my advice, live your life
Stop tripping like everything amount to crisis
I make the sacrifices
My history is black as ice is
I don't think that I can trust you if you're lacking vices
I never miss a beat, the liquor make me slurred
It takes my words, tries to twist them like a Swisher Sweet
With sticky herb
American History X, your teeth'll hit the curb
It's easy 'cause I'm ill with the wordplay
I still flip the bird, like Jeezy
Strip it down, now it's exposed
I suppose my flow is the emperor's new clothes
Although I'm always by myself, I never ride alone
The music is on then I'm right at home, zoning",Back Again,2010
R.E.U.,"Up In Smoke

[R.E.U.]
Well if you know what it's like a cold cell drunk frozen at night
You're prob'ly like me try'na gain control of life
But sometime it takes over that's when I grab a gun and just think
Yo' fuck life man I'm under the brink
Music escapes a parasite chooses his fate
Prior to gunfights you sign ya' will as soon as it breaks
And this is real I want rendezvous spots and prize money
Not lethal injection which manifest the equal intentions
Of them grime thunnys holdin down ya' local street block
That gave the notion of commotion cities open detox
The cleansing begins without trees the most paranoid yo'
Inflictin' in situations that most can't avoid
For sure caps have backfired bodies been caught
Quarterbacks is necropheliacs when shotties get cocked
And once ya' shit is cocked pull it
'cause if not you might see yourself goin' crazy
Thinkin' you can use your back to block bullets

[Clowd9yne]
Yo it's the main cause of niggaz depictin' this came wrong
With a spliff it don't take long to commence to a brain war Sonny
High when I'm writin' this shit like the sky
When it's lightnin' and thunderin' now my mind could adjust it
Public and toxic and seein' life in different degrees
If I want it I got it especially when hittin' this green
I ain't even gotta struggle my rappin' is kind of puzzled
Hard to get a grip chief smoke relaxin' my muscle
Sober niggaz hold it down I keep my actions above you
Below the ground I blow a pound and be excited as shit
It never occurred to me gettin' pissed and mad at the world
Could be a criminal with hot hands and nines in his grip
Not blamin' pitiful cats for the lame excuse for the packin' of tools
Open you up like a surgeon occupation nigga

[R.E.U.]
Maaaaaan you shouldn't give a fuck got some guns load 'em in the pick up truck
call ya' mans pick 'em up get the dutch
Spics and niggaz collide but where our mental is aimed?
Doing drive-by's in rentals with James
Or whatever his nickname is 'cause when inhalin' smoke
Comin' down's like fuck it I'm never gon' get famous
For better livin' yeah and my patience is broke
It seems as if my better livin' goes away with the smoke

[Clowd9yne]
Relightin' the trees now I'm up in the class with grade A Hydro
Nobody's hyper than me man - I'm a survivor through this hard time of bein' off
And now I'm not and Clowd's more wanted than Osama
Can't balance too much stress and good ganja
Me extraordinary style misunderstood kind of - Chief somethin' nigga",Up in Smoke,2004

But I must go along
Till the Lord comes to call me away, oh Lord

Well, the morning is bright

And the night is as fair as the day

Oh, there will be peace in the valley for me, for me
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
No more sadness, no more sadness, no more trouble there'll be
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

Well, the bear will be gentle
The wolf will be tame
And the lion shall lay down with the lamb, oh yes

And the [Incomprehensible] from the wild
Will be led by a child
I'll be changed from this creature that I am

Oh, there will be peace in the valley for me some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, I pray
No more sadness, no more sadness, no more trouble there'll be
There will be peace in the valley for me, for me

R.H. Harris,"Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see. 
  
'Twas Grace that taught my heart to fear,
And Grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that Grace appear
The hour I first believed. 
  
Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come.
'Tis Grace hath brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home.

It's been years since the kids have grown,
a life of their own, left us alone.

John and Linda live in Omaha.
Joe is somewhere on the road.
We lost Davy in the Korean war.
I still don't know what for, don't matter any more.

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
""Hello in there. Hello""

Me and my husband, we don't talk much anymore.
He sits and stares through the backdoor screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
like some forgotten dream
that we've both seen.

Someday I'll go and call up Judy.
We worked together at the factory.
Ah, but what would I say when she asks what's new?
Say, ""Nothing, what's with you?
Nothing much to do.""

You know that old trees just grow stronger,
and old rivers grow wilder every day,
ah, but, but old people, they just grow lonesome
waiting for someone to say,
""Hello in There. Hello.""

So if you're walking down the street sometime
and you should spot some hollow ancient eyes,
don't you pass them by and stare
as if you didn't care.
Say, ""Hello in there. Hello.""",Hello in There,2007

Hola Soy Yo
De verdad estoy llamando para decirte que
Lo nuestro no puede continuar, espero que puedas entenderlo
Y que algun dia me puedas perdonar

Hoy a terminado el amor de los dos
Quisas amarte tanto , ese fue mi error
Hoy no sentiras nada , pero pronto veras
Que el amor que te di nadie lo igualara
Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas , mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola , con ganas de amar
Lloraras

Te marchas para siempre sin explicacion
Y entre tus maletas, mi corazon
Te vas sin decir nada sin importarte mi dolor
Pero se que algun dia sentiras lo que yo

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas solas, con ganas de amar
Llorarasss

Cuando beses otros labios y, no
Sientas en calor que sentias conmigo
Cuando veas que ya no hay marcha atras
Vas a querer regresar, y muy tarde sera

A veces no sirve el amor sin ser conrespondido
Te llevas mi corazon en pedazos partido
No me diga que el tiempo que pasamos se a perdido
Solo recuerda los momentos bellos que hemos vividos
Vas a llorar, cuando quieran besarte recordaras los momentos que tu Solias amarme
Vas a sentir lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Este dolor tan grande que me esta matando aqui adentro.

Y lloraras
Y te recordaras
De aquellos bellos momentos que solo conmigo as de pasar

Y lloraras
Y te arrepentiras, si
Cuando te sientas sola, con ganas de amar

Cause I'm still in love with you

I went by mother's, saw your car there
To her you still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
I've tried and I can't do it
Cause I'm still torn

I tried to think of you as just another love
(in my past) in my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple, baby we

We can't be friends
(oh no no no no no) we
We can't be friends
(if we) if we can't be lovers
(we we we)
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love

You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
You may see me hang my head
When yo come me way
Don't get to close to me
And expect to behave(behave)

I might just steal a kiss

If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say (say)

We can't be friends
(yeah oh no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah, you know I can't go on being just your friend, yeah)
Cause I'm still in love with you

We can't be friends

Can you look me in the eyes
And honestly say you don't love me?

Shines the brightest sun

I'm better than before

So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath
While beggin' me to keep the peace

In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need

Now all my niggas say what(what)

Now all my niggas say what
We don't give a fuck
Gotta let a nigga stack dough(money, money)
[J.D.]
All the niggas fuckin in between, be the the main man
Never get stuck on the scene without a game plan, understand
I went from pop lock into tops droppin
To one of the reasons why the day parties keep rockin
No stoppin niggas is like (wa-what?)
And shorty from the south keep fuckin it up
I'm the glitter and the gliss of this industry
Makin hits, is how ya'll remember me
Niggas dream to be like this one here
JD type cat don't disappear
I'm the J to the E, are to the M
A-I-N-E, got so many
Bitches I should set up shop
Bettin against me,
Please! my bank don't stop
I come through, bumpin Clue, with a 7-5-0
Screamin, I gots to have it, I love the dough

[Chorus 2X]

[R.O.C.]
Nobody want to fuck with the R.O.C.
Young G from the streets
And he's banned from t.v.
Nobody said life was easy
Out on the block
I got shot
And nobody came to see me
Back on my feet
Packed my heat
Got back in the beef
Blazed it up
Are ya muthafuckas lookin for me
Raized it up
And now they see I'm makin rap songs
All I ask is my real doggs smash on...
I said yea and ya don't stop
'cause its a 1-8-7 when ya fuck wit R.O.C.!!
I said yea and ya don't quit
I'm comin live from the Bricks wit the gangsta shit
All my niggas on the corner at the end of the block
Infront of the stores, shakin my dick at the lady cop
Shakin my clip
Til the hatas drop
And I'm in a drop-top, bumpin down ya block
And I'm dumpin

[Chorus 2X]

[J.D.]
I seen a lot of niggas go down the wrong path
And I learned from they mistakes, how to keep cash
In this world it's snakes,
I don't care,
I don't break,
Pushin Benz, 'cause a nigga know how to create
On and on like a jeep go
Any nigga standin in my way of my papers, automatically fonito
Suckin on the end of Rosco pico's
Trained to name
Deleted from the muthafuckin game
Ain't no mo shoppin throught the glass
Beggin for ass
If it ain't 1st class
I let it pass
Ya'll that don't got it talkin all that trash
Tryin to play tough ya'll when ya really bitch-ass
I'm the cream of the crop
The dream of the top
I'm the one they come and see when they don't want it to stop
I'm the bass,
The snare,
The one that don't care
Rip shit the fuck up then I'm outta here

[Chorus]
R-O-C, if this is what ya want
Then put your hands up high and keep em' up
My dudes, my dimes then this is what your get
All playa, makin' paper, breakin' haters represent
So So, let's go, the D to the EF
Now put your hands up high and keep em' up
Let's drink and smoke and tear the party up
Now put your hands up again and tell me who ya love

Clothes, cash, cars, glass
Mary Blige or the cranberry and naj
22 wenches are so often witches
A couple of mansions, a couple of Benz's

Flows is endless, dough tremendous
No one comprehends is the way I pen this
All of my men's is in jeans and Tims's
Came to get the club doors off the hinges

Wired right now, turn these lights down
The DJ booth's on fire right now
Middle of the club with the thugs, I'm iced down
Half grape juice, half papaya right now

All my ladies, let's be swayzie
My man got the Bentley, I got the Mercedes
So let's just say we, hit 280
And rep for the Bricks cause my hook is crazy

[Chorus]

Say (HIT ME ROC!)
All of the women in the club
Who love feelin' the villains and thugs
Say (HIT ME ROC!)

Maybe I will
But the dress, heels, head gotta be ill, but still
I tear they brain up with hell a game
Numb chicks like Novocaine every time I flow a game

The best that has ever came
Remember Mary Blige told you I was everything
It's still the same, real-a game, illa chain
Used to pump cane up in Jersey, over where Lauryn Hill would hang

But now it's just an overseas villa thing
I love to hear my name, ladies would you say again

[Chorus]

Like this, like that, and like this and uh
My machine gun funks like Christopher
Now let me see y'all jump, bounce, get up
Puff something, pop something, slug till ya spit up

I'm so lit up
Used to have love fuckin' girls in my heart but my chain froze it up
You know what's up, 9-7 grid
I come through in a crooked letter UV

Dippin' missin' competitions
Only wishin' for the mortician
6-4 sits on hydro suspension (Bounce)
Manuscriptin' my intuition (Bounce)

Shine and glitzin' my mind is missin'
But any beat chu' find, the rhyme just sits in the loop (Uh huh)
And ain't no substitute
I'm a fly motherfucker all about the loot, come on

[Chorus]

Say (PICK ME ROC!)
All of my mommies in the party, movin' they body
When you see me at the bar say (PICK ME ROC!)
Then show me ya thong, and it's on
Come on all my ladies sing along

And niggas with a lot of money, bottles in they hand
And short shirts, honies tryin' to show that slow (show that)
Lined up tryin' to get through the velvet ropes
'Cause over here when the jam drops everybody bug
Standin' on the couches like this our club

The party begins when the slurpin' ends (oh)
You do me, I do you
Spend a night with boo-boo

R.O.C.,"Have you ever heard the sound of a .44, at your door?
You got guns (you got guns), I got guns (uh-huh)
Meet me at the corner store
After school, wild wild west
Even the teacher got a vest (this is what I said)
You can ask, on the block, fool ? ain't the one to test
Street Jeopardy (here we go yo, here we go yo, here we go yo)
Have you ever played Jeopardy

Not me, it could never happen to me
Professor says what you wanna do? Sell drugs or get a degree?
Looked at him and smiled with 32 gold teeth
And said what you make in a year, I make it in a week
Elementary at the time, I don't think of gettin caught
Sellin with degrees, pickups at the seaport (come on)
Once caught, you know the drill, it's military
I can't lie, it gets scary, you screamin' for your mommy (come on)
Truth or dare, beware, the game is never fair
I'm fallin and I can't get up, like a dead hare
You stare like you seen me before
Yup, you put the gat to my gut, stuck me up in the truck
And said, ""Don't nothin move but the goods""
Caught an arrow in your back fuckin wit Robin Hood

This street life'll get you if the hustle don't fit you
Paranoid crews don't choose, nigga stick you
Arms and foldin macks to ya back tryin'a vick you
Belief in my crew wishin' foes never get through
And if so, Shalom, bless my soul, I'm home
I lived my life to the fullest, neighborhoods now known
A stone face is outta place when discussin B.I
If I have a second thought, you ought not reply
I fought hot and sticky summers when the game started heatin
Competition, mega jail, and the well, who was eatin (oh well)
And every cell in the bang had a tenant
With each of them regrettin they was in it

Have you ever heard the sound of a .44, at your door?
You got guns, I got guns

In the end it's all pain)

Yeah, yeah
I got up, sunny day, hood callin my name
Strange, I feel nauseous, memories of a pine cauffin
Seemed to me that I was dreamin
I'd been struck by a crazed fan after the concert, damn
Slugs form and I hurt, hopped up, checked my physical
But the pain was all mental, I slipped into
The shower, hopped out, got dressed, hit the blocks
Swarmed with cops, mad shots, hot shells dropped
You ever heard the sound of a .44 at your door?
Before, many times, I answered back with a milli
Now what? Now give me mine

We dance and watch the relations build 
Now I'm all up in her ear and she listenin' 
At the same time, watchin' how a nigga glistenin' 
BLING! BLING! I'm thinkin' it's bout time to go

So don't even think about lyin', baby 
Or try baby, to set me up for rape cause it's all on tape 
Where you said put the cake

Ain't that some shit? Suddenly, you hugs and kisses

",Going Home with Me,1998
R.O.C.,"Biatch,
What cha want to do?
What cha want to do?
We're the Legion of Doom.
We're the Legion of Doom.
We're the Legion of Doom.

Fourteen seventy-two is the same cut throat and locks,
And plenty dopes can you cope.
You can call me Count Chocula.
I control all the bitches, Chi-Chi control the riches,
And fly surf the snitches.

Look up in the sky as the fly,
My herion wip, clip on hip, now trip on this.
A bunch of outlaws try to take my town,
Set up shop, run me out, and cut me down.
And how that safe, when I'm the illa-superhero,
Born and raised on that muthafucking underground.
Brrrrbrrrrbrrrr, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em.
Try to catch me, slip 'em, but now you about to be my victim.
I'm not Aquaman, but a aqua-boogie.
I'm sorta like a monster, chasin' cookies,
And I spin a web any size, you can call me to fly.
I walk walls and this is for all my dogs.
(Woof!)
I'm like the wonder twins, my style activates.
The many niggas get in it, and try to playa hate.
It's fly, the rider Maine and Ri, (man, man.)
I do it like a muthafucking rider,
And I represent all the time and
I represent the mad ass fuckin' eastside.
(Eastside,) look out, look out, come out,
'Cause here comes the rider man,
(Rider man,) nigga.

I rock the blue cake on 'em, drop the weight on 'em.
The more they hate, the more I elevate on 'em.
I swerve and collect, serve and protect,
Never hit the streets without the ice on my neck.
I'm all about partying, hos, and getting paper.
They call me Chi-Chi and do it up, caped crusader.
Contact through the frame, no mistakes.
To bank rules, back in town and it's on us to shut 'em down.
Now fly what cha want to do, (nigga what.)

Let's put this shit down my lil' homey, Mr. Turner, with the murder.
He got my back, you know he put me up on game.
When they get up, they getting lit up, heat that shit up.
Enough said, don't tell it, jus' sell it.
We blowin' in the wind and we gonna ride till we win.
Young soldier, stickin' to it, we put the Folgers. 
It's your turn gone get on up and get the light,
And don't forget to grab your strap.

[Chorus x 2]
Look up in the sky.  It's a bird; no it ain't.
It's the Legion of Doom, ain't a damn thing changed.
Keep it safe and sound, get it locked down,
And you don't have to worry when we in your town.

Just a young muthafucker from the street,
Forced to be a G-angsta, knock-knock with a glock, pump-pump answer.
Throw your hands up, nigga, yeah, death's a callin'.
Went from petty deaf bank robber, straight to ballin'.
Stop with us, walk with us, as we bust through,
The doors, forties fallin', like parts in us off in dust.
Stereos got many holes in, plenty dope, plus we fly as fuck.
Duct tape while room up, toe tag 'em.
Have him feel the strength of a black magnum,
Body bag him, nobody is as bad as them.
As shown as them, set kissed like FM.
Life in 1-4-7 to the deuce, right then.
I slipped in the bullet-proof suit,
And swoop down on the bank ruler with the gats.
Waiting for the permission to cancel his ass,
Handle his ass.
I love to see his guts and his blood spill,
And cracked up as I drugged, as I rise flying up high with a forty-five.
If a red demon in it from the sky,
Drop and I put the barrel right between his eyes,
And said you fuck with the Legion and now you must die.
We serve and protect all the hustlers,
And G's from the west to the north, south and back to the east.

[Chorus x 2]

Look up in the sky, (in the sky.)
No it ain't, (no it ain't, no it ain't,)
Mean a damn thing changed, (changed, changed, changed.)

When we in your town, (in your town.)

Look up in the sky, (in the sky.)

And y'all know who the fuck I be
And for a long time I think niggaz been taking So So Def for a joke
But I guess that's why we rich and y'all niggaz is broke

Y'all got one chance to flow I let y'all know
While y'all stretch your mouth I stretch my dough
Also stretch the doors on my Navigators
Long as the Olajuwon
Rock mine a Phenomenon Mr. Smith style
You want to get uh, oh here he is now
Dot to the O caughted blow your shit down
Dot to the see you're feelin' me now?
Anyhow y'all niggaz can't measure up
I'm here to get my cheddar and who ever mess it up?
Then I'mma blow these rounds out, wet â??em up
For my dawgs like DMX who pound like Kurupt
And Snoopy in the club getting at the groupies
Stash the uzi tonight flash the jewelry
And just post up we can't be touched
All my niggaz say, ""WHAT WE DON'T GIVE A FUCK""! (UH)
Be-boy style hot like tical
Four, five cal, check into the profile of a killa
Sonny Black my mellow, my ace playa get on the
Microphone and rock it please

I'm make y'all niggaz feel the hit homie
None of y'all motherfuckers know me
Three times a niggaz like T.O.N.Y.
All up in your spot like Navy Seals, wave your steel
Lay your shit down, clown I'm for real
Spittin' Crips for chips, plant bombs in your whip
I bring the pain to the game on the real tip what?
Hittin' niggaz like JFK
For the pounds and the bricks and yay, hear what I say?
Squeezing off, just to mash and releasing off
Y'all motherfuckers shouldn't be so soft
Oh you type thug niggaz
Frump niggaz, yo I got no love niggaz
Expect the worse yo check it can make you see the hearse
Tell mama I'm about to break the button for the nurse
Niggaz don't want it but they think they do
And soldiers should never fuck with me and my crew, who?

You know I'm gonna make them dance when I step in the club

Well I know another way to make â??em put their hands up

I drop the beat on
I cock the heat on
I got this party niggaz
We lock the street corners

Well it's him again, the Timbaland lacer
You trembling in the faces, Detroit hates us
Take us, come smooth the hard shit, rock jewelry
Like Mr. Antarctic
Watch our hands move regardless of the chartless
Cock your automatic
So the safest thing for you to do is shut the fuck up
Let my crew do this (UH) like this niggaz from the bricks and (UH)
You don't want NWK to get to ya
So you heard we make believers out of dreamers
Now we make murder cases out of sleepers
S to the motherfuckers O to the S to the y'all damned
O to the D to the E F-uck you 'cause we buck you,
Y'all niggaz can't touch us

Assume my position 'cause papermaking's a must
Straight mangle motherfuckers when it's time to bust
Lace flows with angel dust all up in your spot
We got no things with us, kind of dangerous
Don't fuck around and get caught in a verbal onslaught
'Cause I'm label your bills and my man Too $hort , ooh Lord
Getting down one more time
For making motherfuckers who be out on the run
I gotta get mine daily can't let these motherfuckers fade me
That's just the way my mama made me
Top size rider from the get go, known to spit flows
And keep them niggaz on their tiptoes
I goes to the extremity blind with weed and hennesy
I know you niggaz don't remember me
Got the flow poetic, and I stay diamond setted
Running over tracks like I'm Libyan, here's the past
Labeled a pussy, cash see her bounce
Shaking, moving, waiting, sipping the ounce
What's up with that? None of y'all niggaz can fuck with Black
Motherfucker where's your focus at?
JD my mellow my ace get on the mic and come rock please

Nigga I feel like why you gon come if ain't on time
And ain't no need in coming out if you ain't gonna shine
That's why I am why I am with mine and y'all sick
While y'all keep it real we keep it rich
Just clowning, pounding, riding around in
Some of the most elite shit to ever hit the town
Screaming out how you like me now and I'm gettin busier
I stay platinum while y'all get dizzier
The difference between y'all is I get 'em out of their seats
And my balling techniques is out of your reach

Where we make hits, deep grits and steak, homes laced
We never hit the breaks just continue to speed

Hit the parties and the clubs in the Mercedes that bump my shit
Switch from trick to thug, a hundred percent pure bitch
Ice style, four clip, wish a nigga would slip, lights out
If a nigga ain't got four cents, I don't drop hints
Straight to the point, tell him I'm the hot kid about to rock this joint
Make they jump out they boxer draws

Close your mouth hon, I run

Cop a baby L blat, do as, I'm bangin' in that back
She got pictures of me, bangin' in that back
So we gon', laze up, in my tunes
And lock up for days in a hotel room
Pull the pink thong to the West (West)
Prepare to insert billy bong in ya chest

Ain't no shit bumpin' like this one

With her girlfriend, how I bangs it in

Turn around and see me cry

So many reasons why

I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in when the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin

The street lamp dies, another night is over

Your better off and you know it
You may never know it 
But I just can't let go 
I know it wasn't worth the trouble
But fuckin buy me some
I only get one chance at this

(Bridge)
I really love you
I really need you
I really really wanna hold you next me
I wanna cut you
I wanna bleed you
I'm never happy and I know that your to blame
I gotta hold you
I gotta kiss you
It doesn't make it any easier for me
I never told you I never miss you but I say it everyday

(Chorus)
After all it was you
That's the only explanation
In your broken train of thoughts
You had it all so figured out
But you wrong all along
Its just faulty information
And you'll never get the chance
The opportunity to live your life with love

and that's the only explanation
Its just faulty information

Ra,"You opened up a door and showed a distant light
Delightful eyes that hold the world in grey and white
Romantic arms designed to empty out my heart
Creative joy, dynamic love right from the start

I believe in a world that can take you high
I believe in a thought that can touch the sky
I believe in peace and harmony
I believe that you belong to me

Collective mind I underestimate the sun
In everything in everywhere in everyone
Semantic goals I disregard the simple truth
I trade my fear, I trade my hurt in for my youth

I believe in a world that can take you high
I believe in a thought that can touch the sky
I believe in peace and harmony
I believe that you belong to me

If only I could hold you every day
I could undertake a larger mission
I know that you and I is hard to say
But broken pieces can be whole again, whole again

I believe in a world that can take you high
I believe in a thought that can touch the sky
I believe in peace and harmony
I believe that you belong to me

Mommy, you won't tell me what you know

We have to find the time
To make these people do the things the say

Sorry, I look past the truth alone
Maybe, with my fists I throw a stone
Shallow, graves fill up without regret
Broken, promises we all forget

You walked in with a reason to rekindle

And then you lied (And then you lied)
Oh yes you lied
Why, Why did you lie?

Talk to the people, with no interruptions and interference 

Put that mic down, admire the technique and tight tight sounds
Of a Renagade, never been afraid, the time is right now
Before I take my bow and finally allow
My love affair with rap to fade, I'll sink into the page
Pleasure and the pain that came from rulin' the game
And the half Dominican that gave me brains in the fast lane
A seventeen-year reign, simple and plain
When I ruled the rap game and all my peers sold cocaine
One-three-two Uptown, when Rich Porter told me
""See you can push a new car, it's different for a rap star""
And AZ was givin' 50s to the homeless
They never bragged about it ? ""L, we don't condone this""
On the back of the bike with Alpo
Doin' a buck down one-two-five, hopin' to stay alive

Favorite spot rooftop
Me and Big chuckle up when he was hittin' up ""Juicy"" and whatnot
Damn, when Dapper Dan got shot up
Before they made drops when we had to cut the top up
Some cats neglected the fact that L was hot
Cause they warm and electin' me hot when I stepped in the spot
Lyrically reppin' the block on Farmers to rock
But my sex symbol status made me, corny to cop
The microphone strategist ripped the apparatus
Left competition embarrassed but I never held malice

It's a manifestation of the pain of a nation
That makes materialism the only thing we're chasin'
The real gangstas never talked to me tough
Never told me they was hard, or claimed to be my God
When I first found the courage to bounce up outta Queens
And saw Big Dave comin' up out the store with money machines
My only dream was to rock mics in the spotlight
Joint bumpin' on Marley Show all night
Whoever thought that I would be a movie star?
A rap icon, chokin' the game like a python
Russell turned the hype on, exploded like a pipe bomb 
Just because a young boy, turned the mic on
Still admire skills and cats that are ill
With lyri-kills, nowadays the chorus is payin' the bill
The black man found a way outta the hood
Now it's slaves to mayor's not all good
Don't let 'em take our music and plagiarize the game
Then you call up and request it and pretend it's really flames?
The tip of the iceberg, I'll hold my piece

If they gave her half a chance
She could soon learn how to dance
So she could earn her living
Gracefully

One for the money
Two for the show
Three for the lady on the radio
Four might be the one
You'll never know, you'll never know
If only there was a better way to go {way to go}
