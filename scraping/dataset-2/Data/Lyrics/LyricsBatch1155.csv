The Libertines,"I've got a little secret for you

Even now there's something to be proud about
You'll come up the hard way
And they'll remind you every day, ""you're nothing""
My words in your mouth are mumbled all about
You're like a journalist
No you can't cut and paste and twist
You're awful

And tell it to your king
Go on and tell him everything you know
Tell him you know how I feel
Tell him you know how I feel at the palace gates
I’m all levered off my face
And just to work out what it's on about
I can see snakes in eyes
And danger signs

If you were late
You mustn't dare complain
Oh, you won't like this at all
There's nothing to break your fall

Tell it to your king
Tell him everything you know
And you know how I feel out of place
Until I'm levered off my face
And I can work out what she's on about

Didn't they explain?
You have to play the game

Jack drinks and smokes his cares away
His heart is in a lonely way
Living in the ruins of a castle built on sand",Tell the King,2002
The Libertines,"Did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
Shovelled up like muck and set the night on fire
Wombles bleed, truncheons and shields, you know I cherish you my love

But there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
You caught round the houses with your trousers down
A headrush in the bush
You know I cherish you, my love
Oh, how I cherish you, my love

Tell me what can you want now you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean
He knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
And it's all
It's all in my hands
And it's all up the walls

Well the stale chips are up and the hope stakes are down
It's all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
And I sighed and sunken with pride
Well, I passed myself down on my knees
Yes, I passed myself down on my knees

Now tell me what can you want now you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean
He knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
And we'll die in the class we were born
But that's a class of our own my love
A class of our own, my love

Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love
Yeah, I cherish you, my love",Time for Heroes,2002
The Libertines,"Karima knows just what it is she does
It can't be hard for her to get a buzz
Down in the street below
You hear the drunken prophet sing
""I know what's on your mind, my boy
'Cause I can see, oh everything""

Lead pipes, your fortune's made
Well, take a tip from me
Climb up to her window ledge
Or you'll forever be

Just walking under ladders
As the people 'round you hear you crying please
As the people 'round you hear you crying please

Lead pipes, a fortune's made

Karima knows just what it is she does
It can't be hard for her to get a buzz

And letting go
Me myself I was never sure
Was it the liquor
Or was it my soul?",Vertigo,2002
The Libertines,"You caught me in the middle
Phased on the carpet
I was following a line of new rang horse
They said

""Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side
Standing to your right, come on""

You caught me in the middle dazed and confused
I was following the good steps fancy free and footloose
Something ain't quite right

Then we'll have a good time, come on

Where does all the money go
Straight, straight up her nose

And I never really liked it any way
So much preferred it the other way yeah

What a divvy what a fucking div
Talking like a moron, walking like a spiv

Don't look back into the sun
Now you know that the time has come
And they said it would never come for you, oh-oh-oh 

Oh, my friend you haven't changed 
You're looking rough and living strange
And I know you got a taste for it too oh-oh-oh 

And they'll never forgive you but they won't let you go, oh no
She'll never forgive you but she won't let you go, oh no

Don't look back into the sun
You've cast your plans but you're on the run
And all the lies you said, who did you save?
But when they played that song at the Death Disco
It started fast but it ends so slow
And all the time it just reminded me of you

The Libertines,"My love wrote the words to the saddest songs
The songs that says that life's too long 
And the moon is always blue, just because 

I wish you'd sing me those other songs again 
The songs that say life's worth the worry and the pain 
The sun smiles through the rain, just because 
Just because she's the sweetest girl, the sweetest girl in the world 

She's my moral guide, oh she does nothing at all
Smokes all of my bones and stares at the wall 
Maybe she'll pace the room, howl at the moon 
But still she's the sweetest girl 
And he's the sweetest boy in the world 

And me, I'm just a dilly boy

The Libertines,"From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one-track mind and eyes for me
Half blinded in a war

With a pale, young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no mind to please him
Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind

A little boy in a stairwell who
Says 'I hate people like you'
I got matchsticks and cable TV
Half of less than 50P
We all clambered over the balcony
Banging on the window, waking Steve
Bringing with the true love his unholy friend
Singing, 'If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind'

So, baby, please kill me
Oh, baby, don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh, baby, don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

Monkey asked to the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
Turns you into stone
Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
Cheap hotel where I can meet the past
Pay it off and keep it sweet
(aw) It's sweet and it's nothing, no
It's just like nothing at all

You know I've seen you there
How could i help but stare?
It rips the heart out of your, baby
I've taken too far too much to see or think or touch what's real
Stranded on this street that paved my only way home
If you really need it all
You just won't leave him behind

Oh please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
Don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
And don't try joke about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

The Libertines,"Roll a gasper
The guard said he could stay alive
But he has to shovel
And burn his friends to die, people to die
And the gate read:
""Arbeit Macht Frei""

In her rollers
And a gasper
She's leaning the steps in a mean street
Where no policeman walks the beat

He don't like blacks or queers
Yet he's proud we beat the Nazis? 
How queer

It just rolls by till it hits the sky
I'd beg the moon to end the day

Too tired to taste the cornflakes on your tongue
As morning hits the docks
You dream of all the ships there must have been
I river full of everything that it's not
And if your life's not meant to feel like this
Maybe it's time for someone to resist
The riverbank could tell you tales
Of working lives, ship with sails

Sometimes it comes down to you
The many to protect the few
Unless you cross the line your jobs are gone

Tel it a thousand ways you'll still be wrong

Maybe unions and players won't save us
But there's nothing on earth can break us
The strength to load a thousand ships
But willing hands can turn to fists
On picket lines emotions feelings overflow
A decent job for decent pay
To fight if that's the only way
The union says well tough your on your own
If it takes a thousand days we'll never stop

I could give you everything?""

Contained, or satisfied by all
You could bring

The day unwraps the night ties
And we can see

The sunbeam blinds the moonbeam
And morning disagrees
And with panic before dream-time
Overcome

Goose pimplean
That shivers to my fingers
As I touch

The hairs below your stomach
And slowly in between
Oh, how slowly can I stay here?
And never yet too much

And if you get married
You'll find out that it's true
Love becomes a savage
Who's going to savage you

Planted with best wishes
A mouthful of sips

And I know every kiss
And what tastes have been before me
And which ones you will miss

When we thought everything would now go our way
We inherited a fortune of innocence
And they took it all away

Through province town to cities of obscurity
And somewhere down the road it occurs to me
That I might have missed my stop

But I will not return to yesterday
Or smooth out the human clay
We'll face this new England like we always have

In a fury of denial
We'll go out dancing on the tiles
Help me down, but don't take me back

I heard a lover calling to Saint Anthony
Sadly treating love like her property
Only battles can be lost and so it seems we do
But I'm hoping for a change

I left you at the bus stop in working town
Now the service has been cut re-named slumber down
I can see you on the bars of your brother's bicycle
Now I hope you're not alone

And all the politician creeps
I know they want them back
And the couturier weeps
She knows they won't come back

And the lovers who seldom speak
I know they want them back
And me falling back into your half term kisses
No I will not

As in the love I would confess
You shivered far beneath your dress
What did I hold you against?

Your back against the rough sand of the sea
The rush of delight you gave to me

With the point of a rusty safety pin

Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the southbound odyssey

Rolls along past houses, farms and fields.
Passin' trains that have no names,
Freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles.

Penny a point ain't no one keepin' score.
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle
Feel the wheels rumblin' 'neath the floor.
And the sons of pullman porters
And the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel.
Mothers with their babes asleep,
Are rockin' to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.

Rolling down to the sea.

To fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news.

The Limeliters,"Introduction: This one is the story of Harry Pollitt. 
Harry Pollit was at one time a very influential member of the Communist Party in England, 
Until he was finally throwm out; and when they threw him out, 
They wrote a song about him as if he were dead. 
And it goes like this: 


Harry Pollit was a work; one of Lenin's lads
He was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads
Counter revolutionary cads, counter revolutionary cads
He was foully murdered by those counter revolutionary cads!

Old Harry went to heaven 
He reached the Gates with ease,
Said, ""May I speak with Comrade God; 
I am Harry Pollitt please
I'm Harry Pollitt please, I'm Harry Pollitt please,
May I speak with Comrade God, I am Harry Pollitt please.""

""Who are you' said Saint Peter, ""Are you humble and contrite?""
""I'm a friend of Lady Astors.""
""Well, OK. that's quite alright.
OK, that's quite alright, well OK. that's alright
You're a friend of Lady Astor, well OK that's quite alright.""

They put him in the choir, but the hymns he did not like
So he organized the angels and he led them out on strike
Led them out on strike, Led them out on strike
He organized the angels and he led them out on strike!

One day when God was walking around heaven to medidate,
Who should he see but Harry chalkin' slogans on the gate?
Chalkin' slogans on the gate, slogans on the gate
Who should he see but Harry chalkin' slogans on the gate?

Well, they brought him up for trial before the Holy Ghost
For spreadin' disaffection amongst the heavenly hosts
Amongst the heavenly hosts, amongst the heavenly hosts
For spreadin' disaffection amongst the heavenly hosts

Well, the verdict it was guilty, Harry said ""Ah, well'
And he tucked his nightie 'round his knees and he drifted down to hell
Yes, he drifted down to hell, he drifted down to hell
He tucked his nightie 'round his knees and he drifted down to hell.

Now seven long years have passed, Harry's doing swell
He's just been made the first people's commissar for soviet hell,
Commissar of soviet hell, commissar of soviet hell
He's just been made the first people's commissar of soviet hell!

Well the moral of this story Is easy for to tell, 
If you want to be a Bolshevik, 
You'll have to got to hell, 
If you want to be a bolshevik, you'll have to go to hell, 
Yes, you'll have to go to hell, 
If you want to be a Bolshevik, 
You'll have to go to hell!

You can tell me just the same

Past your boxed up hollow station

Fire your attention away from jaws to your feet where
We'll make 'em, make 'em move forward

If you change this grand design and sweep its general outlines
You are one step closer towards your own betterment
Every time we close our eyes, rhythm falls out
Come on, come on you can't hide

Slide into the middle, don't wait for an answer

The sea will start a fire

Living in the lights, never caught you a breakthrough
The people are in lines, trying to be you

From silhouettes to the beating drums
With the free will towards their own experiment
Underneath the covered core are countless numbers

The truth lies somewhere within

In stone and never hidden from sin

We choose to arrive, as lips may slide
To echo something relevant
An ear may concede and the other may bleed
You just don't know

Why don't we just face the facts
And leave it all alone?

Eyes can be revealing, eyes can be cheating
It takes two to make some sense of it
Mirror one another, attempt to read the glow
And see if you seeing is clear

Unfocused but wise, some x-ray type
Decipher a coded artifact
The deeper you peep you fall back asleep
I just don't know

Why don't we just face the facts

With outlines and figures of leaders in silent and gone
Our eyes draped in color with each passing hour and our bodies grew small
And voices, once listless burst out in pitches so tall

We arched our backs to see the light
Sway to the downbeat fire
In their heads they were so inspired
As they danced to their hearts' desire

At that moment we motioned to the sun
Waved our hands around based on the idea of time
Oh, ah, oh, ah, oh, ah
Wife us and clothe us, and clothe us until the dawn burst forth
Straight from the backroom, years that were calling for more

Who is the next one? Show 'em the limelight
Who is the next one? Show 'em the limelight
Check to the front sun and show 'em the limelight
Who is the next one? Show 'em the limelight

I know I'll come around

Your ringing seaside crawl

The mist grows more and more

At the sight of golden youth

When the sales greeter do

Dreamt of the leaves, stitched up the seams
And they all counted down
Each one mutter pair with another
And the young ones go round

Fading dreams and rich tangerine
The sky began to fall
Figures stack up whether they close up
They make the final call

Rise up as one counting down to one

Weavin' through my tangled brain

Smacked into a cop I didn't see

If you ain't drunk, then you're a fool""
I said, ""If that's against the law

Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together.

Hold your warm and tender body close to mine.
Hear the whisper of the raindrops,
Blowin' soft against the window,
And make believe you love me one more time,
For the good times.

I'll get along; you'll find another,
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me.
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever,
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me.

Then you started goin' out with the wrong kind of crowd
To my sorrow I've found that you've gone

Remember me when the candle lights are gleaming,
Remember me at the close of a long, long day. 
It would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
Just to know you still remember me. 
The sweetest songs belong to lovers in the gloaming, 
The sweetest days are days that used to be. 
The saddest words I ever heard were words of parting
When you said ""Sweetheart, remember me."" 

You told me once that you were mine alone forever
And I was yours till the end of eternity. 
But all those vows are broken now, and we will never
Be the same except in memory. 

[Chorus]

A brighter face may take my place when we're apart, dear, 
A sweeter smile, a love more bold and free. 
But in the end, fair weather friends may break your heart, dear.

You said that you were leaving
I said, shove off honey, baby I ain't grieving

There's a wide open road
Early this morning you were nowhere about
And so I searched the town, but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a-leading south
I saw a wide open road

There's a wide open road
It's leading south from my abode
If you stick a round and turn your damper down
There's a wide open road

Well, the reason I was looking for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your wedding ring when you went down
That wide open road
If you're gonna stay away, then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll the dough
Everything's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down the wide open road

 I ain't tryin to shoot you, 
 I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you 
 Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass

 Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!) 
 Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis 
 I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket 
 to fill it full of explosive gasses

We'll roll on with our heads held high
Our conscience in the gutter
Our dreams up in the sky

The wharfies standing strong
They gathered round to see what the union had to say
There's too much work and not enough pay
Say!

We'll protest in peace keep the whole thing quiet
The last thing needed is a wage-fuelled riot
'Cos they don't really care
They're always standing there
Running from the outside
From the outside
Running from the outside world

Why are you standing there?
Filming for the outside world
Do you really care?
Why are you standing there?

Dancing slowly on the edge of a knife
Sipping wine of the poisonous kind
Overdose on loneliness

Beyond there lies a better place
Where knowledge ends and faith begins
A hell to stand by and a heaven within

Prove to be nothing more than weeds
And the life you've known
Won't be he same as it used to be

Used to be

I wish it didn't have to be like this
Love doesn't lie, I'll testify
And that is the truth
And I dare you to defy
And to show me the proof

Hey, hey, disbeliever
You're bleeding me dry
Come on now, listen to reason
Everything will be fine

Hey, hey, disbeliever
We want to see ya
Try not to panic

You're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home
You're such a long way from home

Revenge can be sweet
And romance can be sour
We haven't much time
To dissect or devour

Love doesn't lie down
That's just the truth
I dare you to defy
And to show me the proof
I wish it didn't have to end like this

There are answers
No second chances
Given beyond the grave
So here's to the fucked up
Decisions we've made

Hey, hey, disbeliever
You're bleeding me dry
Come on now, listen to reason
Everything will be fine

Hey, hey

Once the performance is completed seated in the back

Alla that what you too tough to have fun? 
Frisked at the door so I know it ain't the gun 
In your waistline that got you shootin daggers in my face 
When I rhyme - times done changed and it's strange 
Got motherfuckers ain't smiled at a rap show in a while 
Probably since the Fresh Prince was in style 
So it's apparent that you just don't understand 
The meanest mug in the club, don't make yo' ass the man 
Now if you want to be a fan then that's fine 
But all I really want to do is just break through to your mind 
And show you just because you did some hood time 
Don't make it impossible to have a good time when you out 
See where I'm from, it's the hardest motherfuckers come to party 
All shermed out, so what's this really all about? 
You gelled, cause this man's double L, well hell

Quit wasting playing hard roles, when yo' ass is

Just give him a chance (baby baby gimme one more chance)

At the international terminal, where you don't go 
So don't go and diss, big groups, will get ripped 
And tripped by mic cords, and choked, with cordless

Far from a beginner, guess who's for dinner?

A legendary flame of a character with no name 
Same instance, persistence to have latitudes 
Bruise your knees, you will lose 
A life or limb, whichever you choose 
Find some foe in him, words tend to catch a phrase 
That will amaze most from the gazing point, with a judgment standard 
Categorized into a tainted picture before it gets a chance to be painted 
There's no blanket for the truth (I can't see!) 
I got a loose end of a lie, this amateur he tried to get by 
The size is more greater, and equator more immense 
Since it makes more sense to make some sense, or maybe you know 
Out of these weak ass rhymes you roam but you stay in flow 
In this dense a body of mockery

We split and fade, most, Sunspot Jonz, toast 
Goodbye to crust emcees; often lonely and homely 
If you could only capture the power of love 
Like ten albums in this glove, R.B.I. 
While you hittin pop flies.. and sacrifice your life 
And die in hurricane and methane

In a line if you know 
What's up with the times cause we straw the line

Made amends with my soul, now I'm ready to begin 
First ingredient is dope shit, and fool we already wrote it 
Mix up with the motives now we're forming perfect batter 
Had a vision it would burn, if I measured too precisely 
I add a pinch here and, there if the spice be right 
We might prepare this feast for many thousands 
So eat when you're aroused and enjoy - Legendary bitch!

No deterrent to what I've sent you

Sent you
Hey it's all monkey see monkey do
What's really inside of you
What's the motives to the things you do
Things you thought you knew
Nobody knows if nobody grows

To the top inner seeds in a medium
Untapped like a natural element
Expelled in the breeze

They really don't want it
I mean why put it out if your ass don't own it

And then they write it down and journalize
Speculate and generalize
Mask your lives in all these lies
They need to realize

Look between ya eyes this life ain't free man
Ya got to pay for what you need.

Cross the deadly sea
To live eternally

Tidal waving saving both coasts like we need
A coastguard, striking hard
Lightening force we the force...

Globes on a map through
The windy moss
The oceans holding the answers lost

Deal with the cost
Find what's lost
Who wants to be found?
So many want to be fly but stand on shaky ground

Lie to me; tell me that it's all right all night

All tight like a twister

The dead hands will pronate
And FEMA might come through
But they always show late

Have ya racin' like a Porsche
High powered outa control
Of the talents that you hold

Ideas tucked down underneath the skull cap
Clung to the main frame

And a push is like a shove
At times it's disastrous
But it's all done for the love

Pushin' through these lives that were in

Make you realize the stakes fool
This is what the force will do!!!

Make you see what's real, and wipe off the residue
I vow to flow fresh and forever stay true
Doing what I got to do, doing what I want to do
The opposite of a faker, it's the forces of nature

Tapping me with taxes isn't natural
My axis is an actual attraction
To the earth that I've been trapped in

In dilapidated fractions of the masses
We're attractin'
Quite magnetic we pull
If ya stuck in the rut
We make happen, forces tapping
On your soul, life windows
That's fogged up and clogged up blah blah blah

Bring about that piece of mind and recline
Let your guard down and see what you find
Inhale and exhale deeply, get loose
Stretch out your muscles and squeeze you some juice

Light that incense up and then bless your space
Go to that place where the calm is on your face
I promise that a taste of this is pure bliss
Where thought grows freely and minutes mean shit

I'm up in it clean fit, dreamin' so vivid
I let it all radiate, you see how I'm livin'
Energized and rested, tested time after time
I'm impressed with my body and mind

My hobby's so strenuous I gotta cool out
Focus on health so that I'm not ruled out
Exercise my knowledge and abolish all stress
Get a good sleep and tomorrow I press

Today I'm...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Bicasso]
Now let's pretend that I was just born
A niggas first breath, heartbeat, a life with no scorn
It wasn't me, it was the egos of MCs they say
The mic tempt me too

But like the dollars makes 'em fishy dude ok
The average day I got the duties of a lifeguard for myself
When I'm swimmin' in a system makes it so hard
But at the rest I just post up fine,

Patrol my coastline and make the most of my mind
Create the envelope and push it to the people on the avenue
The ones stuck in they offices, this world is a vacuum
But my sauce it got some smack too

Like on a Sunday afternoon I got you tuned into the spiciness
Blended just right with this in the pocket like some jeans
Or the rhythm of these funk strings and I might just get
Another dosage of this slow shit

It's bumpin in my system and my soul too,
It's what I do when I'm alone, it's like some soul food
I wouldn't just get up from the table man, it's too smooth
This groove is better than any wrong thing

And if the phone rings I'm'a hit 'em back now
Let the song sing...

[Chorus: x 2]

[Pep Love]
I'm unavailable for comment
I'd rather go sail my boat and ride the tail of a
Comet, inhale of the chronic, a glass of orange juice,
Read a book, write a poem,

Hike a trail in the forest dude!
Breathe in fresh air
Release pressure
Extend and bend and strength yeah!

Burn a incense, silence my mind in a instant
Because now is the time and I'm in this
It gets me open like Halls Mentholyptus
Pine cones and eucalyptus leaves

Mushrooms and wild flowers bloom
And cool Cali breeze
Make me feel superhuman
I might fly a kite, go home rock the mic

Throw on a song I like, call up my girl to bone
I'm in my own world, a zone
And it be them days like this when I don't answer the phone
I'm clearing my space

Excuse me while I take this brief intermission
From out the rat race
No hustle and bustle though my muscles are strong
I just don't want to do nothing

But sing my song...

It's late as fuck
The sun is coming out
It's a long-ass night, but I feel good

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I really give a fuck what you think
You could judge me til your face turn pink
Just ripped the show and we did what you can't
Luck, and I'm drunk and I'm far in the paint
I'm in Prague, she's in awe
Never really seen a black man with charm
Hopped in the cab and we off to the bar
On the other side of town where the drinks come strong
Five in the morning, I know the night young but she yawning
Took her to the 'tel let her feel what she wanting
I know I did it big I could tell by her moaning
In the morning in the morning

I know things could get all crazy
But you made it from the hating
I know, I know

Girl you all up in my mind
I just wanna see you go shine
So let's go, let's go

I'm taking a long-ass flight overseas
Sleeping on the plane until I reach Germany
Tiny group of people in Berlin, they heard of me
Stepping on stage to murder shit around three
Stinky motherfuckers usually surround me
But I don't clown, the got love for my sound
They want to see a party go down
With a cigarette burning past the filter, degrees
In the club hot mic feeds, they hop like fleas
When they feel the energy
They got the Pac white tees
But they love a little me
They love a little me, they love a little me

I'm on the west side of town
A tiny little spot where it all goes down
A black new world in the bottom of the village
With cute little girls in their black bottom, vintage
High-heeled boots, and they sippin'
Two dollar Cabernet, juke joint spinnin'
Late night nigger cabaret, never-endin'
Lindy hoppin to new be-boppin'
And fools be stopping through fitted
Wonder where it was? Better get in
Or holla at Diallo if you with it
That's my nigga

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It was a foreign exchange like Tay and them
Eatin' Mickey D's breakfast at six AM
Ain't nothing flyer than a Japanese sunrise
I wasn't just trying to hit it like some guys
Hash browns, hotcakes, and I cleaned my plate
I can't count all the bullshit that I done ate
She told me that she spoke English and I said great
Grabbed her hand out the club and I said let's skate
(Let's go)
Man this life so special
When the stress and strife try to test you
DUI and they try to arrest you
If you faded coming home from the club, God bless you

I had a party at my house tonight
Every girl that came through looked tight
All the homies had fun, there's no need to fight
So much drank and weed to keep us high as a kite
Now the sun is coming out, to chase the night away
If you listen really close, you could still hear the DJ play
She was beautiful, I hung on every single word she said
Like, let's get close there's no time to wait
My niggas ain't gotta go home
But ya'll sure can't stay

Good music for the grown and sexy
My lady and I, two of the best seats
But we ain't sitting down, we in step see
Big booty up close, pressed to me
I grab her waist and I smell her perfume
Jill Scott keeps singing her tune
Full moon and it's feeling real now
Babysitter, one o'clock and we still out
Blow the joint, breath the air, hit a detour
No one can see us in this lot, you could be sure
Make it hot, get the windows steamy
Car rocking, it's great to be me

Let's go
Ha

We could fly to Galapagos
Swim in the Ivory Coast
Roll in the sands, hand in hand
Let me hold ya close
Sip on some wine and toast
Down the shore lines and posts
Livin' the dream
Knaw' I mean
We be doin the most
You the one that I chose
Rub you down to your toes
Let's see how far this goes
Under the cosmos

Where it ends? Only God knows
One thing for sure I want you in my tomorrows
Yeah! And all them days after that
I'll be your Romeo, you be my Juliet
And if you with me holler back baby
Yeah! If you with me where you at?

Yeah, yeah
And I want to dedicate this to Monsignor, my main man on the boards
And to everybody that's coming home and it's really to early to go to sleep
And it's too late to call it a late night creep, take your ass in the house before noon!
Because then you're crazy, and use a condom
And if you go to jail call your mama because don't nobody else give a fuck about you. Peace!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And the cabbage patch?
Did you used to do that? 
Like that?

Driving home from the club, you know your ass got work in the morning
I hope your ass don't get fired

We the best in the world, I feel the breast on your girl
Ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah, legends

This is for when you're like six AM, it told you
And he furniture is all white and plastic
And you talking to a girl you have no business talking to, because she's too fine
And you ain't never talked to a girl that fine before
Tell her that you know me and it'll be all good
I'm just talking Monsignor, you can cut me off anytime

Peace
I always wanted to say that, peace
And we out

I wanna give a shout out to baby Rio
To Anticon, hahahahaha
To all the hipsters, that shirt cost sixty dollars and you just spilled ketchup on it
Don't that suck? 
Now it's really limited edition you asshole
If you come to my neighborhood, we'd beat your motherfucking ass
That's alright, you driving your mama's Lexus, what's up
Hahahaha, suck my dick
That's how it goes in the streets, I love you man
But we gotta clown man, we gotta have fun man
What's life if it's not fun? What's he gonna do man?
It's 6 am you still high off cocaine man
You shouldn't do hard drugs man, you know what I'm saying?
You shouldn't do drugs that are harder than you
If you a soft muthafucker, you shouldn't do hard drugs
How about that? Because the hangover in the morning is going to beat yo ass
That's the problem, shout out to everybody who was drinking Hennessey all night
Or all you dumb motherfuckers who bought that Ace of Spades champagne
Because Jay-Z put it in his new video. How 'bout that?
How about you have a mind of your own man?

An if you get pulled over like I said before, you're going to jail, but its alright
And if you downloaded this for free, you're never going to get laid again
Like Monsignor. Monsignor, when's the last time you got some pussy?
And if it's 6 AM and you just called a girl that got a bay of yours
And you gonna go have sex with the baby asleep in the bed next you, you scandalous
But it's a way of life you know hat I'm saying?
And if look, look, look, look, to all the Mexican homies headed to King Taco in East LA

There's still somethings that you don't understand now,
Before you ask some girl for her hand now
Keep your freedom for as long as you can now.""

Oh yeah, you better shop around."" (shop, shop around)

Ah, there's somethings that I want you to know now.

Before you take a girl and say I do, now,
Make sure she's in love with-a you now.

Could I join him?

When what to my wondering eyes should appear
In the line is that guy I've been chasing all year
'Spending this one alone,' he said
'Give me a break, this year's been crazy'
I said 'Me too, but why are you
You mean you forgot cranberries too?'

The Lollipop Guild,"Can you hear the drums Fernando?
I remember long ago another starry night like this
In the firelight Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

They were closer now Fernando
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

Now we're old and grey Fernando
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums Fernando?
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy
And so I dealt you the blow
One of us had to go
Now it's different, I want you to know

One of us is crying
One of us is lying
In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead
One of us is lonely
One of us is only
Waiting for a call
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small
Wishing she had never left at all

I saw myself as a concealed attraction
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving
That's how I started the show
One of us had to go
Now I've changed and I want you to know

E tira forte il vento
Su una vecchia terrazza
Davanti al golfo di Surriento

Un uomo abbraccia una ragazza
Dopo che aveva pianto
Poi si schiarisce la voce
E ricomincia il canto

Te voglio bene assai
Ma tanto tanto bene sai
E una catena ormai
Che scioglie il sangue dint'e vene sai

Vide le luci in mezzo al mare
Penso alle notti la in America
Ma erano solo le lampare
E la bianca scia d'un elica

Senti il dolore nella musica
E si alzo dal pianoforte ma quando
Vide la luna uscire da una nuvola
Gli sembro piu dolce anche la morte

Guardo negli occhi la ragazza
Quegli occhi verdi come il mare
Poi all'improvviso usci una lacrima
E lui credette di affogare

Te voglio bene assai ecc

Poi penso alla lirica, e al grande palco
Che con un po' di trucco e con la mimica
Puoi diventare un altro ma due occhi
Che ti guardano, cosi vicini e veri

Ti fan scordare le parole
O in fondo I tuoi pensieri
Cosi diventa tutto piccolo
Anche le notti la in America
Ti volti e vedi la tua vita

Come la scia d'un elica
Ma si, e la vita che finisce
Ma lui non ci pensava tanto
Anzi, si sentiva gia felice
E ricomincio il suo canto

Te voglio bene assai, ecc

He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few

I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

If not himself, then he has naught

A sacred why? A myst'ry gaping inside

Dance into the fire,

Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams.
Dance into the fire;
That fatal kiss is all we need.
Dance into the fire.

Just for you a view to a kill.
Between the shades, assassination standing still.
The first crystal tears
Fall as snowflakes on your body,
First time in years,
To drench your skin with lover's rosy stain.
A chance to find a phoenix for the flame,
A chance to die, but can we

Dance into the fire,
That fatal kiss is all we need.

Dance into the fire;
That fatal kiss is all we need.

Felt that move at your front door
Felt that blood inside you boil

You're the beauty I admire

Burning love, hope, and desire

Strip the morals from this town

Build the strength enough to climb and fight
The trees they grow in and block my sight
And now I'm stuck here with my darkest inner thoughts

The voices and the choices that are bound to tear me limb from limb
They told me that you hear in some other way but if the answer is unknown
Then why should I believe them when they say
That you're up there and you honestly do care?

But I don't feel it in my heart right now

Miserable excuse 
But tell the world of all the pain I've caused
I hope you don't forget these songs

I'm only twenty-one
I feel as though we can relate on some

So turn off, turn off this song

Turn off this song
You can listen to it later
And go outside

We see ourselves above the rest

I realize there is nothing I can do

That is greater than the orphan song she sings yeah

Never guess where I just came from

If I had to describe the feeling
It was the best
When I had the sex
Man my penis felt great
And I called my parents
Right after I was done

Oh hey, didn't see you there
Guess what I just did?
Had sex, undressed

Love how not one but both eyes are lazy
When I first saw you you were drivin' the bus
Thick skin, strong nose like a rhinoceros

Skin like asphalt, nose so runny
Thick thighs, no waist, not a care in the world

Half eaten squirrel hangin' outta your mouth

Back to junior high school where it all began
Three bad little kids raising hell at school
We were just thirteen straight actin' a fool

Every day after class, kiv's house was the spot
Making crazy prank calls hoping not to get caught
Best friends, blood brothers, yo, we one and the same
'Till one fateful afternoon when everything changed

One day playing punch out up in kiv's room
The house started shaking and we heard a ""kaboom""
Looked out the back window saw a billow of smoke
Yo, your backyard is smashed, man this isn't a joke

(Let's go check this out man!) (I bet, let's go)

All the smoke and debris led straight to the basement
Yo, what the hell is that? man, it looks like a spaceship!
We all ran for cover and the hatch opened wide
And a little green dude stepped out from inside

He said, ""I'm from mars, and I come in peace
I have something to ask, and it's not discreet
There's a mutated strain in our dna helix
And you three kids are the ones who can heal it""

But we're just thirteen, man, what can we do?
""Um, how should I put this? I think we should screw"" (what?)
""On our home planet we can no longer breed
I've been sent a self-receptacle for storing your seed""

Storing our seed? yo, I think he means sex
Man, I'm a virgin, we all are, bad!
""I'm just gonna lie here, and close my eyes""
Aw, what should we do? now it's spreading it's thighs!

""You'll be heroes on our planet!"" but why us three?
""You're the chosen ones, you'll just have to trust me""

(Yo should we do it?) (I don't know!)
(Yo, I say we put it to a vote.)
All in favor, say aye. aye!

Okay, we're in! ""cool."" Who should go first?
""I have three depositories to capture your burst""
Wait, at the same time? ""yeah, that's what I was thinking
Now here's some wine coolers, let's get you boys drinking""

We pounded the drinks, and started getting tipsy
We took our positions, and started getting frisky
One in the front and two in the back
Had it locked up like a Chinese finger trap

""Keep pumping away! my wife and family thank you""
I'm about to explode! yo son, me too!
Three way climax! best friends forever!
Who would thought that we've lost our virginities together

""Andy, Jorm and Kiv, you've saved our race
Your reward is one wish then I'll go back to space""

Knew exactly what he wanted before he took off

I'd lay em in a field, where there's chemical spraying
But I'd punch em first, yo that goes without sayin (yeah)
Acid wash pleats or a nifty cuff
It's just another jean for my fist to stuff

Throwing fista cuffs, eat pants like bag lunches
Jeans pronounced dead
Cause of death?
Hecka punches!

Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before
Best believe this is not a metaphor
You got something to say, we got the proper retorts
Beat your jeans so bad that they'll wish they were shorts
Gonna revise your Levi's with physical harm
Put divets in the rivets with my physical arm
Gonna beat those jeans, gonna dip em in slime
Turn your 501s into 499s
When I punch a jean I like to imagine a face
The fly is the nose and the balls are the base of the face
You got taste and it shows my man
God damn your jean brand got me throwing my hands
Gonna go back in time, find the man who made jeans
And choke him to death, if you know what I mean
Yo I know what you mean, so keep your jeans on a hush
Breakout, before you get bum-rushed

Yo we'll punch your jeans, we've said it before
Best believe this is not a metaphor
So take off your jeans, and reverse the curse
Cause we the best jean punchers in the universe

The Lonely Island,"What is that, crystal? (no!)
Dom p? (hell no!)
(this is that Carlos Santana champagne!)
Oh shit, Santana d-v-x? that's my joint!
(mine too, but a lot of these busters don't know about it)
Well let's tell these motherfuckers!

As a kid, I used to lay awake and think
When was Santana gonna make a drink?
But now I'm all grown and my dream came true
Santana champagne, from here to you
From the heart of napa valley and the guitar king
Comes a sparkling wine, to make a blind man sing
Yo it's the cham-pan-yah, from the man with the bandanna
I can't stand a flute with anything but Santana
What's the first name in cham, it's Carlos
And to that man I propose a toast
In the 60's, he had lots of freebie sex
But now he's gettin' down with the d-v-x

Excuse me fellas!
Am I to understand that Carlos Santana has made a champagne?
(that's right motherfucker! here, try it)
Alright aw shit!

I feel alive for the first time
Each sip hits my lips like a landmine
Without Carlos in my life I was livin' a lie
He makes his guitar weep, but his champagne cries
He's a southwest, tie wearin' bolo champ
Comin' straight out the box with a bolo champ'
Yo he a beast with the sugar and yeast, mix it in pots
Like the way his release mixed jazz blues and pops
And the salsa fusion, he's lady's shoe producin'
Plus he teamed with rob Thomas for a music revolution
On the 7th day, it was said god rest
But on the 8th day he made the d-v-x

Gentlemen, gentlemen, what is all the hubbub about?
(Carlos Santana!) that's right
I see bitches-is enjoyin' my sparkling wine
(we certainly are) well be careful
Cause this shit'll get you fucked up
Bitch!

I'm like no other, one of a kind, my sparkling wine
Santana d-v-x make you wanna have sex (ooh)
I'm rich bitch! I'm havin' my chips
Get laid all the time, by 70's chicks, uh
Won hella grammies, batches throw me they panties
I'm probably your daddy, I probably nutted in your mammy
I'm a bay boy, city life, been around the corner
Try to play me foul and my vatos goin' run up on ya
A legend, a boss, that's what I are
Ask about me pimp, 'tana be killin' the guitar
Old enough to know better but young enough to not care
I get active - might slap a bitch with my hair (whip)
Left coast up top I bang that shit
My sparkling wine'll pop crystal on her lip
Can't stop, won't stop gettin' my bread
Pack arenas and coliseums now watch me shred

Oh, san-tan-tan-tan-ah

A squid drank a bottle and became a freak
A lion drank a bottle and forgot how to growl

Down my drink while the rhythms boom
Take your hand and skip the names
No need here for the silly games
Make our way through the smoke and crowd
The club is the sky and I'm on your cloud
Move in close as the lasers fly
Our bodies touch and the angels cry
Leave this place go back to yours
Our lips first touch outside your doors
The whole night what we've got in store
Whisper in my ear that you want some more 
And I
Jizz in my pants

This really never happens you can take my word
I wont apologize, that's just absurd
Mainly your fault from the way that you dance
And now I

Don't tell your friends or I'll say your a slut
Plus its your fault, you were rubbing my butt
I'm very sensitive, some would say that's a plus

Now I'll go home and change

I need a few things from the grocery
Do things alone now mostly
Left me heart broken not lookin' for love
Surprised in my eyes when I looked above
The check out counter and I saw a face
My heart stood still so did time and space
Never felt that I could feel real again
But the look in her eyes said I need a friend
She turned to me that's when she said it
Looked me dead in the face, asked Cash or Credit?
And I
Jizzed in my pants

Its perfectly normal, nothing wrong with me
But were going to need a clean up on aisle 3
And now I'm posed in an awkward stance because I
Jizzed in my pants

To be fair you were flirting a lot
Plus the way you bag cans got me bothered and hot
Please stop acting like you're not impressed
One more thing, I'm gonna pay by check

Last week - I saw a film
As I recall it was a horror film
Walked outside into the rain
Checked my phone and saw you rang and I
Jizzed in my pants

Speeding down the street when the red lights flash
Need to get away need to make a dash
A song comes on that reminds me of you and I
Jizz in my pants

The next day my alarm goes off and I
Jizz in my pants

Open my window and a breeze rolls in and I
Jizz in my pants

When Bruce Willis was dead at the end of sixth sense I
Jizzed in my pants

I just ate a grape and I
Jizzed in my pants

I went
Jizzed in my pants

OK seriously you guys can we, OK?

I jizz right in my pants every time you're next to me
And when we're holding hands it's like having sex with me
You say I'm premature I just call it Ecstasy 
I wear a rubber at all times it's a necessity

It’s not about Shaq or Iron Mike
So buckle your seat belts it’s gonna get choppy
And listen to the tale of the time I fought Rocky

One day me and all my friends were hangin’
Talkin’ ‘bout which of the girls was most bangin’

Then one friend says “you know who’s really tough?
Rocky” (hit me holmes) the boxer, man

I said “yeah I know what about him?” he said
“He’s really tough”

No way man, I’m callin’ your bluff
I think that I could take him and to prove my point
I’ll challenge him in public (hit me homes)

YEAH THAT’S THE JOINT
So the very next day stay true to my word
And I snuck on tv, so I could be heard
I said “Rocky if you’re out there I think you’re a nerd,
And I’ll lick you and bury you like a dog turd”

I got kicked out but the candle was lit
Cause the people had to know if my plan was legit
It made the headlines then I got the call
It was Rocky (hey) and he wanted to brawl
We negotiated terms, and set the date
Then I went into training to add some muscle weight
While I punched on meat in a rickety shack
He was sippin’ on wine and havin’ models rub his back
At the weigh-in, boy the tension was high
Me and Rock toe to toe and eye to eye
I talked some trash we got pulled apart
I shot him one last look to strike fear in his heart

Skip ahead, the big night is finally here
My body was ripped and my mind was clear
We entered the arena to the roar of the crowd
People chanting my name, I never felt so proud

Faced off once more in the center of the ring
Touch gloves, said a prayer, then the bell went (ding)
He hit me with a left and shattered my face
And a right sent my teeth all over the place
Then another great punch caved in my eye socket
He broke my jaw and my trainer yelled “stop it!”
But nobody heard him and he crushed my ribs
Blood sprayed off my face and onto some kids
They yelled out “more!” and Rocky obliged
I had to think of some way to turn the tides
So I leaned back to hit him with all of my might
Took a swing but he caught me with a sucker-punch right
Then a sucker-punch left and a sucker-punch right
Then twenty-two consecutive sucker-punch rights

He tore off my arms and beat me with ‘em
Then threw acid in my face which obscured my vision
He kicked me in the leg and fractured my shin
The bone splinter shot right out of my skin
People barfed in the crowd, they were going insane!
Then Rocky punched my nose bone into my brain
I was quivering and twitching when I soiled my shorts
Then Rocky pissed on me, customary in sports
The doctor came out and pronounced me dead
And that was the night I fought Rocky",Rocky,2011

Man! Pump that garbage in another man's face

I go to my favorite hot dog stand
And the dude says,
""You come here all the time! Here's one for free.""
I said, ""Man! What I look like? A charity case?""

I took it and threw it on the ground!
I don't need your handouts!
I'm an adult!
Please!
You can't buy me hot dog, man!

At the farmer's market with my so called girlfriend
She hands me her cell phone, says it's my dad
Man, this ain't my dad!
This is a cell phone!

I threw it on the ground!
What, you think I'm stupid?
I'm not a part of your system
My dad's not a phone!
DUH!

Some poser hands me cake at a birthday party

Whatcha want me to do with this? Eat it?

Happy birthday to the ground!
I threw the rest of the cake, too!
Welcome to the real word, jackass!

So many things to throw on the ground
Like this, and this, and that, and even this
I'm an adult!

Two Hollywood phonies try to give me their autograph
Ground!
Nobody wants your autograph, phonies!

Then the two phonies got up
Turned out they had a taser
And they tased me in the butt-hole

Fell to the ground
The phonies didn't let up
Tasin' on my butthole over and over

I was screamin' and squirmin'
My butt-hole was on fire
The moral of the story is

You can't trust the system

The Lonely Island,"Oh! Its been a long time coming.
Two of the worlds greatest.
Americas sweetheart, Ms. Reba McEntire. (Yeah, yeah. How ya doing Andy?)
Were about to take it to the top. (Hoo hoo hoo hoo.)
Hit em Reba.

Haters in my face trying to keep me down
But you know we keep on shinin. (Here we go!)
Two crazy big stars from opposite worlds
Bout to set this track on fire. (Yeah!)

Shes the queen of country
Hes the comedy prince
Making something out of nothing. (Ha ha!)
We hooked up in the studio to make this song.
But as usual we ended up fucking. (No doubt.)

Flash back to when I first met Reba
Sitcom dressing room, puffing on Cheeba
Said I was a fan, she said prove it
Dropped her denim skirt and said, hop to it.

Made love all night. (More like we fucked.)
Kids banging on the door trying to interrupt
But them autographs can wait, cuz this is way too strong
I cant leave it alone, because her pussy's the bomb.

Well my pussy is the bomb and that's a fact
But these N words keep on trippin'(OK)
So I stay on my prime and drop these hits
Cuz I cant go back to stripping (I'm Reba!)

You're my undercover freak
And your my best friend, but our families don't approve.
That's right, cuz I'm a city boy
And I'm a country girl, and I'll never leave your sweet balls blue.

That's because a girl like Reba got just what I need
With big broad shoulders and a red ass weave (And a penis.)
Hot damn, she fly.
All she wanna do is bump me
I'm a lucky guy (I'm a guy too)

My friends think I should dump her
They say shes a man who found a wig in a dumpster. (Your friends are smart.)

Nah, Rebes, they're just jealous
Cuz I'm dating a star instead of hanging with the fellas. (Hanging like my nuts.)

Word up. They're just liars.
They cant believe I can pull Reba McEntire.

Ever since I came out of my mamas butt
I knew I was destined for greatness. (Yeah!)
I looked in a dumpster and saw a wig
And thought, hey brother, I'm gonna take this. (Tell em, Reba!)

So I put it right on and took a stroll
Right over to 30 Rock (SNL!)
I saw Andy Sandberg and he thought I was Reba
And I made him suck my dirty cock.

So there you have it

I can't believe I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

I was thirteen, skinny little freckle-faced kid
Growin' up in the country felt like doin' a bid
But the summers were my favorite when we swam in the lake
And trips to the city, what a magical place
First baseball game, man, I'll never forget
Crackerjacks, bleacher seats and the crack of the bat
My friend Tim caught a ball, but he gave it to me
And five years later, I fucked my aunt

I can't believe that I fucked my aunt

Rainstorms always give me the blues
Worst one in ten years on the evening news
She rode her bike over cause the streets was closed
My aunt standing there in soaking wet clothes
We opened some wine and laughed like kids
She told me funny things that her and my mom did
But then my uncle called and she had to go
And twelve years later, I fucked her sister

Damn I fucked my aunt
Can you believe that I fucked my aunt?
Man, I guess I fucked my aunt
I fucked my aunt y'all

It was my eighteenth birthday, the world was still new
My parents threw me a party as parents will do
My uncle's wife gave me a punny gift
It was an ant farm, man she was a trip
Later that night I was up in my room
I watched as the small ant community bloomed
So simple, yet so complex, I contemplated my own life
And wondered what would come next
I took out my favorite ant and crushed it with my dick
And also, I fucked my aunt

Damn, I fucked my ant
And I fucked my aunt

Man, we fucked our aunts
We fucked our aunts y'all

Oh, I can't believe it
They fucked their aunts
I mean, I fucked my aunt too
But you don't see me making songs about it
Although we technically didn't have sex

Then her friend jump in, I'm wit' it

We're just the kings of giving out hugs
And if you wanna settle down, you know you got us all wrong

Just because I hugged you raw

I'll get violent

Good morning, it's been brought to my attention that many rap artists
Claim that they run New York, but this is not the case
In fact, I wrote my own song about what it's really like
Please excuse the profanity in advance, hit it

I run New York!
New York, big city of dreams
And you know that I run this town
(I run it!)

King of the streets, ? concretes
Skyscrapers on my crown
So if you want this big apple
Come try to take a bite
Cause I run this motherfucking city and
I won't give it up without a fight

Yo, I run New York, it's a pain in the ass!
The city's crowded as fuck, and it's covered in trash
And the sanitation chief just shoved his shit in my face
Another transit strike? oh fucking great!

I can't wait
To have another meeting with the labor union
So the mob can bend me over
And then shove their fucking shoe in

But I do it so you can sip your pumpkin latté
I literally run New York, and it's exhausting

I run New York, it's a fucking headache
It really wears you down
In this lake of bureaucratic bullshit
It's a miracle I don't drown

I *double* literally run New York
I run the marathon
Plus I organized it
So I double-run the marathon

But no one seems to give a fuck that I'm a paragon
Instead they Photoshop me so
It's looking like I wear a thong
And laugh at it in my own office when I'm gone

I went to the Knicks game, and
They booed me on the jumbotron!
Excuse me for trying to help you
They won't be satisfied until I'm
Locked up in Bellevue
I guess they don't tell you this job sucks dick
I run New York and it feels like shit

The chief of police is a major bully
He laughs at my ideas (he's a jerk!)
He made fun of my tie last week
And I had to fight back tears

Now on the surface, it probably seems like I should quit
Cause I spend every day getting punched in the dick
But at night I travel down into the subway
Wearing chain mail, locked and loaded for gun play
And battle the gigantic fire-breathing mutant rats
If I fucking quit, who the fuck would do that?
I'll give you a hint: the answer is no one
That's why I'm in the sewer dressed up like a shogun
Because on the equinox, a hell gate springs
Releasing hounds wreathed in the blood of kings
And no one even knows! they just think I'm a dork
But I still kill those fucking dogs, because
I run New York

I run New York, it's a shitty gig
There's no overtime in my pay (bullshit!)
I asked this city for a fucking bonus
And they said ""no fucking way!""
So rotten is this big apple
It's crawling with worms inside
But I run this motherfucking shit hole city
And it makes me wanna die

I run New York!

Thank you",I Run NY,2013

Proving she knows how to get attention
One laid-back titty with no pretention

The Lonely Island,"YOLO

YOLO, you only live once

The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk

You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
Cause you only live once

Ugh, you only live once
That's the motto
So take a chill pill
Ease off the throttle

Never go to loud clubs
Cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry
When they can't hear

And stay the hell away from drugs
Cause they're not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard
Like a beagle

'Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail
And never travel by car, a bus
Boat or by rail

And don't travel by plane
And don't travel at all
Built a bomb shelter basement
With titanium walls

And wear titanium suits
In case pianos fall on ya
And never go in saunas
Cause they're crawlin' with piranhas

And never take the stairs
'Cause they're often unsafe
You only live once
Don't let it go to waste

You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat 'til it's done
Cause you only live once

Yeah
And here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids
Cause their hair is filled with mad lice

There's no such thing
As too much Purell
This a cautionary tale
Word to George Orwell

So don't 1980 force
Any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt
And triple lock it

Then hire a taster
Make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy
Then destroy him

No blankets or pajamas
They can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture
Killing machines

Board your windows up
The sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straight jacket
So your safe from yourself

Take no chances (no chances)
Stop freelancin' (right now)
Invest in your future
Don't dilute your finances (uh huh)
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?)
4.2% thirty year mortgage
That's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it
Don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast

YOLO, say no no
Isolate yourself
And just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out
Also stands for YOLO

You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die

Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

You oughta look out",YOLO,2013

More specifically one event
The time Osama Bin Laden got shot in the head
She said ""do me like that""
But I couldn't track the metaphor
That said I can see you horny like a Stegosaur
That said again your request is so irregular
She put on a beard, I started looking at the exit door
Then a turban
Then a tunic

He said ""my friend, you just smoked crack""
You just smoked crack

I just smoked crack (oh, my God)

I thought it was marijuana, oh yeah
But now it's too fucking late (I can't come back down)
I love crack (holy shit)
And now I am invincible (fuck yeah)

I'll kill them on principle

Others call it base

This was the hardest day of my life
Should I stay or should I go?
Help me, Lord, to decide

Three blocks from home when she caught my eye
I shouldn't even be looking but she just had to be mine
Ten bedrooms, ten baths, 7,000 square feet
I was weak in the knees, she was the house of my dreams
I had just moved in to the place down the block
And now I'm thinking 'bout moving? Imagine my shock
I talked to my real estate guy, Peter
He was like, ""Your house is beautiful, yo, how could you leave her?
6,000 square feet, a dolphin-themed pool
If I'm being honest, Connor, yo, I think you're a fool
But it's cool, you can definitely afford both places""
Tell me what to do, God, my heart's torn in pieces

So many options and all in my price range
This decision is torture, my head's playing mind games

Should I move? (Should I move y'all?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (Tell me should I buy it?)
Should I move y'all? (With my money)
It'd be nice to have some more space (More space)

So I turned to my friends playing out by the pool
As I sipped on my drink, I screamed what should I do?
They just shrugged and I could tell that I was on my own
With this decision, no vision, which house to call my home
I had to get away so I flew to Majorca
Dove in the ocean, went swimming with orca
I drank too many piña coladas and fell asleep
Had a dream about both houses and began to weep

Tell me how many houses can one man own?
I'll be paying in cash, got no need for a loan (But still)

Should I move? (Should I move?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (I don't know what to do)
Should I move y'all? (I think I should just buy it)
It'd be nice to have some more space (I think I'm gon' buy it)

So much pain, so many struggles
But I made it through
I bought the house, it's beautiful
And I kept the old one for my dogs

The Long Winters,"She loves the singer, every song can bring her close to tears
But when she talks about his band it just confirms her mother's fears
A little crush on the singer but in her heart she knows it's true
Everything is different when he's singing right to you

Her mother says honest, it's alright to be a singer
But don't you love a singer whatever you do

Let the crowd press on the stage
And let the lights wash out their eyes
Sixteen years ago I was completely mesmerized
And then the night was done and the singer disappeared behind the stage
And the roadies came and picked me out from on the barricade

Honest, it's alright to be a singer
But don't you love a singer whatever you do, whatever you do

I wouldn't change for a moment my life or my ideals
But once I loved a singer and I know just how you feel
For him to say so plainly what your heart can vouch is true
Means something is connecting you, something is connecting you

What if sex was holy and war was obscene
And it wasn't twisted, what a wonderful dream
Living for love, unafraid of the end
Forgiveness is the only real revenge

Oh, so we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, yourself open
Yeah, we can heal each other and fill each other
We can break these walls between each other
Baby, blow by blow and brick by brick
Keep yourself open, you're open

Maybe we could care a little more

A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away

I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long

So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree

And there was nobody happy
And my head is mad nappy and
I'm thinkin' up a way that I can get some dough

Man I'm tryin' ta blow
But yet this record shit is so slow
I got the whole family on my back
All I do is eat and sleep
Run the street with that steel pack

You know the lost boyz got
With timbs and jeans
Field jackets, and hats coverin' the eyes
But listen, that's how it is
If you don't dig how I live

The black man is gettin' beat
Police line us up on the concrete

When the blacks is locked down
And the white man's got the key

Plus when he killed the girl
He put the gun to his own head

The homeless keep warm by settin' fire to a trash can

I'm cruisin' in the fast lane

I'm fresh outta nerves
Ma, you're workin' on my last vein
Now how can I explain
That I don't wanna take her out

But that's stuck in my brain
We're havin' fight after fight
Because I leave when it's bright
And comes home the next night

But that's the life that I live understands me

You can't be wasting my time

Communication is the key to our happiness
If we just talk about it
Maybe we can make some sense

I'm not the type of woman
That you can play for a fool
Use and abuse me
And just act like it's cool, oh

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Yo, Mona Lisa
See there's something that we both should understand
Now if we share a life, you be my wife, I be your man
Nothin' can separate us, nothin' stronger than pride
I see it's time to open up wide, release what I feel inside

And take you places that you wanna be
Yo, come with me I'll show you things
That you would wanna see
Afraid of rejection but your affection girl, it's real
Yo, I can write a book on how you make a nigga feel, come on

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it love you wanna find
I can take you where you wanna go
Just stand by my side and just be sure what you want
You can't be wasting my time

Can you tell me what's going on in your mind
Is it affection ya need, is it

",Can't Be Wasting My Time [One Dread One Ball Head Version],1996
The Lost Boyz,"Here's a tune about this honey named Renee
That I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peepin' shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
Excuse me Miss, but can I get your name
She said my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say
So may I walk you to your subway
She said if you want
So yo, we started talking
I brought two franks and two drinks
And we began walking
I had to see where that head was at
Because the gear was mad phat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for 
She wants to be a lawyer
In other words shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token
She drops a package of the EZ Rider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique shorty rock
I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly Blunts
She said I never dealt with Philly Blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts
I said, nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on I can get to show ya

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

Now we sittin' on train
Besides the fingernails
Now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket,with some jeans 
And a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog so we hit the store
Went to the crib
And turned the lights on
A crazy magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch
Stero system with crazy cd's
Understand kid
She got cheese
She said cheeks do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said alright well I'm gonna roll this blunt
She came back with strech pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, Fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chattin
We're smoking blunts on her balcony
We're stearing at Manhattan
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on her breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate
And a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted Bo to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever shorty rock
We can swing it like that
Cause on the real this is where it's at.

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow 
And this what the letter said
It said cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep
So I didn't want to bother you
I left a number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed
Smoked a blunt
Then I bounced to the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you
She's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty
Crack a 40 with my naughty freaks
A man, I never been in love
But everytime I'm burstin' in and outta state
It's shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee
Because Renee uses code two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She said Renee has been shot
So cheeks, meet me up at St. Lukes
I jumps on the Van Wyck
I gotta make it there quick
A yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po nine
I'm doing a buck
Who gives a fuck
I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital
They tell me Mr. Cheeks
Renee is gone 
I'm pouring beer out for my shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto
So listen
This is how I shed my tears

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty",Renee,1996

The Lost Boyz,"[Mr.Cheeks ]
Yo we come through like bulls nigga take two puffs and pass 
Nigga watch your back once you talk out your ass 
I back up 3 80 and my stash for protection 
Family is raged the world is acting crazed 
I never thought I'd make it it was hectic when I scrambled 
On point like a knife I'm takin' life as a gamble 
And living in the rotten apple yo where every core is rotten 
All my niggas rest in peace ya see you gone but not forgotten 
Now my main wifey, dead as shaded chicks, 
Official Lost Boyz since the year of 86 
And fuck these crooked niggas I could kill em with a passion, 
At times I feel like slashing in Jamaican Queens fashion 
You think you can fuck around, but kid you're just thinking 
It's over when I'm sober, imagine when I'm drinking 
Without blinking man, I'll tare your crew like pages 
I'll rip you from the backyard of ? ... 

[--A+ ]
A plus the lyrically superb one, spittin rhymes 
Off the top of the tongue to burn ya ear drums 
Rotten shit, make the opposite team call a time out, 
Knockin niggas three times my size out 
The crowd loves me, so when I ain't around they ask for me, 
I buckle up to kick rap like a crash dummy 
For the fast money, I get up in that ass money 
The fact you tryin' to test me kinda bugs me 
I leave crews fed up, like handicap niggas tryin' to get up 
Emcees get wet up with lyrical gun pillars, 
I blow up the spot when it's time to rock 
I speak through a mic my voice peak out at a hundred watts 
Who want to fight son, I get dumb 
Word to my mother the father the holy ghost and Rev Run, 
When the Source set it down, I'm inner serviced 
To cop the type of verses that average emcees seem to worship 

[--Redman ]
My style is milking magnesia, clutch divide speeding bust 
The more the merrier, secure the area, my life familiar 
Is ultimate superior we don't jack cars 
We jack for aircraft carriers 
I bounce like trampolines, when I be blowing the feces to pieces 
Hymn em like sewing machines and Jesus 
When the shadows of the barrel pointing out my (?) Camarro 
I get punished like pharaoh for splittin' 
You're better off singing Christmas carols for Christmas, 
Because I'm on point like bow and arrow equipment 
The president of chicken head conventions 
I give you a deluxe Ku Klux lynchin' 
I got a headache from the stress, success not wearing a vest 
5-11 for being dirty and quarts of 9-30 
Yo, Mr.Cheeks, I made this bitch call police 
She tried swallowing a nine piece 
Forgot the warrantee on false teeth 
I return like Makaveli on 18 inch Pirelli's 
Assault and battery like my palms was ever ready 
Sharp as machete's 
Matter of fact I slap (?) ... 

[--Canibus ]
Canibus brings the sickest drama, 
Fierce enough to pierce the thickest armor 
I smack bitches who try to suck dick through a condom 
Playing with the mic is something I won't do 
My only concern when I approach you, is to roast you 
I smoke you and whoever you standing close to 
And make every man in your crew deny that he knows you 
Defeating, niggas like Segal Steven, 
Putting Emcees in, positions to prevent 'em from breathing 
I'll make you question any and everything you've ever believed in 
By peeping your deepest secrets like psychic readers, 
What's the matter with ya'll, I splatter ya'll 
Against the mutha fuckin wall with these raw lyrics I catapult 
None of ya'll got the balls big enough to battle, 
I go On & On like Erika Badu 
A hundred times nicer than the best there is 
Twice as African as KRS is, who want to test this 
Fuck y'all you don't impress me and no one can test me 
An Emcee so ill, I got AIDS scared to catch me 
All that shit you poppin will stop, when I put you in a headlock, 
And apply pressure until I crush your mutha fuckin noggin 
I grab mics and push niggas to the left 
So fast their hearts end up on the right side of their chests 
My hypothesis, is that nobody can see this 
Lyrical genius, I got it sown like a seamstress 
But if you want to battle, I'm down, 
If you got nine lives, I'll take eight of them off your hands right now 
Step up and get your neck cut from ear to ear 
If you survive, then you can cover your scar with a beard 
I'm the illest from Queens to the new Jerusalem briddicks 
Anyone who ain't feeling my shidick can suck my didick 
You need to quit it, if you ain't spitten 
More than 50 bars per minute cause you ain't in lyrical fitness 
Kickin' boring raps with metaphors that's wack 
All of ya'll mutha fuckas need NordicTrack 
To get ya weight up, fuckin with Canibus you get ate up 
Get beat down and sprayed up, just for bringing my name up 
Been rockin longer than niggas twice my age 
Back in the days before Bob Marley was rockin a fade 
Before Honest Abe signed the paper that freed slaves 
Before Neanderthals was drawing on walls in caves 
I existed, in the garden of Eden gettin lifted 
Stickin dick to Eve before she was Adams mistress 
Before Christ created Christmas, I been in lyrical fitness 
The Canibus is spitten till' he's spitless 
50 bars of total sickness, you won't forget this 
I'm puttin' every wack Emcee alive on my shit list 
Verbally vicious, tele-connectically gifted 
Took you a minute, to exhibit that I'm sick wit it 
Now you tell me who you think is damaging shit 
Going once, going twice 
Sold to that nigga name Canibus

The Lost Boyz,"this be a message to the ghetto when will this shit stop
we lost 2 ill niggaz B.I.G and 2pac
this goes to all of us so peep the session from your nigga
you can be loved by millions but one clown can pull the trigga
see you aim to get bigger they break for your downfall
your life is how you living kid just give it your all
we strive to be the best that's what they taught us in the rhyme
smoking weed and getting bent we've all been through hard times
much respect to your hood love is love that's all good
the plan's to make you niggaz understand, understood
yo here's the deal for real you can't get killed from entertaining
but that's all we know cause from the street we got the training

this be a ghetto dedication from my family to yours
how hard is this to explain when it rains kid it pours
instead of bringing ?crime ills? and senseless wars
you niggaz need to expand, buy land, open stores
you talk of revolution but you're very much afraid
take that chip off your shoulder let's all get paid
direct it to the world because we all need peace
we all livin in the belly of the beast

yo, now many lives are lost still to this day we ask the reason
all the suffering we've been through niggaz still is into squeezing
mom dukes on welfare ghetto love no more we share
you rising to the top but then get hit from the rear
one night up in the hood I found my own self thumpin
cause niggaz out there they felt that I owed them something
talk behind my back they don't attack that don't offend me
a 13-year old could just up, and end me
if he wanted to, blunted with the brew in his hand
now does that make shorty rock the man?
not only in your hood but in my hood we lost 2 good fellaz
it's more than what they motherfuckers tell us
now if a cop got shot someone's caught the same night
that's the bullshit you motherfuckin right
so take heed to what I say, LB Fam pray in they own way
to the motherfuckin day

now niggaz kick raps, and caps get peeled

kid I thought we was rhymin man fuck that actin tough
enough is enough let's dead that East and West stuff
I'm callin niggaz bluff yo my rap game be tuff
let's take it to the stage and let the lyric game buss
I'm tryin to live a hundred plus in this crazy world
to hold down my fam, Queens, and my baby girl

look here we tryin to make it but they tryin to hold us back
that's why I'm speakin my opinion on this track
the media they tryin to throw dirt in the game
but me and my fam we found ways to explain
throughout the pain I try to gain and keep the shit the same
it's quite strange how these cats keep playin games

We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

Put you through hard times but you still stay by my side
I provide anything that you want and need
But you don't mess with my liquor nor weed
Word to moms we could travel this world
See youse my wife no longer my girl
See people mad at the thing we got
Cause we come through the spot lookin' hot, why not
Is it a crime at times when I nag you
I know shiesty cats that wanna bag you
It's all good in my hood I did it too
What the hell this cat think he can do for you
That I don't, haven't already done
I used to deal with wicked chicks I found a steady one
As long as we keep it tight, build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation

(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

I know you've had your flashbacks of what we been through
But it's a whole different story when I mean you
Make it down to respect and protect you
And if any men disrespect you
Been through downs and ups, ups and downs
I wrote this here from the gut, how that sound
I lay it down while my man Chuck sings to you impressions
I bring to you glamourous life only for the wife
So others never give it baby livin' trife
Cherishin' all the moments that's excitin'
It's probably all of that cause I live fightin'
If you feelin' bored get your thing on
If I really didn't know you why'd I ring on
As long as we keep it tight and build this communication
We'll build a stronger foundation
 
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
I ain't afraid to go where some niggas won't
(I feel your love, it's so love . . .)
We ain't afraid to do what some niggas won't

[Mr. Cheeks]
Well listen Summer time in the city
Now niggas ride around town, for another sounds, look before the smithy
And even on ball courts, you got the shorties watchin fellas
Doin anythings on they baggy shorts
And kids is having fun in the park
But there's a limit, moms says you best to be home before dark
Now we all know the flavor, were back on the black moms
Chattin with the next door neighbour sayin ""Hi""
The folks that don't ride
Her hands on the floor head 'cause the sun keeps gettin in the rock
Little kids in sweaty suits, with niggas like Lost Boyz
Strictly t-shirts or the boots
Standin on the van with, I'm wavin at chicks
Takin food from the vooda, and sips from the Mystics
Lex, coups, beemers and benz
Niggas hangin with they man makin hits
We bouncin in the city

Chorus: 4X
Summer, summer, summer time (summer time in the city)

[Mr. Cheeks]
In every borough there's a crew
Of niggas smokin blunts and drinkin brew
'cause that's the way that us niggas do
With Newports in the ear, playin concrete sports
And shorties walk around in daisy dukes shorts, bounce
The would be throwin jams in the park
When the buddha is sparked, they get together after dark
GG and G tapes are bangin, it's strictly Spigg Nice
And that hat black, when me and my niggas are sayin
I'm given beats to my peeps when I pass through
In 89, 'cause them shorties smoke grass too
To make a avenue, somethin in god rule
40 be, that is lee, agent I too
And to my peoples on the rock
132142, yeah that's the rock
See Queens niggas do they thing
Champagne and rings don't hold shit, 
bang real niggas hang in the city

Chorus 4X
[Mr. Cheeks]
It's about 98 degrees, everybodies gettin cheese
And a downy in my round, spit is walk around in dungaries
When new burgers got a lot around the corner
See a shorty and you want, now you best to push up on her, right?
I lay my act, slick sleen back, 40 ounce down south
Bounce bounce like that
Smokin charm as we creep through the streets
Lost Boyz, they bites and they eat meats
They blues, no socks, short skirts, t-shirts, red Reebok
Shorty bouncin with friends
3 piece, bbs, cloned out on the Benz
I want to hit in the car, how them skins feel
Shorty with the ribbon in the windshield
So one two, this is how we do
Summer time, Lost Boyz comin through in the city

""Now"" 

I'm in this tight situation
I'm at this chicks crib uptown 
Niggaz try to come through and lock me down 
Now it seems like a set-up 
and niggaz try to wet me from the door 
Half a second of gun blaze then I'm in my detour 
Shot through the glass hit the balcony 
How could she set me up like that?
I caught my balance, shot back 
I'm jettin down the fire escape I started sprayin
I'm takin five steps at a time enemy is gaining
on me, my niggaz tried to warn me when my steppin
It's good though cause on a low a nigga had his weapon
I'm jettin down this dead end thrill
I hit the street I got no jacket on my back 
But I got my Tim's on my feet 
when my life broke across me back against the wall
I'm lookin for my enemies I'm searchin for them all
No bullets being fired so now a nigga's jettin to the corner
that's where most of the people settin
I break-away my burner now I'm searchin for the train
The only motherfucker with no coat I'm in the rain
There's beef walkers walkin I gotta play it cool 
Even though he's firm with that I walk covered up my jewel
I'm in a tight situation? 

""Black B the shit went down world wide B""

""Word, what happened?""

""Yo nigga started mouthing off
I don't know if nigga's still breathing
All I know is that I made moues""

""Well yo, 8 moues I'ma need you my fault
I'll meet you there""

""Aight""

My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus i love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I wont be true to my game
Word up

I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women

I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty cant wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we wont forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool 
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover 
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long 
Shorty had to go back to work 
Something inside said that will work

Especially the ones that's never understanding
Like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street get your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinkin to me short 
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to 
I had to run her down the line this aint no walk through 
Now who the fuck you think you talkin to chick
Your complaining's makin me sick 
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string

See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word
She began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing byebye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
To many threats kid 
Got to let her go
Always in your corner 
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give
We talked out
I'm feeling pain as it come to an end

He ain't talking much, keep a dutch in his mouth

Laced the Gore-tex, stepped with his crew

Who he prayin' to? God or the Beast
Some bust blocks, feared on the block
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top

Jealousy is growin'
Paranoia got him second guessin'
D-T's on his back got him stressin'

Ten slugs in the door made him fall
Guess he should of never hustled at all

Cash bubblin' from pimpin' and drugs
He a real pretty cat
He get from his moms
Back in the seventies, she was the bomb
His games top notch, and he don't stop
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin' lot
Tay-Kwan is sick, heartless with chicks
He liked to beat 'em up, make 'em suck dick

Not only did he walk away with the HIV

Used to make coats, holdin' work got arrest
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death
She a vet, yet she look innocent and sweet
When she wet, ain't no controllin' the heat
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs
Then she got pregnant, abandoned the kid
Met this drug kid, set him up and slid
Now she 23 full blown in the mix
Sizin' up wits than more cliques is gettin' chips
She down for whatever, as long as it pays
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed
She was in the same Yukon, laughin' with the thug
He said thanks for settin' Tyheim up

We in the Jeep Passin' cheeba peep 'em as they assin'
Out in the game, what's the reason why you came?
To have these bitches be like askin' you a season in your brain
Flashin' jewels, talkin' blastin' if he pack the tools
I got a Glock to cock back to knock 'em, flat out your shoes
Not no, Big Willie puffin Dutches not Phillie
We packin' bubbly act up and we smack a nigga silly
The name is Mr Cheeks I keep the dough get on the low stroll
Take you to the Essence get my swerve on like the pros do
Baggin' bitches makin' money bounce without my crews

Connect, knock it out the park, what a hit
It gets deeper, I'm on some keeper, my brother shit

And get charged, to rip shows in half, word to God
With clientele like a crack spot, me and my man dwell

So yo, focus your mind on this
Nobody move and nobody get they wig twist

Yo I set shit, come correct with, fat raps that
Rapidly fire like a infra tech spit

To tax at least a million is my lifetime mission so
In God we trust, Firing Squad we bust
Plus we must roll with the rough, Home team
Teflon, Billy, and Fame, mad Swingas to bring
That South 9 triple beam dream you been lookin' for

Last night the club was tight, shorty's dead right
But you stood out the most, so I had to play you close
Nuttin' less than, black essence, your presence real strong
Dudes all around you frontin' hard, gettin' they trick on
I ain't mad, I just watch you gas 'em up, then I watch you pass 'em up
Then I step up, now look, you shook
You stuck, what's yo' name, what's yo' digits, what'chu drinkin'
My treat and when they steppin' you get swept up off yo' feet
My mission, first position, backs I twist 'em listen
Ain't no-bo-dy, like Hea-vy
The all-star, dapper rapper
In conjunction with the funk that keep it blazin' out they trunks
What'chu want, sky's the limit, I live it, now is you wit it
Slow flow, Poconos style, I mean I'm chillin'

The Lost Boyz,"I think it was the month of June, when I bumped, heads with this chick
Me and my click, we was on the Van Wyck
A whip rolls up on the strip, full of freaks
The music lowers down and this passenger speaks
It's a, flame of mine from back in the day
John Adams High down on Rockaway
Like to blow around the smoke in the air from the trees
From the way it's lookin', word they still gettin G's
Scoped out the whip, I'm checkin' out each honey
They must be gettin' money, I didn't see code 20(?)
The L's was burnin', Alize is what they drinkin'
If she said she's on the way and yo it really had me thinkin'
Of back in the day when we both used to swerve
At parties we would bounce, smoke a whole ounce of herb
Word my man I never hit it raw
On the strength to-fuckin'-day we still get it on, listen

I'm, just your, ordinary guy
Love bitches and money and love bein high
Run with Pretty Lou, Spig Nice and Freaky Tah
How that sound? Ah-ah
Here's a little somethin' from Linden and the (?)
We used to get down and hustle my man
But nothing comes easy in this world full of shit
Nigga take this job and shove it out quick what

One day I'm workin' up on the block
Slingin' my motherfuckin' rock
Now police they tried to run up on us
My niggaz tried to warn us (where at) on all the corners
And now I'm I'm I'm I'm jettin'
You see I'm almost, I'm almost, Moet-ed
Hopped over the gate, landed in my man's backyard
I knocked on the door, yo whassup bruh?
Yo let a nigga like, me in
Police they tryin to pull a nigga in
They lookin' for the kid that's sellin' that crack note
Lookin' for the suspect in the black coat
Yo, I'm not, I'm I'm not the baddest
But these motherfuckers know my status
Now peep it I be comin' with the motherfuckin'
Thunder and the rain, I will remain, cause

[Chorus]

This job, shove it out quick
Nuttin' come easy in this world full of shit
Used to put me down, to hustle with my man
Little somethin', from livin' in the 'Ville
Huh, huh, huh, hustle my man
Huh, huh

Now, now, now, now this one day I'm workin' at JFK
It's the 4th of July, nigga HEY!
Something's wrong man, I don't like this day
It's going too long man, I'm gettin' strong man
From pickin' up these motherfuckin' banners
See I want that shit to make my eyes sad
So I jumped off early, got on the back of the 10
I'm all in and in the van with my man
Now I'm up on the block, puffin lye
And I'm with Lou, Spig, and Tah
Now peoples lookin' at us, lookin' at us
Police they want to come through and rush
But we ain't got no crack, we got weed
That's all we need, yes indeed
And I'll, always
Smoke weed in the hallways, cause

Take this job and shove it out quick
Nothin' comes easy in this world full of shit

Here's a little somethin' from Linden and the (?)

We used to get down and hustle my man
Now nothin' comes easy in this world full of shit

Askin' you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunites to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity, which is actually

My mind is reachin' twice that size than it only did last year
Three times it's likely to feel clear
A+, I transform into a super emcee
With super vocals, quicker than Superman can find a phone booth
The whole truth, nothin' but the whole truth, I roast you
Thermonuclear vocals get hotter than in Shanobal
The double O, just abide nuclear explosions
Exposin' radiation like a vulcan
I'm the only guy that knows why the golden eye
Was stolen by five Soviet spies
They told me to lie; they don't want to hear the god spit
Chop my hands off at the armpits, but I regenerate limbs
Like star fish, comin' at you with the hard shit
Swallow my beeper and page myself so I can communicate with a dolphin
Lyrical arson rush the planet like a million martians committin' arson
Walkin' the tarpits in India with snake charmers that place all the weight
Down...

[Canibus]
Yo, A+, fuck the nonsense
I got the reinforcements
To crush any enemies offense with a hundred thousand horsemen
And the hardest muthafucka on the market right here
I'll complete in a minute what would take you a light year
Extra-terrestrial biological entities with infinite energy
Battling for world supremecy
Who want to get touched?
The Can-i-bus will crush you
With hard jigsaw puzzles and strong jaw muscles
Ambushin' emcees, jumpin' out the trees
Like Vietnamese in fatigues, covered with leaves
Interrogatin' you whack emcees like MIB's with dark glasses
Askin' you to tell me exactly where that alien craft landed
By flashing bright light in your eyes with those silver gamas
So when you revive, you can't recall or understand it
That's how the Canibus keeps tabs on the planet
I use amnesia to neutralize public panic
And take advantage of opportunites to do damage
I pierce your heart with evil thoughts
The only thing faster then tha speed of light is the speed of dark
With the jaws of a great white shark, I rip you apart
My state-of-the art lyrical lasers is razor sharp
Splatter the brain matter of my enemies
With the same bullet trajectory that murdered John Kennedy
In the back of his cranial cavity, which is actually
What happens to any motherfucker for tryin' to battle me

[Chorus x 2]",Boyz to Men,1999
The Lost Boyz,"[Mr. Cheeks]
You know the life situations, hard times of deep conversations
Beef in the streets, eliminations
Shit gets iller, it's mad bullshit us niggas go through
They hate us, being broke and gettin dough too
Well let me show you, niggas how I feel when I'm singin
Ya niggas be constantly O.D.'ing
You can't show them crackers love, yo they love to take advantage
Keep actin like ya black watch where ya land bitch
A word from the wise, you know us
The late street slummers
We creep on you with rentals, no hummers
We celebrate the summers, burn trees sit up on the bench
Against the fench, watchin tournaments
These niggas know the scene, niggas roll dice for the green
Bitches the more ice the mean
Keep the cars shining, these love the creep through the actional
And that the hood the fuckin main attraction
The hot bitches and niggas ayo we all make it happen
Sword sellin drugs are workin hard, we all rappin
Hope you recognize the realism, that I'm spittin
Not the hardest rap artist, but I'm hittin
Put the Gennus to my lip take a sip of it
Light my L, write my rhyme watch how I flip the shit
Ayo ya niggas ya be counterfeit, so tone it down a bit
A move along with you bullshit

Chorus: Lost Boyz & Mel
You can't hold us down, You can't hold us down
You can't hold us down, You can't fuck around

[Mr. Cheeks]
I creep the streets with my sounds blastin from the get up
Lay back confortable, why the fuck sit up
Rims shining, ordinary guy, makin cheddar
Life for me and wifey and for the kid it's more better
Better school and yo niggas makin better more
Like some old addition listen kid, cheddar roots
Kid you feelin me, these rap niggas killin me
Shit my team through police they be drillin me
Niggas thrillin me, I shine like the diamond
For real a fuckin wit you money kid I'm only rhymin
But if you wanna get it on, yo we can do it
Any business that's mine yo I'm steppin to it
Livin life with no fear
My teams got my back and my rear
Niggas if you want me, I'm right here
Talkin out ya mouth, runnin out with gems and can't win
These DJ's makin tapes and can't spin
These rap niggas, makin money but they really trash
Niggas frontin like they want Parelli ass
Aiyo I pass, I'd rather listen to some R&B
Some hot shit maybe starrin me

Chorus 2X

[Mr. Cheeks]
It seems that my minds playin games on me
Police stay harass try to throw the chains on me
And try to warn me once I got up inside the game
Niggas told me that shit would never be the same
Niggas chains what money comes around the set
Niggas told me though so a nigga won't forget
Where I came from, you know the fuckin scoop
Police hate to see us cats when we on the stoop
Know the best, are whips caught sword in the chest
Knowin that we enter murder, money and the sex
Drugs, fuck with honeys who be hustlin for cheddar
They only out to make it better
Startin where it comes from
We used to sell those drums too
We represent the slums boo
How we do basically no doubt, LB Fam IV Life, yo we out

I'm at my best, son ya best won' test me?
Once again it's on, official burn out
Don't look, puzzled ???? faces how it turn out
Once in a while I take the train just to clear the brain
People ask me 'what's the deal kid, it's just the same'
You know the night-runners, nothin major
Don't let me and my bullshit invade ya
I know you probably, got problems of ya own
No need for you to zone
Understand, I love this game, it mean a great deal to me
It's my life, can you image how it feel to be?

(Hook)
I remember when ????????
It don't even to start me to reminiscin
About the past when we wasn't gettin no cash
Had the skills, but like a hot chick wit no ass
It meant nada, I gotta get my gid on
I need some chedda in my pocket, hot shit on
The lifestyle'll be butter like the wife's smile
Make a habit, don't break, it may take a while
I'm a hustla, I'ma hustle til the end, too
Starin at that, evil that us men do

This black on black crime I cram to understand why

Young fellows baggy jeans slinging crack to the crack fiends

Give up your cheese you loose my baby boy need shoes

See I was taught young to be strong and just strive

Tried to tell you what you wanted to know

When I ran you were moving too slow
When I stayed you were ready to go

Where I always hoped you'd be
And I recall, when we were both alone
Far from what we needed and where we needed to be

So tell me, tell me you love me tonight
Convince me it's worth all the fighting and pain, nights full of rain
Times we come home and we don't feel the same and you tell me
Tell me you love me

I forget who I am without you to hold
Your memory burns but I can't let go
Of all those times when your love was all I knew
You were all I wanted, so what I need you to do

Is tell me, tell me you love me tonight
Convince me it's worth all the fighting and pain, nights full of rain
Times we come home and we don't feel the same and you tell me
Tell me you love me tonight

Oh take me way back when, when true love first begins
When we were just two kids who thought our love would never end
It was like that for a while, we were walking down the aisle
But we're not done 'cause you're the only one I've ever loved
The only one I've loved

So tell me, when the nights are cold and we're all alone
And you tell me, when the days get long and the road goes on

The Lost Trailers,"Sometimes I go walking through the long tall grass
Wonder how long hard times will last
For this backward soul on a road that god knows where
As hard as I try ain't left no track
It's not enough to find my way back
I hit the ground like broken glass and just lay there

Singing why me, oh why me
And I throw another empty bottle up against the wall
And I say why me, oh why me
But pitty never ever did me any kinda good at all
So I walk on

And I wound up on the capital steps
Watching the lobbyists smoking cigarettes
And bury their shoes in the country club blues
And who got who by the short hairs

Standing there in their high dollar suits
Looking down at my tattered old jeans and boots
And this weathered guitar that seems to follow me everywhere
God it follows me everywhere

Playing why me, oh why me
All I got's another song about how money makes and breaks the law
And I sing why me, oh why me
I'm just a broke troubadour with a bark for the underdog
So I walk on

Now I ain't Jesus, but I can relate
To a man looking death square in the face
Even he hit his knees with a plea in the garden of Gethsemane
To his holy father he raised his eyes
In his darkest hours he cried
Please would you take this cup from me

Praying why me, oh why me
Knowing all the while he had to carry that cross and hang there
When I say why me, oh me
I know that somewhere up in heaven there's a big old book with my name there

And, 'Don't that fly girl got some back'
And I feel so doggone outta place

The Lounge-O-Leers,"I don't wanna talk about things we've gone through,
Though it's hurting me, now it's history.
I've played all my cards and that's what you've done too,
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play.
The winner takes it all,
The loser standing small beside the victory, that's her destiny.
 
I was in your arms thinking I belonged there,
I figured it made sense, building me a fence,
Building me a home, thinking I'd be strong there,
But I was a fool, playing by the rules.
The gods may throw a dice, their minds as cold as ice, 
And someone way down here loses someone dear.
 
The winner takes it all, the loser has to fall,
It's simple and it's plain, why should I complain.
 
But tell me, does she kiss like I used to kiss you,
Does it feel the same when she calls your name.
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you,
But what can I say, rules must be obeyed.
The judges will decide the likes of me abide,
Spectators of the show always staying low.
 
The game is on again, a lover or a friend,
A big thing or a small, the winner takes it all.
 
I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad,
And I understand you've come to shake my hand.
I apologize if it makes you feel bad seeing me so tense, no self confidence.",The Winner Takes It All/I Hear a Symphony,2000
The Lounge-O-Leers,"Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey
Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, hey

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol' Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the milky way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance five-hour phone
Conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way

And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the milky way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there",Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me) /Love's Theme,2002
The Lounge-O-Leers,"I never cared too much for love
It was all a bunch of mush that I just did not want
Paid was the issue of the day
If a girlfriend's got some game
Couldn't be more fly, gettin' paid was everything
But I'm not every girl and I don't need that world to validate me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

I was a girl about the floss
It was all about the cost, how much he spent on me
Seek, for a man who's got the means
To be givin' you diamond rings
It's what every fly girl could want or even dream
But I'm not every girl and I don't need no G to take care of me
Cuz shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, no no

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

But I'm not every girl
And I don't need no G to take care of me, no
'Cause shorty's got a job, shorty's got a car, shorty can pay her own rent
Don't wanna dance if it is not in my heart, oh most girls

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

Most girls want a man with the bling bling
Got my own thing, got the ching ching
I just want real love
Most girls want a man with the mean green
Don't wanna dance if he can't be everything that I dream of
A man that understands real love

'Cause I'm not most girls, don't wanna dance if he can't be everything
I, I just want real love, said I gotta have real love
Everything that, can you be everything that I dream of",Most Girls,2002
