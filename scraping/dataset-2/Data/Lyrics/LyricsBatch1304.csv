21 Savage,"Now first of all where I'm supposed to start
When I first met you man another nigga had your heart
But I'ma player so you know a playa played his part
Smooth talkin', conversation took a nigga broad
I'm on the road doin' shows, seem like we fell apart
She think the nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard
Your family said we wouldn't last but we beat the odds
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars
These streets so dirty I just want someone who really there
Can't fake love, just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare
All my dog ways, headin' for them in the kennel
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle

She gon' make these niggas stare
I'ma fuck her with no condom
I'ma let her meet my momma
I'ma take her out that Honda
I'ma put her in the foreign
Spoiled, she ain't got no patience
She gon' have these bitches hatin'
Got them diamonds on me skatin'

Everywhere we go we clean
She want me to quit that lean
Baby I can't quit that lean
Put a ring around Codeine
Everywhere we go we clean

Baby I can't quit that lean
Put a ring around Codeine

21 Savage,"Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a twelve car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my card

I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
Twenty-one Savage, the cat with the MAC
Twenty-one Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, twenty sixteen and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill
I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
Savage I was just playin'
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us

Don't bend, nigga don't fold
My uncle taught me how to scrape the bowl
And my auntie still smokin' blow
Came from nothin', nigga we was poor
Eviction notices all on the door
Take out trash for some school clothes
I'm the one that the streets choose

Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign

Baby roll the window up and let's get high
You ain't no real nigga if you testify
I don't have to question where my niggas ride
If you gotta question, they ain't on your side
Plenty late nights I made my mama cry
Shootouts in apartments made my mama cry
Seen my niggas in a hearse, I Stevie Wonder-ed why
Retaliation, let 'em spark like it's the Fourth July

I know that bitch wanna fuck me, but she's too tiny for me
She's my way out the highway, you either like or leave
This Rollie cost us the G's, a couple bricks on my sleeve (yeah)
When I first fell on the scene, I drove a Cutlass Supreme
A half a brick, a pint of lean, and a new money machine
It's Wop

Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky (it's Gucci)

Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky

We'll like to welcome why'all back to the club

Ya dig, club Toe Jam, is once again off the hook
For ladies night, ya dig, everynight
Right now, we would like to bring something very special for you
Check it out

[Nate Dogg]
Oooooooooooooooh
I like them girls with the tight black skin, dark and fine
that's the kind of girl I want to play with tonight
I want to do some nasty thangs, want to make her scream my name
I like the girls that don't say, ""what?,"" know that she fine
Always knows her line, because she knows she's a dime
Put her on platinum chains, got her own cash and things
I like them girls, their sassy ways, sassy ways
Oh I like them girls, man I could stay there for days
Ooooooooooooooooh

[Snoop Dogg]
Why you so cute, why you so big
Why you bullshitin', come and deal with a pimp
Put your bags in the trunk, holla at your boy
You can spend the night, we at the Elroy
Doing things that we shouldn't, couldn't
Girl you got that good chocolate pudding
The best in hood, what's goodin'
She got the wizard of west wood, like old John Wooding
But how could I need that
I'm looking for feedback, because I can't believe that
I fell into a little tree sap
I got a woman at home, ain't fell in love where the weeds at
Started off with a dime, but by the time I was thug
She was less than a duece, I'm telling the truth
Confessing with you, I'm just messing with you
Because on the real baby girl, you put in the S in Snoop

[Warren G]
See I rock baby, nonstop baby
Warren G baby, shake that thang lady
I see you picky lady, you be tweaking lady
Pulling that '38 snub out your stock end baby
You put the G in the dub, we hot fuckin' in the tub
I ain't trippin' off baby, so why you trippin' off 'cause
I'm trying to get my money right
So you could kick it with baby, but get your mind right
What the fuck is up, you messing with a G
Warren to the L to the be	 and the see
Regulate get cocked and be original
The game don't wait for female individuals

So what you saying, you trippin' off my homeboy
We ride like that, you know what I'm sayin'
Hey baby, just take the grabic

213,"She said she wants to ride my joystick
She act like she wanna ride my joystick

I got it locked when it comes to females
Y'all niggas still buyin' cock at retail
It's a gift that keeps giving to all hoes
Like that lil country whore I fucked a day ago
We were in Spokane but made it to Diego
Droppin' shit purposely lettin' her thong show
She didn't even know about a nigga mandingo
When she saw the joystick and wouldn't let go
She ain't playin' games, she want it right now
From the living room floor to the ouside patio
Bent over gently, I was proud to embrace it
Firmly grab it, rapidly get it crackin'
Most women I know, love the joystick
And love playing with it when it goes the extra inch
I'm a pro, anything goes at the spot
If you know about it, then be about it
If not..

She said she wants to ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride

She wanted me, every part
But all I really want is dinner
Her company, at least at first
But now I wanna go up in her
While I'm hittin corners in my Chevrolet
I ran into a honey from around the way
Big Nate Dogg what can I say?
She asked for my number and some Alize
I got game, so I spit some game
She lookin' at me all in my face
She must recognize Mister Gangsta Nate
Baby wants to give it to me

She said she wants to ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride

When Mom's on rock I stay on top
Lock up like pits in a box I can't stop
Not cuz your beauty it's your booty that I'm attracted
Want to get acquainted, most acquainted with your assets
Roll with the best, yes my joystick
Tasty in all kinds of ways, you'll see
I'm a pro, anything goes at the spot
If know about it, then be about it
Cuz if not..

I bet she comin' home with me
She wants to come home and play with me
No fallin' in love with me
Can't spend the whole week with me
No sittin' up front with me
For the whole damn world to see
She wants to show me she's a freak
She only wants to sleep with me

She said she wants to ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride

She said she wants to ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride

Yeah baby you said you don't know nothing about video games
But you know a whole lotta about joysticks, huh?
It's like Xbox and EA Sports
It's in the game, you dig?
So if you shift it from first gear to third gear
Just make sure you grab a hold of those two things up under
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, bizzalls, real talk
It's one of them joysticks that you could just
You know, slip n' slide to
Yeah you could ride to this
Real talk
213 comin' at you once again
For the 2000 plus 4

You what up, this is Big Snoop DOgg
If this call is about bullshit, borrowing money from me
Or negativity, hang up right now and call 9-1-1
Cuz I can't do nothing for you right now
But if it's a real call and a real conversation
Leave your name and number at the bizeep
And I'll get back like that",Joysticc,2004
213,"Lil' girl from the ghetto ran away from home
Tryin' to be a fucking woman acting way too grown
Then she ran across the border homie, 24-inch chromes
Now she walking down the track and stripping
With them brand new high heels on

She too young for me so I passed her to the next dude
Got hood fame, what a shame what X' do
Hang with a crew that love getting revenue
With a description of 1972

Now who's the mack in the 'Lac leaning to the side
24's gleaming, sitting up high?
Ride and won't die but you young bitch
Spit words so fly, get you sprung, bitch

Trying to replace him with modern day game
We don't hate then shoot if you mess with his prostitute
And what I hear, he got a lot to shoot

Now what if dude get your crew Slick got one too?
Don't let the pimpin' fool you, he got hot ones too
Blew his brains out now he catching chain out to Chino's
Slick got caught up fucking with a young dogg

My nigga Slick was a gangbang motherfucking lunatic
Nigga out to get a grip, sworn in to do this shit
Nigga only do this shit and make this shit official
A little bitty nigga quick to hit you with the pistol

Ain't no motherfuckers squabbin' me and that's on 20s
Plenty niggaz felt the wrath of his deuce-deuce gun blast
Ask 'cause on the corner with the bullet holes his chest blast
Dumb-dumb don't want come test

'Cause he'll lay you to rest, tattooed with a set on his neck
Demanding respect, Crip or die, is how he ride

Every nigga on the yard know 'cause' rep

It's not just a job fool it's a lifestyle
And when you're slipping, woo-wam-lights-out

Lil' boy from the ghetto with you're greased up khaki's on

And if it get hot in herre? I'm wetting it up
If I can't enter in with my Chucks

Scandalous ho
My dirty ho
Scandalous ho

My homie baby mama trying to fuck me
Would I be wrong if I let her suck me?
It ain't me, it's her, dogg, she'll tell you the same
She don't belong to you man, she belong to the game
A lil' nasty scandalous individual
Hittin' you for you chips and all your residuals
See, bitches do the same thing
to athelets and entertainers and hood niggaz
'cause, we in the same game
I don't know why it's like that
When I was growing up I remember bitches wouldn't fight back
Now these hos push the game and they want to strike back
I treat a bitch like Tina, that mean I'm like Ike, I guess
Back-back-back to reality you funky hood rat
You good for nothing shit talking bucked mouth
Want some real shit I give a fuck about
How the bitch feel if she get killed?
I don't give a fuck and I don't think I ever will

[Chorus]

[Warren G]
We started off friendly fucking
I thought it wasn't nothing but nothing
Then all of a sudden her nigga started loving the muffin
She got a husband, he be gone a lot
So we be fucking in they home a lot
Shopping his expenses while he on tour
I pedal to the floor on one of his Benz's
Flossing for my friends and shit, spending his Benjamins
Then all of a sudden it came to an end and shit
Once he saw me and his dame pass
Walking in the rain holding hands talking about his lame ass
And how we entertained for my gangbang ass
A man jumped out with his thang ready to blast
Ski mask over his face, I reached to grab a 38
that I grabbed from her husband safe
I blast a couple to his face and made it to her tilt
and she checked her answering machine, her husband got killed damn

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
She thought I was gone
Thought I left on tour today
Far away
Thought I was in another place
When the dog's away
Funny how the cats will play
But-but baby girl
I saw you and him walking in the rain

She thought I was gone
Thought I left on tour today
Far away
Thought I was in another place
When the dog's away
Funny how the cats will play
But-but baby girl
I saw you and him walking in the rain

Everybody swimming, backyard full of women

Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy

Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
To pop some fireworks with my kids

And fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion

It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up

Yeah, we like blood brothers

In Jamaica, Queens I sit back, live and collect the cabbage

It's an affair that every state can relate to
And if you do what I do, then go on and follow suit
From Chi-Town to Diego, all the way back to NY
Stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine

When I'm at the church I barbeque for my kinfolk
Watch lil' Elijah and lil' Warren run the football
Got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
And it's a blessin' that the world want to hear our music

The summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
And to my my n**** Snoopdewoop, I love you fam'

Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that

[Chorus]

Yeah, another summer
Kanye West good looking on the beat, nephew
213 reminding y'all put your guns down
Well spent summertime, let's enjoy ourselves

We just want to celebrate
You know what I'm talking about?
It's too hot for all that
Yeah 213

213
Childhood homies way back in the day
since then it's been 213 the hard way
Rapping on the street corners, young as can be
All the local groups called us Run-DMC
Me? Warren G, I was Jam Master Jay
Mixed with my big brother Dr. Dre
Now I got shouts to say
We still want Eazy like bedstyle people, we want Biggie
In memory of Tupac, Left Eye, Aaliyah
Heaven sent, say hi to my mama when you see her
Rest in peace but let's take it back to the streets
With so much drama in the LBC
It's kind of hard being a G from 213
Times was hard for a superstar
But don't nobody notice who you are
We worked hard and stayed true to the game
Kept faith, kept God and now you know our name

[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
A big shout out to all my family and friends
When times got hard, you were still be there
You give me inspiration like strength from the sun
Feel like destiny's son, yeah

[Snoop Dogg]
To be a rapper was my dream
And have a lot of money and live like a king
To have a handful of rings
And to make the kind of music that the whole world sings
Battle rap was the thing
And King Park was the spot where all the homeboys hang, bang
Just to go do our thang and form my gang
And took off white a white boy in a van to get our change
And moms knew what time it was
And loved the way her baby boy came up, 'cause
It's before I was Snoop Dogg on TV
I'm talking about when I was like a little bitty BG
Nigga me and Warren Gizzy and Nate Dizzy and Fatey Baby
are talking about eighty-threezy, flip the clock up to '93
And watch me rock the clock nonstop constantly
on MTV and BET whatever you want
Hit these niggaz with that motherfucking cheese (G-Funk)
Funk to shake ya trunk nigga from the bottom bunk
Now I'm moving on up, straight living it up
Well known in the zone and I'm still homegrown
Like Al be	 Sure, shit I'm on my own
But there's one thing I'm missing and that's family
'cause without y'all I don't know where I'd be

[Chorus]

[Nate Dogg]
There's no way I can forget about you
Support for me, your love for me
Your prayers for me when I'm in these streets
And there's no way I can forget to thank ya
For showing me the true meaning of unconditional love ooohhh
When I be fucking up you always come with love
You say you've had enough
I just want to thank ya
Yeah yeah yeah
I just want to give

[Chorus]",Appreciation,2004

Funny how one thing leads to another

Seems like it all can change and I can get paid

I can't get a job; I might as well steal and rob
Man, life is so hard
Hanging in my homie garage while other n****z
Doing killing for a living in the city of stars

I got a lick but I ain't got caught

And I seen where he set it, thought he had hid it
Nope, and I'm about to go get it

over dick that her mother probably did last night
Despite the dead beat daddy
And daughter don't listen, get her a** beat badly

And we get mad when they a** get burned out

I bust em from the back, to the extreme
Hit em up, make em scream like a bitch
And switch up, for the mix up, and dig a ditch up
And bounce, then for luck, I throw a six up
And hook off like prince naseem a head
Duck yo' head, or go inside instead
Step to me bourgeois? fancy as dandy?
You get killed, like you was jon-benet ramsey
And some of y'all just plain civilians
Talking shit, and never even seen a million
Acting like y'all Sicilians, when y'all niggas
With small figures, and chasing gold diggers
(motherfuckers) don't even come up to me yapping
Or you'll die hard with Bruce and Sam Jackson
Right now, you wanna duel, you fool
I'm a dog 4 life like my nigga ja rule
Who wanna flex, with the influential
With mad credentials on instrumentals we're too essential
The mic and the beat, now shit's complete
For me to kick your ass, for talkin trash, punk

""you got shot cause you knock knock knocked
Who's there? another motherfucking hardrock""

""whoa-ho-hoh, let me like slow up with the flow""

Chk-chk, blaow blaow blaow, blown traject'""

Just throw yo hands in the air motherfuckas
I came to make y'all freak one another
I, I keep bangin', I keep slangin'
We keep watching niggas die for simple things
So I keep swingin', fuckin' a nigga head up
Dead up, I'm fed up feel my lead bust

Now I don't stop, but I smoke weed
I ain't gotta pop rocks no more I got G's
Just wave you hands from side to side
Cause we gone show keep it live
We got greed in our eyes, I keep spittin', I keep rippin'
I keep women, I creep and keep hittin'
They impressed with my shoe size, deuce I'm with you tonight
Girl if you do it right, me and you can do it twice

When I'm called on to bust, wanna get yo brawl on with us
Can't ball with us, too hard to touch
22 Fuckin' up they callin' us

I'm the first one off the bus, got nuts to lust
They keep rushin' for status, some more than you got it
All for cabbage as far as we got it

So don't push me, I'm too close to the edge
Bout to go loco on these niggas, leave'em for dead, and

When it's time for us, bitch we diamond cut
I'm 22, We West-Chi

And I'm da motherfuckin' Brat right

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow
It's potent and rushed out the stores, cop yours

If you won't ride then say so, why play make dough
Turn playa hatin' foes to hoes
Too strong for your nose, shoot up I got the best blow

When I hit the door, nigga best move, guess who
We ain't got no dress shoes, just a couple scarves and a vest too
Test who why you trippin' we came to party
Run game and probably leave the party with somebody
Gotta be hard, women they love to touch it
And when I fuck 'em they hypnotized
Sprung cause I hit it right, tongue tied sometimes
Like Zinfandel wine, got they mind blown
In my zone, I'm a grown man, gone I ain't tryin' to keep her
She got nice features, but so do Mesha, Imma keep creepin'
Keep getting deeper they playa hate me all of a sudden
A new kid bussin', you hear it hush and she
Scared to cut fuckin' too many hoes, me I got
Twenty hoes, I'ma hoe, be a hoe, spend the dough, see a show
Let it be known playa west to east
Cause I'm the dog that fell in love with the Georgia Peach

I heard you wanna hit this twat, nigga I thought not
Fell up in the party with a phat knot, glock cocked
Got too much of my own shit to stop
And look for niggas, when I make any dick rock
Shook them niggas, took all they cheese, still they say
They body's callin' for me, wanna go half on a seed and shit
Fuck that, I got half on the weed and shit and I'm Brat
One of a kind of my breed and shit and you can find me
On the West Side of Chi with my thieving click, believe a bitch
Cause ain't no nigga hated on the pussy yet
Squeeze the dick, got grip, they can't forget
Ain't a hoe tight like me, flow tight like me

Day to day you think of me
Can't wait to get to the club to see my face just to
smoke and drink with me
The DJ keep spinnin' the hot records
Make the whole table go crazy the first second
Third I'm ready and able to hit the middle
Under that disco ball so I could shake a little
This s*** for why'all who dance with me
Touchin' my a** and titties so frantically
Don't get carried away with it
I'll let you have a little fun if you play with it
Insatiably, when I cum I do it patiently
'cause if it ain't all night its a waste to me
You been chasing me for the longest time
Like Billy Joel so please tell me what's on ya
mind..n****

Now tell me, do I do I make ya horny huh
All up on me having a good time
I just want to know what's going through ya mind mind

I put my hands on the back of your fade
And we danced till the crack of dawn came
To the sun raise up its on
Still got stamina to take you home
Brat the damager managed to handle any position
handed to her
You want to f*** with the funk bandit
Leave it alone when the sweat trinkle down my
cleavage you can't stand it
And you ain't even believing you dancing with Brat
And making eye contact
Homie put your hands on my waist and occasionally
Run your fingers through my fresh a** braids and say
to me
That you feel horny 'cause I want to know
If you want some of this I wish you tell me so
'cause if I let you touch me I must want you to go
Home with me be alond with me to get some mo'
'cause we smoke we drink we bump and grind
And even though I'm tipsy I want to know what's on
ya mind

Brat now let me rock it from a n****s perspective
No chick can neglect this
Just listen when I stress this
The b**** was breathless
Big lips so thick make me want to drop draws
Star had me rock hard shaking like a pornstar
Uh huh wa**up shorty
Won't you be my sweet lover friend what homie
Thug love homie Brat put you up on pink lemonade
That's why I don't attract rats with my serinades
Stack off plubicades
Lack when it comes to brains
More than 2 women I'mma stack'em then play the
game
Rack'em they love my name 22
'cause they figure amongst themselves can I really
enject 2
With my nine inch source see me climb in the nookie
screaming
Everything is mine while I'm grinding the p****

Why do we fight - both black and white
cause we don't understand
If you give, you get but if you want respect

tell me who pays the price
From our generation to the next
Have respect for human life

A man kills another man for things he doesn't understand
How can someone take another life
If people just don't give a damn
can't respect a man for what he is a man
Then the world will destruct from racial strife

I do believe in self and self-respect is where it starts
you have to love yourself before you love
And if love must play a part - then it has to come from your heart
In order for the pain of hate to cease

We got - we got - we got to stop hatred
Hatred is something perpetrade by lies
We got - we got - we got to have justice
The system plays God by who lives or dies

Bitte nein, nein, nicht diese Stimme schon wieder
Will mal wissen, womit ich diesen Pimmel verdient hab'
Der mir jeden Tag sagt du brauchst Patte für den Spaß!
Wieso elftausend Euro für 'nen Kaffee-Automat?!
Und ich Affe sag' noch ja, dieser Prengel ist ein äh
Ich hasse diesen Arsch! 
Ey, scheiß' auf Würde und so
Er verführt mich und droht mir mit Hodenkrebs, irgendwann da würg' ich ihn tot
Dieser Schniedel ist ein Spast, ein richtig dummer Vogel
Ich steh' mitten auf der Bühne und er pisst mir in die Hose
Mein Schwanz sagt du musst deine Glotze erneuern!
Doch tausend Schuhe kaufen, ist für mich auch fotzengesteuert
Ich gebe den Kampf gegen den Schwanz leider auf
Denn mein Penis ist kein Penis, sondern anscheinend 'ne Frau

Mein Schwanz sagt denk nicht, das tut dir nicht gut!
Mein Schwanz sagt du hast zu oft die Schule besucht!
Mein Schwanz sagt leck mich, dann nimm deine Hand!
Und mein Verstand sagt scheiß drauf und hör verdammt nochmal auf deinen Schwanz

Okay, mein Penis und ich, wir verstehen uns nicht
Er distanziert sich von mir, ich glaub, er schämt sich für mich
Mein Leben gefickt, ich kann den Wichser nicht leiden
Ich kann machen, was ich will, der Pimmel pisst mir ans Bein
Er spricht zu mir, der blöde Pisser bringt mich in Bedrängnis
Er sagt mir, was ich tun soll, ich lande im Gefängnis
Ich hasse diesen Schwanz, ich glaub' ich reiß ihn bald ab
Doch er lacht nur und sagt hast du keine Eier im Sack
Los machs', komm trau dich, man du laberst zu viel
Ey sone Fotze wie du hat mich eigentlich gar nicht verdient!
Und jetzt mach lieber mal ne Olle klar, sonst Fick ich deinen Arsch!""
Aber, nix aber, besser wär's du gibst hier mal Gas
Ich versteh' da kein' Spaß geh mir deiner Hand hier weg
Man ich bin errigiert hol lieber mal ne Schlampe jetzt!""

Da ich Pause drücken muss, weil meine Unterhose kneift
Ich bau ungestört mit bunten Förmchen Puddingtörtchen weil
Mir das Spaß macht, hört sich dumm an und gestört zugleich
Ich geh mit meinen Dogs zum Minigolf
Währen du dir mit deinen Dogs gerad das Hundekörbchen teilst

Aber nicht die normalen, die man beim Schlafen so hat
Nein, es ist eigentlich immer mehr so ein seidiges Dingen
Mit einem peinlichem Logo und einer Schleife zum Binden
Leg es bei Seite beginne mit meiner Reise ins Innere
Und werfe mein Tagebuch in' Müll weil ich die Seite nicht finde

Guck ich rede schon mit mir selbst. Ganz ehrlich

Da bleibt dir der Atem weg, wie Mike wenn ich hase
Klingel bei deiner Mom und schrei meinen Part
Wie son Geistesgestörter durch die Freispechanlage
Keine Panik, ich schrei jeden Tag, und halte drei Referate
Eins über Schafe und die anderen über heimische
Eidechesenarten. Ich scheiße gerade, nicht im Moment nein
Damit meine ich eigentlich grade, so die Richtung, jap, jap

It's just a test if the rest of the mess
Can flip a song to bang along to nevertheless

We're gonna take what they don't deserve
They're gonna hate the fact that we're rocking
And we make another record, if we're not number one
We're gonna take what they don't deserve
They're gonna hate the fact that we're rocking
And we're motivated by something they could never hope to understand
Jedi Master is the man

Say what?

It's like a TV show, here we go
Kicking around the sound that's sounding def
'Cause I'm sick like salo
I tell ya that we're killing all the fake bullshit
While they're making hits
Like I'm taking shits and I'm sick of it
It's clear to me that they don't give a shit what the kids think
'Cause I can't tell the difference between heroin and *NSYNC
As long as they get sponsorship from the biggest cola drink
Open up your eyes to the crooked and you don't blink

And I'm motivated by something I don't understand
I'm the man guided by the hand of the force
And Jedi Master's on the same plan
Making no sense like the rain man
Underground battles like Vietnam
His cuts are so fresh, he's fuck it - they get it
Hit it twice, pass it left then you kick back track list
Isn't this chronic number one of the finest batch",Say What?,2003

Hey yo Pac ill set back and design it slow. 
They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I aint takin no shorts, like a newport, 
Explortin' the fully joint and 
Explodin' on the whole court. 
And I don't wanna be,wanna be, nothin' like mike 
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin

But your life's not tight.

Finga' on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine 
Smokin' blunts a skunk, makin' hoes of punks 
And only underground funk bumpin' outta my trunk 
Live my life as a hustla, high till I die 
Meetin' bitches, gettin' riches, miss me when lie 
Picture me living out my life as a busta 
I ratha' pop out a shot out my glock, and blast muthafuckas 
I live that thug life baby I'm hopeless, chokin' off indo 
Tryin' to keep my focus 
Don't let that bullshit worry me,
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 
Till they bury me 
God gave me game so I'm hustlin', 
Pour out some liquor for my niggas

Whether its rhyme or crime,
Nigga, I gotta get mine

Now let me rushing threw your mind,
I'm balla is what I keep gettin' 
Every time I pick up the mic and start spittin' 
The sidewalk of new york will start bumpin' 
Jumpin' around,with the muthafuckin pound 
And I'm down to the fullest,and breakin' niggas ass off proper 
Did you right, that's right, cause I got you in my pocket again 
The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when 
I boasted,and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again. 
Like precision, cut the two lines in the division. 
Plus,what I add loose as flutes. its gaming foe sale like prostitutes. 
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt. 
They want me in the back,but bitch I'm in the front. 
Don't front,and really I don't need a reply. 
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye. 
I'm on a whole 'nother level,them hoes is left 
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself 
Goodbye,some many niggas lied to have 
Funny what a muthafucka' do for math

Equal to your realist satisfaction

Blazing their light

Wanna laugh like a loon

29th Street Saxophone Quartet,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree
On what to do,
And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1994
2AM Club,"For as long, long as I can remember
It's been December, no sun,
No summertime to treasure, we weren't grown
And every time that they told us surrender, it will be better
We just go holding on 'til forever for what we know

Broken lover, yes, I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now, out that doorway
I won't say your wrong
But you know that I worry about you

For as long, long as she can remember
She wanted better, no home
No one there to protect her, all alone
And so she told me I was her center
Nothing could tempt her
I still roamed just like her father left her
Ooh, he left her

Broken lover, yes, I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now, out that doorway
I won't say your wrong
But you know that I worry about you

Isn't it bad, you been a good victim
You thought I was worth it, you act like I would listen
And maybe you were right at one point, someday
I use to watch you treat the streets like a runway
I use to write with tears coming down your pretty painted face
Sign language on your back from the first taste
So when he whispers in your ear and you think of me
You wish I would've treated you like you treated me
When you wake up from your dreams of the hallway
Sleepwalking through the streets dressed in all gray
Making streetlamps in the windowpane
I worried from the second that I learned your name

Everything in love is lie
But where was I last night?
And why don't you feel right?

Broken lover, yes, I made you
Believe that I would be the one to heal you
And if you go now, out that doorway
I won't say your wrong

2AM Club,"In the back of this Nissan
You make me so hot
I love you on fire
That's just what this song's about
Hair pressed against the skin
My fingers on your blouse
I'll keep you in my mouth
And hope to never take you out

This means more than love in a flashing room
And those clothes your fashion it dies too soon
So lose those the floor is where they should be
I tear down your walls and you set me free

Nothing can take me from her
She keeps me on the ground
Nothing can take me from her
She never would leave me down

In the back of this Vegas lot
You make my heart stop
I love your clothes off
But that's not what this song's about
Legs over the stick shift
You let the cloth rip
Your fingers on my kiss
Got me wrapped around your wrists

This means more than love in a five star suite
And much more than kissing on easy street
And rooftops in cities that never sleep
They all search for something like you and me

Nothing can take me from her
She keeps me on the ground
Nothing can take me from her
She never would leave me down

You don't even believe me
Would it hurt to try
I'd say you could complete me
But there's no you in I
Will I be here next year hold that next tear in your eye
You know that I come every time you cry

In the back of this LA cab
You drive me so mad
Hold you 'til my hands bled
That's the red I wish I had
So much between us now
Oceans but I'd swim out
I'll keep you in my mouth
And hope to never take you out

This means more than love on a silver screen
And much more than love in a magazine
And sweat beads you give me all I need
And this room it flashes for you and me

Nothing can take me from her
She keeps me on the ground
Nothing can take me from her
She never would leave me down

Ever since we stepped on campus
Ever since she left her classes
So she could fill some glasses
She want a photograph
8 by 11 dreams
She's got that self-worth
She learned at 17

And I could work with that
Been working all week
She's been flirtin' all night
Wishing she could own me
But I come with a lot of baggage
And a lot of ego, and a lot of fashion
Just drop that prada bag
And we could probably make tonight pop
And she said

Let me down easy
But stay with me tonight
Say you don't need me
But stay with me tonight

She left her cares on the bedpost
Next to the lipstick and the mentos
Evian and a candy necklace
She goes to places her friends won't
She's in the backyard
Under a starry sky
I'm thinking backseat
She's looking for the key

And I could work with that
Been working all month
She's been flirting all night
Lady I'm the wrong one

I was off in the back room drinking
Sippin' something thinkin' nothing
When I heard my phone start ringin'
She was like, don't pick it up
'Cause tonight I ain't in love
And I just can't be here with nobody's trust

She left her friends in high school
She's thinking ""why do I like you?
If I just make-do with a nice dude
I could make it to the white picket fence crew""
But it just won't work like that
When I wake it's on the road
You could take me in your room
But you can't take me home

And I said please, please, please don't shine so bright
Please, please, please don't shine so bright, oh no

You did it so right you gave me your life
One star can never shine twice
So I could never, never

I wanted just to feel your heart, wanna feel your heart but it wouldn't beat
Her gates remained locked I tried to move to 'em my feet wouldn't walk
I wanted just to talk it out, wanna talk it out but I couldn't speak

You were there and I could tell but looking was too hard to do
If you came to my side, private sunshine
But I don't deserve to take her home and make the sun mine
So I stay away alone knowing that I'll never know
Only something beautiful will change the brightest of the glow

Used to lay there with wet hair
After the shower picking what to wear

I just don't know how the chips all fell

Gave love I didn't follow suit

Inténtalo que solo soy de ti
No me dejes sin tu amor

On the estate where the sunset kissed the rooftops
Where we always stayed out late
But late for us was only ten

And said “well, I guess I’ll see you around?”

And the lakes start to freeze over, but it’s just late October

Best believe you gotta watch yo' ass

And this is the reason why I sell this
To keep you motherfuckers jealous

Straight out the money, bail to the bank
The upper high class where a nigga rank
And people always try to say they feelin' it
Then wanna come with the bullshit
I don't wanna deal with a bitch on a get-rich-quick plan
Tryin' to make a player be her man
And the niggas on the nut jock roll
Bein' a ho for a player
They might as well be on a stroll
Bring the 'K back a fat end
Just so they could be my friend
I don't accept it, I'll look you over then check it
There's another nigga who feels neglected
The punk and the bitch in a broke role
Will I ever go back to? (Hell nah)
I think I'll stick to the lick that got me rich

""An old, off the street pimps con game""

Bitches, niggas, the whole nine yards
Try to search for the play on the boulevard
The coolest nigga on the scene
Now he live his life like a king
He never rolls undercover
'Cause yo, he's a bad motherfucker
Thinkin' of jackin' my friends
Hmmm, you better think again nigga
See few have only been chosen
But this young player has rosen
With a different bitch every night
Bitches give up the pussy because they don't like to fight
And when he's done they remember the door
'Cause they know they gotta go
He'll do ya know and see ya later
That's right bitch, this is the life of a player...

Ha ha yeah check it out money & pussy make the world go 'round 

(That's right) That's how it's been since the beginning of time. 

Now who says we can't be fly? 

Who say Compton niggas can't get they scrilla 

At the same time get some thigh 

Well uh that's the subject of my conversation 

Cause ain't nothin' like gettin' a dollar & some penetration 

Now that's a whole lot easier to understand now a days 

But uh some of you playas still be going out sideways 

So umm just take this game with a tic tac 

Cause if you was on Skid Row you can get 

Pussy faster than a Big Mac 

I owe it to myself to be fly that's what Top Dog taught a boy 

Cause instead of Mounds these bitches always want Almond Joy 

Because uhh ""Sometimes they feel like a nut"" 

But they rather have it more often than they don't 

So I won't go flippin' & makin' it topsy turvy 

Now keep my hundred dollar bills crisp & that ass curvy 

Cause ain't nuthin' on my mind but to be fly through time 

Havin' a nest egg bird behind an estate that's mine 

Watchin' Jordan go for forty in a sucker tub 

Eatin' Cheetos drinkin' Mo' & getting a back scrub 

Because first you get the power then you get the money 

Then you get the pussy dude don't be no dummy uhh

Playas get they paper when they game is tight

Spin a scraggler on a wheel now they call me D the Potter 

Lotta hatin' going on but I ain't with it 

I'ma mash on that drama everytime that I feel it 

'Cause I'd rather have a major end than have sex

But first you get the power then you get the money 

Then you get the pussy fool don't be no dummy

That next full minute suckin ya drama up

Mary, a girl at a party
Pretty face, fantasy body
On the strength girl was fine
Mission: make her mine
So I stepped to her shyly
Before I could speak she walked right by me
Frozen, lost my cool
Out of the groove, what´s my next move
Should I chill, should I follow
Heart is pounding, I feel hollow
Paused, thought for a minute
If she was a pool I´d jump right in it
So in her path I did step
Nervous but I still had pep
It didn´t matter where she went to
I would be there too

That everywhere that Mary went the little boy was sure
to go

Stand tall, courage don´t fall

Tried to speak and almost choked
Abnormal for the ruthless chiller
Normally I´m a ladies killer
Why were my nerves shaky
I knew she´d make me and not break me

Here she comes, should I talk to her now
Yes, it´s now or never

Music, we could talk
And express our inner thoughts
How about it, what do you think

We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts

'Cause any day they'll push the button and all good men
Like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Told 'em they could get teary the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly

There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me it ain't about black or white
'Cause we're human I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto Gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns

Tell me do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin' outta bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady crack got her crazy
Yet she's givin' birth to a baby

I don't trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged wonder if they take it all back
Will I still keep the courage?

I refuse to be a role model I set goals, stay in control
Drink out my own bottles I made mistakes
But learned from every one and when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one

If I upset you don't stress never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain when I write rhymes
I go blind and let the Lord do His thing ain't it

But am I less holy 'cause I chose to puff a blunt
And drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace we gotta find peace
And end the war in the streets my Ghetto Gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, Ghetto Gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sounds of guns

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy

Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, kna' mean?

Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there, kickin' up dust
Givin' a motherfucker,
Yeah, niggas, mad at cha
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm) (I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, afund I ain't mad at cha)

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time,
You'll find a rhyme'll blaze you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't mad (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)

My mind starts tripping
A tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they breaking trying to save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn I see demons
Dear God, I wonder can you save me
I can't die my boo boo's bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
(Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better)
How long will I live?
(Eternal life and forever)
And will I be the G that I was?
(I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dream of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes my son)
My eyes are closed

Murder, murder was the case that they gave me

I'm fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
It's gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz, and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad
(Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start set-tripping, that ass is mine)
Indeed, agreed proceed to smoke weed
Never have a want, never have a need
They say I'm greedy but I still want mo'
Cuz my eyes wanna journey some more, really doe, check it out

Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I should die, before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

No more indo, gin and juice
I'm on my way to Chino, rolling on the grey goose
Shackled from head to toe
Twenty-five with an izz-el, with nowhere to gizzo, I know
Them niggas from the other side recognize my face
Cause it's the O.G. D-O-double-G, L-B-C
Mad dogging niggas cause I don't care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard, that's where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks, just in case the war, pops off
Cause you can't tell what's next
My little homey Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably won't make it to see twenty-two
I put that on my Momma; I'ma ride for you Baby Boo

Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Making n****s die, witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan to be the man in this wicked land
Under handed hits are planned, scams are plotted over grams of rock
Undercover agents die by the random shots, we all die in the end

So revenge, I swore, I was all about my ends, f*** friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my, my heata
Got me a dog, named him Mobb B**** N**** Eata
What could they do to me that little brat? S*** them, n****s

That shot me and still terrified I'll get their a**, how can I show you
How I feel inside? We outlawz motherf***as, can't kill my pride
N****s, talk a lot of s*** but that's after I'm gone 'cause they fear me
In physical form, let it be known, I'm troublesome

All ya n****s die, put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, troublesome, I know what time it is
Call the punk police please, they can't stop us n****s run the streets

Troublesome, gutter ways my mentality is ghetto
We're guerrillas in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet on bomb on them first n****s
We came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely screaming f***

All y'all n****s in Swahili, pistol packin' fresh out of jail
I ain't goin' back, release me to care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like candy man, bet I roll on your a**
Like an avalanche, a soul survivor, learned to get high
And pull drive bys, murder my foes, can't control my nine

Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta a** motherf***as tried to flee, picture me lettin'
This chump survive, redin' up on his a** when I'm doped
He die, 'cause I'm troublesome

All ya n****s, die young, strapped and I don't give a f***
I'm hopeless, I live a thug life loosin' my focus, baby
I'm troublesome, bad boy killa, there is no one realla
What you saw was the rough, rugged and raw, outlaw

Murder, murder my mind states s*** ain't change
Since my last rhyme, the crime rate ain't decline
N****s bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young n**** never learned a thang

Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers but how can I cry
Tried to warn the little n****, either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak, I scream
Afraid to sleep I'm havin' crazy dreams

Vivid pictures of my enemies and family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong but I plan to die
You can take me to heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity or send me to hell
'Cause I ain't beggin' for my life, ain't nothing worse
Than this cursed a** hopeless life, I'm troublesome

We close like kin but you remain my friend to
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin needin tissues, fightin over childish issues
Swear I can't live witchu but withouchu every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin witchu
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free

Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again

It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend

Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch

Sorry if I called you bitch

The difference between a pack of bitches and black women

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin' right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me, for the outcome, ban my records - check it
Don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennesey got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin, in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry, I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu, that I love her, but it's hard to take
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was

I see bloods and crips runnin' up the hill
lookin' for a better way
My brothers and sisters it's time to build
'cause even thug niggas pray
Hopin' God hear me, 
I entered the game; 
look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
when I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
watchin' time fly; I love my people do or die
But I wonder why, we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga get paid.""
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say, c'mon..

[Chorus: x2]

God help me out here, 'cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
'Cause money's like a strong prescription drug, it's got me addicted
to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
somethin' bout the paper wit the pictures of the president's, head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money 'cause it's cursed
makin' money makes a difference day by day so I gotta stay
paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try to see death, you gotta die
A lot of my, peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life do 'em right, or did life leave 'em dumb
Who has the answers? I wonder; I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell them
or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) 'Cause they don't even know
A million thangs run through my mind..
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time..

He caught me on the sneak tip 
Now the punks in deep shit 

Catch him on the streets, bring him to his feet, quick 
Pass the clip, I think I see him coming now 
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and lets run him down 
Gots to be the first one to hit yah when we meet 

Coming quickly up the street, is the punk ass police 
The first one jumped out and said freeze 
I popped him in his knees and shot him punk please 
These cops are reminded, and get us as when we rush 

Now you clear like a bitch cause you don't know how to hush 
Now back to the smoke of the robbery

I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watch the hearse past
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cause cops tried to snippe' me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man

Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas

And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck

Don't really give a fuck

They act like they never seen a mother fucker wearing black

I wanna take my business else where

We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways

In many ways we were paid in the old days

I'm still down with my homies from the hometown

I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin' tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call

But I guess that the streets is harder

Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong

They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain, so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister! It's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies

They won't be happy till I'm banned

So point blank in your face, pump up the bass
And join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from the Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way

So reap the wrath of the rebel, jacking em up once mo'

I guess they scared of the rebel, the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks trying to sweat me
In fact, they trying to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
Cause they don't like what I'm talking bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers selling out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm coming from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still getting told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gang bang
They talking street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They making records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about

I'm comin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucker makin' death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin',
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin' out (Bang!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja

All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me

Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.you., now she wants to do me
Ooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip 'cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a coat-check, snappin' motherfuckers necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
Niggas get done with the drum, watch my foes run

I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin' to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin' motherfuckers like a shootin' star
'Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin', wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick, like a motherfuckin' 'conda
Niggas wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, 'cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath  and revenge of Tha' Lunatic

Niggas got problems in ninety-one
Ninety-two, and ninety-three
And all that other shit, word up!

Recognize game when it smacks your bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin' shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel 'cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin' for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin' that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin'
Stop trippin' off these niggas 'cause they ain't about nothin'
Or should I say Nay'thin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic

2Pac,"You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what the streets do to me

'Cause they never talk peace in the black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen
Niggas commin' out worse off then when they went in
Over the years I done a lot of growin' up
Gettin' drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harassed me I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em
I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep the black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep the black man down)

They got me trapped
Can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellin' you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because the mans slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett 'em suffer the payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep the black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep the black man down)

Now I'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use the phone
'Cause I'm sure someone is tappin' in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsight the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin' ""Damn homies is dissin' you""
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die then be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped

(Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep the black man down)

(Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down)
You know they got me trapped

I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be

I'm never ignorant, getting goals accomplished

I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?""
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew
(Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!)
""Get out the car or I'll hurt you""
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up, or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man Aye yo ay man just c'mon ?)
(""What you doin man?"") They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked (""I'm out"") he tried to run 
(Freeze nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped so, I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(? Argh, fuck you! Ungh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste, of tradin places
And all this, 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin that I'm violent

I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (damn!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (damn!) we in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up, and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' (audi) then we steppin'

In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is
The troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one
We are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremely alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact
That we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me

It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Acomplishes, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight
Fight and die if we must like niggas
This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in out brains that made us fear yeah
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honor a man that who refuses to respect us
Emancipation, proclamation, Please!
Nigga just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me its all about hypocrisy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me

Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching children
That they can be all that they want to to be
There's much more to life than just poverty
This is defiantly ah words of wisdom
America, America, America
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidence
Words of Wisdom

They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you want to do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The American dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your slave, don't believe
Cause it will strangle yeah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came

Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgetting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings

But the battle ain't over till the black man sings

America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
For Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me

But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come

I hate the studio 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope

Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop

It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight

Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, somethin' that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out, a poison, a deadly venom

Yeah Mad, fuck that, you know how we do
Know what I'm sayin'? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent

Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin' G you better flee

'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up

No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

Nigga, you know what I'm sayin'? Fuck that
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac

Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see

I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me paid
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey

I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everyday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray

First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks
Pac's out puffin' blunts
Deadly venomz

Ha ha ha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache 'bout to clean shit up

Throw up your middle finger, start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin' out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit

You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch

Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em
That's the results of fuckin' with the fifth venom in denim

Yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
Five motherfuckin' deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four, ninety-five all that other shit
We takin' this motherfucker over this larger hit

You know what I'm sayin'? Follow us, come along
You know what I'm sayin'?
We takin' this motherfucker over, trust, we out",5 Deadly Venomz,1993
2Pac,"Guess who's back?

Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, its like a hobby
But more like a job, 'cause bootleggers trying to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceiving those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, ""Hi,"" and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test, of giving
But be thankful that you're living blessed
Guess who's back, coming back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and AK, coming right and exact
I'm fighting it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back

Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?
Guess who's back?

""Yes I'm back""
""Tupac is"" 
Back!

Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustling dicks, to making hits, busting flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause they hate my black take
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, its a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Trying to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, why me?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Giving up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm ripping up 'nough hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?

Guess who's back?

2Pac,"Aw yeah, uh, uh

Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin' hearts and jackin' marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week

But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the Blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song

They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin', never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
'Cause nobody else'll give a damn

Mutha-fucker rednecks all the same
Feel a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll

2Pac,"Daddy's home

Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin' to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin' time
For you to be comin' home talkin' that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin' along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin' to save my soul I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)

For all this time, so sorry baby!

Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
I'm gettin' a bit older and I'm startin' to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin' like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin' care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh, I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin' kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin', Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry

I'm so sorry

Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy

June 16th, 1971,
Mama gave birth to a hell-raisin heavenly son
See the doctor tried to smack me but I smacked him back
My first words was ""Thug for life,"" and ""Papa pass the Mac.""
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini fourteen callin' 
From out the window of my drop top, I got my Glock cocked
Bustin' at niggas, when will it stop?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin, will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have yo' Nike's on - cause when we fight
It's in the middle of the night with no lights on, hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky
Paranoid out my mind, cause motherfuckers tryin' to rush me
Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'
Comin' out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never, never die I'll be a hustler motherfuckers
And makin' thugs out you suckers from the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet
So now a young nigga's bein' raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
A straight - thug; just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats - one black and one of chrome
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave
From the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

From the cradle to the grave
I'm glad to say, I made it this far
Many G's died hogs and all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land
That's the war zone, I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home with out my sugar, I'm hafta plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me since then I been knowin'
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin at marks, get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money, and through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum
I tried to cope loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I'm gettin my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock slingin rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscin' bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin' dirt
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work

From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy, livin' in the ghetto

Time's movin' fast, will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did wishin' someone held me but they never did
I can't take it, will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me, crazy
Do or die, nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tec-9
I got nothin' to lose, payin dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm comin'
Start runnin' yellin' ""evil mind"" as I'm gunnin'
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginning is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave

You wonder why I'm made this way
I wasn't, turned out, I was raised this way
I'm thinkin' these, are the dreams of a young teen
Scheme, to stack cream off of crack fiends
One-time can't hold me
One of these days, we gotta bust back for the homies
Locked down in the penitentiary
I'll, probably lose my mind if the pig sentence me
I'm, stressed, smokin weed, and nicotine
But what a nigga really need, is Thorazine
Right before I die I'll be cursin the law
Reincarnated bitch, even worse than befo'
My fo'-fo' screamin payback
My underhanded plan to get them niggas while they laid back
And Big Stretch hit the scene with the mini-14
Servin suckers like dope fiends, empty the whole thing
Under pressure nigga, haha, that's right!

Never run, throw your gun in the air, oh yeah!
Nigga bust ain't no time to spare
Cause the ruckus motherfucker and we fuck shit up
And with the stainless steel ribbon boy we cuttin' shit up
Flash then blast a nigga with the quickness
Cock the four pound motherfucker when I spit this and rip this
Damn, my mind is in the depths of hell
But when I'm walking on the street kid my name rings bells
And I never fell, nigga I stand too tall
I'm just a thug motherfucker who was born to brawl
Givin' my all, so niggas wanna bring it to me
So I'mma sell my cocaine, and lay they ass down G
Uhh, under pressure

Yeah, look here though

Runnin' wild, I never smiled as a juvenile
Even now I keep a frown when I come around
Don't ask me 'bout the past, it was all bad
Shots blasted, will I last in the wrong path
In the dark is where my heart saw the most grief
Motherfuckers is gettin' shanked over gold teeth
Am I sick, cause I'm addicted to gettin' splifted
Watchin' stupid-ass tricks get lifted
Nothing's changed, 'cause in the game it's a steady aim
Fuck friends cause in the danger them niggas change
Puff weed, and stuff G's in my sock G
Car keys and Hennessy, where the Glock be?
Time's passin', will I last here another day
I put my gun away, and grab my AK
It's gettin' hectic, I can't call it
House full of alcoholics, now a nigga's under pressure

Yeah, that's right
Under pressure nigga, a nigga's under pressure, yeah!

Oh, ah ah
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Oh-hahhh
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket, the aftermath
More bodies being buried, I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, 'cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin' no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

Hey!
Me against the world
Ooh yeah
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
I got nothin' to lose

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin' I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Ever'day there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin'
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin', so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well

I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy!

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this suppression
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress, to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game

I love you

You are appreciated

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
(I know it ain't easy)
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you 
(Dear mama) Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

We had em eatin, shit 'posed to been squashed

She likes the Monie in the Middle, play tetherball
Thick ass bitch, high yellow city-slicker
Scarecrow creepin Southern bitches, aka Posie Pussyfictious

Pullin out bills, frontin on material shit

And settin 'im up and havin 'im catchin a couple of slugs
Sl-uh sl-uh slugs, trynta fuck with savage thug
Pistol pop in they ass, see niggaz be gettin this twisted

Took all your money peeled ya
Seven niggaz bust in the room with AK's
while a nigga be puttin on his jimmy
All of a sudden they shoot up your Vuitton
before you can hit the broccoli
See money-a-made that nigga, that nigga didn't make that money
Left them niggaz jacked up, and the bitch she macked him
He's a busta, punk ass nigga, y'all know the streets
That's why that nigga naked layin dead in between some bloody sheets
It's just a part of the game he didn't feel

Droughts, out, shhh lost clientele but I will prevail
by sellin the broccoli dank instead of the crack cocaine
try not to steal narcotics

the smoke be comin up out the chow, with my nigga Pac

Where's my motherfuckin chrome, only jealous niggaz roam
It's a war zone (war zone) but I'm a man so with gun in hand
I'm on my way to see this hoe you know the fuckin plan
Can't understand, but the things ain't the same
You could die over these bitches if you slippin in the game

Bay Area playa, tryin ta have shit major
And a bitch won't save ya

Action packed, I let the mini-mac smack that ass

Them hoes jacked that ass
Nigga woulda got smokin on that hash
Can't have my cash, better go and take your nigga stash
Cuz he's a busta, niggaz with clusters
Slippin in shit, betta jack that nigga 'fore I jack his ass bitch
Never was no love for the mark-ass, the lo pink (the lo pink)

Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love making, got you shaking when I'm standing near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate but in my heart I know you worth it

Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses

My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow

And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)

Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
Stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go

And I can't get away
I'm not happy here (Let me take you away, all I wanna know, Can U Get Away?)

And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here (If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, every time seen?

Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga trying to make a living
These buster tricks don't want no mail
They spending they riches on skinless bitches
Who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, player-hating but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods getting no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicating through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo

Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own nigga meaning buy yo' own dope
'Cause that front shit is punk shit, something I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit, disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jacking and robbing, despising your homie
Ain't healthy, niggas be ending up dead 'fore they get wealthy

Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doing dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustling since junior high
No time for asking why, getting high, getting mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
'Cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise, them loud talking cowards
Shooting guns into crowds, jeopardizing lives
Shoot em right between them niggas eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's trying to make the news, niggas confused

My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facing
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the player hating tricks, while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed

Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me

When I get to popping niggas is dropping then they done
Calling the coroner come collect the fucking corpse
He got it by killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method, whenever stepping keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets making crack sales
Picture perfection pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed

And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Living when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a player
Overdose of a dick, while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whipping these simps, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading murdered to death, my last breath

But in the lobby Shakur was shot several times, including two graze wounds to the head

Against doctor's orders Tupac Shakur checked himself out of the hospital 
Less than twenty four hours after being shot five times
On the way to a Manhattan recording studio

Tupac Shakur secures one clean legal victory this year
As he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him
When he allegedly shot at two off duty Atlanta cops
On Halloween last year, the case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence

More controversy surrounding Tupac Shakur,
Meanwhile in Tupac news at about six forty-five tonight
Shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack
By checking himself out of the hospital that probably saved his life

Tupac Shakur checked into the Metropolitan hospital yesterday
Under an assumed name, his lawyer said that he had connections
But wouldn't say what kind, that could provide top notch security 
For the injured rap star

And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguments with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggas than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thing, that's the game

Wake up sweaty and screaming, cause I can hear them suckers scheming
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizing
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Looking out for these killer kids, cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representing
Doing twenty to life in San Quentin
Getting calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nothing nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous with ya life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers

Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm having dreams
Of hearing screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
Through the years trying to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started serving fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', cause these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tomorrow, am I falling off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thugging, I can't go home
'Cause muh-fuckers think I'm bugging, so now I'm in

Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
Do I do in these county blues
Getting battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shaking when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sitting in this, living hell, listening to niggas yell
Trying to torture em to tell, I'm getting mail
But ain't nobody saying much, the same old nuts
Is making bucks while these sluts is getting fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems

I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Excercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? heaven or hell? freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? and if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive 
By making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin' to hover over niggas til we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May god forgive me, I was high, label me a

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear god, I wonder could you save me?)

Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest
So I just.. swallow my beck's and holla, ""fuck em!""
And if I'm next.. just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nohtin'

Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
(Hold me down) definitely no need for askin'
(Now he mad) top speed (smokin' weed) blasted (biotch!)

'Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' bout prayin' they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block, tryin' to take my wealth

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)
Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (dear god, I wonder could you save me?)

Outlaw, outlaw, outlaw (they came in to sin)

Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggas run the streets
Ha ha, it ain't nothin' but music
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin real strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than g's
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
'Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket

And all other lil' young niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas

As a young nigga, I'm almost swellin' in the wind
Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies
Tell them niggas started slangin' that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin' to make a bill-ion, can you play me
With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin'
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs

But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends

He's the downest G I've ever known

Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin'' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin'' high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin'' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
""Me Against the World"" stuck in misery, as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
But that's before they taught them gang-bangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga

I'm telling you
To be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that
Yo, y'all niggas don't know how good you really do got it
Motherfuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they want to do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you begin your life
You dumb nigga

Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein' somethin'
Don't want to be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin'
Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
And I will even if it kills me, my young niggas
Break away from these dumb niggas
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thing, that gang bangin'
Puttin' niggas in a casket, murdered for hangin'
At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin''
'Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin' hopeless, where
More and more brothers givin' up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggas

2Pac,"They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
And the system's sucidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block

And I can't help but wonder whhhy, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus... on my block

And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break nine
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... from my block",My Block,1995

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothing to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

Now you know how we do it like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressing the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it"", cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
While she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""go to the telly, ho""
Equipped with money in a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smoking bomb ass weed, feeling crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustling and prayers, to breaking motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishing
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressing (booyah!)
I'mma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches getting suspicious
Started plotting and planning on schemes, to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart, strapped up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hoping you listen I catch you paying attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothing to a G

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screaming as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spitting at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flying when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doing jail time, better day, sacrificing
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thugging for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man, you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothing to a G

My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops cause I know they coming for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish
Didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfucking menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch ass niggas on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
Getting much mail in jail, niggas telling me to kill it
Knowing when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic

And all the cowards that was down with it

Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

We gotta go  (gotta go, gotta go)
We gotta go (yeah baby) (it's check it out time)
We gotta go (let's go nigga, gotta go)
We gotta go (Y'all know what time it is!) (Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man)
We gotta go (call that valet motherfucker, tell him to get a nigga shoe)
We gotta go ('cause we out this, motherfucker)

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
'Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
'Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

We gotta go (ayo man Pac ay)
We gotta go (where the where the fuck is Daz at man?)
We gotta go (This nigga locked up or somethin'?)

Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go
We gotta go (Ay, it's check out time)
We gotta go (Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin')
We gotta go (where my shoes go, nigga?)
We gotta go (where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?)
We gotta go (Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much)
We gotta go (What the fuck y'all doin', nigga? Kurupt!)
We gotta go (go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas, c'mon man)
Niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
We gotta go (I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred)

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, elevates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, ""Mr. I get around""
My temptation got me dripping wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking, strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'

Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug ?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion
Help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alize
Come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
Baby and you'll be my soulja

Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me
What's all that? Huh
It's like the closer you get, baby the quicker I'm speaking
I got a flight out Chicago, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Hennessy and coke
Tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a player hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends
I can soup you in my Benz

Until the end, it gets better with time

You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes
Of a nigga who don't have a thing to loose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took your family in
I put some cash in your pocket
Made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fools fate
Without your word, you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do, if it was up to you
I'd be dead now
I let the world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live until you die

Curious spittin' lyrics, on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency, nigga that's why we're doin' this, I got set up
I surprised the niggas the way I got up and then
I hit the studio it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation this information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient it's a celebration
Of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members across the fifty states
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate ?
To live the life of luxury, some niggas bought my tapes
So much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared 'cause only the strong survive
Life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you figure fuck with me, I give that ass a try

I shoulda saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothers framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain, while she blame me
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen, doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision, that got me livin'
Just like an animal, I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' 'cause
Hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetery full of motherfuckers got not knowin'
Picture my prophecy the cops are attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let'em stop me 'cause I'm a soldier
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust a no no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po po

I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus I try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future 'cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin' tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, 'cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for

How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
'Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walking through the cemetery talking to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward

Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace

Pour a glass and drink with a nigga, you know what I mean?

I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this Thug Passion, baby

I could pull out the drink and be good until it's relevant

I'll roll up a nigga like it's Heaven sent

And laughing while I pass through times
And all these bastards be watching
Just keep it plain
And I'mma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game

Twisting riches but there is only one way to make more

Couldn't know, but buy a .44, blasting at playa haters wanting more
With a Thug Passion

Control by this Thug's Passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blasting

To the niggas who kept it real
Like they claim to
That's when I bang, do, see thang true
Travelling this road my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can easily stated
It's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
To be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split

Creep with me
Through that immortal flow
Thug Passion got you trembling, like Death on the Row
Make your move
So I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowing up the scene
Like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a dub to get you flowing
And let that loc see smoke
Feeling the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

They say money don't make the man
But damn, I'm making money
Observing you motherfuckers
'Cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshitting
Licking them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Sipping on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winking at me
She smiles, a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlasting
""How does it feel?"" what I'm asking
While I'm rubbing on that ass
""Why you laughing?""
See, I'm digging as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip
When I be doing this
It's so physical
My attraction driven by alcohol
Beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said, so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blasting, bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin', but you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings, blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story
What proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come

They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials, sew up all the potential
Million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work I betta end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'

No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why
When we ride
Thug nigga 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches, ask me why
When we ride

It's the imperial serial killer
Alias Mussolini mentally unstable G status
So you can't see me drug warlord
Riding Concorde jets, Rag Vette's
Shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Inglewoods banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin up on these niggas easy
It ain't nuttin, 'cause if they wantin' somethin'
So I'mma commence to dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin, Thuggin
To my fuckin last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon while beefin'
With rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself
With all these backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin wealth

Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the Glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin

Live my life as a thug nigga, 'til the day I die (I know ya'll watchin')
Live my life as a boss player

Of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see

Give me my money in stacks
And lace my bitches with 9 figures
Real niggas fingers on nickle plated 9 triggas
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch them
While they coughed up and weeded
Open fire
Now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh
And test
And get your chest blown
Straight out the west, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like ho's
Open and shut like doors

I've seen money
But baby I got to gets mo'
You scream and go

Niggas Can't C Me

The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't C Me

Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Saying they can get with us
But picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be bumpin out the record store
As if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what ?
It ain't nothing but a party when we thug
And there I was
A young nigga with heart
Ain't had shit to loose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools
You know the rules
D-R-E you got me heated
My words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed
Alize and Hennesse
To my Thug niggas in lock down
Witness me

You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them Thug niggas have arrived and it's Judgement Day
Hey Homie if ya feel me

They ain't killed me
I can make a motherfucker shake
Rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor
Thug nigga
Quick to jab at them ho's
And I can make ya jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a niggas aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money
Then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm getten green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these ho's
And see how many I can go through
Look to the star

I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker
Because it's crazy after dark

Niggas Can't C Me",Can't C Me,1996
2Pac,"You find an MC like me who's strong
Leaving motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I get deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those
Who can withstand, the more power I gain
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck your brain
Imagine and keep on wishing upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstanding, faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
Breaking in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facing
We must be patient nothing better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waiting
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that ass shaking
I'm busting and making motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
But thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm activating your souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
You, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fucking rhyme I wrote
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat

I got my mind made up, come on (come on)
Get in get in too (get on it)
Let it ride (get wit it) tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in get in too
Let it ride tonight's the night

Well I come through with two packs
Of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fucking sac won't collapse
Cause nowadays, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifying like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfucking poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fucking bom-bay
Your got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly vibes spread through your head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blasting
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those asking
Opposed to laughing, raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killing
Why is that? 'cause smiling faces deceive
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
Your already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler, sticking up (Jews) with German (lugers)
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket blow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggas best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfucking mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and falling fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Hey yo, lyrical gas spitting the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless, the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust till every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out till your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit your fam' by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushing the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS the rebels)

2Pac,"Hey Suge
What I tell you, nigga
When I come out of jail, what was I gonna do
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right
Watch this
Hey Quik, let me get them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars
Yeah nigga, time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga 'cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik gonna show you niggas what it's like on this side
The real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize 'cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends
But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
'Cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1 It's an emergency cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar
Cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver, when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Eternally I live in sin until the moment that they let me breathe again

The hearts of men
The hearts of men

My lyrical verse was so much pain, to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode, I'm a homicidal outlaw
And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight, so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this til the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
First nigga getting drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no mutherfuckin' friends, nigga

Look inside the hearts of men
In the hearts of men
In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems, smoke 'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugging is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
Scar'd up, but still flowing
Energized and still going
Uh, can it be fate
That makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent, 'cause I've been sent

Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a hoe need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin' baby I love it when you flaunt it

You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Want some on lease? I'm makin' millions, niggas top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell

Got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me

Know there's dope being sold, but I ain't the one selling!
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from going under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by me bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shooting at your crib
Mama, I'm still thugging, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheming on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossing a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beating and my hands are swollen
Thinking of the G's I'll be holdin', picture me rollin'

Can you see me now? (Oh picture me rollin')
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin' (picture me rollin')

Ay, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got keys coming from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swanging
Make me wanna start back banging
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packing 40 Glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy coming from my enemies
While I'm sipping on Remy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 Big body, sitting on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facing is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm living a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine picture me rollin'!

Picture, picture me rollin'
Rollin', picture me rollin'
Wheelin', picture me rollin'

My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin' ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checking in the park, 'Pac

Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're going, she's making me come

Now that we made it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is begging for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinking you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggas doing time in the cell
I went from hell, to living well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on calling me
I'm floating free on the highway, formulating plans

Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb!
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go head
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm) (I ain't mad at cha)

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin', that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' n grindin' wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin, ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad, at cha (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha (A true down ass bitch, afund I ain't mad at cha)

Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb hopin' we make it, to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time,
You'll find a rhyme'll blaze you'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha

I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't mad (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at cha (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha (I ain't mad at cha)

2Pac,"There's gonna' be some stuff that your gonna' see 
That's gonna' make it hard to smile in the future 
(No Doubt) 
But whatever you see, through all the rain and pain 
You gotta keep a sense of humor 
Gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit 
Remember that 
Just keep ya head up 

Our lifesytles be close caption 
Addicted to fatal attraction 
Pictures and actions be played back 
In the mist of mashin' 
No fairytales for this young black male 
Some see me stranded in this land of Hell 
Jail and crack cells 
? culture 
Or the repercussion 
While bustin' on back-stabbing vultures 
Sellin' my soul 
For material wishes 
Fast cars and bitches 
Wishin' I live my life a legend 
Immortalized in pictures 
Why shed tears, save your sympathy 
My childhood years 
Was spend burying my peers in the cemetery 
Here's a message to the newborns 
Waiting to breath: 
""If you believe 
you can achieve, just look at me"" 
Against all odds 
Though life is hard, we carry on 
Living in the projects 
Broke with no lights on 
To all the G's that follow me 
Protect your essence 
Born with less but your still precious 
Just smile for me now 

Oh Won't you smile for me 
(Just smile for me now) 
Oh Won't you smile for me

Oh Won't you smile for me 
(And the next generation) 

Now as I open up my story 
With the blaze of your blunt 
So you can picture thoughts slowly 
Upon phrases I run 
And I can walk you through the dayz that it done 
I often wish that I can save everyone 
But I'm a dreamer 
Have you ever seen a nigga 
Who was strong in the game? 
Over-looking his tomorrows 
and they finally came 
Look back on childhood memories 
And I'm still feelin' the pain 
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade 
Dealin' Cocaine 
To many hassels in my local lights 
Survivin' the strain 
And a man without a focused life 
could drive him insane 
Stuck inside a getto fantasy 
Hopin' it'd change 
But we're not focused on reality 
We broken in Jane 
Had a dream of livin' wealthy 
Makin' it big 
Over football 
?
What take it 
He did 
And after all my mama's thankin' god 
For blessing her child 
All my mama gotz to do now is collect 
And then smile 
(2Pac: Smile) 

Oh Won't you smile for me 
(Just smile for me now) 
Oh Won't you smile for me

Oh Won't you smile for me

Fuck tha world 
As we unload, we witness furious speeds 
Un-answered questions keep us all stressin' 
Curious G's 
Back stabed and bleeding 
Crooked thoughs 
Laced with weed 
Learnin', duckin' stray shots 
Bullets be hot 
They burnin' 
Inhale the shurm smoke 
Visualize the flames 
Will I be smothered by my own pain? 
Strange wisdoms 
Cowards conversate' 
So quick to dis' us 
Takin' pictures for the Feds 
In desperate hopes they get us 
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries 
Forgive my stance 
Sense I entered many penitentiaries 
The best revenge 
Is fuck friends 
We milatary minded soljahs 
Bustin' shots blindly 
Trying to find Jahova 
To help me 
Somebody save me 
Lost and crazy 
Scared to drop a seed 
Hopin' I ain't cursed babies 
Maybe now 
Niggaz feel me now 
Picture my pain 
Embrace my words 
Make the world change 
And still I smile nigga

Man of many men's till the very end 
And blend in and change my iden

It's mind over matter 
I don't mind, you don't matter 
Pull a glock and watch the whole block scatter 
And we can have us a gak to gak talk 
Do it old style and do a back to back walk 
Count to ten and say goodbye to your friends 
And we can put the bull shit to an end

And he's a motherfucker ? calls a corner when I'm around 
Bodies are buried and found all around 
And parish and charish and thoughts just to be true

But I ain't goin' alive, so what the fuck these niggas come for
Just because you got a vest don't mean you escape from death (bitch)

Alright bwoy, drop that shit
Whassup man? Always listen to that shit?
That thug criminal shit? Peep game nigga, peep game, feel me

Travel through my mind am I blind it's a shame
Young niggaz gettin' murdered straight took out the game
As I sit here puffin on a cigarette
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin' on a niggaz death
These are the rough times, best to hurry up
And duck muh'fucker 'fore I buck mine
It's gettin' crazy and everybody's strapped
Surrounded by niggaz but nary a motherfucker down to watch my back

These are the bitch made niggaz, you been played nigga
While you starvin' and broke they pullin' six figures
Oooh, what can you do
When you can't trust your crew, time to bust out the wenty-two
Boo-yaow! Ran out of weed, so I'm sippin'
On this Hennesey, tell me, do you feel me?
Heyyy, I have no remorse
As I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh

[Chorus: ]

Thuggin' to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
I'm the first muh'fucker that can outrun a bullet
It's them thug life niggaz and we don't like tricks
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin' like bitches
Now my riches is gettin' hoes on it's own
Fuck a mystery, do you want to get with me, then let's bone
I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin' that spinach
and stayin' strong to the finish and then I ride out

See you on the freeway, sorry baby
But I gotta call my homey see what he say
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot everytime
And ain't no way I'ma let bitch made nigga worry me
Catch me slippin', empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice
Ain't no slippin' when you thug for life, motherfucker can you see?

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Never bow down, let these other bitches crawl
I'm a Thug motherfucker and these Thugs only ball
Ain't no half steppin' here, from the cradle to the grave
I'm a muhfuckin' fool, but I choose to get paid
Now my pockets gettin' empty, and I'm panicked in a fright
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin' tonight
Ain't nobody livin' safe, got a plot, and I'm stressin'
All I want, is my muh'fuckin' money, ain't no question
Don't try to stall little trick, cause we hit
So bring in the scissors and get to clippin' at his dick

I'd rather die young than die old and broke
That's why I stay drunk, and I constantly smoke
My memories as a youngsta, hangin' with the homies
But now I'm doin' bad and them bitches don't know me (Who? Who?)
But playa haters can't fade me (Why?)
Cause this is thug life nigga and we're crazy, tell me do you see?

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Yeah, constantly runnin' from danger
Ain't no stranger to cop cars
Gettin' arrested and tested wearin' a vest and don't drop my guards
My life is hectic, my homies send mail from jail
Niggaz in Hell got some horrible stories to tell
I'm catchin' cases and still tryin' to stack a grip
The IRS is tryin' to stress off a niggaz shit
A young nigga never had a prayer to prevail
And all my peers doin' years locked up in jail
What can I do, stay strapped, get a bigger crew
And creep around with them Dogg Pound niggaz too
And now we rich ain't no bitch than can touch us
And it's a trip, how we clown, when we fuck sluts
Bust nuts then I cut, that's my new thang
And motherfuckers got on do-rags

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Can I get paid, can I get paid, can I motherfuckin' get paid
Nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin' day and
Still never see a piece of it, you understand me?
It's not about the nice guy
It's 'bout the hardworkin' motherfuckin' Thug nigga
If you ain't a thug nigga, you ain't really doin' nothin'	
You ain't really makin' nothin'
These motherfuckin' po-po's and these pink folks
Got it all locked up for us to fail
See how they did O.J., and they doin' niggaz like that all day
So if you don't watch your motherfuckin' stack
Believe me, this could be your last breath...

Just looking back at the world from another level
Ya know what I mean? Starin'

Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped caring
Last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed
Now the little baby's crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
And we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend
I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview

I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinking I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashing till our dreams come through
Staring at the world through my rearview

Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, counting days in this living black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
Baby, let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

“Do dreams come true?”

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
Cause fiends hitting up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowing rules to these streets
Something I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosing my dough
So while you reminiscing all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm staring through your rearview

Hahahaha
You ain't knowing what we mean by staring through the rearview
So since you ain't knowing what we mean let me break down understanding
The world,  the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
And what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So now we looking at the world, from like, behind us
Niggas know what we gotta do
Just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggas do they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can

(Let's get it on) 
All you wack rappers hit the floor 

[Grand Puba]
I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do 
I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!"" 
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps 
and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody want to see 
but them youth don't trouble we 
because they fall victim to what they see hey! 
I keeps it +Reel to Reel+ like my last album title song 
but I understand it takes a year for niggaz to catch on
(hit em in the head dog) So let's get it on! yea 

[Notorious B.I.G.] 
Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to 
get wicked in the joint uh Notorious is glorious 
*cough, cough)*
Niggaz now who's the mind blower, the weed grower 
Have you seeing doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower 
B.I.G. top notch with the glock check your pockets 
and your sock it's just the way my pops taught me 
When you throw the drop check em thoroughly 
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight
Reminiscin on my swingin days 
when I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yea she had the Gucci boots I had Sarducci suits
Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin Bucktown
Mac-11 cocked back niggaz better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future.
But through whatever you see,
Through all the rain and the pain,
You gotta keep your sense of humor.
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit.
Remember that.
Mmm, yeah.
Keep ya head up.Yeah.
Verse One: 2Pac
Our lifestyles be close captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back
In the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
Protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now

[Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)]
Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smile (smile), smile for me
(What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile
(And the next generation)

[Scarface]
Now as I open up my story
With the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
Up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
But I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile

[Chorus]

[2Pac]
Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds
Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' 
Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
 
[Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outer space 
May the angels help to lead the way
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

2Pac,"M.A. Parks, C57797, you have a visitor 
Right there, stall three 
Hi baby. 
Wassup honey? 
Hey you know it's just only one more week until family visit. 
Yeah I'ma rock them drawers. 
A-heh. 
Yeah but you know did you take care of that bidness I asked you to do? 
I made those deposits. 
Okay that's cool you bring that shit? 
Yeah I got it. 
Aright see that guard over there? 
Mm-hm. 
When you get done just hand him the shit, he know wassup. 
Aright. Hey you know E just got cracked, he's in jail now. 
What? 
Yeah, Go-Go's out. I just saw him runnin' around the other day. 
Ah, fuck that fool. But anyway, what's happenin' with my moms? 
She gave me a message for you: 
She said she's sorry she couldn't be here today, but she'll be here next week. 
Aright well check this out, I got somethin' real important 
I want you to tell her 
C'mon c'mon this shit's over with. 
I'm not done talking to him! 
C'mon boy, back to your cell. 
Shut that shit up bitch! He's outta here, c'mon. 
Don't be callin' my woman no bitch! I'll fuck you up! 
Yeah yeah fool, what? Yeah yeah that's what they all say fool. 
You institutionalized, and this is your home... 

Guess who's back, and ready to knock off a cop or two 
'Cause me and the crew could still get our rocks off 
The penitentiary don't stop a nigga 'cause he's in jail 
Hell I'm makin' more money on the street from here in a cell 
I'm livin' proper, the coppers is havin' fits 
I just made the profit, you punks ain't stoppin' shit 
I still remember my momma told me 
Find the cop who killed your brother 
Send him to Hell lookin' homely 
'Cause a real nigga love the law 
What's raw is a nigga that's above the law 
Keep pressin' your luck and get fucked, huh 
Think a nigga don't know whassup 'cause he's locked up 
But in the meantime, it's get swoll get clean time 
Concentrate on gettin' green time 
And as the years go by, they forgot 
About the small time soldier from the block, huh 
To kill the crook they threw the book at me 
Don't worry be nappy, don't even look happy 
Put me in the hole, gave me cold cuts 
Did push-ups until I swoll' up 
And then they offer me a furlough 
But what they don't know as soon as I get free I'm killin' five mo' 
They asked me if I changed much 
I told em 'Yeah' even though I'm still the same nut 
They started askin my questions about my brother 
And makin' remarks about my mother, hmm 
Wait a minute, hold up 
makin' jokes about my folks'll get yours blown up 
They sent me back to the hole for what I told em 
I guess he didn't believe me, so I showed him 
He went home to find a tragedy 
Nigga, that's what you get for tryin' to badger me 
And anybody else that want to sweat me 
I'm already in jail so you punks can't get me 
You better pray they never see me 
'Cause if they let me free, prepare for trouble on the streets.

2Pac,"They finally did it (what's that?) 
They stole the mic I grip 
Now that it's gone (what's wrong?) 
I'm feelin tired and sick (How did they do it?) 
I don't know I wasn't sleepin that long 
When I woke up (what happened brother?) 
My microphone was gone 
At first i panicked (how?) I put the cops on the case 
But they were stuck (damm?) Without a clue or a trace 
So sure as smokin cigarettes is bad for your health 
If I want my microphone back I'll find it myself 
So I picked up the phone (for what?) 
I called Dizzy 

What's up? 
My mic is gone 

Word? 
Let's get busy 
Before I could tell Dizzy What I wanted to do 
He was over at my house with the TMS crew 
He said 

Word is out in every mouth 
In the street now that your mic is gone 
It's not long until your beat 
And then it hit me (Damm) 
I got a battle at six 
Without my microphone I'm guaranteed to get whipped 
You might think it's unbelievable but word to the strength 
when it comes to rockin' rhymes I'm a musical nymph 
They gave me other mics but yo it wasn't no use 
I tried to rock One two one two 
But I couldn't get loose I said forget it 
My microphone or not I gotta do it 
Give it all that I go (What if you loose?) It be the first time I lost 
But if I beat em I'll finally prove I'm the boss 
I grabbed my leather jacket Walked through the streets 
Suckers was hopin' and preyin' Strictly Dope would get beat 
I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight 
Yo I was confident that I'd win 
To hell with the mic 
I hopped up to the stage Dizzy started the beat 
suckers shivered cause he Tasted defeat 
Then I signalled to Dizzy Bust a rhyme off my head 
Perpetrator fell back (Huh?) And then he was dead 
I was happy as hell Cause I was lucky that night 
Put my hand in my pocket And there was my mic

2Pac,"I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter 'cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win 'cause he's my bestfriend
But now I'm guilty, I'm fallin' for his girlfriend

I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
It's like a trap that I'm sinking into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin' 'cause I'm thinking of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feeling comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel possesed by you
I have these thoughts at night of undressing you

It's kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't so he keeps on trusting me
Leaves me alone with you while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me with this temptation
Now I'm confused 'cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin' you sayin' to comeover
Now what do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
It's gettin' rougher 'cause I suffer from a burnin' heart

My burnin' heart

Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel and now you wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby, did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken and now you make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love and now we are departed
Girl, I buy you anything your heart desires
I have to let you know, baby, you're my fire

Warm and wet each kiss is prolonged
This sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just being with you and seeing the two of us
Walking along the beach 'cause, girl, you are my peach
So sweet and tender my love I surrender
No need to pretend that you want it to end
I'll never let you go you're forever my girl
You know why? 'Cause girl, you are my world

My burnin' heart

Totally tongue tied every two seconds I keep watching you
He's my best friend but I can't help clockin' you
How could this be, how could we both love you?
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reenforce upon the sores that's already there
So many times my mind was locked up and we passionately stare

Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction 'cause I fiend for you desperatley
I stand here fantasicing because you're next to me
What can I do with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind and so I'm feelin' nervous

I wanna tell you how I feel but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though it drives me crazy to see you sitting with him
A tear rolls down my cheak because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're saying before they can be said
Hear the thoughts you be thinkin' before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brotha for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl

My burnin' heart, heart, heart

My heart is burnin' you know it's yearin' for your sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy as you kiss and rub my chest
You know you love me why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you yet you want somebody else
It's not that well then girl what could it be
I hope I'm good for you 'cause baby, you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then acted fool and cool and cruel like a church

Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby, you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you 'cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire

My burnin' heart

I lay awake tonight because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya the feeling gets stronger
You sit a bit closer we stare a lot longer

Try to beat me at this game you gettin stomped like an ant

Upset to get to me sweatin me for the rhymes that I write

You could shoot it at me and I wouldn't get harmed

Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free

Running silly through the court) They don't really wanna start

These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime) 
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting

Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey

What's up with bitches trying to screw me?

Is it the demons screaming inside of me?

Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin' Hennesey, smokin' weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Ooh wee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
lookin' dumb, 'cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
Straight grindin', everybody havin' fun
And it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
'Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and,
He's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin' I just hope he get 'em, I got nothin' but love

I'm down for yours, nothin' but love
Ain't got nothin' but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nothin' but love

I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
And pay respect to the place that I came from
'Cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin' double dutch
Still blush, 'cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
'Cause I know they got love for me, nothin' but love

Ain't got nothin' but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nothin' but love

When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
'Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin' crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me, ""That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tried to make my way legit, ha ha
But it was hard, 'cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
'Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nothin' but love

Ain't got nothin' but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nothin' but love

No matter how you try niggas never die 
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply 
See me striking down the block hittin' co'ners 
Mobbin' like a motherfucka' livin' like I want to 
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways 
Thug Life muthafucka crime pays 
Let the cops put they lights on 
Chase me niggas
Zig-zaggin' through the freeway 
Race me nigga 
In a high speed chase with the law 
The realest muthafucka that you ever saw 
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me 
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die 
And you could walk a mile in my shoes 
And you'd be crazy too 

I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose 

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate 
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away 
I'm startin' to lose hope 
It seems everybody's on dope 
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke 
Sometimes I choke on the indo 
Peepin' out the window alone on my own 
I'm a criminal 
Got no love from the household I'm out cold 
In the streets give me motherfuckin' peace 
I got nothing to lose 
And something to prove 
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true 
I wonder when they kill me 
Is there a Heaven for a real G 
Lord forgive me if you feel me 
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke 
With no hope lil' skinny muthafucka wantin' dough 
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid 
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city 
No pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time 
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too 
With nothing to lose 

I got nothing to lose (That's why I got gang related) 
Got nothing to lose

Now up and at em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real

All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin, I'm all in
Shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it

What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
come and save me (save me) had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
he need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my niggas on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace niggas with the game
want to see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear

Just as well, cause my life on the streets, a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, ""Baby it's on""
And now I'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin cheese

Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness 
I rob my adversaries, but Slick done left a witness 
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this n**** snitch 

Should I shoot his b****, or make the n**** rich? 
Don't want to commit murder, but damn they got me trapped 
Hawkin' while I'm walkin', and talkin' behind my back 
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this s*** to win it 

'Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it 
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me 
Too f***in trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me 
N****z gettin' jealous (jealous) tryin' to find my stash 

Whip out the nine, now I'm a dive and pump your a** 
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk 
Snatched him like a b****, and threw him in the trunk 
The punk thought I was bluffin', but swear I'm nothin nice 

Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics 
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane 
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain 
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen

Where they find me? 16 on Death Row 
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me 
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family 

My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that 
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back 
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger 
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger 

The brother in my set, is 16 is wet 
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin 
Hell 
I shouldn't a let him catch me 

Instead of livin' sad in jail I could a died free and happy 
And my cellmate's raped on the norm 
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his a**hole gettin' torn 
They made me an animal 

Can't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, n****z countin' cannibals 
And that's how it is in the pen 
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend 
My mama prayed for me 

Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?) 
'Cause when they come for me they find a struggler 
To the death I take the breath from your jugular 
The trick is to never lose hope 
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row

Dear mama, they sentenced me to death 
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath 

I'm bitter cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen 
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16 
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a s*** 
And they too quick to say goodbye to me 

They tell me the preacher's there for me 
He's a crook with a book, that motherf***er never cared for me 
He's only here to be sure 
I don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin' 

On the poor, and how can these people judge me? 
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me 
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan 
To keep a n**** in the state pen 

And to my homies out buryin motherf***ers 
Steer clear of these Aryan motherf***ers 
'Cause once they got you locked up 
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot 

I'm convinced self-defense is the way 
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day

Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

And when I saw it on the news I see busta' girl killin' 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin' f*** the world, in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my s*** drop
Thug Life motherf***er I lick shots
Every n**** on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a n**** be strapped, f***ed up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, Thug n****
Stressin' like a motherf***in' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now

Yeah it's gonna be alright, don't trip baby
It'll get better

Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start 
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong 
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on

Hold on, be strong, hold on

There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on

Hold on, be strong, hold on

2Pac,"Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin Hennesey, smokin weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody want to dance when the slow jam come
Lookin dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin, everybody havin fun
And it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and..
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love
*chorus*
[singers] Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
 [2Pac] I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
(repeat 4X)
I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin, his breath still stinkin
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin stick ball, quick why'all
Get out the street before they hit why'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love
*chorus*
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me, ""That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love

Tell me, which one?

They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately 'cause I'm guilty

Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless, I'm chokin' off
Marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high

Don't mention funerals I'm stressin', and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' 'bout them n****z that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money

Where am I goin' I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday b****, you know you shouldn't-a did it

Everybody's dyin' am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin', two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin' blood on my satin' sheets

Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin' suspicious
Of this b**** the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone

After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a n**** played her
The b**** is tellin' all her homies, that I can f*** her
Like no other now them other b****es wanna bone me

I'm under pressure gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherf***ers pa**

By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
N****z don't like me 'cause I'm Thuggin', and everyday
I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid

They wanna bury me, I'm worried, no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin' homies, ain't that a b****
When I was rich I had clout, now a n****'s lonely

I put the pistol to my head and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost 'cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a n**** dies lonely

Nowhere to run I'm in terror and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day

So I stay Thuggin' with a pa**ion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherf***ers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound, well Hell
Can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now

Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
See motherf***ers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherf***in' mack
I love it 'cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now, you motherf***ers don't know me

Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated

I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka' screaming like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide

No school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned

And jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't paying
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playing (biotch)

(Brenda's got a baby)

I hear Brenda's got a baby
But Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
The girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem; that's up to Brenda's family)
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms and her dad was a junkie
Went in debt to his arms; it's sad
'Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But, oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now a spot to joy in
She tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's having a baby
In love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with the two of them are together, whatever
He left her, and she had the baby solo; she had it on the bathroom floor
And didn't know so; she didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize
How much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling
Brenda wants to run away
Mama say, ""You makin' me lose pay.""
The social worker's here everyday
Now Brenda's got to make her own way
Can't go to her family: they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter; she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So, now, what's next?
It ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby

Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up",Do for Love [Album Version],1998

Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snitches
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash

Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'

I see you starin' like you want it
Well baby, if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me

I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho
You think it's all about you? Well boo
I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold digging, cold digging a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia

It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you'se a groupie baby and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes that you nuthin' but a trick
Hangin' with us for some superstar dick

She know what's crackin, free shows like loot
From limos down to the Lexus Coup

I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""
Well hey, well that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive.

And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the blacks givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same

When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And running from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whooping to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was looking for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hanging
I needed money of my own so I started slanging
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you coming home after work late
You're in the kitchen trying to fix us a hot plate
Ya just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady
Don't ya know we love ya? Sweet lady
And dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't ya know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know it makes me unhappy (What's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
It ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to kno' why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with

Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin'' in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ah, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin' visions
Of leavin'' here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin' blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin'' well

My life is in denial, and when I die,
Baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears

I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothin'' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin'' me, in my sleep
Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Lord knows I, tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more

All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was

Give em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like

I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

A lotta people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'

Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlaws motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block
Without my my heat or Glock got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me and lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullet
All you niggas die

Troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome (all you niggas die)
We troublesome

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, better bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck, all ya'll niggas"" in Swahili
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drivebys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
'Cause I'm troublesome

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless
I live the thug Life, losin' my focus baby (all you niggas die)
I'm troublesome
Bad Boy killa
There is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw (all you niggas die)
Outlaw!

Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen 'cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me 'cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell 'cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nuthin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me

I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love

Come listen to my truest thoughts
My truest feelings all my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes, before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try, maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare
Shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fighting and the hurting
In my room crying 'cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me

Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation
If could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin' out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days

A damn shame

(That's not her problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects the whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a junkie

Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation

Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family

Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly is gettin' bigger

But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, who's sexed and crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever

And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together, whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and what ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heap

I guess she thought she'd get away wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha baby's in tha trash heap balling

Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way

Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
Know what's next, there ain't nothin' left ta sell

So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slang, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
'Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?
I get around

Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go

Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go
Round and round, round we go

2Pac,"Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'Cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""
Well hey, well that's the way it is

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive.

And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
So the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the blacks givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

That's just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's just the way it is
Aww yeah

troublesome 19-motherfuckin-96 (Westside!)
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
These Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Outlaw motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eater
What could they do to me you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
'Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on first niggas
Knew we came for murder, pullin up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck, all ya'll niggas"" in Swahili
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drivebys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died;
'Cause I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus ba-baby
I'm troublesome
Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw was the rough rugged and raw - Outlaw!

Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep; I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God to forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nuttin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life;
I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lah
Bye bye, bye bye

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Ha ha, I'm troublesome

Young rugged and sick

Ghetto niggaz remain violent all the killers remain silent
Niggaz strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all rome'
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggaz do their struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin'
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makin' music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggaz make it out the neighborhood and won't circle
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggaz

And me and you selling fucking tapes in the bahamas

Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
Real ghetto niggaz can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggaz off from new orleans to california

Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night, in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch or ho'
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

Happy, home
(Let's turn this house into a happy home)
Happy, home
(Finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
Happy, home
(Turn this house into a happy home)
Happy, home

Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home

Happy, home
(Turn this house into a happy home)
Happy, home
(Finally got to live the good life inside a happy home)
Happy, home
(Turn this house into a happy home)

(Happy home)

All these problems got me goin'
We got a family, of our own
I just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home

Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' ta turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops on the milk box missin'
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight
Why I am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die

And still I'm havin' memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushin' the gas when my glocks blast
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin' to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me so what can I do
But stay true, sippin' 22's a brewin'now the medias tryin'
To test me got the press askin' questions, tryin' to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind's state
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate
Ma main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed, ""Thug Life"" and emptied a clip
Gots tired of runnin' from the police

You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead

Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me

Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change

So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen

You kept it true, helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun

Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja

Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analyze these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we manage

Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged
They hate, how come

Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids

They growin' hopeless
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pass

Time move quicker
No time for wastin'
Put your hustle down my young dealers
'Cause the end is nearer

But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers
Ain't ridin' 4 3 felonys
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize

Capitolize, mobilize
We in the war why'all
It's for all why'all
My family to the ones that stand me

Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity

That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does

But if you don't
Man, we sho' to be done
And we'll all see exactly why the good die young
Does anybody have an answer why

It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why

I send this out for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the former fallen soldiers
That's in the cemeteries buried

Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breathe you breathe

Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say

I'll catch ya at the crossroads

Get on yo' knees and pray

Huh, increase the doses, busting whoever closest
Thug living, hell or prison, never losing my focus
I'm making money moves mandatory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture niggas we rushing and still busting
Til the cops come running, duck in abandoned buildings
Ditching my gun, homeboy the motherfucking villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, why plant seeds
In a dirty bitch, waiting to trick me, not the life for me
Living carefree, til I'm buried, and if they dare me
I'm busting on niggas until they scurry, I'm clearly
A man of military means in my artillery
Watching over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Selling dope to all the fiends, at times I want to cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowing if this game'll last, feeling ashamed
Of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I selling my soul?
Got tired of small time livin, niggas telling me no
I got mine! Fuck them other suckers! That's the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz, make it hell for us

Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, being broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay struggling and juggling with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? ?, lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears, and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slipping, you soft niggas is outta here
In case you forgot, we on the same shit that got us here

Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block ducking charges, nigga fuck the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missing dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell no, dead blocks with red tops but now a nigga sell words
For all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as fuck son
Dying luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slanging cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler

Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let em play me for a buster, make it hell for a hustler

No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef til I burn
Sensimilla bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
Niggas shaking like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they coming for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? Getting blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walking close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for busters
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler

Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way

Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep

Nigga it's a goddamn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked

Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious

Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all links in the chain, tryin' to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yours, we'll bring these muthafuckas war

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggas so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit' it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get it
See me and pray for options
But the pressures nonstop
Niggas get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggas wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas pass the clip and watch me bring em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for (What you got?)
I got the Secretz of War

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us

It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Down wit' no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds (Here we go)
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his muthafuckin' head off
Signal all the other Outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streets is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass pre-style grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm laid cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Y'all, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us

It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
Yo, we go to war

We check the murder rate percentage
Niggas is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
You got some heat? Pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference here, with the 25 to life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like algae, niggas be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blase me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggas like Rodney
Turn a killa' like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
We go to war

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggas

Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin'
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?

2Pac,"Dear Lord
As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

Somebody break me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin' to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, ""Keep it real G""
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

I stay sharp as always
Runnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though, be placin' triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin' for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin' bags
We out for power, makin' cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin'
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin' somethin' the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down
clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin' time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops

In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise, and still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)

Never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride

I live my life to fuckin mo', exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell bound, but we got to eat

The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin' tattooed tears
Like Gram' Sammy, we feudin' for the whole damn family

Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller

Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye

It's been years of stugglin', guzzlin' beers
Beefin' and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talkin to the heavens
Walkin' through the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, startin' with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm through with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain

It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
(Throw it up fool, hey nigga, haha)
Tell me how you feel homey
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crasy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentiary bound)
(Now introducin' Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin' for Precious) What?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein' visions of people smokin' and niggas catchin' vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we'll call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin'
(They call the squad, hittin' blocks with they guns blowin')
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin', so they kept goin
Catchin' dealers comin' out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them niggas died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
To death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin' dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus

Teardrops and closed caskets!
Will I, forever be alone

(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(Was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)

Hopin' God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin' he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin' dough
She's slippin' in secret places and gettin' with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin'
Lil' Trigga's gettin' pictures of the both of 'em walkin'
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disappear with another man
(And his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin'
Just the smoke from the cap peelin' a man with no feelings

Now with the problems of poverty
And the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
How many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
(They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know)
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out

Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin' plans on gettin' bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin' down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin' Ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin' me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg)

Teardrops and closed caskets
We dedicate this to all the fallen comrades (that's right)
All the homies that didn't make it to see this day (rest in peace)

With teardrops and closed caskets
It's like that's all we got to look forward to these days
Murders, brothers dyin, funerals

Shit, it's like I done ran out of suits homey
I done ran out of tears
Know we gon' have to do somethin y'all
We gon' have to do somethin
Will I, forever be alone
'Cause I know all these mothers is tired of seein the same thing (rest in peace)
Teardrops and closed caskets
I send this out to M'thulu Geronimo
And to, all the fallen comrades, all the soldiers
Will I, forever be alone (to the homey Boonie, rest in peace nigga)
All the homies that fell, all the homies
May God bless your families
May you always live in the motherfuckin' heart
Will I, forever be alone
In a thug niggas heart forever (that's right)

Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes

Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate thug niggas

We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall
'Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us

Now I been trapped down 
And fucked since day one
This instructional style of mine ain't no fun
Where I'm from

You sure to see about 10 niggas in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life 

Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical

Then one of them sat down living so 
Mystikal and impious
With a heart full of anger it's so ridiculous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute

With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?

I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the dick to your wife 
And I'm the Jesus of your Christ
You dig that? respect this

I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me? 

We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that ecstasy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed

I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This lunacy then with me, then with chemistry

Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me

We will never fall
Through the war, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers

When we was kids, the loving felt good
But of course have the respect
Though it's even better
Now for this cheddar

Niggas is laying deader 
Then Malcom and Martin put together
Oh Lord only knows where we'll end up
Remember what 'Pac said

Watch the fuckin' signs
But we wasn't listening
Too busy trippin' off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz

Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro 
May we all roll
And if you don't know 
We got the rap game petro

Scared cause we bout to release 
Like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground 
We running the ghettos

Stealing all of ya fan base like we klepto's
Bitch I can't let go
I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
And niggas is stealing my shit 

And busting it wrong
Hot shots holla back when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin' back at the system
Military wisdom

Preparing myself for Armageddon
Breaking my balls at this game
Knowing it's a dead end
And my only weapon 

Is my believe that I'm superior
Yeah we the muthafuckas 
That you niggas is leery off
Controlling my steam

Knowing my team to deserve more
Fuck the re-frame
Stick to the game and earn more
Holding my head, rolling the head with focus

Laughing inside
'Cause deep inside y'all don't know us

We will never fall
Through it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
'Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all don't know us, y'all don't know us

Hey man so far I've been listenin' to your album
And I ain't heard nothin' you could kick back and smoke a beadie to
You know?

Yeah like that
Some of that mellow s***
Some of that s*** that make b****es drink
Make n****s think
And help you check a fat-a** bank, 
So why don't you kick some of that s***, n**** only you know how
Ha feel me?

I'm barely standin, and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this b****, I let my balls hang
Runnin' through the street lights, 'cause we like, yo n****
Get your mobb on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
N****s poppin, welcome to our casino, 'cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin' for a b**** that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tongue-kissing on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your n****
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love f***in' b****es in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right

You can f*** on the first night, or try, in the late night

Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
Ain't nothin' like bein' a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin' that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
Was poppin' like like c***ed Glocks with hollow-tip rounds

From booty calls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin'
If I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin' to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, n****s gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the Gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

The life of a California star, and when you see me
In the drop-top Jag', how many n****s wanna be me?
Game is automatic, mandatory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb b****es
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissing
It's a mean world n**** you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my n****s up in Clentin gettin' weeded

2Pac,"Let us pray
Heavenly Father
Hear a n**** down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me, who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?

I see mothers in black cryin', brothers in packs dyin'
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why?
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God 'cause we livin' in sin

I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car pa**ed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin' bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin' for

Is it the miniature caskets, little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us

Perhaps the underlyin' fact stay high explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear? Reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer

Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in

Before I'm leavin'
I'm askin'' the grievin', who do you believe in?

Can't close my eyes 'cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
'Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddeon, murder in ma** amounts

In this society where only gettin' the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven

And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin' if I'm worthy
Livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me

So I'm askin', before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the s*** you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change? I'm askin'

Who do you believe in?

And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin' down camp, still mashin'

Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck

With a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
If you don't stay wise, then in this game you f***ed
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin', diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
'Cause he just came home off of bail

Now tell me
Who do you believe in?

Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah, or Allah?
Is it Jesus, is it God or is just yourself?
Definitely not to be imposed, being a demon

Because this is the joy of believing
Men, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true

From the soul, of the man, for truth never has an alibi

That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand, that every man, is his own man

Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man

Me and my homies tho
You know we kick it like everyday
Me and my homies, kick it like everyday

[Nate Dogg]
But I'm alone in my room
And I don't have no one to talk to
I catch a girl with my phone
And cause some folks who know what I go through
After I smoke a joint, come on
To keep my temper low
I parlay with my friends
There's really no where else to go

[Chorus: x2]

[2 Pac]
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Rather be buried, then see us party
Keep it close to my heart
Cause we the ones that got the shit started
You recollect, we used to bust on snithces
Nobody come before my niggas, fuck all y'all bitches
All my homeboys are self sufficient
So be suspicious of your scandalous tricks
Got the police taking our pictures
Love to hang out on the corner but we known to ride
Me and my motherfucking homeboys down to die
For each other, cause we closer than brothers
Its like you came in, no forgetting the party popping
When my squad walks in
Throw up your hands baby buy me a drink, stop acting phony
Don't forget to bring something for all my homies
To know me is to love a thug nigga to the fullest, ducking bullets,
Snatching guns when these trick niggas pull it
Handle my business like a professional, the whole world knows me
But I ain't shit without my fucking homies
Me and my fucking homies

(Me and my homies)
Constantly we mash
(Me and my homies)
Gotta make that cash

There's no need to ask

Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?

Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed ""thug life"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police

So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too

Why you lookin' sad, should'a though about it 
Say you learn, i truly doubt it 
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love 
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club 
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Don Perione (spellin?) 
Knowin' I'm a cash dealer, still I, remain calm 
Let you chill with me 
Plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me 
That's what you get for trynna dick me

Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it 
See us, toungkissin', you was trouly with it 
Little Exstacy, Hennesey, mix with me 
Picture me pray for pussy when the dick's for free 
Hey now, where my niggaz at? Tell these hoes 
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses 
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet 
Pointin' at the places that you want me to hit 
Give me room all up in the room, call the cops

This dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
And you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
But for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
This world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us

It's for ya entertainment but it's my life why all
And I can't rewind, fast forward, or press pause

Why'know, when I was younger I prayed, to get in this game
Why'know to hold dis microphone in my hand
I asked the man upstairs, to let me rock a crowd one day
Why'know let people out there feel the way I feel through my music
Like my homeboy Tupac did fo' sho'
And he gave that to me
But he didn't he didn't he didn't let me know
About all the shady shit that's in, in between
You and yo' dream, why'know?
See it's more than the music, I spit it from the heart
So sometime it's cold n it's dark, but it's raw
And that's how I'ma bring it to you every time, why'know?",Starry Night,2000
2Pac,"Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 

First it was nothin', not even, a fake ? 
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along 
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes 
Thought I'd never feel this way again 
And you were supposed to reach my heart 
And find love within, love, love 
Oooh...oooh 

Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
Love within a storm 
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love 
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me 
Wonderful 

I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near 
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly disappeared 
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend 
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again 

Fall in love again, in a storm 
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses) 

Just when I thought I'd seen it all 
Our paths crossed, amen 
And I knew, from the first glance 
That you, would be hard to forget 
Your eyes, attracted me first 
But you reeked of sultry confidence 
I couldn't wait, to touch lips 
And kiss, with my heart's intention 
When we didn't, was what I expected 
And for that moment, we erased the tension 
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters 
And the initial blind date, first impressions 
We kissed again; and I felt the passion 
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin' 

We made love, within a storm 
In the midst of passion and chaos 
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost 
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder 
Those who prevail this drama 
Will learn to bring their love farther 
But now, the storm has past 
And the seas of our friendship are gone 
But as long as I live, I will remember 
The love within a storm 

(Love within a storm is repeated after every line) 
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love 
Ya know that I miss you, and love you 
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart 
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice 
They say, this ghetto fabulous 
On 125th street forkin' around 
This village, and the village uptown 
South Central, Compton, Philly 
Sha-Town, Southside 
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta

My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me 
This open, rich city 
Ya know, I got love for you",Thug Blues,2000

I cannot bear activity
Where my couch, I am told, ""Hold no significance""
I waited and died in ignorance
But my inner eye can see, erase
Who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were reached from fall
And every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people

War was gone because all was at peace
But now like a nightmare, I woke to see
That I live like a prisoner of poverty

Please, wake me when I am free

So much pain

All my, niggas.. so much pain
Uh, huh, yeah
Yeah, so, much

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggas time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga, you know the game
Smokin' weed, fuckin' hoes, slangin' things, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do? I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck 'cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep, drinkin' Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of strugglin' all my life
Runnin' wild as a kid, grew up blazin' 'em right
I'm in a, little cell I call my soul lately
It's been a, givin' me hell and my heart is screamin', ""Don't enter""
I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin' to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your ""7 Day Theory""
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggas wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin', sendin' shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in, keep us hustlin' nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin' crime excited my mind and leadin' the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
For gettin' fucked up and blastin', we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

They got me mobbin' like I'm, loc'd and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me
Trust, I got my glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a, passion
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin' when I'm, blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?
Cause the stress gettin' major
A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin' on the streets
And I be, ballin' loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckers 'til you buried
I was born to raise, hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother
I'm tough, I'm kicki'n dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me

2Pac,"Machiavelli, I'm in the studio drunk then a motherfucker
Ready to freestyle this shit and do it wild,
Live, for all my dogs, for all my dogs out there raising hell, 
Just to see ya young nigga, raise the bail
Stepped out on the streets, fresh from jail, 
All the police want to rag and tell, 
Not knowing that I stacks my mail, 
All these niggas want to see me fail.. 
That's just the intro, as I sit back and rock this instrumental... 

After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure it's pain, 
Even though we broke for the moment, we ballin' the game,
Time to make yo mind military, be prepared for the busters, 
Similar to bitches too scary and too near me be rushing,
Visions of over-packed prisons, 
Feigns and niggas thug livin', 
Pressures and 3 Strikes, hope they don't tell us,
They call it heater, ammunition at grace, 
Move without a sound, let me slide down, pistols in place,
They got me feignin' for currency, the money it goes, 
It's like I'm a, dreamin' senior season me ballin,
Official hated, and my enemies be hated, got the cops .4-5 stanchin' niggas pagers,
Laid with a mark, soon as we start, but it's hard to quit, 
Started out drinkin' 40's, the hardest shit,
God Damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man, 
Nigga got my own plan, in my hand,
Got the .45, I get it live to survive, make these niggas die, 
While gettin' high though we cry,
When these thugs bud, niggas'll leave in they casket, 
That's what you get for being player hatin' bastards,
 
Me and my click so legit, we keep a 50 on us, 
These niggas know, you can't touch us,
When they get to come against us, these niggas be defenseless and senseless, 
Knockin' niggas back on the fence,
My whole click be sick, and though we rip whole crews, 
Niggas knew we came through drinkin' 22's of brew, 
And though we drink Hennessy, we provide our enemies with mo' shit, 
Though all the world so legit,
I read my name out, Makaveli with the Thug Life tatted on the bottom of my belly, 
Can these niggas understand this, my whole family is sick and so Scandalouz... 
Let's introduce my click, Kastro, when he blast y'all niggas run to hide, 
Napoleon will provide the game, 
Let me explain while Edi provide shit for the needy and take from the greedy,
Khadafi, he's not sloppy and not a copy, he's the only one bring a gun, if you want it,
Young Noble bring the soul to the troop, let 'em know we come through in a bucket of BMW's,
We trouble you, the ""W"" for West Side, niggas die when they try to infiltrate my crew,
We never hide, we ride, and die together, 
And when you see my click we always ride forever,
Me, my whole click is sick, we smoke sisamy, can you convince the G, 
That they can come against me

You can't see me on TV or live, niggas die when they try to come against me,
Never hide, in my own zone in my own dome, 
In my mind I'm a Don, niggas knew it once, 
I came all out, splashed on niggas, will I dash on niggas, 
Once I mash these niggas, I'll be badder nigga,
It's me, Machiavelli, a.k.a The Don of this whole click, 
Nigga you's slow sick,
That's my freestyle drunk and slow, 
Just so you bitch ass niggas in the back row now,
Weather it's New York or Texas, 
Ride through in a Lexus, 
A BMW, I trouble you, 
So and forever this Big 'ol ""W""
Hu-hu-hu, my Double are cruise, I'm a big rap star, 
Rockin' the grooves, niggas where ya at,
Where you are is the back, in the front when you park this shit, 
I keep a gat inside my trunk legit, 
Always, and though I'm on probation I still rock the nation, 
Out on bail, 
Though last year I was in jail, 
Raise hell, until I get my mail, 
Will I fail?

Hell naw nigga bite my nails,
I keep a manicure, though you panic, 
You're still gone die 
When Pac get high,
Smokin' Indo, I roll my window down, 
A smooth criminal, and though I pack this pound, 
.3-5-7, .0-4-5, will I hide?
Will I die?
Will I ride? 
Niggas never know why,
My whole crew, a family click, 
Always sick, 
Are we live though we struggle to survive in this motherfucker,
9-5 turn to 9-6, 9-6 turn to 9-7, I keep a .3-5-7 Mac 11,
Back home I got a M-O, what I say, a Mini 14, ha ha,
My Double are, ride with my crew, ride with my crew, 
You don't have a clue nigga when we comin' for you,
We hit the House of Blues actin' like fools, my nigga Fatal, 
Put a gun inside a club, I keep his fuckin' pre-nadle, 
Had to bang inside a chest, now I, bang as Veli, no-no-no, 
With Machiavelli I told him don't bring that gas out of Veli,
I said yo Fatal are you crazy, nigga pissin' all side in the front, 
Niggas said god damn them niggas is funny as hell,

What you want? You want the pump?
Hell no them niggas don't want no beef, 
That's why we left that motherfucker in a Rose, 
A Limo I mean, well pick this out, to me, 
I was sittin' in the back, then on some hits, 
I did a dope as show, them niggas will always remember me,
Came from India, Felizimo, was the call, yeah nigga I got Vasache on, 
On mighty all them niggas want to fuck with me, y'all know,
I always represent my people to the fullest,

Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky

I came to a field, catchin cases, litigation
Niggaz playa-hatin, got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw my WESTSIDE, ain't no thang

We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific

Was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug
Just westcoast what? To my real niggaz stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin cool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door

Catch me, I'm fallin' out flat, yo, I'm ruinin'
Breathin' is suicant, no one give a fuck about me
I leaned to like it like that, when I was still wit' mommy
Besides a seed that the devil run from
In the belly of the beats, that's where the fuck we come from
And still breathin'

And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost 2 of my closes, man, one of why'all can take this
But, I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number 1 muthafucka, bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it, you hoes can't ruin it
2 million everytime he drop, I know you fuckas losin' it
We movin' in for the kill, for a mill
We holdin' the steel, hold the wheel
I'm bout to give these niggaz somethin they can feel
Fakin' real, but we the raw on the cut
Style-bitin' THUGLINE niggaz give it up
We Hit 'Em Up

And we still breathin'
And we still breathin'
And we still breathin'

We'll be the last muthafucka breathin'

Stress, and busta free, enemies give me reason
To be the last muthafucka breathin'
Bust, my automatic rounds catch em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last muthafucka breathin'

2Pac,"Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hahaha)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships (hey, excuse me, excuse me) y'know? (Look)

We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
'Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship 
'Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek, we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't 'bout talkin' 'bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin' (How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?)
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality (How do I plead?)
Armed with missiles guns grenades (Yes sir, how do you plead?)
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin' (Shit, you know how I plead, c'mon! Psssh)

Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' 'bout, ""Where is the Quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed ""Nigga motherfucker""
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, repossessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission with a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'

2Pac,"Niggas, fucking with the wrong nigga

My seductive introduction be specific, still elusive
But exclusive's what I give you when I kick it, and I'm still lifted
Niggas can't get with Mr. Wicked
Picture me flipping my adversaries, gettin' the dick swiftly
Niggas are swinging wild, but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch but you whole click'll still get treated shitty
Business never personal I'm up before the sun come up I'm tired
Just a ghetto star, a drop top double-R is what I'm ridin'
Nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring yo' artillery when you come for me, ‘cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast, ‘cause Syke was bustin'
Plus, Bo had 'em duckin', screamin', ""Get they cash!""
So now I got the law on me
My phone's tapped so I had to send word through my lil' homies
Tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger
Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin' with the wrong nigga

This is what you get
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Yeah, nigga, peep it

Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray and thank the Lord
For givin' me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful, man, but still when niggas come for me
All I can see is gettin' 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peeled
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give him the MAC and make him spray hisself, hey
Fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
Puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in heaven
Why call in shots? Nobody really as clear as me
Ain't tryin' to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder, my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death, so my true niggas show me love
God, forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
You know?

It's like, why you fuckin' with the wrong nigga?

I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise, but they tried me
I guess they all had to die, ‘cause we tried peace
I die in these streets
Blast 'til they recognize
Still do or die, all my niggas gettin' high, watchin' time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride, so they can't stop it
Then keep it poppin', lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch, and now this new shit, gon', fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some back-up
For lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
""Buck buck"" was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
Should've never fucked around, buster
How you figure makin' moves on the wrong nigga

2Pac,"I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' ""Fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life, maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water

No one knows what the, future holds, for you
Haha, listen closely
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
After livin' so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world

Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise

Uh ha, We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

I spend my days and nights not knowin' if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
Bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
We still tryin' to get a hold of the game

Nigga, I hear even the smaller G's be dippin' Chevy Impalas
While flossin' they gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We swallow tomorrow see, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em bleed tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin' wine, hit grass
'til I be starin watch the parents sacrifice they child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents, now dos for dose
Keep yo' friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin' to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw yo' hands in the air, it's a robbery

Let's go see what our enemies talkin bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
This ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know!

And half the times we be actin' up call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

Take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, till the end of time
Take these broken wings

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all night, money making got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo, ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo

For quiet times disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homey had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sex his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

Take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, till the end of time

Take these broken wings
You gotta learn to fly and learn to live so free
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, till the end of time
Take these broken wings

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate but death row full of demonstrators
And in the end drinkin' Hennessey made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breath
While beggin' me to keep the peace

What I can see closer to achieve
In times of danger don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin' to make a G
Remember me, as an outcast outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about more
Gettin' raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

Take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, till the end of time

Take these broken wings
You gotta learn to fly and learn to live so free
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, till the end of time
Till the end of time

Until the end of time
I can fly, I can fly, I can fly",Until the End of Time,2001

Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?

I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggas gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
It was hip-hop until Tupac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
Have me catchin cases all across the nation
I went to jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin' three strikes, and we might
Just blast God bless the child that can get cash
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned
Talk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag
Like the Mack make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back pay

Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? 
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat

2Pac,"Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..

The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob n****z love to act up
The first to bomb we rob n****z
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
N****z get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty gla** of Hennesey
Talkin to a n**** on a tight leash
Screamin ""F*** the police,"" as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin n**** unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life I will be (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead (close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin (close your eyes)

Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a b****, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder, than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life I will be (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead (close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the n****z came out boom!
Who want to see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin n****z in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my n****z facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death n****
Take a breath come be the last one left n****, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life I will be (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead (close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win (this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

This go out to Cato, Mental
All the n****z that pa**ed away
To Geronimo ? all the down a** riders
All the n****z that put it down, all the soldiers
All the n****z that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the n****z that pa**ed on
All the n****z with ambition and money in they heart
All the n****z that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They want to see us dead
They got pictures of a n**** head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, s***
Them n****z'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols c***ed
Run the whole motherf***in' block, f*** the cops!
The police? We run these streets n****

In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryin' to earn every penny that I'm gettin', and reminiscin'

To the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived, and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud, single parent but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd

To school, but I dropped out, and left the house
'Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again, or deal again

Love you, if you didn't know I feel this way
How I, think about you every day

Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to bein anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be rapist

When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times but I'm still breathin'
Livin' proof there's a God if you need a reason

Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right, or the wrong way?
Dear mama I'm a man now
I want to make it on my own, not a handout

Make way for a whirlwind prophesied
I want to go in peace.. when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy, and no friends
In case you never see my face again

Dear Lord can you hear me, tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in, case I pa** away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs? Cause bein' black hurts

And even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?
'Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm kiddin' I'ma thug 'til I die, I'm a rider Mayne

Touch bases, eat lunch at plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein there

N****s knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million n****z with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
'Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over b****es

[Chorus]

I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't want to see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me I creep on you like puberty

You don't want to see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we ought a cruise right by the state troopers

When I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, f*** your crew

This type of s*** I do for a petty hobby
F*** the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

[Chorus]

My s***'s phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo and f*** what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my n****z nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt

Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
B****es is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin' G's
My n****s crosstown got ki's

Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over b****es
(N****!)

[Chorus]

I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over b****es
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin'
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'

As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a f***
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven

So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings

Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over b****es

[Chorus]

That's from the time a n**** close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these b****es cause they skanless
Gettin' n****z f***ed 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles

Ain't a n**** ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops

Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my b****es

[Chorus: x2]

That's right n****
Money over motherf***in b****es
M.O.B. on 'em n****
Keep your motherf***in mind on your money, f*** these hoes

(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherf***in b****es
You need some motherf***in money
Get your mind right n****, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid f*** the fools

F*** what they talkin' bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, 'cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
F*** yo' enemies, n**** grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night

Sip off the Hennessey it's necessary to finish me
I'm in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them n****s they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin' to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin' on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin' at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted

Ever since mama got f***ed and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savage it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the s*** I speak
Once this s*** drop it's heard on every f***in'' street
Like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow 
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'

Halfway thugs are bugged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big p**** throw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked extorting
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin' out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin'
Catch my body like Haitian 5 minutes from the station

Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 n****s bleed
After they made this punk fag motherf***er bleed
All the money was bloody as s***, y'all n****s shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees s***
The glock to your head n****, don't let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted, shot f***in' backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napolean ain't no cell they can hold me in
Caucasian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some n****s fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product n**** I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with I'm some immortal s***

To lose your life, over somethin' that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with yo' pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
To help us grow at times, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters, to n****s and b****es
We went from welfare livin', to worldwide riches
But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine.. mayne
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See you gotta get high or die, 'cause even thugs cry

So merciless that my attack'll take command of your dreams

Regulate my area, the terror I represent

Am I cold or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body God, don't let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long

Til hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin', too busy bulls***tin'
Caught him with his mouth runnin' ain't this a b****
They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk, po-lice pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit, now s*** is flipped
Cause n****s died over bulls***, it's not my dream
I'm seein' pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin' times, livin' blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
To the thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my first born, feel me

My words to my first born
My words to my first born

Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed
So I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion

Quiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin'
Sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end
Drivin' with the car runnin' blinded
Ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able
Can't, blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin' up and down
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down
Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born

By all means, stack green, gangsta lean
They say money make the world go 'round
So only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers

And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
It's player haters every corner you hit
Touchin their tits, hella thick, tryin to get you for yo' grip

But come out, gun-blazin, and keep yo' head up
You can call it what you want to but it ain't gon' change

And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Y'all, although we grew up, corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom, to give to our first born

What you gon' tell your kids n****?
Who was you? What was you doin? How did you put it down?

Niggas get their caps pealed back, fool, this the West Coast
Bitch, you misdemeanor, I'm raisin' hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip ‘cause, bitch, I love to scrap
Mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me, so fuck 'em all!

Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah

Now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell? A possibility of livin' well?
But if they killin' me, I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosin' to sell, I'd rather die and be deceased

Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)
Fuck 'em all, touch 'em all; that's the way that we do it

Man, I'm as strong as this game, ya'll be knowin' my name
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane, gettin' fucked by the past

Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal

Even my hood call me ""baby Malcolm X""
With the TEC's, shower some slugs on 'em
I've got a brother, don't rest and he keeps some drugs on him
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen Faces of Death? That's what my 9 do

I keep my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
With my back against the wall, like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat, I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world, this guerilla team of mine
Screamin', ""Thug Life, bitch, fuck 'em all!"" and die for 'em

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain

Searching for fortune and fame 

Though we exist and breathe some believe currency comes to G's 
Stresses after battle with success comes greed (echo) 
They got me hot When they shot me 
Plotted my revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin' dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
Niggas change fast 
That's a shame 
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
Searching for refinement 
Curse, I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck 'em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 

Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage like priors 
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher 
Fortune and fame 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

Searching for fortune and fame 
Lost in the rain 
A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain  
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain (
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
And if family come before 
All the fortune and fame 
 
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest my head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall and I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glock clocked and keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 

I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It won't change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange I got so used to the hood 
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me I made myself 
Poverty raised me thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health my mind and my family too 
State of myself my grind and my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it 

One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain

While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn't have tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter

Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)

Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Street smart, proficient, intelligent
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waitin to get done in
Back, we tossed his ass out
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G
Now the next generation's lookin' at me through (?)

Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
2 shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
His family, sheeit, ain't nothing left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Why, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Set up shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
Put cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star

Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star

When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them

You can best believe they're watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're getting
Is a blessing in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you're all alone
You gots to do this on your own, so baby go
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you're fighting the world
Facing all this drama when mama's just a little girl

Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not oh
Time ain't on her side
'Cause mama's just a little girl (mama is just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high oh

At sixteen, what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age? (what?)
She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated, if this is fate
I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find? Little growing boy of mine
With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police, don't come home (why?)
'cause mama's acting crazy at the hospital
About to have another baby, like a rose from the concrete
Growing within, blessed with twins
How the hell can mama raise three men?
So we began, closest family, such insanity
A happy home from one act of inhumanity
Plus mama said they seed was corrupt, it used to rub
Her belly, begging to let us breathe if she loved us
Now, mama, since quiet, sipping peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops hey
How could mama bring a thug like me into the world?
She ain't the cause of all this drama
'Cause mama's just a little girl

Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not, oh
Time ain't on her side
'Cause mama's just a little girl (mama is just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high, oh

Now, will she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
Now, look here, I see her clutching her son in her arms, she's hurt
Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfil prophecies, but who could stop the grief
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top of me
Probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? Nothing but pain since my birth
Only functions at the pen, 'cause everybody's in
Paying back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die before we get it
Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried
Worried and scared, knowing I'm going to see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world no one cares
Knowing it ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about, coward, what you niggaz want? (hey)
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mama in this world
'Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl
See mama is just a little girl (Mama is just a little girl)

Mama don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Living if she is or not, oh
Time ain't on her side 

They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
They wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
(Facing all this drama)
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse is to ignore from which we came
(mama is just a little girl)
You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals 
On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses (we are the roses)
This is the concrete (this is the concrete)
And these are my damaged petals (and these are my damaged petals)
Don't ask me why (Don't ask why)
Thank God, nigga (Thank God)
Ask me how (ask me how)
You see, mama's just a little girl hey (mama)

2Pac,"Damn, take a ride, to my block
My block, 
That's right! Heh
F'real on my motherfucking block

They got a nigga
Shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
'Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutching on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same 
Cause all these little babies going crazy and they suffering in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop 'cause it don't stop, on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, 'cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
'Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losing focus, on my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still pray
But on our block we still pray

And block parties in the projects lasting way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers balling
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on the fast times, past crimes
Trying to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game from my block

Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see 

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers who passed away
From all the blocks that I'm from
One-twelve street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown,u know what I'm sayin'?
183rd and Walt, my block, that's right
122nd and Morningside, my block, that's right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that's right
In the jungle of Marin City, that's my block, that's right
Los Angeles, that's my block too
Oakland, can't forget Oaktown, that's my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago
All y'all niggas stay kicking up dust
Represent the motherfucking block",My Block [Remix],2002
2Pac,"Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked, my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop, I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty, it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose, they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more 'cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace, if you can't grant it
Niggas fightin 'cross the whole planet, so it could never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there could never be peace

Somebody owes me, will they control me? Not
I ain't a hater player but I want all you got
Y'all babies had babies now we fightin' each other
My dawgs got rabies, they bitin' each other
And it ain't hard to find a friend like mine
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
And I gotta be blind, missed sign after sign
Time after time, after time, after time
And I don't like nobody, they don't like me more
And I'm good with that finally but it heard it before
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgiving, we thankful, just for livin' in hell
Damn, homey, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
Will there ever be peace? Just a piece of my heart, never

The only peace, we got, is the peace of our heart
Peace of our mind, or that damn piece
That we hold in our waistline
You feel me, dawg? C'mon, uh

So will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace, never
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
'Cause there'll never be peace

Thangs is changin', nigga you better read the signs
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times
The world is a ghetto and peace is not a part of it
We all believe God's new plan to make it out of this
Niggas spendin' too much time hatin' on each other
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Deep in me, there's a part that wants nothin' but love
But the rest of me know, war is what's waitin' for us
So I stays ready, keep my pay heavy and boss up
Stack my funds and my guns, never rely on luck
Asking God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
'Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it
Soldiers dyin' for it and in the ghetto
They cryin' for it, but fuck peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all just
Headed for doom, still consumed by the beast
And I know, there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace?

Shit, fuck peace
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nuttin'?
You muh'fuckers are smilin' but I'm mean muggin'
Why, 'cause I gotta be thuggin'

It seems drugs done turned this whole motherfuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass, motherfuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood?
And you at the funeral every muh'fuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you muh'fuckers talkin' about peace
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin' smoked, muh'fuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings, muh'fuckers gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace, we can't never have peace

Till you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped

(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)

Damn, gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' bout this shit, we been through
We close like kin but you remain my friend too
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you but without you every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the east coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic 'cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you.
I swear I'll never call you bitch again believe me 
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up you know what I'm sayin? That was way back then

I'm never gonna call you, a bitch again

Keep yo' head up, 'cause things are gettin' better

Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin' in the living room, in the nude
Thanks for bein' there, much more than a friend

If we bleed then they suffocate, chokin' in terror
So we strive singularize we reflect in the mirrors

Strategize with no fear, wagin' war for years

Plans are cursed to be a G on the first to breathe

Promise retaliation they plan busted, no man to be trusted
Everything corrupted once man touched it
Kamikaze, hopin' that none of the spies find me
That's why we bye, bye daily knowin' cops trail me, but why cry?
Floatin' while we tokin' on this potent branch
Flossin' in the thug stance, flippin' pockets out inside my pants
Never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide
Sure as hollow points shatter, enemies die
Spread love dead thugs, gettin' buried in riches
Take a chance to advance fuck them worrin' bitches

Some say niggaz is hard headed cause we love to trick
Equipped with game so we bang wit this thuggish shit
I see you trying to hide
Hoping that nobody don't notice
You must always remember you still a member of the hopeless
See ya black like me
So you snap like me
When these devils try to plot
Trap our young black seeds
Look it
Cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models
Our father figures is bases
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties
Just as rowdy as me
Before I flee computer chips
I gotta deal wit brothas flippin
I don't see no devils bleedin'
Only black blood drippin
We can change
Whatcha now say?
I'm watchin niggaz work their lives out without pay (huh)

Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg
I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed (uh-huh)
No including yourself
All you want is what they perceiving as greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck em
I was on paper, thinking they don't give a fuck about us

I'm seeing it clearer
Hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath
The aftermath is y'alls
I told ya last album, we need help cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust
Then they beg when my guns bust

Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply
Now that's love
Shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down
Six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song
Ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck
I don't
Feel what I'm saying?

Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic
Or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times
We busted like bubbles
With the police
This nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and working
I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?

You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga your lying
'Cause half of my niggas, long gone, buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying
And that it's awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that all fool
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin in the coffin
The shit comes around so often
So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'

2Pac,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine,
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide,
And woulda' tried but when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head with the little bit of homeboys that remain,
'Cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love
When I need to escape the deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night,
It had me shook drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Ain't no place I'd rather be

Nothin' but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)

A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin'
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more

Where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion

Straight from your million dollar smile
To my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed, you got me
Inhalin' the aroma of your perfume, and feelin' heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin'
My lyrics are poetry
So baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction, see pictures of us
Layin' butt-naked on the beach kickin' back relaxin'
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I want to make you mine
I'm kissin' on you tryin' to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin' at the walls
With your number in my hand, wonderin' should I even call her tonight

Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me

Been gettin nothin' but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us havin' breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide, it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin' love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin'
Come get a shot of this plain dealin' and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, 'cause every time we touch
It's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin' my fingers through your hair if you call me

Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
'Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me

Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby 'cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
'Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the hot', if it feel right
My only wish is to be with you
You got me steady strivin' to get you
Fantasizin' of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin' major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin' wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places, what will it take
'Cause the heartache be heatbreak, is my prediction
When you falsify and start fake, in my position
I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?

Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me

You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you

I started out dumb sprung off a hood rat
Listening to the radio wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man
Listen I've got a scheme break away do my own thing
Drop some conversation sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas they want to see me rise
'97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case ], lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room please don't let them frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe if they see me rolling look at all this green I'm holding
I guess that's why the envious get their eye swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me have a heart fuck they feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted, niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip time to mash they asked for it

Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit
Pay attention, here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me

Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie, but I'll kill all of y'all, then ball
Then tell da brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word

When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die
When we ride on our enemies

2Pac,"Let us pray
Heavenly Father, hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me, who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?

I see mothers in black cryin', brothers in packs dyin'
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God 'cause we livin' in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin' bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin' for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin' fact stay high explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer

Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'

Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin' 
Who do you believe in?

Can't close my eyes 'cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
'Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin' the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessey and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin' if I'm worthy
Livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me
So I'm askin', before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change? I'm askin'

Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
'Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggas in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin' down camp, still mashin'
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck
with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
If you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin', Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
Cause he just came home off of bail
Now tell me

Is it Buddha, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?
Is it Jesus? Is it God? Or is just yourself?
definitely not to be imposed, being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing!
Men, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man, for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry, or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand, that every man, is his own man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man

Got me thinkin' bout better days
Better days! Better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' bout better days

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
Wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
'Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Pa**ed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days

Better days, better days, hey!
Better days, got me thinkin' about better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey! Better days
Got me thinkin' about better days

Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
That in my future years, I'd be stressin'
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin' to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' llello all day long, but they wrong
So I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, 'cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I
I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' pa**ionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin'

Got me thinkin bout better days (Oh)

Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
I went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' in night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days

Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look

By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw

Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M O B

And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?

So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?

I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider

All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man

In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin'

I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin' past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat

Don't creep, oh what you think, T I P and them sweet?
Don't sleep, get you hit from your head to your feet
And you don't know me, I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload

You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neck piece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga

Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out “M O B”
Nigga we ride

I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number 1 in the nation, I fucked the world
The Judge gave me probation, faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to, the whole nation

Gimme nine, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz and fuck a bitch
'Cause a true sister love niggaz

Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits

Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps

Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie

They catchin' deja vu's of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'

What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake

Rushin' to the goal line

No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed

Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees

Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did 'cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg, I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed (Uh-huh)
Not including yourself, all you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to bust
I was on paper, thinkin' they don't give a fuck about us

I'm seein' it clearer, hatin' the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls
I told you, last album, we need help 'cause we dyin'
Give us a chance, help us advance, ‘cause we tryin'
Ignore my whole plea, watchin' us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us

Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

Now, all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love
Shit, nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong?
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song, ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck, I don't, feel what I'm sayin'?

Now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times, we busted, like bubbles
With the police, this nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Master a hustle, soon dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and workin', I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?

You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
‘Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin'
Sometimes I think my block is dyin' and that is awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's all fool
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often, so tell me somethin'
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga, I be so in vain, go through the struggle
And I'm doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well, since you don't give a fuck, I be frontin'
I'mma drink my Hennessy like it ain't nothin'

Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by

2Pac,"Young mothers
I feel you
I know how it is
Mama's just a little girl
Don't nobody understand
I feel you

She was born a heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why?
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen should've been a beauty queen
See here cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl don't cry
'Cause even though they died
You can best believe they watchin' over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery
But look at what you gettin'
It's a blessin' in disguise
When you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home
And even though you all alone
You've got to do this on your own
So baby go
I wish you luck and if you need me call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand
The way it feels when you fightin' the world
Facin' all this drama
When Mama's just a little girl

Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Woman tho' she is alive
Ooh
Time ain't on her side
'Cause Mama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high
Ooh

At sixteen what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she get pregnant at an early age
She didn't listen had sex
Watch her belly raise
Hey, got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find?
A little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime at no time for growin' stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police don't come home
'Cause Mama's actin' crazy at the hospital
'Bout to have another baby
Like the rose from a concrete
Grown within' blessed with twins
How the hell can Mama raise three men
So we began a closest family
Such insanity a happy home
For one act inhumanity
Plus Mama said, ""The seed was corrupted""
Used the rubber belly
Beggin' us to breathe if she love us
Now Mama sits quiet sippin' peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops
How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?
She ain't the 'cause of all the drama
'Cause Mama's just a little girl

Mama
Don't know why?
Mama's just a little girl
Woman tho' she is alive
Time ain't on her side
'Cause Mama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high, ohh

Now would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang they came from the cane spot
Now look here I see her clutchin' her son
In her arms she hurt
Her heart bleedin' as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfill prophecy
But who could stop the grief?
I walk away I'm tryin' to hold the world up on top me
Probably be an innocent man
Still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse?
Nothin' but pain
Since my birth taught me functions at the pen
'Cause everybody's in payin' back society
I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur
My eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die for we get it
Though we shed tears
So many peers I done buried
Worried and scared
Knowin' I'm a see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world
No one cares
No it ain't fair
But we all there
And do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talkin' about coward?
What you niggas want? Hey
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mama in this world
'Cause you know I ain't mad atcha
You're just a little girl
See Mama's just a little girl

Mama
Don't know why?
Mama's just a little girl
Woman tho' she is alive
Time ain't on her side
'Cause Mama's just a little girl
She gotta hold her head up high, ohh

{They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this drama
But to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals
On the contrary
We would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well
We are the roses
This is the concrete
And these are my damaged petals
Don't ask me why
Thank God nigga
Ask me how
You see, Mama's just a little girl}

2Pac,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine,
I cry at times I once contemplated suicide,
and woulda' tried but when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor store and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, 'cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chil'ren, dead homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise, in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night,
it had me shook drippin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown tell the lady in the liquor that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

The most beautiful place in tha world

Come on this journey, the best journey, its a mansion
Acres of land, swimmin' pools and all that, check it out

I'm capable of anything, my imagination could give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things
Kids walkin home from school, on drug blocks, missionaries
Pass out papers that read love god
I see faces cases, judges n jurors, masons lawyers n cops
I watch 'cause every thugs face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
Sixteen years old did his jail since there was no where to go
Every mornin' calls his commrad to come n get em' a smoke
He insane already gone mad, blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where his sets at
Sling from dusk till dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his ass was flarin
Smokin' like a chimney on remy of course he not carin'
He needs a place to go to keep his mind expandin
I give em a helpin hand, bring em out to Thugz mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy
Lil hennesey, lay back and cool, every hour 'cause its all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion

Dear mama don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the hommies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook drinking
Peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace that last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy

Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done
Will be alright, nothin' but peace, love n street passion
Every ghetto needs a Thugs Mansion

A place where death doesn't reside, jus' thugz who collide
Not to start beef but to spark trees, no cops rollin' by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis grey hair maybe
'Cause I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin'
I'm just twenty some odd years I done lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
'Cause like Anne Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone, she shouldn't feel no pain no more
'Cause one day we'll all be together, sipping heavenly champagne
With angels songs, with golden rings, in Thugz Mansion

Every corner, every city there's a place where lifes a lil easy

Leave all the stress from the world outside, every wrong done

2Pac,"The nights grow cold
My search for gold is leading nowhere
Whichever lonely road I take
It seems to go nowhere
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow
How can I display what I know I'm worthy of
When they turn me away

The doors are closed to such as I
A boy from nowhere
But not to those who merely buy the right to go where
They'll be met with respect, not humiliation
A man's place on earth
I have come to realize is decided by birth

No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where we don't know where

I'm bound to Spain, I won't remain
A boy from nowhere
There has to be a place for me
And I must go there
I don't fantasize, unlike a million others
Who must bow and scrape
For my one means of escape
Is to flourish a cape

I'll fight all odds
And fight the Gods if they oppose me
I have to win, I won't give in
No one who knows me would expect me to fail
For the want of trying
Not a man alive
Had to beg or steal or fight
More than me to survive

So what's the future
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where good, honest men grow weak
And the rich grow strong
Something's wrong

Another dawn, another boy
A boy from nowhere
My destiny will guarantee
And I must go there

With the s-n double-o-p dogg 
To help my fuckin' homie 
You's a cold ass nigga on them all 

Sure enough I keep my hand on my gun 
Cause they got me on the run 
Now I am back in the court room waitin' on the outcome 
Free tupac is all that's on a niggas mind 
But at the same time 
It seem they tryin' to take mine 
So I am get smart and get the best of this shit 
And put together a million march plus some gangsta shit 

So now they got us laced 
Two multi millionaire muthafuckas catchin' cases 
Bitches get ready for the throw down 
The shits about to go down 
Uhh, me and snoop about to clown 
I am losin' my religion

You might be deep in this game 
But you got some rules missin' 
Niggas be actin like we savage 
See I'm a get the cabbage 
I got nutin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish 

I got a pet named p she niggarino 
I got a house out in the hills right next to chino 
And I think I got a black beama' 
But my dream is to own a fly casino 
Like bugsy segal, and do it all illegal 
And get scooped up, by the little homie in a regal 
Uhh it feel good to ya baby bubba 
You see this is for the g's and the ki's muthafucka 

Now follow as we ride 
Muthafuck the rest 
Two of the best from the westside 
And I can make you famous 
Niggas been dying for years

You thought it was but it wasn't 
Now disappear 
Bow down in the presence of a boss playa 

It's like 'cause, blood, gang banging 
Everybody in the party doing dope slangin' 
You got to have papers in this world 
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl 
Ya doing ya job 
Every day 
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray 
Let me tell you about life and 'bout the way it is 
See we live by the gun so we die by the blood of kids 

They tell me not to roll with my glock 
So now I got to throw away 
Floating in the black benz 
Trying to do a show a day 
They wonder how I live with 5 shots 
Niggas is hard to kill on my block 
Scheme for currency and dough related 
Affilliated with the hustlas 
So we made it 
Your answer to the question 
Tryin' to get up on it

But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin
Well are you still down nigga? 
Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double, oh benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems my main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One niggas gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me

Heeyyy, to my nigga
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, times moving fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to servin this, moet and paychecks
Like akai satellite nigga i'm forever ballin'
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin
Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin against the grain niggaz still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay

Come on let's picture the possibility
Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane

I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the benz burnin' rubber

You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nuttin' to the G

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without a guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was, fuck it, 'cause motherfuckers love it

To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitionz az a ridah to catch her
While she hot, and horny, go up inside her

Then I spit some game in her ear, go to the tele hoe
You put what money in a Benz, 'cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual

From hustlin and prayers, to breakin' motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin'

I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts, no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row

Now these money hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night

Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me

Above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life

That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they catchin' me, watch me bleed

Mama come rescue me, I'm suicidal thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson

Thuggin' for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it

Pay off the block evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears

Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
Niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards

That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I caught the perfect way that God made it

Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried
Gettin' much mail in jail, niggaz tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out, they gon' feel it

Witness the realest, a who ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it

Now, do you wanna ride or die?

I ain't a killer but don't push me, revenge is like the sweetest joy
Next to gettin' pussy, picture paragraphs unloaded
Wise words bein' quoted, peeped the weakness in the rap game
And sewed it, bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listenin'

Now pay attention, rest in peace father, I'm a ghost in these killin' fields
Hail Mary, catch me if I go, let's go deep inside the solitary mind
Of a madman who screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies
See me flee, activate my hate, let it break, to the flame, set trip

Empty out my clip, never stop to aim, some say, ""The game is all corrupted"", fucked in this shit, stuck, niggaz is lucky
If we bust out this shit, plus mama told me never stop until I bust a nut

Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nuttin' to lose, just me and you

On a one way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin' life as thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doin' they bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary, nigga

Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems smoke fire and bomb them
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if its a game of crack
Thugishness is in my spirit

Energized and still going

On these jealous ass coward 'cause they evil and fake

Life as a baller, alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, Loc'ed out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof let's get smoked out and blaze with me

Two in the morning and we still high a**ed out
Screamin thug till I die before I pa**ed out
But now that you are gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone but now ya gone

And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them n****s to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessey
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that a** when you pa**ed
'Cause life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace young n****, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie, if I told ya that I never thought of death
My n****, we the last ones left
But life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace young n****, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie, if I told ya that I never thought of death
My n****, we the last ones left
And life goes on

Yeah n****, I got the word as hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's getten' old

Plus with the drama we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at chill parties

Me and you no true a two
While scheming on hits and gettin' tricks
That maybe we can slide into
But now you burried, rest n**** 'cause I ain't worried

Eyes bluried, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade, I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace young n****, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie, if I told ya that I never thought of death
My n****, we the last ones left
And life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace young n****, there's a Heaven for a G
Be a lie, if I told ya that I never thought of death
My n****, we the last ones left
Cause life goes on

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know from way before
Kiss me from my head to my toe

Give me a paper and pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin incase I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we outlaws let me ride

Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my n****s from old blocks from old crews
N****s that guided me through back in the old school

Pour out some liquor have a toast for the homies
See we both gotta die but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you are gone
You left your n**** on his own, how long we mourn
Life goes on

Life goes on, homie
Gone on 'cause they pa**ed away
N****s doin' life
N****s doin' 50 and 60 years and s***

I feel ya n****, trust me, I feel ya
You know what I mean
Last year we poured out liquor for you
This year n****, life goes on
We're gonna clock now

Get money, evade b****es, evade tricks
Give players plenty space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your n****s

Your gonna be on top n****
They gonna be like, goddamn, them n****s came up
That's right, baby life goes on
And we up out this b****

I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my Dogz from the County Jail
Sendin' me mail
Heard the blocks in the same shape
Ain't nothin' changed
Niggaz slangin' at the same place
The same faces
We suppose to alwayz hate our foes
This lifestyle is forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding Crocodile tears
Just got Life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just Stay Strong

Forgive me Lord I'm insane
In search of fame
Won't hurt to change
Follow in foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with ski masks
No witnesses, as we blast fearless
Reckon now they feel us
In this act of war
More casualties
No survivors
Any man the defies us
Quickly dies
Cuz we Ridahs
In my quest for chips
We wear vest
Equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
Cuz niggaz died over information
How much more can we take?
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet
So lets make Clinton pay
(Haha)
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we posses
We had to fight and take it

Bumpin' his beat

I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was young
I could picture livin'
In Luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison?
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die
Nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties
Why the fuck should I let you live?
When I'm dead inside
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at their whole crew
Nigga remember me
Hit up my Outlaw set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask

Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for Thug Passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking, when we're tossing it up

No longer Dre Day, arrivederci

Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move

Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming ""Compton"", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs!
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals

2Pac,"Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the mornin'
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
'Cause they seein' destruction before they a see human bein'

So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
'Cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns

Smokin' weed can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead

Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free

Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

We can only learn to take our anger an' our hate
Control our mental state, settle down an' just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
'For we said it, regret it later an' let it escalate

'Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow an' tolerate
Up to the point that he just breaks, snaps an' that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learnin' from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't

It's plain to go against, with every artists comes the image
He portrays an' a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger an' this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
An' I ain't hear no complaints

But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead an' never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me an' that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free

To this day the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me an' no matter what they do
There will never be another you

You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts an' your minds, we will never die
We are forever alive an' we continue growin' one day at a time

Don't be caught in the publicity an' caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money an' light
Searchin' for fortune an' fame an' super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest

Now the hip hop police, the villains is watchin'
An' kids think beef is they only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories could die but Makaveli lives on

You think the industry is fun an' no pity with guns
An' when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died an' came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains

I spent my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
An' every now an' then I take rights from the left
I'm still just like a kid lookin' for stripes on my belt

An' that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray an' hope God take a like to myself
No matter how much, I try stay alive
I'm gonna die mad, still standin' there in love with my pride

My heart frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in an' collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
An' I finally realized that we not in the same game

The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4 5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery an' keep your eyes on the rollers

They do what they gotta do to shackle an' hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'

2Pac,"The only way, for me to come back, is by makaveli
That's it! all these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm takin' back what's mine

Laughing you motherfuckers can't stop me
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin' problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black ghosts
Feel me?

Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so god damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, can't peep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(five-oh!) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mausberg goes boom, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs
(give it up nigga) don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye

A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
Die motherfuckin die, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
Boo-yaow is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin to my fuckin block
Took a shot, tired of runnin from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(hey man, come the fuck on!)
And then we'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die

I'm supposed to say 'peace', sing songs, and get capped on

But it's time for tha new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one man clan
Here we go 
Turn it up
Don't stop
To my homies on tha block
Gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound
Underground for ya
And I'ma throw a changup
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in tha backstreets
Tha blackstreets
They fear me when they rollin in they phat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song
A black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in tha struggle
Hustlin' to tha other brotha's bubble

But still I kick

Never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could
It's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring tha noise

And the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real 'G'
Pump ya fists if ya feel me

2Pac,"I ain't got time for this man I'm out

You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?

As soon as I leave the house you want to page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe It makes me want to leave 
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve 
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?

Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's think of the evil break don't make it scandoulous
Try to be mature til your sure that we can handle this
Your sayin' I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I want to hold you tightly but instead you want to fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fightin' back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl, don't you trust me?

You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)

I hangup the phone (click)
I can't barely hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always want to sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)
Just set me back my things and I'll be outie 
This time I'm breakin out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not because we rushed it (hell no)
But girl don't you trust me?

Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars

And I wonder if the Lord ever heard of me, huh
I need loot, so I'm doin what I do
And don't say shit until you walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose, so I'm singin' nigga blues

Why'd you slang crack? I had to
Why'd you slang crack? 'Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? 'Cause I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin' rent

Poppa need brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do?
My little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war, but I ain't old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, huh
And you're hooked on my ""I Don't Give a Fuck"" look
Make your rules, I'ma break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em, you show me bacon I'm take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty
To my brothers in the barrio
You're livin' worse than the niggas in the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police?
Don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We ain't free, I'll be damned if I play the trick
For a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, caucausian bitch
Down with my homeboy Rich, huh
Fuck a snitch and a groupie-ass bitch
And the nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home
So he can go out and bone, huh
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas
Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas
And they down to be fuck-ups too
Drinkin' forties of brew, huh, singin' nigga blues

Why'd you slang crack? 'Cause I had to

See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true to what you do and keep the game up
‘Cause things change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door

But I'm strugglin' with every breath, I pray to God

I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay

I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper things in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
‘Cause I'm hustling and making money with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin' to track me, baby, hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?

I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down

I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it

And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce
Thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to em
They tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look, strange
And for me it's reversed
We left em a world that's cursed
And it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all come in like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make you get teary
The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me

Will I still keep the courage

I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets

Part 2
This is for all the homeboys who couldn't get their happy home
As long as one of us got it some of us got it
Stay down for me, hold on

Verse 1:
Sometimes you made me feel like I wasn't good enough for you
So I punished us both and didn't stay true
So much pain I know I've caused you
Truly I'm sorry every day that I'm away girl
Things went down that just don't make sense
Time and place is all now irrevelant
Cause I'm still thinking about the love that's gone
Morning, cooking breakfast back at home

Chorus:
I never meant for this to end
But we couldn't just let it go again
We broke up, it's been years and we can't turn back
But I still remember my happy home, home, home

2Pac:
Goin' through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest, it's a hard role just to keep up your faith in God
Knowing you'll get scared though
Look at him walking and talking, a little child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over little seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle
Married my baby's momma, made her my wife now
I'm tryin' hard y'all, maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watching older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it'll help our child grow then together we die
Why question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
I wonder what you must feel like now you know
That I'm having a seed with someone else
I didn't plan it to be this way
But things happen with time
And you know, time don't wait for nobody baby Oh, now I gotta handle my responsibility
Even though you still mean so much to me
Baby I can't say enough that I'm sorry
Oh, I never meant

Fuck yea and that's the way its gonna be 
Why,puffin on a dank and drinking mad brew 
Taking names and after that I'm kickin' ass too. 
Breed,kinda of tha (can I get a rhyme to go) 
Hey yo Pac ill set back and design it slow. 
They hate to see a young nigga, come up
Another punk, run up
And have to get his, gun up
Cause um I aint takin no shorts, like a newport, 
Explortin' the fully joint and 
Explodin' on the whole court. 
And I don't wanna be,wanna be, nothin' like mike 
Cause even mike don't miss every itty bitty triflin 
And when you in the spotlight,you get um jocked right 
But your life's not tight. 
Buckin' anybody forbed mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

I keep my mind on my money,money on my mind 
Finga' on the trigga, nigga, hand on my nine 
Smokin' blunts a skunk, makin' hoes of punks 
And only underground funk bumpin' outta my trunk 
Live my life as a hustla, high till I die 
Meetin' bitches, gettin' riches, miss me when lie 
Picture me living out my life as a busta 
I ratha' pop out a shot out my glock, and blast muthafuckas 
I live that thug life baby I'm hopeless, chokin' off indo 
Tryin' to keep my focus 
Don't let that bullshit worry me,
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 
Till they bury me 
God gave me game so I'm hustlin', 
Pour out some liquor for my niggas 
2pac is still strugglin' 
My niggga breed new the time, 
Whether its rhyme or crime,
Nigga, I gotta get mine 

[Chorus: x6]

?
Now let me rushing threw your mind,
I'm balla is what I keep gettin' 
Every time I pick up the mic and start spittin' 
The sidewalk of new york will start bumpin' 
Jumpin' around,with the muthafuckin pound 
And I'm down to the fullest,and breakin' niggas ass off proper 
Did you right, that's right, cause I got you in my pocket again 
The new jacks, the new jacks, use to be my niggas when I ran way back when 
I boasted,and roasted, and coasted to the clinical cause ill do it again. 
Like precision, cut the two lines in the division. 
Plus,what I add loose as flutes. its gaming foe sale like prostitutes. 
I never had love for hoes, to put it blunt. 
They want me in the back,but bitch I'm in the front. 
Don't front,and really I don't need a reply. 
Pull yourself together as you pass me bye. 
I'm on a whole 'nother level,them hoes is left 
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself 
Goodbye,some many niggas lied to have 
Funny what a muthafucka' do for math 
I got rats caught up in my everyday actions,point 
Equal to your realist satisfaction 
Buckin' anybody that forbid mine 
When will they realize,
I'm set out to got mine
