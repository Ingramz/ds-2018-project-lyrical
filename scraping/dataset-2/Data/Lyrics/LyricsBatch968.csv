S. Scott,"Yo, I'm a tic-tac-toe tactical wit it tactician
Tit for tat, three bombs on me, we all ticking
Schizophrenic, up in the kitchen
With a black fifth up against my head, just, click, click, clickin' it
We check the barrel and start respinnin' it
We, I start, medics start sowing and restitching them
My constituents and scorpions poisonous stingers filled with opium

Stay grippin' 'em, I've got a venomous heart, filled with vigilance
That will shatter ten continents and ten palatinates
Envision the vengefulness, visualize the vindictiveness
I rhyme with Sid Vicious viciousness
You be kiddin', soft like kittens
My grills are pit bulls, they will kill when I say sick 'em
Restrain me, restrict me
I'm arresting resistance, can't be apprehended nigga

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

Let the catty spray and wet up the matinee
Smack niggaz with both hands like patty-cake
Violate and I will retaliate
I don't battle fake niggaz, I'm heavyweight nigga
GMG, fam, we gladly hotta
Behold the sorcerer's stone like Harry Potter
And I'm like Harry Potta, we scary riders

Can't get near the dadda
I swear to God I'll come find where you hidin'
Have my high, finding beamers and ninas
Leave the area shot up, you hearing me Patna
I'm a fucking five star general, to drive cars into you
Ic' dodge interviews, one flip of the mack, take all ten of you
This message intended to, who's ever offended Duke
Yeah, you my nigga, but you could still get it too
So don't test me, I don't wanna do this shit to you

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

Live from the NY state
And I got one question, guess what's in my waste
Y'all got me pisted off slick talk
To get that Jacob watch, I'll cut your wrist off
I'm in the limo too long to turn
And this motherfuckin' Dutch taking long to burn
I'm impatient, this is a song you learn

Make money, take money
And I'm hear to confirm my occupation
The new boss of course, the new Porsche
I pull up just to murder you niggaz and move off
You too soft, Red Cafe from New York
I tell a bitch quick, I'm hot can't cool off
I twist lesbos, and guzzling out exos
My firearms stick to my waste like Velcro
It's R.C. nothing phony about me
With E double the O.G. you know me

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

Yeah, I know, you never expect me to anchor
I bring it to them so called pranksters and them gangsters
I run DMC's from rappers that's petter piper
I am the big apple, ain't nobody ripper, man
I'm not M.J., I'm a lover and a fighter
That's why I'm in D.C. now, looking for the sniper
I came in the game with hoodies and timberlands
Hard since Cypress Hill been wanting to kill a man

I did time, a thirteen year bid
I'm gutter E, I'm hanging on the side of crib
I'm a fan, but I hate what you're doing
Whenever you performing shows it's me booing
Ya as soft as your bid-die, you punk now
And you gonna be a punk at sixty
Dog, ya need more team to get me
I'm a G, and my Unit come through like Fifty

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me

S. Scott,"You can't rap like me
Uhh, Sy Scott, Def Squad
Listen, ain't playin' no games man
Yeah, whattup

Give or receive and give or take, I'm an Indian giver
I take back what's given to the getter from the giver
Nigga give way, give up, you never get a glimpse
Of the glimmer man, glimmer glitter when I trek your body shiver

Rhythm I'm rippin' whatever I can get a grip of
Just to get a giggle, this literature's ishkabibble
And damn, dun-uh, dun-uh, dun-uh, the shark is in the water
Dun-uh, dun-uh, dun-uh got him right where I want him

Now I'ma get him, Scott crack leg bones like a wishbone
Snap your nose bone witcha chin bone
Break your legs and snap your shinbone
Put your skull bone, jawbone right next to your gall stones
'Til y'all all know

I got the hypothalamus of a hippopotamus
Squashin' the retardapuss when [Incomprehensible] rush
Too good to be true like fairy tales come true again
You wish you was me but woke up and you was you again

Sy Scott, you can't rap like me
You can't murder a rhyme or kill a track like me
You can't bust aim or hold a gat like me
Flow hundred percent perfect, you can't rap like me, no

This here's somethin' stupid for the eardrum
You wanna hear somethin' slick, son, here it come
You can ask Dr. Phil, I'm ill
I'ma kill you, then kill them, then 'Kill Bill'

Yeah, word to Vivica, I hemorrhage a pile
Drop the temperature, 'til the coroner start zippin' ya
Be-ball player, I shoot from the perimeter
Two shot, three shot, all into ya

On mics I does my thing
Agua, I flow like Poland Spring
Not from Maine, I'm from New York, mayne
I'm the bandit, in the black Maybach in transit

300 pound nigga, hold weight, stop, hold, wait
E-Dub the great there's no mistake, yeah
The untakeable, unshakable, you uncapable
I'm Bruce Willis, I'm 'Unbreakable'

You can't replace the unplaceable
You can't face off, with the unfaceable
Even the matador can't face the bull
I'm the raging bull, you wanna shoot, pull

M E, you can't rap like me
The boy with the slow flow you can't rap like me
Bang, bang, you can't shoot a gat like me
My Squad is Def and you can't rap like Khari

I throw three like Bobby Jackson at 'em
I'm O.G. like Bobby Johnson stomp 'em
Hold G like Bumpy Jonson on 'em
Read flip and beat kids like Joe Jackson

My flow jackin', clack, clack, I'm sharp like the claws
Of Hugh Jack, hands packin', make you an 'X-man'
Time for some action and matter of fact
Go exercise or be ordained to explore pain

And explain, why you puttin' extras on
In this excess I throw a hex through your headset
Settle down 'fore I set it off on your set
Let's say Santiago is the best you heard yet

I know, my flow, oh my God, get so heated
That MC's stay away like I gotta heebie jeebies
Ask G's if I G, hit the G spot on your queen
Kings get they heart or crown ripped apart now

Yeah, you can't rap like me
You snap back, get back, smack a wack MC
Santiago, you ain't got the stats like me
To get busy and tap dance on tracks like me
",Like Me,2004
S. Scott,"Hit it hard
Yeah, yeah, when I stick it she be like (uh)
Yeah, pimpin, I run up right inside 'em, yeah

[Verse One: Sy Scott]
Yo, it goes hey you, guess what, guess who gets what
I snatch baguettes, you get what you get, guess what
Guess what, you get it and forget it like guess what
Guess what get done to special guests that can't guess what
He goin on when Sy be goin off
In the cross my Squad run tracks like motocross
I write words I read and then re-word 'em
Same word, rework 'em without re-wordin 'em
Word perfect for workin with 'em
Workmen do homework, men at work in the network workin system
Yeah, I overwork, work the middle
Work and turn your homework workbook against you
In the range of a roundabout ratio
I merry-go-round around around the radio
Around around and away we go
Everytime Sy bust down then it's up up away you go

[Chorus: Keith Murray]
Now what do you niggaz think about this
A jam for the streets that you can't resist
So hustle to this, bang to this
Get your money to this, yeah listen to this
Now what do you bitches think about this
A jam for the clubs that you can't resist
So shake to this, freak to this
Drink up to this, yeah listen to this

[Verse Two: Erick Sermon]
Uhh, huh
E-Dub, I'm known like the Rucker
Fucker, comin through like a redneck trucker
Nother, man down, call 9-1-1
I stash that so they can't find my gun
I'm in the woods like hikers, bikers, campers
Antlers, bears snakes and long-leg tarantulas
Uh, E-Dub I got balls
If I get chased pon' de river like Sean Paul, believe it
I'm on the fish neck, like jet-skis
I killed Romeo, along with Jet Li
And messin with the E be incomparable
Get romped like Romper Room, a one man platoon
Oh I say, I'm Andrew Dice Clay
Filthy mouth and also fuck why'all
You want to get physical we touch why'all
Haters we appreciate the love so - thank you very much why'all

[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Keith Murray]
Last but not least, Keith wreck shop comfortably
When I flow, I fuck up your street credibility
Def Squad get busy often
When it comes to chicks we got more tricks than a dolphin
You see the new E-Dub spin when I pull up
Ecko sweatsuit with the hood up
This shit is so hot you could cook an egg on it
So I sunny-side up, buttered toast my opponents
I take the drama to the middle of the street
Or any nigga that's feelin himself like Tweet
Kid you sonned out, let me speak to your father
Matter of fact, hold these here, and don't even bother
We come through with the nines poppin
Niggaz get so quiet, you can hear rats pissin on cotton
So you see there's nothin furthermore to say
Aiyyo Busta, ""Pass the Courvoiser""

S.A.D.,"Wonder what can be so bad 
That it makes you want to die 
I wonder what could be so tragic 
Makes you want to take your life 
You have your Savior on the cross 
While you sit on the throne 
Put yourself up on that cross 
Put your Savior on the throne 

And I know it's hard to take what's happening 
And I know life is tough sometimes 
And I know it seems like there's no hope for you 
And I know your life is worth more than you can see 

It's hard to see beyond your pain 
When you feel so dead inside 
It's hard to see what you've been given 
It's hard to find the hope in life 

And I know it's hard to take what's happening 
And I know life is tough sometimes 
And I know it seems like there's no hope for you

Down here, nothing but hard heads
Round here, nothing but straight killas down here
And if you really want to know

I'm from the city of the wickedest, cut throat connivers
We keeps it gutter, till the day that we die
We roam the streets at dark, all we got to survive
Is our hands and our heart, our balls and our word
Just for sitting in my hood, I be screaming until I'm horse
You ever touch one of mine, I'm coming for you and yours
If you ain't got to jack in the murder, you ain't shit
When you hear the blacka-blacka, you know somebody got hit
Hope it ain't none of mine, and if it's mine
I be coming to get you die trying, survival of the fittest
We the sickest no disrespect, but these boys got heart
It could be the dope, but these boys play the part
Murder capital, just a couple years back
In my city, itching to put us right back on the map
When you hear the click-clack, you know it's time to smash
Playa in chest-tolic, catch a bullet in the ass

You bound to get sprayed, hole in your fade

We love car jacking, and breaking in people homes
Love concealing weapons, illegal firearms

With a smile upon their face
I heard old men sing with youth in their voice
When that old-time record plays
I seen young boys learning their first steps
To the sound of those drum breaks
And I heard the sound that accompanies
So many first mistakes

You can catch a nigga roaming the lot hugging the glock, dogging the drop
Creeping on some'ing, that's chrome and don't stop
I'm a street nigga, associated with thugs
That's why my trunk popped up, gangbanging like Crips and Bloods
I crawl when I creep, looking for a dime piece
That's down to get knocked down, like porno freaks
I'm just a ghetto superstar, that's trying to climb out the hood
So if you haters thinking jack, I'll bust a round if you would
Try to plot come on my block, my slugs will meet ya
And greet ya, social security will have to delete ya
Hating people, my Desert Eagle's giving haters no love
Wanna find me, I'll be roaming the lot fuck the club

You can catch me in the lot, trunk on pop
Fuck a bottle with a bug, you can catch me with a glock
Slow Loud and Bangin, still swanging in a drop
Top down for the bops, but my rims don't stop
(you can catch me in the lot, nigga fuck the club
Rather chill with my thugs, when I'm banging on dubs
Some niggaz hate, the other half show me love
When a nigga mean mug, I'ma greet him with a slug)

You can catch me in the lot, with a big gat squashing all chit-chat
Finding a parking spot, to the drop the Focus it'll sit flat
These niggaz don't, wanna upset Boss
Hopping fly, might lead to a right hand cross
One of the homies trailing behind, the blue Yukon
Banging and hanging sets, with that blue Duke on
He got a heater on him, he don't say much so I don't speak on him
Niggaz act like they want our spinners, more than we want em
But down in H-Town, we ain't scared of no jackers
Rushing through the park, looking like a linebacker
Leave the murder scene, on my gold and chrome adaptors
We young block bleeders, gangstas paper stackers

Cruising the Boulevard, with the trunk on wave
It's the Jay'Ton, so you know I don't play
When I bo'gaurd the block, better get out my way
If you fuck up my slab, I'ma fuck up your day
So back-back, before my click get on your ass
And we don't need a mask, for them niggaz talking too fast
In a blue tipping and turning, wrecking 'em while I'm swanging
Call me an O.G., the way my trunk banging
Fuck roaming the club, I'ma knock the top off
And show you how we be stunting, in the Dirty Dirty South
They mouth be wide open, stuck like they wet
I bet, these niggaz gon respect my set

You better get out of dodge, my entourage coming quicker than flash
That's your ass, Slow Loud And Bangin got you feeling like trash
Never need to get in the club, we be crawling the lot
Trunk popped top done dropped, on thirty some'ing dots
Out the roof one hundred proof, on a mission for bops
Yeah they try to get my attention, but the rims don't stop
Entertaining up in my slab, got 'em riding my jock
Throwback ""Fondren & Main"", got 'em doing the wop
See the mind frame is fast, and the wide frame is slow
My game is too fly, my mouthpiece is thoed
Piece and chain, hitting about a hundred below
So when it get hot I'm garunteed, to be pulling a hoe
Whether in a silver bullet, or in a Excursion
They need a anthem for the streets, and this is my version
Slow Loud And Bangin is what I'm yelling, when I be swerving

I find myself in a daze, sitting watching time fly on by
I tried to catch a grip, but somehow we keep moving on by
We came a long way, from playing hide-and-seek on the block
To bleeding corners on the daily, barely missing the cops
We turned to grown men, quicker than the blink of an eye
Some of us made it some of us didn't, but still we got by
What about the good times, ain't too many but I remember
Stadium Bowl, the rest of the clubs wouldn't let us in 'em
We was young, and plus our pants sag like Dubs
But we ain't care, cause half of the parking lot knew who we was
We came from riding on a bike, and graduated to a Houpe
Six deep with a grey cassette, trying to swang banging Screw
That was the days, but now we only riding with guns
Only understanding I got, is multiplying my funds
And moving slow in a drop, pass bops so grimey
Missing better days, hoping they could come and find me

[Hook]
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from playing tag, to me running from the cops
Went from Tunker Toys, me swanging in a drop
Flying pass bops
I remember, being kids on the block
Pennies and my nickels, soon turned to a knot
I went from shooting water, to me loading up a glock
I came from the gutter, trying to make it to the top
Shit don't stop

[Jay'Ton]
I remember kicking it, with my niggaz in Middle School
In the hall full time, fuck class and all the rules
Late night, I was with the O.G.'s on the block
Curfew broke, but I was trying to stack me a knot
With my nigga Raw-C, Nick and the T-Head
Can't forget about the J2, and blocks we bled
Playing tackle football, while we on the concrete
In the house, imitating everybody we can beat
From the West to the North, with my nigga Pyrex
On the hunt for some bops, roaming through the projects
When I turned 16, Trae bought me a car
Four 15's, so the hood know who we are
Jay walking, so you know I'm walking it fly
T-shirt creased up, fuck a suit and a tie
Them was the days, I'll probably never see him again
So my main focus now, is for me stacking my ends

[Boss]
I was raised back in the 80's, I can tell ya bout the Smurfs
We was kids, we done traded our nurse for hard work
I can go back in the day, to playing get like me
In the hood looking for trouble, can you hit like me
I was a youngster in the street life, bailing through the street lights
First pair of G-Nike's, ask a nigga what that G like
I remember playing curve ball, and soccer
They got most of my homies chained up, in 5-by-7 lockers
The days ain't the same, in '79
Nigga was cool in '94, but now everybody walk in a shady line
25 years of keeping it real, wasn't hard for me
Living for the moment, to hit the gates for the Lord to see

[Hook]

[Z-Ro]
I done came a long way, from cutting class
No more ducking hall monitors, now the FED's on my ass
Grown man shit Joseph Wayne McVey, I never thought I would say
That a state jail or prison, is a place I'd have to stay
I remember Saturday morning, cartoons and basketball
Half of the niggaz I was hooping with, in a casket y'all
The streets, is a graveyard
187's every second, please watch over my days Lord
I'm nothing but a Christian, I'm down with Jehovah
But this day in time, you ain't gon make it if you ain't a soldier
So God forgive me because I'm strapped, somebody might try to do me
The real world ain't like my block, this shit it like a movie
Make me wanna travel back in time, like Michael J. Fox
To when all my people was living, and it was love on the block
But ain't nothing but the future, bout to take place
It'll never be 1989 again, so nigga fuck friends

I'm a gangsta to the end, riding for the set
Black Chevrolet, with the paint still wet
J's on my toes, locs on my eyes
Crawling on fours, every time I slide by
Nothing less than the truth, on the streets of the South
Hos on my swag 'cause the diamonds in my mouth
But I move low key, posted in the trap
Raw with the rap, to put my hood on the map
I'm a do this one for H.A.W.K., and his brother named Pat
And my partna named Screw, so I let the trunk crack
What they know about that, haters better chill
Plus I'm packing something, that they classify steel
Repping my block, still doing my thang

Locs on my face, and my grill so clean

Moving so slow, banging my screw
Moving so slow, banging my screw
Hop out on the block, still hollin' 'what it do'

Baby, keep your face down, and don't talk back
You can find me in the hood, nigga distributing packs

My guns go off, when my fists is hard
Mobbed up 'cause nigga pistols'll scar
You got your knife on you, homie, that's for twisting cigars
I got my knife on me, homie, that's for twisting your guards
These niggaz, wanna play you for weak
It's going down, motherfuckers drizzown when they playing it deep

Lean on you with this beam, till you fade to black

Niggaz old school, still jacking my swag'
Y'all concerned about a playa, since the day of my birth
Grab a couple mill, and I can show you what I'm worth
Sitting so low, every time I come down
Trunk just popped, so I'm showing my surround
84's got me tipping, so low to the ground
Still hitting licks, moving off the Greyhound
Watching for the laws, I ain't fucking with the time

It's for war thirty, fuck President Bush
If he was close to the edge, then I'll give him a push
And do this whole world a favor, hey there howdy neighbor
Shit, I'm sorry I took so long to save you
I was getting my dick sucked, by my secretary
She asked me my sign, I told her bitch Aires
I stay on Barbary and Scott, 5000 block
I paint the white house black, and start renting it out

In this underground game, I'm rolling with S.L.A.B
Black H2 Hummers, when we holding the Avenue
Got a itching trigga finger, when I'm holding my strap
Nigga they call me hit man, don't get your wig pushed back
Man some of these niggaz, is bitches too
Steady riding my dick, like bitches do
You a gangsta or a hoe, nigga which is you
Archie Lee been real, before I had a crew
Get it right don't get it wrong, I stay's in the zone
Plus my piece got yellow stones, like I stayed on the Stone
I spit that hood shit, that wood shit
Hershelwood for life, matter fact it's all good bitch

I heard a nigga in the game, was saying my name
But now my glock is fully loaded, and ready to aim
S-L-A-be until I'm gone, and I'm repping it strong
You don't want to see these gorillas, running up in your home
Everybody better clear the lot, when the lights off
I set it off, when I luger ride for the cause
And fuck the law, I'ma mash till I'm finished and done
And when it's all said and done, I'ma be number one
And I bet that I'm a soldier that'll fold you, I done told you
Niggaz getting ran over, in a Rover
Trae forever staying sober, like a Jehovah
Witness I'm at your door brah, door brah

Let's take it, to the streets
Any one of you, motherfuckers got beef

Get the nine millimeter fitted up in my denim, on my creep
Who that want to do that, bitch or come through that
And sweep up, that street
I'm a motherfucking G, and bitch you gon' listen to me
When I speak, ain't got no time to try to be friendly
Motherfuckers, must didn't hear me
Move around bitch, before you feel me
We smoke em, and choke em
Then fry a motherfucker, just like a poker
The game is now over, be the next
To the thoedest cats or now open, are you playing with me boy
Watch a nigga bob and weave, and then we break jaw
We ain't barring no law
Snap rugged and rough, and playing this game raw
Bitch we ready for war, anybody running up is bound to get scarred

Dog better get the fuck back, 'fore I fuck around and leave a nigga flat
With a cardiac heart attack, slugs stuck off in your back
See I ain't tripping mayn, I'm one of the young guerillas
That's stacking scrilla, slash a killa cause I'm a made nigga
You don't want to get hauled on, or straight clicked on
I've been a G ever since the day, that I left home

S-L-A-be	, one of these motherfuckers finna see
I've been a sad cat with a fat cat all the way back, still spitting with heat
One of the rap game phenomenon's, me and my click be ready for war
You better get your entourage, 'fore you get calicoes through your car
Or you'll get a 44 to your jaw, ain't no love boxing we raw
And if you really think that we playing, step in the ring so you can get scarred
Guerillas ready for havoc, on a mission to let you have it
To tell the truth I done had it, this game is really fin to get tragic
I ain't having when I'm busting on first and ten, I'ma be rushing
Till a nigga left with concussions, bring the end of discussion dog
You don't want to get me pissed off or ticked off your ass is fin to get pissed on
Not dissed on but clicked on, for stepping inside my zone

50 Cent, baby that's nothing but chump change
Shooting slugs at my partna, disrespecting the game
So feel this verbal cocaine, your whole tape was trash
Now the whole Screwed Up Click, gon beat that ass
So when you come in H-Town, don't hide behind your circle
We gon' tear the club up, leave both your eyes purple
Hurt you bitch nigga, that's from the Boss Man
I'm known for slapping boys, knocking em out with my hands
Understand bow down, and show some respect
We clicked up and heated, with knives hanging round our neck

So call the ambulance, and put this bitch up on some ice

S.O.F.T.,"I live to fly on a natural high
My love is growing softly to the sky
The lovers hors d'oeurve for the
Evening to come
The camera still runs and we see you
I was soft for the first time
Now content to breathe so deeply
Got my hands in my pockets
Burn, burn, burn
I've seen the light
Hell, I've seen them all
But one can keep those daydreams
Keepin' on
Show me a world in a
Different space, in a different house
In a different way
Nothing's sacred anymore but
Don't touch my friends
God makes amends in a book
He's only pleasant when he's sleeping.",Second Coming,1999
S.O.P.,"Yesterday got a page and it said that my daddy died 
But I couldn't cry we had a fight long time ago by the liqour store 
Said I didn't want to see your face no more see 
I know pops was just a man but how you hurt someone you love 
I don't understand telephone rings and what am I supposed to do 

[Chorus]
Heaven can you hear me father can you help me on my knees and prayin' 
Please come through my world is slowly dyin' and lord I'm really tryn' 
It's been awhile since I last talked to you mama said everyone makes mistakes 
If that's true then I really need to see your face so I'll know its gonna be ok (ooook)

I pulled up about five to see my people at my mamas house to see what they was talkin' 'bout 
I haven't seen 'um in a long time (baby are you doin' fine) 
Now it's time to tell 'em what's been on my mind 
Who was there to wipe my tears away and who decided not to show up on my weddin' day 
So y'all tell me what am I supposed to do I just need to hear from you

[Chorus]

Livin' in this world ain't easy you want to give up sometimes and even though 
I got my girl beside me a fathers love is hard to find 
See every boy wants his daddy there fells like his daddy cares 
Feels like his daddy will be there watchin' on his graduation day 
And be there to take the pain away

[Chorus]

To every daddy that might hear this song see one day you'll look up and your baby be grown yeah 
You can't get back all the years that's past so while you have the chance you better make it last didn't get the chance to say goodbye and I wish that I could see you one more time 
And now I gotta keep my mama strong guess you never miss something til' its gone!!

[Chorus: x3]

  You're wrong or right
  We all have our faults yes we do

  What do you see, two eyes a nose and a
  Mouth just like me
  Oh your eyes are open but you refuse to see

  You and me
  Because of my color I struggle to be free

S.P.M.,"First Verse:

My homie called me in the morning from a hospital bed
He got holes in his body from a glock full of lead
He said, three motherfuckers that his lady knows
Tried to jack his ass for his 84's
Now in a Ben Taub sick bed, my homie lays up
He got sprayed up, 'cause he wouldn't raise
Caught three of the seven of the shots that rang
Them folks sayin' that he'd never walk the same
It sounds like a job for the uzi gat
And where the fuck did your bitch say these fools be at?
For a real long time, we been the best of friends
And I'll be damned if a nigga don't get revenge
I feel anger, that I'm no stranger to
Bustin' slugs in they guts just a thang to do
Why they pray for you, come and spray they crew
Got love for my homies, I thought you knew?
He said ""Los don't sweat it, let this shit alone,""
but with these punk motherfuckers I must pick a bone
Now will it be the cranium or the chest plate?
Necks break back, snap, put him in checkmate
Lead take me to vengeance, send this
Ripping through tendons I end this
Because you bleed inside and it hurts to cough
I can't take no advice I gots to break them off

Chorus:

'cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do,
What my friends, would do for me,
You muthafuckas gotta beg,
y'all askin' for action,
Eat a fuckin' K,
I'm blastin' some asses
'cause my revenge, it tastes so sweet, I gotta do,
What my friends, would do for me,
You muthafuckas gotta beg,
y'all askin' for action,
Eat a fuckin' K,
I'm blastin' some asses

Second Verse:

My niggas check me, I'm thinkin' of a master plan
I'm straight up blastin' glocks, them fuckin' bastards ran
I'm steady missin' all my homies that done bit the dust
Got revenge 'cause them bitches wasn't shit to us
Now what the fuck can I accomplish?
And when I'm dead, will I find myself on God's list?
Every night I give, thanks I wouldn't die today
Turnin' cane into crack and my mic away
We dealin' 'cause we feelin' that the, pay's right
Hopin' Mama never see me at my, grave site
No daylight, play night cautiously
Could be death, or my freedom what it's costin' me
Lost in dear life my wife be that Mary Jane
And my streets got me strollin' blueberry Lane
Very same song sung in the South
From the mouth of a hustler, never have I trusted a
Trick or a hoe or a dope fiend either
'cause they smoke like a beaver buildin' dams on the river
Live a, life of a ""G' til' the d - a - why
Hittin' switches on the freeway high
Don't reply 'cause me don't give a fuck
What you hoes got to say about me Hillwood funk

Chorus

Third Verse:

Stop short in your tracks
Gats got the place surrounded
Sounded two warning shots, fuck on up and you'll be grounded
Pounded bodies with a bunch of twelve gauges
Now her face is too straight in the fuckin' dog cages
Pages of my book, turn like the wind blows
On the paper of a crook, muthafuck them hoes
Hittin' flows as a hustler, rose as a ""G""
Saves his flows to big 8, now he scores half a ki
Some say in his head he got insanity inside
But all it really be is mathematically inclined
Look behind, you might find others takin' over
Rookies movin' cookies, they whipped in baking soda
Baby learn the fuckin' rules, my cheese, is SOLID AS A ROCK
With my homies and we BALLIN' WITH A GLOCK
Tenderoni phony fraud motherfuckers
Best to get out the game, 'fore you die motherfuckers
Bustas trust us, but us hustlas trust no one
You can sure run with no gun
That be a nigga slow guns
So roll one of them sweets

Chorus",Revenge,1999
S.P.M.,"Yo-yo homeboy, pass me dat
Yo, this is the song I wrote for the girl I love.
Her name, Mary Jane

Saggin' my dickies, smoke like a hippy
Smell so good when she get wet and sticky
You lift me, girl you the bomb
Got a nigga blowin' like Cheech and Chong
A bong, a blunt, or a paper square
It really don't matter she'll take you there
You been my gal since the age of thirteen
And it's funny to me, you still make me fiend
You put a spell on me with the green voodoo
You love when my boys come and run us a choo choo
Mary-Jane deep in the game
The way I feel words can't explain
You been true to me, stood by my side
I wake up and get my mornings first high
Other hoes wonder why they get no love
'Cause Mary got a big ol' but, huh

[Chorus: x2]
Mary-go-round, round and round
Oh let the Mary-go-round, pass the sweet

If yous a Jane user
Throw your hands in the air with this muthafuckin three time user
Producer, wanna cool my future (pass the sweet)
Pass the Medusa, I never knews her
Who ya, who ya think ya are
Ya fuckin with a dopehouse shootin' star

Smokin' that budda
Drinkin' that puda
Booya, another killa from madulas
I thug in rida chick gets me higher
There's no needa tryna find a finer hyna
I decya my bitch your fya
Be bestet as we kids under plya

[Chorus: x2]

Mary-go-round round and round
Oh let the Mary-go-round
Pass the sweet

Now you can do snow or get wet as the rain
Me man I got Jane in my brain
Of course I kick doors for white whores
But my wife Mary-Jane I never get divorced
'Cause she be tha only one fit for a playa
The green eyes and the pretty red hair
The hoes sick cause them jealous bitches wanna
Vyla coma vana marijuana
You was born in Mexico but I took the chance
And brought your ass across to the promise lands
I love to lay you down so soft in my swisha
Act like a freak and let all my niggaz hit ya
I got your picture on all my walls
Mama caught us kissin' wanna call the laws
My family thinks you nothin' but trouble
Can't see how you helped me through the struggle

[Chorus: x2]",Mary Go Round,1999
S.P.M.,"Got to do something for the playas if you ain't a real playa
You'll have to go to the back of the club, this for the playas
And the ballas and the pimps, for everybody, south side
Who rocking lots of ice, teeth shine, piece shine
Pull up looking clean on two twenty's nigga

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

I just put some new rugs in my two story club
Hoes getting dug in my king size tub
Boys getting drugged, trying to act like a thug
No fucking love while I sip purple mud
I fly like a dove, smoke like a champ

Never run from no one 'cause I might catch a cramp
Smoking damp, fucking on a old school tramp
Ten dollar rock for a twenty food stamp
My name is Carlos holla fuck these hoes
Life is like ballet stay on your toes

My dream is to keep the world up all night
'Cause I got enough 'caine to have a snowball fight
I floss gators, got cribs with elevators
So much cash I bought a pool for my neighbors
Dope house and sucka free, run your ass up a tree
Fuck with me and you'll be keeping dad company

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

When I walk into the club people say, ?Where he go??
But when I open up my mouth they be like, ?There he go?
When Redd sliding through the club I'm throwing my elbows
Any girl I snag, she sticking like velcrow
And when I take my watch off, they say, ?Who cut the lights off??

And I can freestyle all night until they cut the mics off
As soon as I touch the stage, broads ain't paging they man
Instead they spilling liquor, waving they hands
Well I'm a valet parker and a endo sparker
So many waves in my hair I got to wear swimming goggles

Now we ready to buy the bar tossing shit the counter
People notice my name and run over the [unverified]
Now when you see me in the club, I'm dressed top of the line
I'm mixing up codeine and popping bottles of wine
I met a chicken head from Michigan showing her tattoo
Hit it off at the bar too, let's scram so we could car pool

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

Hey, this for my Blacks, Asians, Chinese and Caucasians
Muslims, Irish and even Jamaicans, Hispanics, Indians
Throw your sets up and all the fine women, raise your dress up
Hold up your piece if you got ice in it
And put your white cups up if you got pink sprite in it

You might see me at the bar but I don't drink that much
I just bought an Escallade and I'm gone paint that truck
I got three million in the bank, but it ain't that much
Now when I look at magazines I say ain't that us
I'm in the VIP section, wearing a black dob

I got the women screaming whoa but my name ain't Black Rob
Man, they screaming Lil' Flip at the front of the club
A nigga buzzed off this remmy with a blunt and a hug
When sucka free in the club women lose they brains
If I need ice in my cup, then I use my chain, bling bling

Put your fist up if you wearing a Rolex
Put your wrist up, grab your Styrofoam
Cups of drink mixed up if your car broke down
Get it fixed up playas put your fist up

Let your piece shine if you got diamonds in your grill
Let your teeth shine and when we at the club
We be creased down, you ain't never seen
No playa like me, don't ball with sucka free

Well Baby Beesh, that's my handle, money mackin'

Squares don't understando
Play like a piano when I'm flipping through the

On some doja, cars keep flippin' over 
Getting' Jags and Testerosas
Motorola, Coca-Cola, stay high and never sober 
Got them hot girls makin' love to my poster
Attitude kinda flippy, pockets never skimpy 
Married to Marijuana with that drama you can miss me
Fifty-fifty I'm a playa, slash money maker by nature
I get that paper pushin' green and snowyflaka
Make a good girl turn to sinna 
Puttin' inches all up in her
Blaze the bitch up now she's a bread winner
I'm a gold digga, kick a hole through your front door

[Second Verse]
I remember way back in the day
I used to get spankings from my momma
But uh now this lil' ass baby smokin' on dank in The
Bahamas, got a pair of Versace pajamas 
Little mommas say I'm a sex symbol
I come through with the blue Coug
And shit I'm thinkin' Lexus Limo
I'm a swang three lanes to the piece and chain
And the pinky ring I'm gonna blind
'cause it's my time, I pack my dime, I put two holes
Right in your spine
Every time you talkin' down my rhyme 
Boy I beat yo lil' behind
And stop and rewind, feel my lines 
Bottle like me, I'm gonna shine
Little Christian on a mission 
But listen he gaining recognition
In the Expedition, it's gonna glistin'
Got a line and he went fishin'
Pay attention to the Louisiano recano regano with a
Blano, I be puffin' on a big Fano 
Got mo' green than the motherfucking lotto
Nigga I'm the one, the Christian 
The lucky motherfucker outside of the Yukon
I'm swangin' fo's, I'm slangin' hoes 
Representing of the way Houston
These boys ain't ready for the age of Levy in a SS
Chevy on perely 
Nigga I be sippin' lean 
And I'm counting green
'cause boy I'm all about my feria (feria).

Chorus

[Third Verse]
I promise this song is harder than my dick is
I won in the Olympics for cooking the most chickens
Gold medal around my necka, living la vida chueca
Puck checka, chuck wrecka, nobody do it betta
I'm best when under presha, smoke up in my chest
Momma mad, 'cause I just just failed my piss test 
Brain deader than a door knob 
This is, for my road dog
Fresh out the Pen I take him out to get a blowjob
I'm so shy, controlling the streets, like a robot
The one to put a dope house 
I'm sorry but it won't stop
My door got kicked in once before
And I'm sho' they won't try that stupid shit no more
I put holes up in they asses 
Broke em' like some glasses
Niggas was falling just like my motherfuking pants is
Answers your questions, throwed as Mexicans
Snatch your bitch up and dig deep in her intestines.

Order in the court!

The courtroom asks Carlos Coy to step up to the witness stand.
Do you swear to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?

(SPM)

Yeah

First Verse:

I'll begin when I started gettin' violent, sir
Screwin' in my muthafuckin' silencer
I grabbed my 'stol, and then I felt the coldness
People stood around as I told this
Ferocious confession of relentless aggression
I was taught, to shoot first and then ask questions
I sold rocks, I was raised with no pops
My four glocks, twistin' hoes like door knobs
Bitch offered me the pussy, so I took it
They call me a crook, 'cause that's short for crooked
Stayin' high as Hell, and drunk as fuck
You ain't down with the Mex, you can sick my duck
I mean duck my sick, I mean suck my dick
Don't laugh bitch, you know what the fuck I meant
And if I ever come back to the free World
I'ma take my Baby Girl out to Sea World

Can you tell the jury exactly what happened on the night of December second?

Second Verse:

My word is gold, now check, how the murder's told
Bring me back thirteen and my birth is sold
Learn the code, then meet me at the service road
Now you all understand what this person know
Servin' coke, seemed like my purpose so
I was the perfect mold of gangsta you've been searchin' for
But on a further note this cat tryin' to burn my dope
But since the day that Mama gave birth to Los
I heard them hoes, forever be first to smoke
Tryin' to jack a jacker, what's the purpose Loc?
Mercy no, 'cause he smiles and ain't heard the joke
Now he's in his blood, tryin' to write a cursive note
I snatch his (???) up, he looked like he turned to chrome
That boy got a date with Dirt, in the Earth below
With the worms, that hoe left on an early note
I seen him run the red light, and I heard she broke

Chorus

(Judge)

Do you have any last words before I give you your sentence?

Third Verse:

I spent a lot of time away from family and friends
The first song I wrote, was a song named ""Revenge""
Ever since then, my weapon was a pen
But I still kept a strap for those devilish men
Sucka better duck-a from the buck, buck, bucka!
Do a fly-by and shoot your aunt and your uncle
Does anybody understand the life of the trill?
Pigs and snitches get along 'cause they squeal

Bobby is the mix-breed, people think he's funny
Behind us in the Cougar and he's hoppin' like a bunny
Bird's keep flyin', I feel like a Hawaiian

Creepin Harrisburg, the party broke left

S.P.M.,"[Chorus]
She's in love with a hustla 
She don't be messing with them suckas 
Looking so good, little tight jeans on and G-string on 
And I know that she be feeling me 

She in love with a hustla', someone she could trust uh 
Someone she could get down with, cause she don't mess with suckas 
Sleep all day, and grind all night 
Living in the fast lane, the game's nothing polite 
So I'm laced up tight, cause I ain't into lagging 
She love to watch me in the mirror when I'm doing my stabbing 
And she ain't into punks, giving em bruises and bumps 
And she know I blow big, so she be twisting my blunts 
That's real talk, coming from a real hog on the block 
She love the playboy lifestyle, the knots and the rocks 
And even though sometime, it might seem strange 
She wouldn't trade it in, with none of she thangs 

[Chorus] 

Well now she might of caught my ass like once or twice 
But she'd rather stick with me, instead of rolling the dice 
Cause she know I'm official, so why take a chance 
And end up with a over jealous sucka' romance 
Love to see me get the lap dance every now and then huh 
Never fuck around with her stripper girlfriends huh 
Now that's living like, who's the boss 
Yeah she liking the money, but she loving my sauce 
Even though she approached by them big time ballas 
She ain't having that cause ain't another like papa 
And her parents just don't understand
What kind of man she in love with, 
But she don't give a damn 

[Chorus] 

One day we gone get it together 
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together
One day we gone keep it together

S.P.M.,"[Al-D (Z-Ro)]
Screw (what's the deal my nigga)
Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)
Al-D and Z-Ro (ha) South Park Mexican

[Chorus: x2]
I'll never forget, the times when we crawled together
I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

[Willean]
DJ Screw player, I'll never forget
Represent S.U.C., forever my set
I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe
It's your boy Willean, and I'm holding it down
Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live
And if S.U.C. get a deal, it's goin' be a hundred mill

[Al-D]
If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Smoke killer herb till my lungs collapse
Lost two grand last night shooting craps

Doing twenty-five in the federal pen
Wanna come home but he said until then
Could I look over his three children
They wake em up at five am for Fruit Loops
Draped in white overalls and black boots
Used to drive a Lac sipping gin and juice
Now we need money for some chips and soups
Run around town with a sack of rocks

And it sets my spirit free

A new born baby (haha Yeaahh)
I was once lost but now I’m found

Father please help me with the lyrics at hand
I don’t wanna misrepresent the miracle man
But I gotta dedicated a very special song
To the one who gave me everything and kept me strong
From a child you protected me and I kept you busy
Sold so many times that it missed me
Thank you for my mom, my abuela and others
My babies, my lady and the worlds best brother
My friends, my fans, I call it my family
Everything good that I got, you handed me
My only big sister, she’s on top of my list
She taught me how to write poems and now it’s my gift
Her hand was heavenly
Since 1970
Every hug, every kiss, every book she read to me
My dad might of left but he was always around
He became my best friend, I will die for him now

I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me

And it sets my spirit free

I was once lost but now I’m found

We all got Angels
Some you can see
I’m writing mine down I’m on 103
And I can keep on going till the end of my life
An incredible sight
An unforgettable ride
And it still ain’t over
Tho I’m deep in the struggle
You can still see my feet while I sleep on the rubble
Your boy still breathing and I ain’t trying to be even
Cause everything happens in this life for a reason
My heart is healing and my mind is seeking
My eyes are blinking and my rhymes are reaching
Every soul that is lost there is hope on the cross
People walk away like they don’t know what it cause
And I’m not saying that I’m any better than you
You will see for yourself if you stepped in my shoes
I ain’t blind but it’s times, I’m too stupid to see
But I just wanna show what Gods doing for me

I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free
I got Angels, you got Angels
We got Angels all around
Jesus save me
A new born baby
I was once lost but now I’m found

We all face obstacles and difficult times
We try to resolve them with our physical minds
Sometimes you gotta give us unreasonables
To him whom makes end possibilities possible
I know that it’s easier said then done
But just try your best and the rest will come
They gave me 45 long years up in prison
But I never let the tears interfere with my vision
I keep on moving, I can see things changing
I feel my soul strengthening and it keeps me patient
Knowing that I’m loved in a world so crooked
Jesus Christ died so the rest of us wouldn’t
There is only one truth and a zillion lies
That truth is NOT just for biblical times
And tonight, before I lay my head to sleep
Imma pray for the angels he sent to me

I got Angels on my shoulders
You can’t brush em off of me
Imma ride cause I’m a soldier
And it sets my spirit free

Guess yall hate the mexican
Maybe how the things changed
The accents, the restaurants
To you it might seem strange
But we have the same dreams
Want the joy that peace brings

The only day I didn't eat beans
Got gave us x-ray
To see pass the skin tone

Now that all the freeways buildin'
Throw me out the country

Had chopped down a plum tree

So we don't got no place to call home

But they do it all alone
And thats what I call bravery
Just one show thats saving us

It's no wonder the kids drug themselves to get out of here

I'm grinning cause I hear my echo in it
When you whisper to your infant
I'm glad I could be of some benefit
God bless, but the voice ain't the sound coming out of the hole
That's from deep down inside of your soul
Something ya'll need to know

Late at night I find it harder to rest easy bruh
It's like this heartache has no intention of easin' up
'Cause every twenty four hours is another homicide
And they keep telling me that being emotional is unreasonable
Now I'm just trying to find a way that I can maintain
So I turned this love affair with words into my main thing
Putting all the hope I got left in the vocal expression
And maybe the message will make the world amazing
And finally my daddy can understand me a little better
See why I gave up my B.A. for another set of letters
'Cause if he knew to what degree I sacrifice for the road
He might be prouder of the life I chose to go get us
But time's too precious to be wasted on the grudge between us
Ain't no bond greater than the share of flesh and blood between us
And we can make it through the toughest times together
If we let our guards down and just allow our love to lead us right",We Got This,2017

Hieß es für Gazi damals, erste Wohnung, Santa Fu
Ah, manchmal geht man in Knast
Auf der Reeperbahn nachts zu viel Jäger im Glas
Ein paar Fehler gemacht, trotzdem Tränen gelacht
Wenn du 'n Problem mit mir hast, komm, dann regeln wir das (was, was?)
Digga, dieser Part hat keine Message
Nein, weil Gazi will nur Scheine scheffeln (Scheine scheffeln)

Saafir,"I've been down this corridor -
Before you enter you have to bring
Back the creator of winter damn,
Too late I'm spoiled, I need the napalm
I got it, I shot it in my left sector,
Blew up the timing device on the reactor.
Time shifted I had to remold the floor
The foundation for creation - mate's blend
The pleasure dome into another roam -
A walk stalked nightly by the ogre
That's rarely sober. but there's no tracin
I see the place in the flow. I'm beyond dawn,
No I'm not in the lawn under pawns -
Don't rest, never possessed stagnate magnets.
I never pulled slits lips wit no braille skilled eyes -
Balls through eyesockets. I'm currently current
Currents of electricity; they can't get wit me
Invisible to the retina half - way reality part limbo.
A nervous laugh while ya climbin through windows,
Never spin ho's on merry-go-rounds,
Be the ground level for ghouls, schools of fish,
Victims on a hit list me like geronimo on a pratt -
Tackle patt tacklin patterns addin in seasonings, flavor.
No false teeth for beef, catapulting fingers to light
Switches so you can see the real, I feel the tension
My sight twitches - I'm bent.

Second scene: I'm the star in a step show
Around corners, the coroner's office;
Where my rep grows. I'm on some sort of drug
Like the president, it's evident that I'm noid,
A little bit of pizza - the riddle gets deeper.
I'm lookin for outs n ins, stolen isotonas,
The gloves, the bout begins three jabs on a transport
It's a sport for me to take another life on landing,
Branding wit a prattle prod designed by god.
It's my job to resign frauds,
The odd is against you got a degree in me,
So I know that I flow, credentials are essential -
It's blasphemy the type of shit they be askin me.
I don't feel the vibe, abstract art the veal
Doesn't heal this deprived stomach from a plummet.
Swinging on a duet with the bullet.
I never pull out for suspense - I'm on a bent mission.

Jack cousteau couldn't take it no deeper -
I'm a resident in davey jones micro-locker
Holds the phone, foamin at the mouth:
Mad dog, a taste, never had hog I'm droppin
The scrooge, makin fools hit the log - axe it.
I seen it beneath where the cowards hope
Trembled sleeper see if you can find the lost
Treasure through measures in bars - I'm bent.

I'm the first batter up Ahmad -- well then come widdit
All around the planet, pitchin, and no one hit it

Verse One: Ahmad

Well it's the nigger 'ole that caught Foot Lock
Cause the vibe keeps voxed in funk, makes you rock to the side
Gave it all I had, just to have what I got
Niggaz tryin to be bad, and they mad 'cause they not
Gonna defeat the rapper who got three ways to sack a
Quarterback I slaughter wack MC's with ease
These nuts what you get and a busted lip
What you have when you come at me with buster shit
All that graf given driven so I musta hit
Bought a Jag, chillin on the Shore just to dip
Get it right, cause I get it, night in and night out
I'm butter, covering up wack MC's like White Out
Don't doubt it that they dissed me OK rap is overrated
Who hate it that a nigga from the West blew up and made it
And I'd braid it if I had it but for now I keep it balded
Niggaz tryin to touch to me better stop before they get scalded
I'm hot, like a skillet and grits, crush you to bits
When I look over the room, and then lower the boom, and
Think that they can defeat the man that can't be beat
I do the breaststroke clown while you drown in three feet
Beep beep like robots on Buck Rodgers plus I bust
25th century rhymes so you decline
To battle anytime had skills since I was nine
Dope lines the only weapon that I cock, I never drop
I stop clones 'cause biting's never condoned
From the Westside 4th Avenue crew Jones

Verse Two: Ras Kass

My foramen magnum got 357 calibers
To bust a suckaz melon like Gallagher (pow)
Body chemistry consists of Hennessey, toxic melanin
With an adamantium skeleton like Wolverine
Child, my heart pumps kerosene
Son I spit butane, burn any bastard you name till I die
And even when I'm maggots, I'ma still be fly
Perpetrator, you're not the one
Your name's not Anfernee Hardaway
I'm like a wolf with blood dripping down the fangs
My techniques foul enough to shoot the flagrant technical
I be comin off the head rougher then ribbed tip recepticles
Expect the exceptional syllables to be the next man's umbilical cord
Catch distortion, ras cancels kids like abortions
Sendin niggaz to hip hop hell, ock
Eternal damnation through writers block
I rock over the results of Reeboks and sands
Stand ill, forget a live band just my mouth and hand
And even man wasn't prehensile
I'd still find ways to grip mikes, hold my tip when I piss
And pick off pubic lice
Cause see, I always been nice but first brothers slept
Now I've come back twice like Christ to resurrect the West
Check

We went all around the planet, pitchin, and no one hit it
I'm the third batter up, Saafir -- well then come widdit
All around the planet, pitchin, and no one hit it
I'm the third batter Saafir -- well then come widdit

Verse Three: Saafir the Saucee Nomad

Some spit it, but my saliva is liver
Spit stenches drenches been intricated, flow braggarts
Act cynic thyroid thermia hypodermic
How I earn it squeezing juices, one-hundred
Percent concentrated on easing nooses around the necks
Of tricks, probably won't get this
Thick hottie body carberuator
I'm the un-priggish well cat led bredded-well ill verse my
Will is ho gung for the fortune
Can spell hearse with the same Addams Family apple grapple hook
Crooked, flier I fly crooked
For the crew, Hobo Junction, in a few I'll plan
Father soldier and when they're older I'll teach them off
Killings of confidence and to be omnipotent with content
Accomplishment for gladiation I'm done
With training of explaining as the crates in plan be
Attack instructs me to hit the yak
I'm here, on purpose
The Nomadic, addict, merchant

If ya not broke, I'll save your face like dope and make it right

I like to malpractice, complicate a surgery 
Intoxicated, smoke cigarettes, drop ass in your gases 
feel the utensil, knife is dull like a pencil 
And what? 
When a nigga place pussy get fucked 
Without a kiss or a hug, like contaminated blood, 
Transfused from a junkie 
With the hair of Jones, I reconstruct the bones 
Of all hip hop clones 

I date fat girls that weight 215 
With low self esteem, cause it's easier to get the pussy 
I'm performing vinyl liposuctions 

Phat MC 

Phat production, motherfuckin' facial reconstruction 
Needles injected 33 RPM of anestic for ? to require cosmetic 
sex changes from bitch niggas to ra ra niggas 
the only cure for sick lyrics is to implant a hit gimmick 

This shit is full blown, you better head to the clinic 
After Captain Save A Hoe, we had the luitenit 
Operate get straight, we hear to separate the fake from the classic 
niggas get blasted if they plastic

I, never, wash my hands 
The only rubber gloves I wear is on my dick 
But I'll split you quick 
Like Jackie Chan, the way I switch my wristhand 
I make ya sick, but I'm a doctor, don't trip 
Hopefully, in surgury, I won't slip 
on a tile that file and twist ya lips 
Like Collin Powell 
Descriptions I'm overwrite 
For the ones that's over bitin' on dental records 
bitin', to God, send your blessings 
I'll put your mask on, fast like Romidon minks

A Large Professor, a Mad Scientist, with a long line of clients

Smoke a beady, scrape my lungs, smoke the resin

Got so-called writers, crashing into brick fences

Now you in my properties, but you have to pay my equity

For the lowest point in my character
I'll reach the highest place in the house when I rock
Like the Qu'ran, fuse hot, fluid with flavor like buillioncube
Been this way since I was fourteen

Rippin up tracks like immigrant Chinese, peep the game I lay

Saafir,"Slightly schizophrenic borderline psychotic 
Sensational recreational narcotics 
I thought I lost it but I found it 
Temptation marches along till I'm surrounded 
Inspired by fire the sensual illusion
Caught between the crossfire anger and confusion
Howl at the moon black blanket that's starlit 
I'm rarely romantic plowing through tramps 
And harlots madchild prevails tails of the unwanted 
Not to be taken for granted 
My past has come back and haunted for real 
I've all ready danced with death. a dozen black roses 
I pose with babies breath 
Be afraid a place where magic is made 
I'll rain on your parade with silver razor blades 
I'm creepin' over the fence crawlin' through your back yard 
My mind states intense 
Savage penetration on the rocks with a twist 
Now scream and shake your fists
Cause dreams are made of this

For real the opposite transmit telepathic 
Roamin' the flats with automatics and back packs 
Doin' jacks for Big Macs, accumulatin' stacks to make G's 
Nigga please, you artificial 

You dropped somethin', it's your heart 
An' it's still pumpin', pumpin' you from this existence 
It seems to be absolutely mandatory, 'cause you be manipulatin' skin 
But no way, because you fake I can trace out your image 
Even though you don't cast one, I smell a rat, I'm smellin' that 
Stay back at least 150 inches, 
You brew tea? an I know you know I can sense it 
With the nostrils innocently mixed with 6 hostile stenches 
Henceforth the elbow swings dinging, we bring whip to bleed scalps 
Swingin' sleep out your mouth 
How long you been hibernatin'? Too long! 
You're abiding and aiding a felon, to switch your melon 
Droppin' grammar like a judges hammer 
I feel you mark, feel me feel your chart 
You gotta be real an you gotta to have heart 
You gotta to be real an you gots to have heart 

Stir the blur, nuts and bolts whirl 
Stored in electric ports, 4 strong boxes of 10 floors 
Shift the weight towards the door, in hopes of escape 
When hands on cord, the blazing roof Prev creates 
Sound break, concord, eye of the condor 
Hand skills of a saboteur, your in for 
A war that pours coarse of molten into cords 
Strung by the young ones, put me on tour 
No folk lore horsemen for poison, pour in skin pores 

Soft rhymers, metamorphize their cartoon characters 
Grafted from Africa, in this game you got no stature 
Not even a factor in this 
Whole shit makes me yawn 
Snatch your heart out your chest like a '96 ghetto spawn
Antonym of urban, too feminine for this cut-throat mentality 
Have ? thoughts in my area, you get snatched out your Suburban 
Fallacy with no antidote, in this ? your age get broke 
Runnin' from gun smoke, ballin' never rumin' 
Silver spoons crumbin' from flavor 
Soon there will be no overseer to save ya 
When I delve, tell your podiatrist it's a size 12

Saafir,"Intro:
Yo Saafir what's goin' on playboy? 
Saafir: What's really goin' on? 

Huh, you tell me baby. 

Saafir:Hey, it's like this man. 
I gotta let these motherfuckers know how to crawl man. 

I know everybody tryin' to come up immediately. 

Saafir:You know they don't got the motherfuckin' perseverance cause they 
ain't have it hold up though. I gotta go and do this man.

Verse 1:
You can hear the ambition mobbin' in my po position
The intention is to come up 
Do your grindin' pay the boss before you floss
And don't lose your mind and find discipline' 
And stackin' your scratch 
So it don't come up missin' in
As you're askin' the Lord for guidance
While you ridin' 
Stickin' and movin' slidin' 
In and out the game
Unless you realize you're sprung before you legalize your funds
All you track hustlers that was made for the corner 
Dodgin' the coroner's office 
I'm tossin' this at you
Now on some sermon type shit 
I'm burnin' and I gotta write this
The mic got me ballin' 
Shot callin' 
It's the murk one like that 
Sit back but not in starship 
So I don't tarnish or rust 
When I'm bustin' on the next jerk
Who swears he's ballin' but can't network
You better off with sexwork
The way you fucked in the game
It's a shame
I'm aimin' at the bathroom stall on all of y'all
With the H.J.s deflecting these hate rays
Until the sun falls 
You acquired a dream
Crawl before you ball

Hook:      (x2)
What you thought?
You was just gonna ball on the spot?
Let's be real
You gotta stack dollar bills before you get a mil
Gotta handle business before you choose to chill or you fall
Crawl before you ball  

Verse 2:
All you pompous ass marks in Babylon yawnin' 
Becomin' another nigga spawnin'
>From the trenches 
The stench is unknown 
I've been crawlin' like a two toed 
Chameleon for so long 
Writing these songs and ridin' these thongs
With bracelets on they ankle bone
That's anxious to moan 
Like Neena Samone
Have a trick 
Sickin' thinkin' 
That we know it's on 
You better crawl before you ball man
Before you fall man
Keep ya hoes off your payroll
Unless they crawl with you 
And you know they all with you 
And even then they won't fall with you
I'm like fuck 'em
I got to 
It's a new sheriff in town his name is Reggie Mamoo
Ya hear?
More like Saafir
On a crawl 
By watch how daddy ball
I'm all ears and all eyes 
Recognize 
I'm crawlin'

Bridge:      (x2)
Baby baby let me kick my all to y'all
You gotta crawl before you ball
I've seen so many many soldiers fall
They didn't know you had to crawl before you ball

Verse 3:
You see gotta put in major work in at first 
Before you burst
Crawl before you ball but never lose your thirst
When you ballin' 
Or you gonna end up broke and butt naked with no garments on
While I'm makin' more cheese than Parmesian
Learn game at a fast rate
Apply it to my walk then stalk
I won't fall off cause I'm a put in that work
And I'm a stick to that plan 
Now I'm a stay down with my folleys 
The team then turn and brace God gave green
Going, going till I'm gone
I'm ballin'

Can I talk to why'all for a minute
See the game has become a lil twisted
See you gotta cat like me imma east coast playa
Str8 from up state
Then you got my man Cam he a west coast playa
Then you got my homey saafir..se he a westsiiiiderrr!!
And we get down like dis

[Cam:]
You See I'm standing strong
But still don't want to break no bread
Now why'all gonna think I'm wrong when I start going up side your head
Str8 left you for dead
And that's the reason why
I still be riding on these Niggaz like giddyup horsey ride
I'm on the wind on my saddle
Bout to herd up some cattle
Cut the head of a snake and save the rattle
You willing to battle
Partna but you fail to see you losing the war
I stand up for what I believe in not leaving enough to score
Bet to show that why'all can't ignore my rep for making people shout
Whether popping they ass on stage..or socking they ass on out
I'm like Luke on this money..Dont stop!
Get it Get it..down south they bout it! bout it!
But out west we Widdit Widdit
If you fools admit it
Maybe you wouldn't be on the ground
And everything would be OK I wouldn't have to lay you you down
why'all haters ain't doing me no harm I'm still rich
Just like Old Macdonald on his farm.bia bia ittch!

But I ain't scared of none of why'all

""I ain't scared of none of why'all watch how daddy ball"" too short (3X)

[Saafir:]
Now watch how daddy ball on all of why'all
While why'all plotting for my downfall
Always gotta watch my back around why'all
When I touch the turf, everybody slow down
Shit is getting worse, 'cause ain't no money in the town
For what its worth, I have to give my hustle a rebirth
Research another circuit, so I can really work it
I'm sick of sending ripples down the stream of ounces
In order to triple my scratch on the scheme of things I'm bouncing'
Outta town to get mined fuck these mousetraps
Niggaz fighting over cheese like rats
My whole family is against me, pullin out gats, what type of shit is that?
You got me strapped with a tight grip, 
when I'm around fools they tight lipped
But want to jaw jack me to death around a tight bitch
I know the script but while you stuck on some town shit
I be ballin nationwide bound bitch!

[Chorus (3X)]
[Saafir:]
One year later with from inflated plan
Just me and my man, touching back down in the town
But in the background, wishing into whispering
He's back! With all the scratch and all the contact
Now what why'all lack contracts mackin the gats (I got that)?
See I'm mobbing with a permanent plan, you say he came up quick (damn)
While you still on the corner standing in quick sand
You think you know what time it is, but your hourglass 
Let the hour pass right by you
Why fool? You should have taken more than an hourglass in high school
Instead of snorting dog coughing wit your tweaking ass
I speak fast, stick a move in and out
Now I'm the man with all the clout
Nothing but big shit, mobbing in big ass whips
Own big ships, floating on big battle ships
Fuck a yacht,I'm trynna own a block like the Jewish
Watch how daddy ball this year Saafir knew it!

Imma tell why'all one more time..listen!

Snipers are moving unseen
Fight for land, to lose it again
Shrapnel is filling the air

Hell on earth, the trenches mean death, better keep your head down low
Charge their lines, the ultimate test it's a synchronized sacrifice

Get the wounded after dark
Left alone in no man's land
Maddening chaos at the front

Dream of heaven
Angels are calling your name

Shells and guns, a rifle and scope
Bullets are wearing your name
Losing track of time and of space
Midnight at sanity's edge

Losing friends to artillery shells, at the break of dawn
Break their will, as yours has been broken, they're here alone, dream of home

Charge at dawn to gain a yard
Scout at night to guard their lines
Leave your life in fortunes hand

When the bullet hits it's mark
Know your time in hell has been served

Artillery leading our way
A million grenades has been launched
The nazis must pay for their crimes
The wings of the eagle has been broken

Serve me Berlin on a plate!
Disregard the losses
The city is ours to take

The price of a war must be payed
Millions of lives has been lost
The price must be paid by the men

Syria attacks Israel crushed their
Lines of defence
Ruling golan heights

[Chorus:]
6 days of fire 1 day of rest
June 67 taught them respect
Control Jerusalem

3 nations fallen in 6 days of war
Traitorous neighbours
Received as deserved
Under the sun in the dust of the war
1 nation standing stronger than before

First into Egypt and
Sent them to hell
Then turned their forces to Jordan
Climb up the mountains
Where Syria awaits
Break them in hours
Protect holy land

Once we were young
We have found our peace

Sleep 6 feet below

Cannot bring me back to life

Still brothers in arms

We have fought in distant conflict
And for all to many years
Seen our friends go down
Wounded dead or lost

Know that peace comes at a high price
It may take a thousand lives
And a deep belief

Buried deep deep in cold earth
Shallow grave in my motherland
Here I stay lay in darkness forever

Advancing on their foe

Rule is left to lesser men
Waiting for their chance

Listen, obey my command
Hear me, or die by my hand

Russian armies blocked their way
20 000 lost that day
They bled the ground

It was the jungle wars of '65
My weapon jammed and I got stuck way out and all alone
And I could hear the enemy movin' in close outside
Just then I heard a twig snap and I grabbed my empty gun
And I dug in scared while I counted down my fate
And then a big marine, with a pair of friendly eyes
Appeared there at my shoulder and said ""Wait.""

Well, we fought all night, side by side, we took our battle stance
And I wondered how the bullets missed this man
'Cause they seemed to go right through him just as if he wasn't there
And in the mornin' we both took a chance and ran
And it was near the riverbank when the ambush came
And I thought it was the end, and we were had
Then a bullet with my name on it came buzzin' through a bush
And that big Marine, he just swat it with his hand
Just like it was a fly...

I was awfully glad to see this big marine

When he led me outta danger I saw my camp and waved goodbye
He just winked at me from the jungle and then was gone
When I got back to my H.Q., I told 'em about my night
And the battle I'd spent with a big Marine named Camouflage
When I said his name, the soldier gulped, and a medic took my arm
And led me to a green tent on the right
He said ""You may be tellin' the true, boy, but this here is Camouflage
And he's been right here since he passed away last night
But before he went, he said Semper Fi, and said his only wish
Was to save a young Marine caught in a barrage
So here, take his dog tag, son, I know he'd want you to have it now""

How they play on my mind,
Now that darkness is falling and
Still there's no sign of my guide.

Either I have been betrayed-
They have left me to die,
Or worse still at this moment he lies-
An unwitting victim by brigands attacked,

Left naked and dead with a knife
In his back.
Childhood terrors return to me now,
From the rand stench of fear in

The sweat on my brow.
Deciet and despair are to me
Kith and kin,
Seduced into slumber-

My nightmare begins.
""Welcome - welcome to my domain,
I have been biding my time.
Watching and waiting -

But now you are mine.
Weaving the web that entwines you,
Like a puppet you play on the end
Of your strings 'till the end of

Daylight flees as night gives chase
I'm held in panics dank embrace,
I smother in his cold caress -The sum of all my worthlessness.

I have been told to thank the Lord
For all that He will send,
But if death should come to meet me -
Must I greet him as a friend?

Now I see that this quest is
A test of my fidelity -Has God forsaken me?
When maddness sings his lullaby a
Nightmare filled with unknown things -

To cast aspersion on my sanity.
Faith starts to flounder in
A mind torn apart,
My thoughts move in time with

The beat of my heart
A creature of habit
I make easy prey,
Cross faith and fire cannot

Hold at bay the beast that
Pursues me -
The end drawing near.
My soul keeps no secrets -

He knows what I fear.
Flying so high on the wingsOf a dream,
Over mountain and forest -
'cross river and stream.

While the creatures that feed
Off the doubts I invent
Await my arrival with evil intent.
""Welcome - welcome to my domain,

So in that twilight world that

Lies amidst life and death I dream,
And writhe in fitful slumber no-one
Hears mjy silent screams.
Except the horses head that stares

With black and lifeless eyes,
Atop its totem glaring as it mocks
My helpless cries.
Now I see that this quest is

A test of my fidelity -Has God forsaken me?

Nightmare filled with unknown things -
To cast aspersion on my sanity.

Casting shadows in the night,
I feel their breath upon me-
Catch their faces in the light.

Somnambulistic hunters come
To prey upon my fears -
As peals of psycopathic laughter
Echo in my ears.

Startled I waken from myDeath-like sleep,
Though fearful and shaken
I crawl to my feet.
Still my memories taunt me -

Like ghosts they appear,
Forever to haunt me when
Darkness draws near.

Then fleeing from the terrors

At the night before I leave,
The remenants of reality behind
Me 'neath the trees.

Pray that God will send -
His wisdom now to guide me

The birth of the world
To proclaim,
Your lives have been guided -
Decided by fate,
Unaltered by chamges that
You try to make.
The world nkeeps on turning -
Men still live and die,
Though many have questions
So few even try,
Searchfor the answers
That you have found here -
Unaware of the threads in

The web that is wyrd.""

Drowning in the waves which carry me
'cross oceans of tranquility,
Lulled by the eddies of my mind -
Washed up like flotsam on the
Tides of time.
I've no desire to return
From whence I came I came
Now I have learned,
Within us all resides
A dream of days not grey -
But evergreen...

And can you blame me -
Is it such a crime,
To crave for one small piece
Of Heaven that I can call mine?

For years I have waded
Through bland mediocrity,

Watched my hopes sink
In a mire of negation.
Yet why pay the cost for a
Paradise lost when here is
An Eden of natures creation?
- * -
All that is left of those
Times are my memories,
Days long since past into
Realms of antiquity.
Tales round the fireside
From old men who reminisce,
Speak of lost youth and
The age of 'Mythistory'.
Many a cold Winters night
She has come to me -
Easing my sorrows and
Soothing my fears,
In the dreams of this old man

A soft voice still comforts me,
Made young once more by
The words that I hear.

""Come walk with me through
The vale of eternity,
For you must know ere you go
I go with thee ...
I go with thee.""",Mythistory,1989
Sabbat,"In thoughts from visions of the night,
When deep sleep falleth out of sight.
Many a strange thing will you dream -
Though it is never what it seems

Awakened from my troubled sleep -
Where dreams once lost as
Nightmares creep,
To steal my soul and suffocate
What sanity remains.
My anger mute -
My anguish blind
Within this sad fragmented mind,
Your eyes the spark to light fire
That burns away my pain.

Protected by reality-
Yet you still fear the beast in me,

Your reckless tongue could be the key,
You'll be the first to die
If it breaks free.

Alone tonight-
Myself and I,
On raven wings our spirits fly.
All hope has fallen out of sight,
Without the wit or will to fight.
I face up to my destiny-
You'll see another side to me,
A love that dare not speak it's
Name is born tonight of sweat and
Flame and ...

Wildfire - hallucinations
Fill my mind with
Wildfire - a love so strong
That it is blind.
Wildfire - a dream of such

Intensity,
Wildfire - it verges on
Insanity.

Protected by reality-
Yet you still fear the beast in me,
Your reckless tongue could be the key,
You'll be the first to die
If it breaks free.

In screams of raw emotion
Down my cheeks the tears flow,
With my tongue tied I damn these
Eyes that let my feelings show.

Bursting with frustration -
Feel the cancer eat my mind,
Flirting with damnation -
To all dangers I am blind.
Twisted and contorted -
Forsaken and forlorn,

Like the love you have aborted -
Yet tonight I am reborn in ...

Wildfire - we're like the
Spider and the fly,
Wildfire- upon your web
Ensnared am I.
Wildfire - bound by threads
That hold me tight,
Wildfire, so sweet the kiss
So cruel the bite.
How could you be such a fool,
To dare to break the golden rule?
Yet in the light of day I see
That you were right -
The fool is me!
In screams of raw emotion
Down my cheeks the tears flow,
With my tongue tied I damn these

Eyes that let my feelings show.

Bursting with frustration -
Feel the cancer eat my mind,
Flirting with damnation -
To all dangers I am blind.
Twisted and contorted -
Forsaken and forlorn,
Like the love you have aborted -
Yet tonight I am reborn.

Now muy futile cries for help
Are drowned in laughter.
Searching though I know I'll
Never find what I'm after.

I seek a release from this
Web of deceit -
Now my terror is growing.
There is no escape
From my fate

It's too late -
All my fears are showing.
Though I'm running from
Something that just isn't there -
The panic is real,
And you must be blind for
My words cannot hide the
Heartache I feel ...

Please God help me now.",Wildfire,1989
Sabbat,"""I have wealth beyond measure-
My treasures are words
Forged by time in a tale of
Such beauty they cry to be heard.
Still a young fool was I as
My story begins,
Yet like all fools considered
Myself to be wise -
A match for all things.
But the lessons I've learned
I will never forget,
When your teacher is life then
Success is survival and
Failure is death.

From early years I saw the world
Through tunnel-vision eyes,
My cloistered mind philosophized
And fossilized,

Secure in my belief was I -
Assured throughout my life the
Only things that could sustain me
Were the words of Jesus Christ.""

""There is no way to fight a foe
Who strikes from the inside,
And once within we can begin to
Smite this pagan pride.
We shall take their graven images
And grind them in the dirt,
For that men can live in paradise
Must be the Devils work.""

[BROTHERS OF THE HOLY ORDER:]
""The clerical conspiracy begins,
We shall wash away your sins-
We have come to purify,

Absolve you of all sanity,

We shall provide.""

""How can we hope to save these
Heathen when we know not of
Their ways,
One of us must journey southward-
Infiltrate and then assuage.
Only when we have this knowledge
Can we finalise our plans,
Greet them with a velvet glove-
Then crush them 'neath an iron hand.""

Christian soldiers armed with virtue-
Hearts afire with blind obsession
Cannot see the difference 'twixt

Compassion and oppression

""These were the days I believed that
Salvation was mine,
When I worshipped apostles
Believing their gospels to be divine.
My life drifted by in a warm summer haze-
And I thought I would bath in the light
Of our lord 'till the end of my days.

But destiny mocked me-
And fate did bequest,
That the strength of my faith in
The Lord God Almighty be put to the test.""

""My son your word is matchless as
A scribe you have been blessed,

Your skill and faith in God doth
Qualify you for our quest.
You will sail to Southern England
And recount their blasphemies,
For the first step in their cure
Must be to learn of theit disease.""

""For one so young so great an honour
To be chosen for this task,
Have I the stength-
Would I be worthy?
Questions that I dared not ask.
Was I to be a missionary searching
For lost souls to save-
Or just another pawn in their
Monastic power games?""

I learned what had to be,
That I must tour these foriegn shores-
My cross for company.
Those who had preceded me
Of pagan devils warned-
With fearful tales of christian souls
Since martyred on their horns.

In my tale I will tell how we
All were decieved-
For in truth I was hunted not
Hunter as I had believed.

How could I have known that the
Guide they'd provide was to
Show me far more than I'd ever
Imagined I could have desired?
So soon would I learn
What a fool I had been,
There is more than one side to a coin-

Beware your future at hand,
Alas for thou art dammed.

Forwards and backwards to damn me to Hell.

Jehova I beg thee have mercy on my soul.
Be gone foul beast that stands before me,
My God! The midnight hour chimes,
Oh Lord have mercy he comes for me,

I cry - but terror takes my scream,
And now my future is at hand,
Also for I am dammed.""

Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes

Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a los 17 [To Be Seventeen Again],1992

'Cause the best of sounds always led the way
It was shining through, what it meant to you
Always stayed so real, that's how we feel

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Con este tango nacio el cielo y con un grito
Salio del sordido barrial buscando el cielo
Conjuro extraño de un amor hecho carencia

Que abrio caminos sin mas ley que su esperanza
Mesclas de rabia, de dolor, de fe, de ausencia
Llorando en la inocencia de un ritmo jugueton
Por tu milagro de notas agoreras
Nacieron sin pensarlo las paicas y las grelas

Luna en los charcos, canyengue en las caderas
Y un ansia fiera en la manera de querer
Al evocarte, tango querido
Siento que tiembran las baldosas de un bailongo
Y oigo el resongo de mi pasado

De alquitrán en la voz
Siete notas 
Empapadas de alcohol 
Campanadas 
En el fondo del mar
Carcajadas

Con un loro 

Que blasfema en latín
Le hacen coro 
Los “sultanes del swing”

Con un trombón y bombin 
De Nueva Orleans

When it come down to loving, it's a perfect fit
Whole heap ah more loving and we just nah quit
She can't tek the vibe of Babylon dem spirit

Straight up loving and ah nah no bull

Me glad,well, ah she a get di money
And a spend di wad
'Cause me know the chumpas

Will not be squandered, she mek me start sing
Some Ray Charles ballad
'Cause the style of the loving is not just a fad

She need a lover to hug and squeeze her tight
She need a man to come home at night
But he's always working that's what she say
I had to tell her, go home and pray

She needs my love
She said she needs my love
She need my love

Sabor a Mi,"Tanto tiempo disfrutamos de este amor
Nuestras almas se acercaron tanto así
Que yo guardo tu sabor
Pero tú llevas también
Sabor a mí

Si negaras mi presencia en tu vivir
Bastaría con abrazarte y conversar
Tanta vida yo te di
Que por fuerza tienes ya
Sabor a mí

No pretendo ser tu dueño
No soy nada, yo no tengo vanidad
De mi vida doy lo bueno

I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone-cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know

I know I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
Oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday you'll get better

Something's gotta give and something's got to break

Someday it's gonna give, can't always be this way

And if the riptide comes to get me
And pulls me under, it won't upset me, I'll go down

I'll throw the white flag of surrender
Knock me down, not forever, just for now

Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated
I should’ve played it cool, instead I made a fool

Here comes another one and it's so intoxicating
Being where I’ve been I know that in the end
I’ll do it all again

Sabrina Setlur,"I'm on lonely street age nearly three
Recently Mama's crying all the time 
Is it because of me or my younger sister, 
Even Dad was weeping when he kissed her.
Face all puffy like a blister, 
Crying like he missed her. 
Since we moved away from the house,
Where we used to play.
They say I'll understand on day but I doubt it, 
Mama never say nothing about it. 
How'd it get to be so crowded.
I found it a strain, everywhere I look I see pain.
And I can't escape the feeling, 
Maybe I'm to blame. 
So I strain to listen, 
Praying for a decision, wishing they where kissing.
This feels like extradition or exile, 
Mama finds it hard to smile
So I make pretend cups of coffee in her favorite style.
She says child I'm working so there's nothing you lack.
But she know I want my Dad I want my family back.

I'm on Lonely Street, age forty three.
Couldn't gauge when to quit so my wife quit me.
Took offense, took the kids,
I wish that was the end.
But before she took her leave 
She took care of my best friend.
Working all the hours. 
God send was not the tactic
You see, because after ten years I'm
? Wanted to make the cash
Quick so I had to work real late. 
Bad sex, my woman's vex, even if I stay awake.
And if I'm honest, I had a little cake at the office.
I was eating. We'd do our cheating over coffees,
Making tea for the bosses. 
Making free with me,
And I agree I got sleazy too easily.
But I'm forty three, 
This doesn't usually happen to me.
Now I'm lonely, 
I wonder what my son's doing today.
Suddenly I'm blinking like the screen 
On my computer display. 
And I'm drinking.
Concerned about what's down the track 
If I don't get my family back.

I want my family back

I'm on Lonely Street, number fifty three.
Boarded up property, 
I'll probably get pulled down.
Litter all around inside there's 
No sound and no light.
But yo it gets busy at night, People creeping.
Derelicts sneaking to fix. Speaking.
On the way my timbers creaking,
Roof leaking. And bricks coming loose, 
Knee high in refuse.
But even though I'm a slum,
I'm still of some use.
There was a time when my walls where decorated.
And under my roof children where educated.
But now paint's faded, windows are all smashed,
A crash in the economy robbed me of my family.
And no strategy, combats negative equity,
So that's it. Like violence it's drastic.
I'm freaking, and seeking to be 
More than just a house for crack.
Somebody bring my family back, reverence",Bring My Family Back,1999

Sabrina Setlur,"Es könnte mich nicht weniger interessieren
Ob du tot bist oder lebst,
Ob du gesund bist oder krank,
Ob du Krebs hast oder Aids,
Mir geht's am Arsch vorbei
Du Wichser reißt mein Herz entzwei
Millionen Teile aus Schmerz und die
Sind schwer wie Blei
Meine Gedanken kreisen wie'n Adler
Immer wieder um die selbe Kacke:
Wie geht's ihm, wo ist er,wo war er
Hat er an mich gedacht
Wie ich an ihn denk
Merkt er nicht wie er mich kränkt
Ich will doch nix geschenkt
Da fängt die Scheiße von vorne an
Ich greif' Rosen
Und fass' Dornen an
Du bist für mich gestorben Mann
Hast alles verdorben
Am Anfang war's lieblich
Du sagtest du liebst mich
Warst friedlich und niedlich
Und ich wusste ich lieb dich
Das gibt sich doch
Denn heute bist du der kühlste Mann
Oberlockerer superduper Chabo
Wie fühlt sich's an?
Ziehst du dir darauf nen Hass, Alter
Macht dir das Spaß?
Ich scheiß' auf dich
Das war's
Du liebst mich nicht

Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht
Und deshalb lieb ich dich jetzt auch nicht mehr
Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht

Ich weiss das die Welt groß und schlecht ist
Hart und ungerecht ist
Dass jeder Depp ein Hecht ist
Und das, was er labert meistens Blech ist
Aber mein Pech ist
Dass ich vergesse was ich weiß
Deshalb dreht sich wohl mein Scheißleben
Auch in 'nem Scheißkreis
Ich reiß mir 'n Arsch auf
Und wart drauf
Dass du's erkennst
Wusst du eigentlich dass du laberst
Wenn du pennst?
Du nennst mich manchmal Namen von Alten
Die du mal hattest
Sagst was obermattes wie
„Ich lieb' nur dich“
Und erwartest dass ich stolz bin
Denkst du dass ich aus Holz bin,
Du Arsch?
Kommst nach zwo Minuten und schnarchst
Und fragst mich vor deinen Jungs:
„Wie war ich?“
Meistens spar ich mir mein Kommentar
Du findest mich sonderbar
Alter, du bist faker als 'n Wonderbra
Schlechter als der Sommer war
Kälter als der Winter
Laberst mich voll von wegen Kinder
Und ich denk' nur jetzt spinnt er
Die Rinder, der Wahn
Oh bitte, erbarm!
Das werd' ich mir ersparen
Du liebst mich nicht

Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht
Und deshalb lieb ich dich jetzt auch nicht mehr
Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht

Ich wünsch' dir zum Abschied 'n beschissenes
Gewissen mit Gewissensbissen
'ne Seele voll mit Rissen
Und dass du lernst mich zu vermissen
'n Kissen dass nur leer liegt
Und ewig davon zeugt
Das die Alte die da mal lag
Dich verabscheut
Und heute noch bereut
Irgendwann mit dir zu tun gehabt zu hab'n
Schick' deine Rosen deinen Schlampen
Die auf Blumen abfahren
Bei mir tragen sie keine Früchte
Wie Gerüchte und Lügen
Du hast mich viel zu oft belogen
Und betrogen
Du wirst mich niemals mehr betrügen
Mir genügen die Erinnerungen
An die Scheißtage im Bann von' nem
Beschissenen Mann
Ich kann heute kaum noch glauben
Wie sehr man sich erniedrigt
In Zeiten die widrig sind
Für Scheiße die man nie kriegt
Aber wie blickt 'ne Alte den Dreck
'wenn se' verliebt ist
Das gibt es
Und das is' dein Glück
Aber du versiebst es
Locker und lässig easy come and easy go
Fick dich und deine ganze beschissene Show

Du liebst mich nicht

Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht
Und deshalb lieb ich dich jetzt auch nicht mehr
Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht

Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht
Und deshalb lieb ich dich jetzt auch nicht mehr
Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht

Du liebst mich nicht

Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht
Und deshalb lieb ich dich jetzt auch nicht mehr
Du liebst mich nicht
Du liebst mich einfach nicht
Du liebst mich nicht",Du Liebst Mich Nicht,2000

Descansaron en un bar 
Con mejicanos margaritas 
Dos chicas: una sabe mentir 
Eligen una mesa un par de tragos

También te aplauden a vos
Y si me caigo una vez

De cigarrillos que queman
De cables putas y dios
Y de esta gente que espera

Corriendo atrás de su amor
Una pianola de azul
Muy vieja, adulta y sin voz

Y se abre como una flor
Ante un acorde sutil
Y cierra su corazón

So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle

On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Hearing guitars like someone in love.

Fin to put it all in why'all face

I bought a new Lac and put it on chrome, without touching my stash
Like Lil Flip I can do that, Excursion candy blue tha?
Twenty two that, pounds of dro I done blew that
You should of knew that, the Slim Thug gon' shine
My ear rings cost a dime, I read Rolex Times
I'm top of the line, you can tell when I open my mouth
I bet nobody got mo' princess cut teeth, than the Boss
Open your mouth up you lost, I'm blinding these boys
I'm joining rocks in your blocks, in candy blue toys
Talking noise, 'cause I ain't old enough to drank
But I got mo' cash to last, than your daddy in the bank

S-Type Jag straight off the lot, believe me dog I'm really hot
I'm swanging four's and thinking thoed, banging hoes and changing clothes
Smoking dro and doing shows, paper stack can never fold
I bought the car and I bought the house, I represent the Dirty South
Got more syrup than Waffle House, run through hoes like Marshall Faulk
I talk the talk and walk the walk, 'cause nigga I'm a G

'Cause I wear a Roley, that look like a snowman
And I push a Jag, you just gotta see it man

You see them rocks in my teeth, ain't none of em fake
Give me a break, you think I'm lying or something
I'm at the mall with your hoe, and she buying me something

Pull a Bentley off the lot, and ran that thang in the wall
We throw Crys in the air laugh, and watch it fall
Watch me ball, as the Dub spin like a top
I got crunk when I stopped, and made my pop trunk wop
Girls bop, automatic cause I'm top of the line
I cut my beep past six, and I raise the top of your spine
I'ma shine, Sucka Free, Boss Hogg in a row
You can catch me fresh and braided, or rugged and fro
You see the Spre's on the car, I bet you my people like the rock
When girls see Tite, Flip and Slim they say... pulling cameras out
Damn I'm hot, when I hit the club I'm bound to line to the bar
And for the first hundred people, I'm insuring they car

Welcome to ""Animal House"" 
The animals are in the building
It's a new day

[Verse: Angie]
Angela... Better known as Angie
We are animals... Animal House... wut we are... animals
Uh yeah uh yeah uh uh uh yeah uh uh
All I could do is give you me if you choose to believe it's on you
I live in peace I could sleep but I don't choose I'ma animal the promos
The station, the movies rap Rebecca Lobo
I run elbows with people you couldn't a ""Hello"" from
With a mask and a gun you don't gotta ask how come or where I'm at
I work! I want to make that clear to cats
Nuttin's free and no you can't run to me
I'm ten years deep you to young for me
You could sleep while I drop album number three and 
Yeah you could hate but somebody lovin' me
Evidently number one at 3 with videos on MTV 
You could learn from me then it's back to the streets can't be serious
Haha that isn't funny album still sold can't be curious

[Chorus]
Animals that's how it is that's how we are
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we
Animals-straight beasts 18 hours a day work no sleep 
We are animals that's how it is that's what we are we are animals
Walk with our heads up high 'cause we animals- straight beasts
18 hours a day work no sleep

[Verse: Sacario]
You ain't know em like the highway patrol
I stay on a roll like Joe Smooth on your back I got creative control
A vocal coach shows singas how to flow
When our engineers songs we verb highs and lows if the shit ain't clear
This year I hope you chose to retire or expire 'cause what I propose is a resonation 
'cause the animals is aqua now and all your deticated fans is rolling with me now
I gotta lock to the 5 0 1 n 3 now you gotta watch you can rhyme doin them freestyles 
I rather not just do it I make records and write sixteen bars in 500 seconds 
It's Sacario AKA Mr. Guntalo BDS news track
My spins is a problem so BMI throw me parties
My publicin is lots a dough we animals get me and ""ang"" espacio

[Chorus]
[Verse: Angie]
Look I'ma professional (I'ma professional)
I'm not stressing you I do what's best for me
You do what's best for you (best for you)
I'm not concerned with the bullshit 
Never was (never was) I'm wouldn't check that respect that
I meant 'cause bloods, kings, nietas, and zulus (zulus)
All over this world most who do you
I put in work interviews, shows, promos, rehearsals, reverse moves
All of that shows back to interviews
No time for self, none nigga drive-through diner
No time for my health I'm dyin' hehe
I wonder how I'm surviving myself
Angie OG baby got the title in belt
Queen (quueeeeeeeeeeeeeeen) of hip-hop radio

[Verse 1: Angie Martinez]
If I can chose a place to go it gotta be far away
From here we could crossover like Hardaway
Somewhere outside the states where tomorrow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2 ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Verse 2: Sacario]
And, if I can go, with you
Oh boy we 'bout to make a lot of people annoyed
And cry you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
And boy with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Huggin Tato after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name hold weights the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week back to you

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all
I'll get my things, soon as you say, baby vamos, we'll fly away

[Bridge: Lil' Mo]
You can fly away, no one has to know
Will you take me with you, cause if I can go
Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

[Angie Martinez]
Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

[Sacario]
And a seat, know why? the window cause I like to see
And seein as to how I'm so fly me and the clouds can speak

[Angie+S] 
And, since we 'bout to go, in a few

Go 'head

[Angie Martinez]
Oh, I just wanted to tell Trace thank you
That week off I'm grateful what was you tryin to say boo?

[Sacario] 
Nuttin just grab my chain off the table and 2 way too

[Angie Martinez]
Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario]
And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em

([Sacario:] True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow
If I can go, contigo, I'll tell my friends, nothing at all

Sacha Baron Cohen,"My band of soaks, my den of dissolutes
My dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts
My sons of whores spend there lives in my inn
Homing pigeons homing in
They fly through my doors
And they crawl out on all fours

Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks
Rooking their guests and crooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be

Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor
Doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing
Everything has got a little price!

Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus! Won't I bleed 'em in the end

Master of the house, quick to catch yer eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperon
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone

Food beyond compare. Food beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome
Bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges
Plus some little extras on the side!
(Yes yes oh Santa!)

Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks I knows
How it all increases, all them bits and pieces
Jesus! It's amazing how it grows!

(Oh, sorry love. Let's get something done about that)
I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?

Master of the house? Isn't worth my spit!
Comforter, philosopher' and lifelong shit!
Cunning little brain, regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted living with this bastard in the house!

Master of the house!
Master and a half!
Comforter, philosopher
Don't make me laugh!
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Hypocrite and toady and inebriate!

Everybody bless the landlord!
Everybody bless his spouse!

Raise it up the master's arse
Everybody raise a glass to the Master of the House!",Master of the House,2012
Sacha Boutros,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river

We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,

Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2008

Opposing lessened armies, they say are here to stay
But no one knows until we try, what we all can do

Than I've ever been hurt before
Every day that I'm without you hurts just a little bit more

And he's walking with his head down to the ground

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2007
Sadat X,"[Chorus: 2x]
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys
Wild cowboy, it's the wild cowboys

[Sadat X]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All of y'all out there might think that I'm strange
But the wild cowboy never lived on no range
The only prairie I seen was in the library
And the last Indian I seen was headin towards Cleveland
y'all can believe in what y'all believe in
But stop the bullshittin and deceivin
When the O.K. Corral bell rings for the winter
I'ma flash back to '79 with Thelma drinkin wine
You could see that it was me even with that small screen
Al Green had a major string of hits
And I want to be like him, in the fact, that each one was a gem
My man Mashburn is killin 'em down in Dallas
I seen him one day after this bullshit show called Alice
The wild cowboy is hard to resist
Make the play, get the assist, girlfriends hate genesis
Me and Diamond D +Dug+ deep In The Crates
Been rhymin for high rates, did wild show dates
My name is X yo my name is X, worth more weight than gold
Precious than your baby who's a year old
Step to war without your armor, results in trauma
Mad drama, I'm the mad bomber
Young girls stay away 'cause I'm dangerous
I'm a grown man, don't force my hand
I'll judge off 'cause I can (Cuz I can and I will..)

[Chorus]

[Sadat X]
Hey I got a lot of family on both sides of the tracks
Some is livin positive while others is sellin crack
Two sides to livin yo step up and place your vote
Like a 'murder that she wrote,' hey that's my own qoute
Now should I clear myself for samples?
Or make cats examples of my cowboy status Boyd Roger?
You ever see Oliver Twist and his boostin man Dodger?
Takin wallets in the street, sign my name in the wet con-crete
A big X, so wide ya break ya fuckin legs
For me to be dead-ass, have bread and water in a tall glass,
is lunacy, madness, and I ain't on no badness
But in this point in time I can't take no backward steps (Uh-uh)
I like crisp, green, money, and a lot of it
In big bills, 'cause money right here make this whole world spin
Say you went on a gin, 'cause honey go home with strange men
Dance by the light of the silvery moon
Then wake up in the mornin with the hay in your eyes
Your purple with that herpes bump, who want the rump?
Some niggas joint got a lump from that late night hump
What does it take to be a cowboy? Hold on down boy
'cause I don't got no contracts in my pockets
Kids run up our amp like they stuck they hands in sockets

[Chorus] 2x

[Sadat X]
I rule uptown to Nairu with an iron fist
Grand Master, national titlest
I string people out, plus I bring people out
So Heineken's across the board for all my men
Check it out, I'm verse for now but I'ma do this again
Remember the wild cowboy's in the heart's of all men
But then again some kids ain't never gonna win
And they'll be played in here

[Chorus]

[Sadat X]
Yeah, Nubian style, so versatile
Win by a mile, sack a pen and pile
One nineteen and one twenty
8th Avenue, 7th Avenue
1st Avenue, 2nd Avenue
3rd Avenue all the way to Amsterdam
And Broadway, and even more
And Castle Hill, money fill the bill
And haha, ya don't stop
To my man Marcus Mark, ya don't stop
To my man Early Bird, ya don't stop...",Wild Cowboys,1996
Sadat X,"No diggity, Bronx style yeah, yeah


1-   In the daytime, on the late night
     In the morning, on the wake-up
     In the daytime, on the late night
     In the morning, on the wake-up
     In the daytime, on the late night
     In the morning, on the wake-up

[Verse 1]
Men's words can't describe the great X
Is it the shoes or the fantastic
That got cha' callin' out to ya girlfriend
Boo banged who last night
Made the man leave baby
Forget about Stanley
For real I came charged off the Staten Isle
I'm like three or four down twisted
Givin' away smoke
Sweatin' takin' off my coat
Money walked by all fly and dropped my drink on my leather
And now my shit is fucked up
And now I gotta do with dollar bill I see potential
And I got a eye for spottin' kind of like Spike
Miss Chocolate, Miss Brown, Miss Black
Miss Long Legs, hey I'm ready to wrap
Can't do that
A vision of the deep, dark soul of home
And claimin' niggas with dro
Hey watch the honey roll, check it
Surround sound hides ya crass
Tell ya neighbor lies
No that wasn't me that was my cousin
Hey you're a school girl
But hey you're in a different world
You're a fly chick
Now ya want to learn a different trick

[Hook: with 1 repeated in background]
Now can I do it again, do it again
Steady do it again, do it again
And then ya do it again, do it again
Steady do it again, do it again
And then ya do it again, do it again

[Verse 2]
Life is slim put me on to a game
Had a lot of style in that last profile
Got her nails filed and her hair done weekly
A real name thrower, y'all niggas know her
Talkin' about garbles comin' out in ten
Drinkin' goblets of gin and ain't givin' up trim
Tease a nigga, make em' want to squeeze a trigger
They say a woman's best is diamonds and a man is a dog
Better come in from that fog that you swimming in
Brown skin, laid out in bed is real feminine
I'll put that R. Kelly on ya
Fingers have some smelly on ya
The boy's dry humps are now man pumps
Can he go deeper than the explorer
120th street horror
Let's get naked by the laptop
Can I snap and pop
You can squeeze and then stop and be all up in that piece
I'm the late night window climber, you are the rhymer
Ya mom thought you heard you wouldn't be fuckin' in the house
Not you momma's sweetheart, undercover freak-heart
Imagine if she would've seen us intertwined and pretzel style
Legs and arms, hummin' with the radiator clickin'
Our soft patience quickin'
I couldn't slow the pace
I bust off three nuts and man the sun's in my face

[Hook: with 1 in background]

[Verse 3]
I'm turnin' around handlin' things and then BAM!
A toss of that ass hit me like out of nowhere
And hey like a flashback honey
There was a one should slipped off since day one
Check it out, now can I do it again
Sure I can do it again
You're on some friction, bring along ya friend
See how the world turns
Look beyond the floor burns
At least I have concerns
I didn't take it like a chicken
I love ya sexually plus intellectually

Chest bucked out with your head wide open 
Hopin  to spot  a chip in this frame 
I lived and died by the burnin flame 
Of the OK Corral  Cowboy style 
From the Quarters on down to Colorado's 
Big niggaz from uptown  ridin into Tahoe's 
Saloon settin  kids is walkin round 
Drinkin whiskey and scotch, strictly out of shotglasses

There's women in garter belts and ciggarettes 
And on the side there's the price game 
Niggaz is playin the price game 
Indian Red, was bangin niggaz in the head

Walk in the New York terrority 
On the back of a tree, there's a picture of me

Half-pipes to scramblers, and free for Wild Cowboys 
You never bring decoys if you want to make real nouse 
The bigger the stick, the bigger the fire 
I never hit a man in the back, a coward acts like that 
Lay out my black hat cause I feel like the bad man 
Who on the rise, the D's to Manhattan 
Let's walk the thirty paces on the Now Rule races 
Oh it's the Marshal Cooper, and I love how he doin this 
Women sayin don't get hurt, and I ain't plannin on it 
Ten steps taken as I hit the blam factor 
His dick to act up, was death the benefactor 
Leave him twitchin in the dirt like Cousin Harold from the Menace 
I'm in this to win this on the great wide trail 
I'm ten times as bad as John Wayne, could ever be

Joe Tex was the biggest hombre from the projects 
Had all the work locked down, so he thought 
But he drank and got loose lipped, let a lot of news slip 
Stripped of his game and got his self murdered

Sadat X,"Verse One:

People often see me in jams, and be thinkin I'm high
No that just be my lazy eye
What's your reply to the evidence against you
Your girlfriend found one hand just one loan credit
Exclaimed you was fuckin you claim downtown
where Fred can beat that, win that, quick nigga wins the ballgames
Tailwind nose is a must on any con any truck
When riding on luck you catch an empty
Riding on the wave is real good, suave bola
You be playin the low low, while your girlfriend be like, ""Oh no!""
I seen it with my own eyes and I know that it was him
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Episodes of Free Willy bring strife in your life
You can flip and use the gift of gab, but don't waver
If you love your girlfriend, then you better save her
Cause the next man is eager, to run up in yours
Be in her drawers, put your girl on her fours
Sometime's the girls game's tighter than a sloppy ass nigga
I got my girl locked down hey that's the truth nigga
She gone away for the weekend, man she right uptown
Runnin around with my man Boogie Brown
I keep your arms in the air, your feet on the floor
While you're over there frontin with these kids
your girl's givin jaw

Chorus:

I been doin my own thing (2X)

Verse Two:

Oh you got your own dough, from where I don't know
You hold degrees from two universities
Girl you're worth cheese in the nine-seis
Sadat owns apartment keys, is it Alize for Dolo
You got a mind on top of that spine plus the lump lump
Highly educated and highly motivated
Workin girl skirt tight love to hurt
What to exert, I break your next man's pocket
Smell of freak fragrant, unlike the vagrant
You can pay the rent always, and don't be gettin hallways
In the bed girlie and at work by nine
Put on the work force ridin on a iron horse
Bring it home to dad, the one piece cause I'm here
Workout baby doll and keep yo' career
No chiggedy, no diggedy, not you
Glad that I got you, when I did
Cause you was runnin wild with this out of style kid, no class
Light in the ass, white enough to pass
Shotproof glass for the midnight mass

Chorus

Verse Three:

I have seen this chick at the bar, furiously she was searchin
She want to wet her whistle with the glass of bubbly
She want the Willie Dom not the cheap sherry
Tryin to front with the outfit that's goin back tomorrow
Now she's makin me dream, if she played to force it
Dom she want to toss it, back in that
Jet when the bottle's gone and that's a fact
Give you the wrong number knowin it's the wrong number
Front on a nigga never that, not I
If you see me at the bar it's dry throat
because I'm keepin these hoes dry
Hey lookie there there's Harlem Slim!
Lookin at me, but then you're walkin with him
I be a little old for them young girl games
I know a lot of tricks but I ain't namin no names
One burnt my man, left his beef in flames
Actin ill wild like the untamed dames
Just came to mingle where I flowed the river Thames
When I was young in the clubs they played Cool James
Get rich without jail, is one of my aims
You remember Good Times, with courderoy jeans

Chorus (repeat 2.5X)",The Lump Lump,1996

Yeah, Wild Cowboys, 1-2-1-2, yeah.
Diamond D, D-I-T-see, the Crates.
Brand Nubian still up in here, no question.
I'm Shawn Black, so stop asking me questions.

This solo thing I'm doin' here is real to me,
The most serious thing in my life, I can say up to this point.
My reputation is at stake, this where the men are mad
Separate, me from the sons put me with the big guns.
My energy now radiates from leads, grow trees.
I'm every time like crime on frustrated black men.
Hey you, and ya buddy, why y'all both need to study.
That my past records shows, my pros is untraceable
Flows will lace that ass, full fold in and
I'm nice now, five years ago way back in the beginning,
When I was runnin' in back yards,
While people was playin' cards
And eatin' barbecue, I'm one of the only few
Sayin' take that pork off ya motherfuckin' fork.
Then they would front and cut out the mic,
And I'd be out on my bike.
Now Lil' Mo was there, Marvin Spark was there;
This is in the eighties now, the start of my long career.

Move on, black man, move on.
Move on, black man, move on.

New year, same game, same shit goes on.

We was young cats playin' Latin quarters;
We was playin' roof top, yeah don't stop,
And I was there at Union Square when KRS-One did his thing.
So why y'all know what I'm bringin' to this ball game.
I got stacks of rhymes and papers and notes,
Lil' phrases written and my catchiest quotes.
I free them Hatians off them boats and give em' the finest ocean liners.
I hate brothers that's walkin' but mentally in recliners.
Hey who's that behind with the plastic and them scanners?
In the year two thousand will ya be on ya manners?
In concentration camps, wet floors and cold,
And population control keeps ya welfare comin'.
No more big fams, Uncle Sam damns,
And this MC Big Brother want the platinum
At your expense, niggas ain't been heard from since.
I walk light and carry the big stick.
Give out my views to blacks and Jews, and whoever choose to get hit
With my shit; I'm like the snowball effect
And why y'all should all stand erect when I pass.
Corporal with the ranch groove style, leadin' profile.
First leave the whole crowd thirsty and wet,
Wild Cowboys leadin' New York and that's my set.
I'm down with Lil' L and my man Akinyele;
I love her but I can't stand her mother.
Me and her brother ain't had the blessings to lead,
Kind of hard that I'm the G-O-D.

[Chorus]

Yeah my rent is due and the phone bill too,
Long distance is dead, got to see ConAir.
All of these bills is risin' in my head,
But wait I got the child support.
Got the car note as the after thought,
Got the school loan then after college that was blown.
Did I forget with my car a lot of tickets I owe?
Now niggas hate, my youth it constantly grows.
Always need clothes, hey that's how it goes.
Word, and my wife, I gotta keep my home life in tact;
Some of her friends try to end me then try to act friendly.
That's that bullshit, yo now that's that bullshit.
Now my crew all money and I'm tellin' em' to hang on,
I'm tryin' to hang but sometimes that don't be workin'.
Niggas talkin' about gettin' a package and goin' down South and murkin'

As we proceed well dressed to get done 

Live well  dress well to the day it's done (2x)

Come here singing  check this 2 piece combo 

Grand Puba  Dat X snatching Polly o 

Please  dig the way we grant this cheese 

Looks a whole lot better wit a pocket full of cheddar(yea) 

We smacked this on the blizzard day we all remember 

We stomp through wit Gortex and 3 ?guaded? timbers 

So Ali, put them things to a halt 

Get that rhythm so we can stack these papers in a ?boat? 

No time for chicken when a nigga politicing 

No time for sticking 'cause honey here is easy picking 

I need to be straighter than gator 

Catch a flashback and you can do me in the project elevator 

It's no guessing when it comes to this session 

Ah, it's no diggy, Ali hit us wit a blessing 

Me and Sadat go back to the days of the sandbox 

Now we much bigger, still laying nigga 

We used to chase honies back then 

Now all we chasing is decimals, Range Rovers and Mercedes Benz 

850's and houses, no time for skirts and blouses 

Bitch, back the fuck up of my trousers 



Chorus(2x) 



(Sadat X) 

Yea yea yea 

Can you face success for the coming year 

Drink jet, lay back and get your swiderve 

Make the breadline wind way around the corner 

I want all of my people to be rich so life wouldn't be such a bitch 

The same way as it comes, I want my pockets filled wit lumps 

Puba, you know me for 20 odd years 

Let's raise our glasses in cheers, ?that was all our? careers 

You know what, we goaling in since the days of old 

My pockets been swoll yet unconsole 

Never dwell, we live swell on the d-low 

Raise the person now in you, getting wit the us and now 

Alamo, if you hit me once mo' wit that 

I'll return and burn, kill shit for the ages 

Rip up the stages listed in the yellow pages 

They better slow down wit that slander 

I am the great Sadat X from New York state 

And I rate much more than pretenders 

I'm down wit mindbenders and the big moneyspenders, the big earners 

There'll be no cross burners in this part of the grass 

I'll be the first one to flip and run up wild in that ass 



Bring it down... 

Chorus(2x) 



(Sadat X) 

Let bygones be bygones was last year's episode 

This year I want to explode wit the great paper caper 

If the move is willing, should I not go for the killing 

Freewheeling poses a lot of death, wack rappers waste a lot of breaths 

The cognac is back in a mid size glass wit ice 

I'm already nice, who got the dice 

So let's roll, hold on, let me gain control 

When you hear this jam, you can bet your last dollar 

I was jack deep down born in a whole squalla 

Hey Puba, speak to these people 



(Grand Puba) 

Hey, hey, hey, hey, man, yo 

My days is over playing Willie Cassanova 

Used to fuck wit these bitches til I smacked up my Rover 

Used to take the hoes to the hotel 

If they wanted mo', used to take them to the motel 

Shit was swell, in '96 though I be mad jell 

'cause if you play these niggaz out, they might go tell 

And on that note, let's shake it to we all butt naked 

Keep the crisp style flowing, 'Mo, keep the beat going 

It's Grand Puba, Ali, Sadat and don't foget it 

Make you happy like the day that OJ was acquitted

Just burned, black burn cause he want a turn
I told ya it would happen to this comin' attraction
Let the billboards with plastic, all I have is this Massenburg
And they can't talk no more, I'm gon' keep on livin'
Fueled by the microphone and ass cash driven
Need to blow shit up so I can rest myself
In the best of health and have sex with my lady
Hey you don't get no ass cause you always lookin' shady

Now for the good things in life, Show, let's keep this crowd minglin
Been everywhere like twice, my latest trip been to England
Learned this whole scene from the Grand Puba
Peace to Lord Jamar and Nas Escobar
My people Crime Family, they finally got a chance
Long live Ralph [Name] and his crazy man Sam
My man [Name], can I get a suit from Mecca?
Brother [Name] from Karl Kani, can I get a shirt so I can be fly?
I'd also like a Walker Wear suit made from April
Hit me off in May when I'm heard on Ed and Dre, Scoop
Jackson on the late night, New Jersey week night
??? say it, my joint they better play it
Rhyme after rhyme after rhyme after rhyme
Line after line after line after line 
Somebody said did I know my man Kid Capri?
I grew up on him and my man Brucie Bee
The lone mic for hire like the viking
If shit ain't to my liking
I run and get the axe
It's not that I'm a racist, it's just I'm pro-blacks
You can't sleep in this here game 
Cause there's cheese and
There's a million MC's in public housin 
A nigga'll step on your back
Just to get a crack
Got to go reign, the whole thing is like a game
I ain't never been gold, but I got the platinum fame
Like this

[ CHORUS ]

My energetic show is just half of the picture
I take your suggestion, no question inflicted
Add to it, then get bad to it
The music man and I got what's hot
I be the pleasure principle
Reignin and restrain from buggin out
And luggin out the heavy arms
I'm to rap what Allen Iverson's to Georgetown
The truth sayer, never team player
I move, groove, groove and parlay
If I could bone every day, would I go that way?
Check it out
At first I'll take a little lead to lead the whole world
Jump and make the earth shake and expose the fake
This is no coincidence, this was bound to be
Tell the young history is bein made
Goin backwards I had a low one, a baldie, and a fade
Bein fresher neverthelesser makes me go all out
Cause I'm out in the street too much
Not to be too clutched
Showbiz is my man, no question, ace
Hit me off with the head-nod ???
My tunnel vision has my shit on collision
We're makin dough, makin investments
And stackin up the property
30 years from now the young boys is livin properly
As the foundin father
Of the style that niggas ain't even bother to find out
It will blow your mind out
Missioned in the circles of royalty
Wild Cowboys I owe my whole loyalty
At the scene of the crime, the new essence of the rhyme
Comes out like a dime piece, braided and shredded
Wack rappers get mean shouts from my team
The riches, the bitches and all the fan fanfare
But I stay aware just like the black bear
'96 is my year

[ CHORUS ]",Stages and Lights,1996
Sadat X,"If I was to sit down and actually write out a list 
Of the MCs that missed it would be the constitution 
They play their caps backwards still saying whack words 
No power to (durhust) just a few yes men 
Raising the question of who gave you a contract 
They should be fired you're officially retired 

I see you make a little cash and start showing your ass 
You get laced up with jewels your crews acting like fools 
Playing hard rock surrounded by body guards 
Hoping no one pulls your cord you got me laughing pretty hard 
Thinking you're the white hot man of the hour 
But you just can't figure how your flavor went sour 
Back in 89 PE fought the power and in 86 Big Daddy Kane was raw 

And I was right there on the first floor of the Palladium 
You never played a venue local college or a stadium 
A young boys (fiddin' pad) fad is now a grown mans profession 
To earn this is a blessing 
This skills have me guessing learn cause I'm testing 
Follow this down no question 

No doubt check it out 
You be either rhyming in code or on some gangster node 
You all clockwork apocalypse you about to implode 
Collapsing on yourself cause your whole foundation is 
Built on lies don't apologize 
Cause once they watch you rise they want to watch you fall 
And they'll all take a piece just like the Berlin wall 
And place it on their mantle like a souvenir 
And what they call a knick-knack is really your career 

You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress 
Still there be people that would die for less 
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow 
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow 
You ain't promise nothing but a pocket full of stress 
Still there be people that would die for less 
You ain't promise nothing but a heart full of sorrow 
If they don't like the demo make a new one tomorrow 

When its time to rise Ill open the archives 
When you be in dreams you got 85s 
Chrome down with the leather package 
You got a home of your own 
you're holding acres 
I got it made 
Season tickets to the Knickers and the Lakers 
Playing both coasts closed and European festivals 
Crowd scream decibels x2 
In your ear you want to make rapping your career 

From Arkansas to Minnesota I sell out the quota 
I be the wet dream making cream for promoters 
We keep the shit right we don't be starting no fights 
And he won't hold out my dough cause I'm a put out his lights 
And once the crew hits the stage the crowd gets involved 
We show love they show it back all problems solved 
You can boom shalock and jump to the sounds I pump 
But I ain't quitting 'til I'm shitting on Donald Trump 

So take heed to the verses and styles and versions 
When you socialize with other MCs 
And boast your rhymes to company enemies 
And in any cases that feel is what you want 
??? 
You want to make money money and take every honey 
Rap charges ain't funny but it boost your career 
Your penile style is now hanging from a tier 
Now you want to know fear to impress your peers 
Now your ass outta here the rap game goes on",Heart Full of Sorrow,1996
Sadat X,"""Never gonna give you up, no matter how you treat me"" (Repeat 4x)
[Diamond]
Now people used to tell me that if you smoked
You'd lose your hope, and it would stunt your growth
I used to chip in with the other young folks
Back when it came in little brown envelopes
Remember the day my moms found a tre
Bust my ass and at night I heard her pray
Lord don't let my boy succumb to
But it was too late, I already begun to
Hanging with the knuckleheads on my block
Smoking in the lobby looking out for cops
Sipping Private Stock, now my eyes are shifty
Who got me covered on the next $2.50?
Nigga I ain't tripping, I passed out a few whippings
On deep throats in cheap coats who wouldn't chip in
It got me flipping, now everything's serene
Purple clouds and ultraviolet dreams

 ""Never gonna give you up, no matter how you treat me"" (Repeat 4x)
[Sadat X]
My old moms said that the smoke would harm
I'd be a crackhead or die with a needle in my arm
Tried to playy me out, my father was smoking that good lye at the time
That old grown man brown weed with my aunts in the back
I'm a little nigga now saying ""Why they acting like that?""
Coming out all high and laughy off some Richard Pryor tapes
Before he blew up his face trying to base
I was smoking weed when half the niggas with me now was fronting
When cats was anti-drugs there was weed seed in my rugs
I've been to the brown bags, the clear bags, and even the glass jars
I've been smoking with stars in parties and bars
I done got actresses high, the greatest athletes fucked up
Took some niggas from DC to the spot and they came and cracked a knot
And left the spot real hot, check it out
I get up in the morning, take a pee, and light up that good tree
Old girl often ask me why I always get so high
Because it keep me in touch and keep my shit on the smash
And I ain't down with Rudy G no more cause he done fucked up the hash

 ""Never gonna give you up, no matter how you treat me"" (Repeat 4x)
[John Doe]
Picture me giving up my early moring marijuana
Reading a books, slef-entitled ""The World According to Scamas?""
Yo herbals make the world calmer
True fact, no drama, old timers still smoke like farmers
I done heard many tales about the chunky black
Guess that's why I prefer the chunky black
Every day I'm reminded bout the dangers of smoking
8 o'clock I'm rolling L's, by 8:03 I be coughing
Rehab spots ain't for herb smokers
That's for extremely stressed stock brokers
Who bought four closers from a crack quoters smoke this
If you're offended by the fumes light an incense
She's not laced with infringements or buddhas
She wouldn't have the gall to fool us, please no intruders
She stays true to her students
Stayed loyal til I tamed her up
Took a trip to the greeny green kid and never gave her up
That's why

And if I think 'bout it one more time

Give me some room that I can breathe in
Now I'm a start weavin' spells like a wizard

When I was the age of two

And when I was the age of four

Couldn't get more bent when it's time to represent 
I control it like rent in a slum tenement 
Life's hard like some men in the concrete jungle 
I don't smoke jumbo so what you knocking for 
There's locks on my door  we rock from the floor 
To the ceiling ain't no drug dealing 
Ain't no gat peeling, you can't fight this feeling 

Well, My style's golden, hot like molten rock 
Niggas come bold but leave here holding jock 
High roll patrol, roll through the set on fifth 
Arm's solo, sipping ?molo with a chick 
Niggas take the penitentiary chances at the dances 
Letting off shots, lit off the lanterns 
Mad cause a nigga can't test with no access 
To 'phatness' like this 
 
From one story the cowboy was founded 
I'm surrounded by Casual, and Whitey Ford, the whole world and your girl 

From the Bay to LA to my blue end while 
I ain't trying to die, I'm trying to live while I cool out 
And pick up my daughter when the bell says the school out

To, consume, the tomb and submerge 
The depths of adverbs, ?

I'm the pinnacle and the prodigal, rhyme style's 
Hip nautical, fuck the article, the artist is hardest to harvest the 
Hard shit

I like them all house parties rocking, plus I'm up in your ?
Bitch, turn your head and keep your eyes where they supposed to be 

Supposedly, I was seen with something lean, huh 
Brown skin, I keep it bouncing 
I say lounging, on the side with red wine 
I know that shit on my floor ain't swine 

Now back it up, stack it up and hit me one more time 
It might be your phone call, but check it, it's my dime 
And I know she's fine but get off my line 
Or I'll break that spine and then maybe your face 

You all up in my space like with Puffy and Mase 
But that's just not the case 'cause I'm setting the pace 
While you following and swallowing, savoring the flavor 
In your 40 open now, quick suckin' my style 

Rock on, to the break of dawn 
Just freak it, ah yeah baby 
Rock on, to the break of dawn 
Just freak it, ah yeah baby

Cause it's the funky beat 
Cause it's the funk, the funk, the funk, funky beat (beat) 
Cause it's the funky beat 
Cause it's the funky beat 
Cause it's the funk, the funk, the funk, funky beat (beat) 

I'll leave a piece of my style flying high up in the air 
And you'll say to yourself, 'damn I'm glad I was there' 
This is as rare as me fricking share 
You people stare 
But behind closed doors you will take it there 

Yeah, I be the extraordinary  
Judge from Bay fare to Albee Square 
Tell me where the party at, I'll be there 
Let her hit the coney at, show her where to rock the pony at 

I be the man with the large amounts of sapphire fare 
I'm about to cut loose my dog so you all best beware 
You can dance with flare and get out of your chair

Sadat X,"Dollar dollar bills
Deutch, marks, franks, yens, and pounds
I rock the jocked up sounds
From Devenshire Downs

Out the Fordham Road
Up top in the boogie
I be loyal to my peeps
Like budha stud doogie

Never very bad news
Payin' crazy dues
I'm blowin' out crews
And tamin' mad shrews

Like Bill Shakespeare
The fakes will disappear
The flavor in your ear
Is strong like Everclear

Two hundred proofs
So put the match to the roof
And set this bitch on fire
Get rich, the empire's

About to strike back
If you rock the mic wack
And that's the way it is 'cause yo
It's like that

[Sadat X] 
Money, money y'all
It be the root of all evil

[Sadat X] 
Money, money y'all
It makes you popular with people
I go back to the 80's
Like three times a lady

When it was pussy for free
And crack for currency
It just occurred to me
It's time for surgery

I remove MC's like tumors
The lies and the rumors
Got me thinkin' of this dub
By Timex Social Club

Yo, word to my momma
I'm high off the trauma
Whitey Ford gets deeper than subway trains
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains

All pain no gain
Makes the brain insane
Life in the fast laneT
He flakes the cash gains (for real)

[Sadat X] 
Dollar bill y'all
Dollar bill y'all
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all
It takes money

[Sadat X]
To get that fly ass ho
It takes money

[Sadat X]
To see me rock a live show
It takes money

[Sadat X]
To get that last bag of smoke
'Cause they kindly take from it when that ass was broke
Hey yo I'm about to g-off
Just like my name was Ed-o

Black kids call me whitey
Spanish kids wetto
White kids call me the king of this be	-boy thing
If it's broke then fix it

If it's wack remix it
Can't none of you MC's ever fuck with these
You be crazy on my dick
Like some porno chick

For the style that I'm blessin'
Ain't no second guessin'
Kid heed the lesson, subtraction, addition
Reward for submissionA

In to no debate
Won't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
I want the stocks and bonds
Plus the real estate

I want the iron gates
And low interest rates
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe

When times get lean
Y'all know what I mean

[Sadat X] 
Money money y'all
Some be callin' it cream

[Sadat X]
Money money y'all
Some be callin' it fame

[Sadat X] 
Money money y'all
But once I get it I'm J

I want cash and checks
I want diamond rings
I want jewels on my neck
And mad fly things

I want a stack of fat chips
So I can take long trips
I want to sail the Bahamas
On my own cruise ships

I want acres of land
I want papers in hand
I want stocks and bonds
All pros no cons

Hey if it smells funny
Then back it up honey
I want the money y'all
I need the money y'all...",Money (Dollar Bill),1998

Recently  got me first degree wit a hot gun 
That's my third strike  so Xzibit can't go home 
Fight to see Daylight like Sylvester Stallone 
Don't ask too many questions nigga, keep that on the d-low 
My family might mistake you for an undercover see-O 
Last one that tried didn't make it past bookin 
Five times in the neck when everybody was lookin 

You see the judge, but he don't budge 
That's you're third felony, I believe strike three 
Remanded and stranded, to the cold steel granite 
Lost to the world, your moms and your girl 
Keep your weight up, or your ass get ate up 
Cats is stickin, straight up 
Wit the shank, get more time in the tank 
Ask Hank, he bout to bank, killed a cop wit high rank 
They gave him life and now another cat is fuckin his wife 

Just because I'm locked down don't mean the hustlin stop 
Her-oine and beer joints twenty dollars a pop 
You a new recruit, so today I'm lettin you slide 
But tomorrow you'll be confronted wit the two's in the side 
If you a smart mothafucker, you'll be fallin wit mine 
Behind bars, no bitches and cars, we only got time 
We're I'm from, time is money and got neither to waste 
Once in a while catch a Cannanite in the wrong place 
BEAT HIM DOWN, break the strongest hand, piss in his face 
Strike fear, play the rear, 'fore he catchin a case 
Low-class, got a dozen free visitors pass 
Plus the female see-Order want to give me some ass

Get on your ?(""YEAH""), get out the blood on your ?married character? 
Kitten-ass faces (""YEAH""), niggas about to beat you all down to the last stop 

I'm all good, as I telephone my hood 
At first I was shook, tried to play by the book 
But you can't bid your time by stayin in the cell 
I'm gettin high everyday like I was still on the corner 
Where I'm in fat pink caps, New York to California 
Makin deals for mills, holdin cigarette lottos 
Givin cats pills, and tell em ""Yo try those!"" 
Niggas try to scheme but my team is tight 
We as shady as the night and bring fright to sight 
Hey you be aight, but don't act like a sucka 
Ain't you ain't got to be the wildest mothafucker 
Use control, put a cat in whole if he's broke

Bumpin systems, rollin down the street in Detroit, Michigan 

I switch again, bucket seats with my girlfriend 

Wearin Paco in a Bronco, cologne is Pronto 

Movin quickly like the Lone Ranger, X is Tonto 

Back up the turnpike, Oldsmobile's roll with two pipes 

440 engine blowin wind, through our hair extension 

Two bags of six packs, with .38's, wrapped in gift packs 

Big attitude she's on the two train, I roll like Mad Max 

Keep it simple baby young girl, now squeeze yo' pimple 

How dare you walk around ignore the First National Bank 

My name is unknown, ? die my family call me Hank 

I go way back, like you still shop at Alexando's 

Buy your sandals for your little son, named Romandos 

Watch your step Theresa, chew up on your slice at Easter

Can you surround me in the black tan 

My living room, trips to Cancun, with these - eighty ladies 

The Jefferson's to the Brady, Sanford and the Son 

I want the whole world and my old girl back 

She left me for the postman, now she send me letters 

I got a bottle of Grand Monet, drinkin in the stairway 

With the wizard cool Keith, and I'm SPORTIN my rhymes 

Funeral chimes signal the beginnin of the end 

Cowboy with more in, with my private dancin chicks 

They live way out in the sticks, but I put em in the mix (uh-huh) 

Took em to Reno in an old Camino, gamblin in a casino 

The movie's Al Pacino

Got my check cashed, you posin new, stop actin girl, like a fool 

Got the Benz on loan, Sadat rollin by your school 

You brought your frontin friend Gwen, beggin for the Benjamin 

I'll see you a ten, with a haircut, like Scottie Pippen 

My man Mark riffin in the backseat, my cousin Clifton 

You get me pissed and wearin big gloves like Sonny Liston 

Leon Spinks with afro on, ready to rob the Brinks 

I see you got your thongs out, Daisy Dukes and buns out 

You call me when you broken hearted, when your money runs out 

Back from the ?, you did it girl the blind way 

Hold your horses, and evil forces 

Don't press star for Pathmark, I'll be home after dark 

I'm tired of Pop Tart 



[Sadat X] 

Yeah 

I'm touchin Gwen with the butt love, the rubber glove 

I'm touchin that ass she swingin her hair, claimin she's an actress 

But wasn't she that same chick I seen with the black dress? 

Traded the ninety-eight for the sixty-eight Mustang 

Me and Keith at the bar, do they know who we are? 

Apparently, because all the drinks are free 

It's ""Our house, in the middle of our street"" 

And when you come in here you better wipe your feet 

I'm from Alburqueque, New Mex' to the great state of Texas 

I rode across on a gray horse, ?? 

Get to the sauce and add spaghetti, non-pork (what?) 

I'ma own New York, with a big spots of the BX 

and German outposts, with the communists close (no doubt) 

I'm verbose, I host, the most, y'all should roast me 

People watch closely and rewind me on the tape 

Study this here, then look and listen 

Take a step back and watch the black pearl glisten

Get up out my way, it's Grand Pub's turn to shine
Hurt MCs ride the pine and get paid, no nevermind
One time as I sew it up like Dr. Frankenstein
Chickens ride the pony cause the rhyme flow genuine
As I do it like that, do it like this
Shorty watch your step or you might get Rocked like Chris
Are you feelin this? You dig the way it's going down?
Now we back in town watch all the chickens crowd around
Niggas try to duplicate my flow but it's difficult
Like a game of Yahtzee
Chickens stress me out like paparazzi
As I flip a flow you desire
Dattie blaze those trees and let's start this forest fire
My rhymes carry like the weight on Barry
Stack cheddar like Combs and buy homes like Larry
I be smoother than Tal, Sharp-ton like Al
When you ballin everybody want to be your pal
No dilly-dally, baggin up the shorter alley
Bouncin in German cars, still playin shot-ball
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you
For sure dog cause this is how we do

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Sadat X]
Ah , I see men mitts (?)
Watch the green van cause inside's the dicks
The prayer beads bleeds from the crucifix
Went tight comin out boy I be down in six
Or when the sun go down, or when it's round in the BX
(?)
Cats on the concourse, still holdin dx (?)
Bums on the street often ask me for change
What's change when I'm tryin to save up for the Range?
I want the whole world and my old back
Change that -- I want half the world, and my old 
You can play the hell out, like those that came before ya
Your style is butt, similar to a cobra
That's your pimp strut
But what you foes is really doin
Is leaving your empire in ruins
I'm the problem solver
I got the brand new revolver
But I got a new album too
I want to be here for that money and the rest of my crew
Y'all know it's true-- a nigga like me is due

Just an old fashioned love song, playin on the radio
Brand Nubian cats, here to flip one for you (2x)

[Puba]
Now you know I gots to come back strong
See I been doing this too goddamned long
For me to ever try to come back wrong
Check my pockets and my empty light just came on
Don't wanna do wrong so I think I'm best to make this song
Undeniably satisfiably master microphone mutilator
None greater, ain't no Automator
Grand Puba and Dattie, riding shotty in the Mazarati
As we come and blaze you with this body

[Sadat]
Corner poets get smacked and hit, savagely bit
I go git and then you out of it, permission to quit
I mean right, I keep the green light specials
Half price a slice, you blink twice
I done picked up the dice
I'm that nice, Dattie X the party-starter
Number one heart-ripper-aparter
More vice and than Las Vegas, Nevada
I try harder every day
It's all work and no play

Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

[Common]
Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see em
My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em
Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em
Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em
Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the you-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life, I'm like chief up in this demonstration
Still...

You squirm wit this coughin, whippin cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'ma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the place I went to, always played the low
It's like a competition, this mission here I'm tellin you
Slip up and rhyme-ass niggas here is fellin you
Crash courses, slow down you can't learn that quick
'cause I'm the dead eye, wit the red eye, from Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growin
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showin
A male seed, praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common, why they tempt me?
The king of the simply, bore in mic
I always stay on top 'cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times, it's gon' be the same way
The 'Dat-Father, go farther, why bother
Now I'm a peaceful man, I don't want no stress

Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring/Warren like a G-Child
Searchin for the child in me, this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the bal-cony
Lyrically I put a hit on em, 'cause I'm the style-Nitty
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Tryin to get a chick to kick it wit me till the tilt
Told her my Chamber's like Wilt
Built wit her for a sec, let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was givin me neck, yo I'm still gettin mine...

Tight broads watchin
The Guru, the great 'Dat X, and Big L
Flamboyant for life

Check it, a year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
with some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that?  I wore a Lifestyle

Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

I'm in the breed of the bad guy
Get caught in a mad lie, come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
and think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin witchu
Had said some ol' slick shit, that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin swell, how you gon' fuck my man L
like we don't cross paths in these New York streets?
But that's good, cause he's my man and we both shine
and to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted;
things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it, think back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted, she ain't never resisted
Left it red and blistered, shakin
I could slam it if it wasn't NO money makin

Word up games, these girls nowadays they play many
Techniques for gettin your loot, they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick, just for some ice and shit
In the beginning they're polite, actin all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushin your Land
When she got you - she goes and fucks your man
Understand?  You gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud, they'll set you up Baby Pah
Some'll try to get you stuck up, some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough, and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a hoe a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick - could be a lifetime bid
A lot of cats be beefin over these honies
Not me I keep it movin they ain't getitn jack from me
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
And one love to L we gon' stay Flamboyant

After these years I should be slidin' on the gold stage
Missed the blades fifty, they left a nigga off the whole page
Fifty motherfuckers that was better than me
That mean fifty motherfuckers was boiling hot
That's a lot, I can see that, that's a plot
Y'all bring y'all best five to the game
And I'm gonna do the same
And if y'all win I'm burst from the same way I came
The great Dat aligned with a bo-day of Arabs
They said don't fly black, yo just play cabs
Y'all happy y'all had a good day, y'all niggas slave slabs
Y'all niggas got money then huh y'all niggas get paid tabs
Save my mic in a steel case for when they blast this place
And I can still be a hero to my race
Y'all know I can't change my face
That's why I only move with pros
Who move that eighty long money when the bright sunshine
And the streets was kind but we can't rewind
I want that new money, tight fittin' jewel money
Mine's on tour, so I can take no more
So y'all niggas better knock it off

Blame my check bein' late for this rage
Blame child support for makin' me beats on the mailman
I got a new whip but is fucked up as my old van
Nigga crash my whip, you seen 'em hit 'em 'cause he was an old man
I gotta cold hand these days and no heart
You believe in that bullshit baby please don't start
Cock it once and it means no stress
House cleaned and you fumed into my favorite dress
You say I feelin' best, hey broad don't gas me
And don't ever take no money outta my pockets, yo just ask me
See me down the block drinkin' Bud with the Mexicans
Speakin' broken Spanish, I know a lil' I manage

I'm about to leave New York I can't stay
The way shit is goin' I might have to get away
All day tryin' to hit me with prices I can't pay
Niggas bust the guns, got to duck and stray
Is the block clear, nah y'all can' rock here
With the twelve, twelve, thirty-eight, and fifty-eight, fifty-eight
If we don't get it done here we gon' take it outta state
Burn something in the air, let the room be few
My broads gon' give a show 'cause I told 'em so

Talkin' to ya how he want cause he think he a king
This shit swing right next to his pocket, ka-ching
Took ya in and out of town, show that ass some things
Wrap ya body up in glass, call ya Miss Bling Bling
Now tell ya friends about that cause it don't mean a thing

Gave me head in the car, I mean right in the street
And if ya don't believe me then ask my niggas ya meet
Live up on my block, sell pussy for free
It don't smell, if it did I was high of the drink
Intoxication is a fuck if my dick could think
He'd probably tell me...slow down
New York is ho town
Close ya pants nigga or ya might go down
Fuck a hole through ya condom now ya ass got a child
Now ya know that ain't cha' style
Don't want to claim it, move away a hundred miles
Called for child support and that ass blew trial
Stressed out thinkin' what cha' gonna do now
Gray tones growin' with a sharper tone than Al's
Saxophone nigga blowin' money by the notes
Stickin' us to get paid, I'm bustin' seeds in they throat
Ya gets no fur on ya coat if you ain't hustle this coke
Jigga said it ain't a thing, KA-CHING, it ain't a joke
It'll make ya grab ya totes and be out and reload

And motherfuck a ho, I ain't trickin' no dough
They haters with vibrators, they don't want to see me though

Lay out broads with the haze, lay out for two days
Might tease the adventure
See me freaked out with two chicks smashin' em' out
Like a nigga had two dicks
And the breeze done shook all the leaves off the trees
Leads to homicide with the suit jacket
Who want the keys in the tight package
I walkin' past the park with Spark
That's in the plain clothes harassin' the same niggas
And smashin' the same hoes
My lil' son Sammie hold the weasel
Behind the phone booth and the wall is the teasil
With em' up, we gon' live like ghetto stars, how we are
We gon' fuck with all the broads and drink shit out the bar
We gon' snatch a bitch too, throw em' in back of the car
Money boss be a force
Blast a gun in exhaust
I don't want it no more, who had they coat and they ring on the fourth floor
Yeah, let's get these broads and get the fuck outta here

I got pussy on my mind
But gotta keep it on the grind
Track the wrong bitch, lusted for a life of crime
Gotta sign, got the blind
That's why I fuck em' feed em'
Duck em' leave em'
Then act like I don't need em'
Because I don't need em'
They all lyin' so you can't believe em'
Fuckin' scandalous and they so conceited
They make a nigga heart stop breathin'
She whorin' every time he snorin'
Fuck a nigga where he sleepin'
That's why Trey gon' change the game
Fuck a bitch, fuck a slut, fuck a whore be about cha' caine
Ka-ching and don't forget cha' change

And ya tip over in the Range Rover
Ride it into October
Fuck it, ya lived once plus the end is comin' closer

Compromised his integrity

Come get me
And be where I perform, stay warm
I'm prepared for the storm
And I brought the heat with me

Put 'em six feet up under the soil
Looking at the roots of trees
Better yet leave they bodies all out in the open so the flies can feed

First, did you come with six zeros?
Fuck y'all then, I'm trying to put some dubs on the road
Then just slide up in the club and try to bubble some hoes
Player, the harder we grind, the further we go
I'm at the point I'm ready to commit a murder to blow
Whatever it takes, I see the nigga holding the case
Look dead in his face, hit the nigga holding the weight
Make his man take me to the crib and go in the safe

Pardon me a second dude (you better get in line)
Confrontation time, get in line or spit a rhyme
I ain't looking for no beef but I will oblige
I'm kinda quiet but surprise I ain't really shy
Didn't mean to shock you with the real
But niggas know the deal
When I'm up in punk knockers and down in Sugar Hill
Call me Mr Foreverman, can't say I never ran and never will

I get ghost then I bounce

I knew
I needed
A miracle
And I never thought I'd see the day

You put a shadow on a love
Took a shelter of a lie
Took the shelter out of my life

I wish you could shelter me
Shelter me now
I need a miracle
And I never thought I'd see the day",I Never Thought I'd See the Day,1988
Sade,"I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
Feels right, so fine
I'm yours, you're mine
Like paradise

I'd give you the world if it was mine
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
I'm yours so fine
Like paradise

I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like you're mine
Feels right, so fine
I'm yours, you're mine
Like paradise

Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life

I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life

I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life

Sade,"I was so in love with you
You rarely see a love that true
Wasn't that enough for you
Wasn't that enough for you

I would climb a mountain
I wouldn't want to see you fall
Rock climb for you
And give you a reason for it all

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

Hit me like a slow bullet
Like a slow bullet
It took me some time to realize it

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

I know the end before
The story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul

You kept on thinking
You were the only one
Too busy thinking
Love is a gun

I know the end before
The story's been told
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul

You were trigger happy baby
You never warned me, let me free
It's not that complicated
But you're gonna need a bullet proof soul
Think you got it, but you got all the trouble you need
I came in like a lamb
But I intend to leave like a lion

It hit me like a slow bullet
It hit me like a slow bullet",Bullet Proof Soul,1992
Sade,"I couldn't love you more
If time was running out
Couldn't love you more
Oh right now baby

I couldn't love you more
If time was running out
Couldn't love you more
Oh right now baby

Oh right now baby
Take me by the hand come on
Be my darling be the one
I wouldn't want to lay or ever love with another
If everyone in the world
Could give me what I wanted
I wouldn't want for more than I have
I couldn't love you more if I tried

I couldn't love you more boy
I couldn't love you more boy

Cause darling I'm on your side
I really am on your side
My love on your side
Oh right now baby

I couldn't love you more boy
Stay exactly how your are
I couldn't love you more boy
Couldn't love you more
I couldn't love you more boy
Stay exactly how your are
I couldn't love you more boy
Couldn't love you more

If everyone in the world
Would give me their treasure
I would not want for more
Than I have right now",I Couldn't Love You More,1992
Sade,"There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly led me to you
Look at the sky
It's the color of love

There must have been an angel by my side
Something heavenly came down from above
He led me to you
He led me to you

He built a bridge to your heart
All the way
How many tons of love inside
I can't say

When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel my heartbeat
When I lay eyes on you
Ay ay ay
You wrapped me up in
The color of love

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

Wasn't it clear from the start
Look the sky is full of love
Yeah the sky is full of love

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss that's like
The kiss of life

You wrapped me up in the color of love
Must have been an angel came down from above
Giving me love yeah
Giving me love yeah

You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life
You gave me the kiss of life
Kiss of life",Kiss of Life [Album Version],1993
