Bee Gees,"Pulse's racing, darling,
How grand we are.
Little by little we meet in the middle.
There's danger in the dark.

It oughta be illegal
Make it a crime to be out in the cold.
It oughta be illegal
You got a reason for living.
You battle on with the love you're living on.

You gotta be mine.
We take it away.
It's gotta be night and day,
Just a matter of time.

And we got nothing to be guilty of.
Our love, will climb and mountain
Near or far, we are,
And we never let it end.

And we got nothing to be sorry for.
Our love, is one in a million.
Eyes can see, that we
Got a highway to the sky.

Don't want to hear goodbye.
Don't want to hear goodbye.
I don't want to hear your

And we got and we got nothing to be guilty of.
Our love, will climb and mountain
Near or far, we are,
And we never let it end.

And we got nothing to be sorry for.
Our love is one in a million.
Eyes can see, that we
Got a highway to the sky.
Don't want to hear,  goodbye.
Don't want to hear,  goodbye
I don't want to hear your

And we got nothing",Guilty,1998
Bee Gees,"Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under.
My love for you.

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by.
This world may end,
Not you and I.",Heartbreaker,1998
Bee Gees,"So this is who I am,
And this is all I know.
And I must choose to live,
For all that I can give,
The spark that makes the power grow.

And I will stand for my dream if I can,
Symbol of my faith in who I am,
But you are my only.

And I must follow on the road that lies ahead.
And I won't let my heart control my head.
But you are my only.

We don't say goodbye.
We don't say goodbye.
And I know what I've got to be

Immortality.
I make my journey through eternity.
I keep the memory of you and me inside.

Fulfill your destiny.
Is there within the child?
My storm will never end.
My fate is on the wind.
The king of hearts, the joker's wild.

But we don't say goodbye.
We don't say goodbye.
I'll make them all remember me.

'cause I have found a dream that must come true.
Every ounce of me must see it through.
You are my only.

I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play.
Hand over my heart I'll find my way.
I will make them give to me..(yeah)

Immortality.(oh baby)
There is a vision and a fire in me.(oh)
I keep the memory of you and me, inside.

We don't say goodbye.
We don't say goodbye.
With all my love for you.
And what else we may do?..
We don't say goodbye.",Immortality,1998
Bee Gees,"Look at me, I'm Sandra Dee
Lousy with virginity
Won't go to bed 'til I'm legally wed
I can't I'm Sandra Dee

Watch it! Hey I'm Doris Day
I was not brought up that way
Won't come across, even Rock Hudson lost
His heart to Doris Day

I don't drink (No)
Or swear (No)
I don't rat my hair (Ew)
I get ill from one cigarette
Keep your filthy paws
Off my silky draws
Would you pull that crap with Annette?

As for you Troy Donahue,
I know what you wanna do
You've got your crust
I'm no object of lust
I'm just plain Sandra Dee

Keep that pelvis far from me!

Bee Gees,"Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
And every beat of my heart
We got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah ha
From one love to another, ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever
We can ride it together, ah ha
From love to another, ah ha

Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

Oh baby alright
Ghetto superstar superstar that is what you are
Coming from afar reaching for stars
Fly away with me to another place
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha
Oh baby alright
Tonight, tonight, tonight
By the by, all right",Islands in the Stream [#],1998
Bee Gees,"Listen to the ground
There is movement all around
There is something goin' down
And I can feel it

On the waves of the air
There is dancin' out there
If it's somethin' we can share
We can steal it

And that sweet city woman
She moves through the light
Controlling my mind and my soul
When you reach out for me
Yeah, and the feelin' is right

Then I get night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

Here I am
Prayin' for this moment to last
Livin' on the music so fine
Borne on the wind
Makin' it mine

Night fever, night fever
We know how to do it
Gimme that night fever, night fever
We know how to show it

In the heat of our love
Don't need no help for us to make it
Gimme just enough to take us to the mornin'
I got fire in my mind
I get higher in my walkin'
And I'm glowin' in the dark
I give you warnin'

Oh, girl I've known you very well
I've seen you growing everyday
I never really looked before
But now you take my breath away

Suddenly you're in my life
Part of everything I do
You got me working day and night
Just trying to keep a hold on you

Here in your arms I found my paradise
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now I think I would die

Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time

More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, more than a woman to me
More than a woman, oh, oh, oh.

There are stories old and true
Of people so in love like you and me
And I can see myself
Let history repeat itself

Reflecting how I feel for you
Thinking about those people then
I know that in a thousand years
I'd fall in love with you again

This is the only way that we should fly
This is the only way to go
And if I lose your love I know I would die

Oh say you'll always be my baby
We can make it shine, we can take forever
Just a minute at a time

Bee Gees,"Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep.
Reflection will show
This connection, we can lean on each other,
This is all we need to know.

Now I admit I've been a fool sometimes.
I believe I may be losing you.
It's now or never, we talk before a tear is shed.
Under your spell and over my head.

You took me in your arms and you told me
We don't need to worry, but you,
You never say you're sorry.

Keep this love alive for us, it's all I feel.
How can we survive if we change what is real?

Still waters run deep,
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep.

Reflection will show
This connection, we can lean on each other,
This is all we need to know.

I see the angel and the devil in your heart.
I confess, either one is my addiction.
And where you're leading me
I don't have the will to fight.
Out of the darkness and into the light.
But living in your arms, I can take it.
Please don't make me shiver.
I know together we deliver.

Let the gods decide
Who finds the sweetest thrill.
Who can justify the truth?
God, I love you still.

Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other.
No one wins and losers weep (losers weep).

Deception will show
It's a struggle when you're starved for affection (ah),
This is all we need.

Oooh
Don't let him get too close to you.
(you've got a stranger on your mind).
The dream is free.
I know I'm only human if I cry
(Or maybe we should kiss and say goodbye).

Ah. Girl. I love you still.

Still waters run deep.
Just remember when we lie to each other (ah).
No one wins and losers weep (no one wins).

Bee Gees,"I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I want to feel you in my arms again
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

How deep is your love, how deep is your love
How deep is your love?

Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies

I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm

You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
Your sweet lips, your fingertips
And you touch me but you won't stay

Bee Gees,"I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man I had a master plan
But I was alone

I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh what a night it's been, and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone

Always end up alone, always end up alone
So I'll play, I'll wait
'Cause you know that love takes time

Living love between the line
We came (sha la) so close (so far)
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine, and I don't want to be alone

Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
'Cause I know it isn't heaven is it love or hate
Am I the subject of the pain
Am I the stranger in the rain I am alone

And is there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination another story there to be told
So I play sha la, I'll wait sha la
And I pray it's not too late
We came (sha la) so far (so far)
Just a beat of a lonely heart and it's mi-i-ine
And I don't want to be alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

So I'll play I'll wait
And I'll pray it's not too late
We can so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love's got a heart that's made of stone
Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of site
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home",Alone,2000

Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to break my fall
The heartache over you
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through

You're the last to know when love is blind

All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no-one
Didn't stop and take a look at myself
And see me losing you

When the lonely heart breaks

It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more
Than the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul

Seen you in a magazine
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been
Hanging on the arm of someone else
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine

Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark or the broad daylight

Are you leaving me a helpless child

Fight the devil and the deep blue sea

How can we be wrong
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah ha
From one lover to another, ah ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
In love forever

That makes me know there's a party somewhere

Burn, baby, burn
Burn, baby, burn

To my surprise, one hundred storeys high
People getting loose, y'all, they're getting down on the roof
Folks are screaming out of control, it was so entertaining
When that boogie-woogie started to explode
I heard somebody say

(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down

Satisfaction came in a chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on and it was rising to the top
Everybody's going strong that is when my spark got hot
I heard somebody say

(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down

And burn, baby let the good times roll with me

On a cold and gray Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto
And if there's one thing that you don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto

People, don't you understand
That the child don't need a helping hand in the ghetto
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows in the ghetto

So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
And then he buys a gun and he steals a car
And he drives away but he don't get far in the ghetto

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto
And his momma cries

Oh, baby, baby, burn that disco down
You're gonna burn, you're gonna burn
You're gonna burn, burn, burn burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down
(Burn, baby, burn)
Disco Inferno, burn that mother down

(Burn baby burn)

You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me?
Without you

Without you, watching you take the world from me
Leaving me with a memory about you
Sometimes there's no forgetting the place
Where you told me goodbye, like a slap in the face
Where you tore me apart and I learned how to cry

Without you, there ain't no love at all
And without you, there ain't no plans at all
Without you, everything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me?

Baa baa black sheep, you haven't any wool. 
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull. 

Cherub, I lost a ship in the Baltic sea. 
I'm on an iceberg running free. 
Sitting, filing this berg to the shape of a ship; 
Sailing my way back to your lips. 
One passing ship gave word that you have moved out of your old flat. 
You love the Vicar more then words can say. 
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away. 
And I'll see your face again .

Odessa , How time goes by. 

Treasure , you know the neighbors that live next door. 
They haven't got their dog anymore. 
Freezing, sailing around in the North Atlantic. 
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore. 
I just can't understand why you just moved to Finland.

But money's always been my dream to me
But ev'ry time I saw that face, those riches never mattered

Bee Gees,"I've been here all your life
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world
And he was your sun and your rain
I was losing you before I ever held you tight
Before you ever hold me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do

I've got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need
It's the only show
And it's you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere
Are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain
We blew away the memories of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die

Take me out of the cold, give me what I've waited for
If it's the pleasure of taking my heart that you need
Then it only makes me love you more
I was yours before the stars were born
And you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try

I've got an everlasting love
So tall, so wide, so high
Above the rumble of thunder down below
It's your love I need
It's the only show
And it's you on an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere

And an everlasting love will never die",An Everlasting Love,2010

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And my dear, we're still goodbye-ing

Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away

Beegie Adair Trio,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger,
You may see a stranger across a crowded room,
And somehow you know, you know even then,
That somehow you'll see here again and again.

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing,
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room,
And night after night, as strange as it seems,
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams.

Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try.

Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love,
When you hear her call you across a crowded room,
Then fly to her side and make her your own,
Or all through your life you may dream all alone.

Beneath the blue

They just sitting on the car
We the hottest in the city
Got 400 horses with me
Tell a hater stop playing
Ain't nobody fucking with me
Aiiiii-ght

[Verse 1: Beema Monroe]
I tell em' welcome to my city
Pimps, hoes, saints, dope boys fuck wit me
Whitney
Gone get the donk out the storage
Make a long story short
I'll take yo' porridge
We sliding
Ain't gone be too much speeding
Floating thru my hood all the dope boys speaking
A bossy mulfukka
I'm exactly what they seeking
Show that love then I let them sixteens go to leaking
Hit the strip round seven
Stunt a little that'll waste time
Rearview mirror terrified of the bass line
Boooooom
You hear them outside speakers bout a half mile away
Feeling like a holiday
Aiiii-ght

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Beema Monroe]

Whip cleaner den a mulfukka
From the waxed outside to the seat covers
In the head-rest you looking at Chris Tucker
Money talk, bullshit walk
Broke mulfukkas
White folk, ween born with the money we hunt
So when we finally get it, let a nigga stunt
All we tryna do is vibe and have a lil good time
Maybe sip a lil liquor lil wine
Pass the blunt
In that midnight Beemer with the Florida State tag
Hair did, tatted up, wit a whole lotta ass
Headed to the strip club with a whole lotta cash
In the back surrounded by Haitian flags
Yeen fukking with me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Beema Monroe]
We need peace in the hood
Remember when we use to walk the streets in the hood
Not enough money too much beef in the hood
Put them K's up, together we can feast in the hood
No, matter the state
I'm always repping my city
77Deuce, Fort Pierce Florida we winning
I'm grabbing they attention and this only the beginning
Am I sinning dear Lord or you approve of how I'm living
Ain't no time for beefing when you busy getting money
I'm fukking wit my haters
They get touchy when you stunting
(haahh) Bitch youn't wanna run it
Keep revving ya lil' engine
Too funny
Yeen fukking with me

When he sipped the lie detector
Looked into his eyes
Asked him where you been?
He said it's no surprise
Cause I've been with my ex girl
Why'd you tell me the truth?
He said you wanted to hear the truth
Sometimes I wish I never gave him a detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her

That ever dealt with somebody

Two teaspoons and they bound to tell the truth

[VERSE 1:]
You told me (you told me)
That I was your fantasy yeah (its yours)
You said that
We would practice monogamy

So, I became a freak under the sheets
Put his ass to sleep
Creeped into the kitchen
And got the remedy
Its called the lie detector
Slipped it in his drink
Brought it to his bedside and said ""take a sip of this and don't peek""

[CHORUS 1:]
You won't believe what happened when he sipped  the lie detector
Looked into his eyes 
Asked him where you been
He said ""its no surprise cause I been with my ex-girl""
Why didn't you tell me the truth
He said ""you don't want to hear the truth""

Sometimes I wish I never gave him lie detector
I thought he loved me but he loved her
So I'm kinda glad he took the lie detector
Now I know the truth so you can get the boot

Looked at her pager number
Said who's ?? sixty-nine
She said don't be surprised cause its ?? your best friend
He looked and swallowed his pride frontin' like

Hey take a good look at me, now picture me unhappy
No cash and outta fashion, not flashing
Picture me doing bad even if I wasn't rapping
Picture me even breathe on the mic not snapping
I'm fire hot not lukewarm, my arms frozen
Picture me in a room full of hoes unchosen
Picture me with no P.O. and no 'dro
Picture pimps walk with some broads and ain't gettin no 'tho
L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
A ghetto vision ain't real no mo' (Picture that)
Ah T.I.P. ain't work for MIA no mo'
He still so-so (picture that) he still po'
Nigga picture that, ah matter fact picture T.I.P.
Getting anything other than rich
Now can you picture this, young, pompus, African son of a bitch
Labeled as anything less than ""the shit"", I can't see it

And Polo gear that won't drop 'til next year
Be like this here, Cartier frames and Pierre Jouet wristwear
T.I.P. your majesty's right see'here
Notice when I came the dames disappeared, ya lames listen here
To play me, ba-by, hey he,
Gone need a track from God featuring Jesus or Jay-Z
Go on floss; ball where it cost
Smile for the cameras, take your shirts off
Y'all niggas acting, take ya skirts off
Hopping bomb-ass nigga and he ain't wanna work boss
I'm getting sick and tired off these phony renditions
Wonder why I don't consider them no competition
There's no vision, lil' ambition
How I feel about these niggas, and my word, are ya kidding?

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Some niggas wonder what my goal is
They think it's going gold having hoes sweating me
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Compare me to, Tupac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Work with legends like, Organo, I.Z., and J.D.
Neptunes, they even flow on one of Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke and we can trade freaks
I freak shows, just peep hoes under shade trees
Huh, but KP say just keep it top-notch
And make sure that the club is jumpin like it's hop-scotch
Floss rocks and in the summer keep the top dropped
Ten thousand dolla work for clo', when I go shop
In the Apollo on them 'boes so the hoes jock
Especially when I rock that linen suit with no socks
In Polo skippers, they undo zippers,
And they shows cock, to show shot shit
Bitch, I'm serious

Booty bigger than the pussy
And cuchi dat make me happy
And I'm all the way in your city

City do it for the camera
Make it drop and bring it back to the top

Girl you can give it to me it ain't nothing I can't handle
She just got out of the shower smellin' like a scented candle
And I'm finna flip her backwards
Have her sliding off tha mattress
No moving no acting baby this is real action
Beat it up so bad
You be scared to walk past me

Incredible by tha waist
Plus she got a pretty face
Even tho she got class she listen to UGK
I'm finna flip her through traffic
With tha top back of tha donk
Girl I guarantee I can make you go numb numb numb numb
I got enough bread to take me and you to London
And back to America and all over the country

Beets Brothers,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1995

You try to go out of your way, oh
To prove a point to me
That everything's okay

And the love I took from you
Has quickly been replaced

Does she know in the midnight hour

Should we tell her how you send me flowers

You can't accept I up and left you

Die Messdiener, Crackdealer, Alt-68er
Alle sind happy, denn der Testsieger rappt wieder
Eizi Eiz, heißer Scheiß
Jeder, den du kennst, kennt eine meiner Lines
Hammertyp, Hammerflow, Hammersprüche
Darum hängt mein Bild in Marsimotos Mamas Küche
Schreib' Gedichte, schreib' damit Geschichte
Jeder, der mich disste, ist bereits Geschichte
Alter, ich kam schon mit K Zwo und Hammerhart
Als ihr noch irgendwo im Sack von euer'm Vadder wart
Der Veteran von der Reeperbahn
Hab' Hamburg hinter mir, als wär' ich Uwe Seeler, Mann
Und die Sonnenbrille, sie ist am Start, Baby
Sie ist der letzte Rest Privatsphäre

Was los, Digga, ahnma'
Wie wir gucken, wie wir labern
Jeder sagt Digga heutzutage
Wir packen Hamburg wieder auf die Karte

Was los, Digga, ahnma' (ahnma')

No matter how dem gon' shout
Da one ya name trample all doubt

Still around, still I move the crowd
From Hamburg way down to south

Dem can't get we out
No matter how dem gon' shout
Da one ya name trample all doubt
Dem can't get we out
Still around, still I move the crowd
From Hamburg way down to south

Ich komm' mit großem Herz, dickem Kopf und kleinem Bauch
Wortgewalttätig, aber masterpiece-ig drauf
Triple-A Pass, Fremd im eigenen Land
Fette Anlageberater, Afrodeutsche Bank
Denyo, ich komme rein
Halt' 'ne Basspredigt und die Sonne scheint
Was Rap ist in 'ner Sinnkrise?
Guck, wie ich es hinbiege mit Armen wie Tim Wiese
Ist 'n positiver Film, den ich schieb', Typ
Vom Eppendorfer Weg bis zur Beatstreet
Hier kommt die Band mit Geschmack
Wenn jeder Jens-Peter einen auf Endgegner macht
Und irgendwo zwischen Itzehoe und Idaho
Kommt noch einer mit Jason DeRulo featuring Tyga-Flow
Is' leider so, für uns 'n Haufen Scherben
Doch wir lassen uns die legendäre Stimmung nicht verderben

Was los, Digga, ahnma'
Wie wir gucken, wie wir labern
Jeder sagt Digga heutzutage

Beginner,"Tja, ich sag', die Geschichte geht „Es war einmal“
Klein Jan, Klein Dennis und ein Basketball
Vierzehn Jahre alt und ein Haar am Sack
Aber die größten Klappen in der ganzen Stadt
Den Edding in der Tasche, war dauerhaft am taggen
Yo! MTV-Raps auf VHS-Kassetten
Deutschland war grau und die Charts waren schrott
Aber N.W.A and P.E. waren Gott
Auf einer Party haben wir Mardin getroffen
Er rappte Eazy-E und hat Campari gesoffen
Die Chemie stimmte, wir gründeten 'ne Band
Mit 'm Tapedeck, 'n Zettel und 'n Stift und Talent
Rough Beats und Texte mit 'ner Aussage
Der Flow mies, doch die Shows waren herausragend
Braucht nur noch 'n Auto und jemanden, der scratcht
Dann kam DJ Mad und alles war perfekt

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner
Haufen cooler Hosenscheißer
Loszog von der Küste
In Turnschuhen an die Spitze
Denn die Füchse von der Elbe
Wollten raus aus der Kälte
Hatten kein Ziel, aber fuhren los
Die großen Beats, kleine Studios

Ja, genau, Digga, damals, als es kein Schwanz kannte
Ergriffen wir die Chance und die Schanze
Die ersten Demos klangen wie die ersten Demos ah
Und das flora-rote Viertel, es brannte
Hip-Hop und Rap, Digga, waren noch nicht Trendwörter
Sondern Fremdwörter, selbst unter Spex-Lesern
Denn damals gab es keine Juice
Nur ein paar Crews mit dicken Samplern auf den Gepäckträgern
Und wir radelten von Proberaum zu Proberaum
Kein großes Studio, doch dafür einen großen Traum
Die Noten wurden schlechter, die Texte besser
Echt hammer, echt, Mama, ich werd' Rapper!
Und so fuhren wir paar Stündchen
Weiter auf die Jams über Braunschweig nach München
Keine Gage, um sie aufn Kopf zu hauen
Stattdessen Maxis verkaufen aus'm Kofferraum

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner
Haufen cooler Hosenscheißer
Loszog von der Küste
In Turnschuhen an die Spitze
Denn die Füchse von der Elbe
Wollten raus aus der Kälte
Hatten kein Ziel, aber fuhren los
Die großen Beats, kleine Studios

Ja, ich sag', vom Plattenmachen kein bisschen Plan haben
Die erste LP war 'n Gemischtwarenladen
Dub, Crossover, P-Funk, Bossanova
Geschrieben, aufgenommen und gemixt in einem Monat
Zu viel Gedudel, wir wollten wieder Rapshit
Schnell zurück zu drei Mics und zwei Technics
Denn im ganzen Land ging so viel zu der Zeit
Die Sprache lernte rollen und die Beats wurden tight
Und wir waren mittendrin mit 'nem Universal-Deal
Nur Mardin, der ging, denn es wurde ihm zu viel
Keine Ausbildung, wir setzten auf Rap
Bauten unserer Generation 'n fetten Soundtrack
Und als er rauskam, Alter, was da los war
MTV, VIVA, Radio, 'n Bravo-Poster
Kein' Bock, Popstars zu sein
Darum gehen wir zu The Dome, ohne da zu sein, ey ja

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner
Haufen cooler Hosenscheißer
Loszog von der Küste
In Turnschuhen an die Spitze
Denn die Füchse von der Elbe
Wollten raus aus der Kälte
Hatten kein Ziel, aber fuhren los
Die großen Beats, kleine Studios

So war das früher, doch alles hat ein Ende 
Wo soll ich anfangen?
Das Hip-Hop-Fieber fühlte sich auf einmal krank an
Ne, kein Flash '99 hält auf ewig, mit
Goldenen Platten im goldenen Käfig
Denn scheiß ma' auf Talent oder Stil
Jede Profilneurose bekam 'n Deal
Und dazu noch 'n Starproduzenten
Finanziert von Jamba-Sparabonnenten
Eh, ja, und das Klima wurde kälter
Deswegen machte Jan Urlaub auf Jamaica
Doch ein paar Firmengründungen und Pleiten später
Waren wir wieder angefixt wie Doherty Peter
Ja, dank Just Blaze und den Neptunes
Kam auch sie zurück, die derbste aller Rapcrews
Und die Hamburg-City-Blues-Brothers neu vereint
Schrieben Deutschraps erste Nummer ein

Ihr wart Zeuge, wie ein kleiner

Are you ready?

Ey
Hier sind die Beginner, woo
Yeah
Das is' für die alten Zeiten
Für den alten Vibe, den alten Flash
Ein Mixtape wie früher
Gemixt, gecutted, gestyled
Für all die sie sagen: „Ey
Wieso klingt der neue Scheiß nicht wie Bambule?
Und was macht dieser Gzuz Typ da im Video?“
Aber alles cool
Wir haben das ja selber mal gehört
Selber mal gemacht
Und es bringt riesen Spaß
Mit alten Strophen und alten Beats
Eimsbush Stylee
Ah, check das ab

Haben euch alte Styles mitgebracht

Siehst du das Blau und das Gelb, da der 
Siehst du das Blau und
Siehst du das Blau und
Siehst du das, siehst du das, siehst du das
Siehst du das Blau und das Gelb, da der Punkt
Der Skunkduft, der dir funkt: es ist Zeit
Breit und weit und breit nur Welt
Und alles wird schön und hübsch, wie ein Bild, es gefällt dir
Cool, jetzt sitze ich am Pool in meinem Liegestuhl
Ich denk, ich bin verwirrt, doch dann bin ich wieder cool
Ja, das gehen wir ruhig an, nur keine Hektik
Denn es erstreckt sich auf einmal
Tiefe Tiefe in mehr Richtungen, als es gibt
Jemand hat sich in diesen Moment verliebt
Meditation entspannt geb' ich das Ruder aus der Hand
Und lass mich treiben auf dem Fluss durch das Traumland
Das Wasser plätschert, funkelt wenn du lachst
Und ich mir fast vor Lachen in die Hose mach'
Hey, die Sonne scheint zurück von der Haut dieser Frau
Die ich anbetungsvoll anschau
Und ich gehe langsam durch die Hektik von heute
Schreite gemächlich durch die rennende Meute
Auf meiner Reise werde ich kurz weise - pralles Ding
Für einen Moment wusste ich worum alles ging

Chillen, alle Leute sind am Chillen
Was geht ab? Wir sind am Chillen
Was geht ab? Ihr seid am Chillen (Chill man, chill)
Die Beginner sind am Chillen 
Platin Martin ist am Chillen 
Tropf am Mix ist am Chillen 
Fidjikris ist am Chillen

Dynamite
Oh, ah, ja
Ich sag:
Samy Deluxe am Mikrofon, ran am Anfang
Es hört sich krank an, ich will an allen Ufern ankern
Ich finde Anklang, kann man das sagen? Ja, das kann man
Denn ich brauch' mich nicht mehr an alten Zielen festklammern
Andere rappen, doch hören sich an als wenn sie jammern
Außerdem stammeln, weil ihre Zungen im Mund vergammeln
Wir sammeln Inspiration und Energie
Brauchen keine Gewinner nie
Weil wir Gewinner sind, für immer im Wahn
Mit Ideen auf dem Plan, erzählen von Dingen, die wir sahen
Orten an den wir waren, wir rulen wie Dschingis Khan
Ihr könnts nicht ahnen, egal wie hype ihr seid
Zeit für Dennis und Dynamite Deluxe, a'ight
Samy Deluxe ist Dichter und Verfasser
Dj Dynamite sorgt für den Ghettoblaster
Vinyl bis Meister, aber kein Scheibenkleister
Und Dennis Lisk ist zweiter, nicht dritter sondern dreister
Hamburgs neues Tempo, nichts für Popel
Wir fahren Ford und nicht Opel
Und zwar mit Rap-Mucke, weiß ich nicht weiter
Ist die Glotze Therapeut, wenn ich Rap gucke
Neue Styles müssen so dringend her wie andere auf Toilette
Wenn sie mich sehen und sich ins Hemd pissen, jede Wette
Weil, 'ne gute Freestyle-Kür gehört zu mir
Wie dein Name an die Tür oder an die Wand
Spieglein, wer ist der schönste Rapper im Land? Du
Wie ist mein Name? Dennis von der AB-Crew
Ich hör nicht auf, und besonders nicht auf andere
Flieg' mit den Beats von Dynamite, meilenweit
Und weiß nicht ob ich lande
Und ob, und wenn nur damit ich tanke
Erober alle Herzen im Sturm und Samy schießt die Flanke
Die Tore fallen und wir steigen, die Beats sind fetter
Die Underground-Chart-Trendsetter

Wir gehen weiter und poppern auf den Zeiger
Die Underground-Chart-Trend-Setter
Der Beat ist fetter
Chartleader der Styleliga
Der Underground setzt den Trend der Trend-Setter bis ihn jeder kennt

Ich komm in der Tür, du fragst wofür
Nun ja, weil ich das Verlangen nach Befriedigung verspür
Rühr die Chemie an, die euch zum zuhören verführt
Ehre wem Ehre gebührt, also mir
Hier, nimm dies und zeig es allen MCs
Damit sie wissen wo dieser neue Einfluss herfließt
Hamburg City
Spuhl das Tape zurück bis es zu Ende ist
Und wende es, bis es heiß ist
Du hörst, dass dies kein Scheiß ist
Und wenn der Sound allein noch kein Beweis ist
Dann lass die Texte sacken, bis auf den Grund deines Geistes
Und verdau sie, spür wie weit wir den anderen voraus sind
Ohne Pausen, stylen bis ins nächste Jahrtausend
Wir gehen weiter
So ist es, also friss es, miss es mit anderen Raps
Und dann küss es, lieb es und nimm es, find es
Cool ich könnte wetten, dass du nicht denkst, dass es dünn ist
Weil es fett ist, keck is', deswegen tagg es an die Wand und vergiss
Niemals wer der Mac ist, Dennis hilft wie Cannabis
Rap ist mein Leben, weil er viel wert ist
Cooler Rap mit Eis serviert wird
Und heiß begehrt ist, ha

King of this B-Boy thing

Ja, ich sag
Wie geht das da? Liga-mäßig an den Start
Es ist Boba Ffett, der Hanseat, mit der Hanse-Art
Ich koche Lachs, während in deinen Töpfen Pansen gart
Und komme so cool, da frieren Truck Stops die Fransen hart
Alle wollen wissen warum gegen mich keiner 'ne Chance hat
Ich hab die Mongos, wo sich um andere 'n Haufen Transen schart
Fette Beats und Daunenjacken bevor es Helly Hansen gab
Und ihr Teenies in deutschen Serien zu Hip-Hop tanzen saht
Bevor ich Styles kicke, such ich den Raum nach Wanzen ab
Wann ist Schluss mit den Pirates, den Bitern und dem ganzen Pack?
Ich gebe mich ungern mit Behörden und Bilanzen ab
Weil ich ihre Regeln so wie Dieter Bohlen Emanzen mag
Mache mich lieber mit Blüten von illegalen Pflanzen platt
Mache Beats, hoffe, dass das mit den Finanzen klappt
Warte von meinen Mongos die Resonanzen ab
Bis das Presswerk einen neuen Burner in Vinyl zu stanzen hat

Ich sag, krass das, was? 
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was? 
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was? 
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, mach Rock 'n' Roll

Was los?
Hör auf mit Algebra, weil ich auf Plus und Minus scheiß
Und komm zu mir, wenn deine Doktorarbeit Sinus heißt
Bist du Analphabet, so wird Bass buchstabiert
Indem man Sub addiert und Höhen subtrahiert
Mks sind nicht geerdet, wenn Mad geschickt scratcht
Und Matze macht mit dem Gekratze dann den Mix fett
Und Boba hat 'n Kuchen und tausend fitte Tracks
Ich will mehr Bass, die Höhen leise und die Mitten weg
Hör in jeder Stadt Bass, von hier bis Kapstadt
Und in Bagdad les' ich halt 'n Bass-Fachblatt
Mein Style hat Karma, weil ausgepfeilte Wertarbeit
Nicht eng, wie 'n Bahnabteil, immer sechzig Hz dabei
Früher war vieles Spaß heute nehmen's viele ernst
Doch auch du willst was, egal für welchen Stil du schwärmst
Solang ihr Bass wollt werd' ich Bass haben
Und meiner der wird brummen, wie 'n Fernkraftwagen

Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was? (Yes, yes Foxy Music)
Lass das As, mach Rock 'n' Roll

Yo, heute ist mir kalt, heute klagen Nachbarn
Denn mein Zimmer hält nix anderes, als 'n Bass warm
Ich will im Bass baden, der muss brummen, wie Lastwagen
Dünne Sounds nerven wie Bullen die nach 'm Pass fragen
Ich kick statt Battle Rhymes Schlagzeilen in die Welt
Sechzig Hz zerbrechen nicht und wenn die Teeniewelt
Die meinen, der Garten Eden sei 'n großer Blumentopf
Ich brauch im doppelsiebten Himmel bloß 'ne Boombox
Das analoge Paradies ist heute ganz nah
Und stehst du nicht so auf Peace, ist Bass 'n Panzer
Wenn ich nach Sounds wühl, chill ich im Fuchsbau
Bis man es im Bauch fühlt und der Sound im Club taugt
Weil Bass ist golden, wie das M wenn du in Burger beißt
Doch magst du Metal, geh bellen, kack auf 'n Bürgersteig
Es soll nicht quietschen, wie Enten oder Walgesang
Ich will Basswellen im Wellenbad oder am Badestrand

Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag krass das, hier kommt Platin Martin
Verlorene Strophe von „Da geht was“

Anschaffung vom Chemiekasten hat sich gelohnt
Bei mir im Keller könnt ihr sehen, ich hab mich zehn mal geklont
Jetzt kick' ich Rhymes wie 'n Fußballteam jetzt
Werden Rapjunkies auf keinen Fall clean, denn jetzt kommen Raps
Die kitzeln wie erste Küsse in Küstennähe
Kühl flüstern wie der Wind, wenn ich an Küsten gehe
Knisternde Kopfhaut zehntausend Volt Kurzschluss
Wie 'n Colt kurz nach dem Schuss, atme ich Rauch aus
Bin auch raus, wenn das Gas aus ist
Im Haus ist Martin, der langsamer als der Tunnel Staus ist
Reim für uns, die wirken wie die Siebziger
Alles wird freier und spritziger und Bob Marley gib's wieder
Ey gib's das? (Ja, man) Das heißt, da geht was
Ihr hört Bass und seht was die Wände zum vibrieren bringt
So krass wie wir klingen, kann es nicht gut gehen
Wir sehen uns dann den Südjemen beim Training

Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, derbe Styles kicken über den Bass
Ich sag, krass das, was?
Lass das As, euch fragen, fühlt ihr den Bass

Oh, this is terrific

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Ja
Ich spreche von früher in höheren Tönen, als wie mit Helium
Denn Hip-Hop, wie ich es kannte, starb mit dem neuen Millennium
Ursache war die Masse und an der war ich mit schuld
Sie gab Hip-Hop 'ne Leine und 'n Maulkorb wie 'n Pitbull
Machte Rap in Deutschland zu Deutschland im Rappen
Und an der Stelle bin ich draußen, denn ich find' Deutschland nicht fett, ne!
Soll doch der ganze uninteressante Sauhaufen allein weiter im Kreis
Und irgendwann dann in's Aus laufen
Wir machen uns selber kaputt, ich kann's nicht länger hören
Fordert man den Verlust der Freiheit mit enger Stirn
Anstatt immer was zu meckern sollte man Liebe finden
Und Paläste bekriegen und Dritten Frieden wünschen
Das Land ist fade und macht durstig nach Leben
Und heutzutage ist Vorsicht geboten für jeden
Denn Konkurrenz ist gut, aber der Flash geht vor
Statt Allüren hab' ich Stahltüren für mein Rhymebook im Tresor
Auch wenn der Beat mich hart begleitet, bleib' ich zart beseidet
So wird er vom Gespür für Flows smart verkleidet
Ich mach' meinen Kram und meide den Heiligenschein
All der Scharlatane in den eigenen Reihen

Ich glaub' an nix bei all den Zaubertricks der Star-Maschinerie
Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie

Ich will keinen deutschen Hitler-Rap, ne, ich will Anarchie
Und meine Boom-Box braucht 'ne große Batterie
Denn der Bass schallt vom Asphalt hoch ins Paradies

Das ganze Feinde-Gelaber ist nicht bloß eine Macke
Und nicht der Spaß an der Sache der Maßstab einer Platte
Was denn? Sich Beulen für Fame und heulende Sirenen
Und bloß kleine Kinder als Zeugen dieser Themen?
Ich find' das unangenehm
Wird nur noch runtergesehen und muss für Frieden in unseren Szenen Wunder geschehen?
Was muss passieren, bis die meisten begreifen
Dass wir uns alle nur noch peinlich verhalten?
Zu dumm, dass mit der Masse nicht auch die Klasse zunahm
Doch die wenigen guten Acts waren schon da, als der Boom kam
Dafür nerven Tausende aus der Newcomer-Rubrik 
Mit 'ner SP-12, aber kein Plan von der Musik, nee
Wenn real bedeutet immer den gleichen Scheiß zu labern
Und um den Beat zu machen nur zwei Minuten Zeit zu haben
Muss ich sagen: Okay, dann bin ich's eben nicht
Denn für mich ist Qualität und der Flash wesentlich
Und an euch Pisser mit weniger Weitsicht, als 'n Blinder hat
Euer Kinderkack macht mich wahnsinnig wie Rinderhack
Jeder Scheiß wird gesigned, Majors kriegen Torschlusspanik
Doch ohne Sellout aus Hamburg bekämen ihr diesen Vorschuss gar nicht

„Eich ein Mikro
Eich ein Mikro
Eich ein Mikro und es verliert seine Seele
Das ist der Grund, warum ich meinen Weg wähle“

Ich steh plus fünf auf der Gästeliste, doch mein Gott
Ich komm allein, meine Freunde haben keinen Bock
Doch ich hab Hunger und auf dem Facebook-Flyer war die Rede
Davon, dass es Fingerfood auf deiner Releaseparty gäbe
Und nun lass ich mich tatsächlich, wenn auch widerwillig
Für paar Spieße Saku-Chicken auf ner Party blicken
Und lass es über mich ergehen, das Gedresche all der Phrasen
Und diese „Wann kommt 'n endlich das neue Album?“-Fragen
Und du fragst mich, wie es Jan geht?
Ich frage mich, was dich das angeht
Ich will hier weg, ich muss pissen und dein Telefon klingelt
Doch ich warte vergebens, dass du Spacken endlich rangehst
Ne, ich war noch nie in Kaiserlautern
Und bagger' mit dir jetzt auch keine heißen Frauen an
Und nein, es gibt keine zweite Staffel bei Vox
Und ich war auch noch nie auf deinem supergeilen Blog
Und ja die Hose, ist ganz cool
Ne, die ist von Cowes, sorry Digga, ich muss los
Ne, ich bin heute einfach nur nicht so gut drauf
Ja, cool - Ja genau, du mich auch

Ich hab kein' Bock, so sieht es aus
Ich bleib stumm, doch leider nicht taub, Typ

Kein wenn, kein aber
Kein wenn, kein aber, kein Bock

Einfach nur damit ich stinke wie ein Schwein
So halt ich mir die Labernasen auf Distanz
Und habe meine wohlverdiente Ruhe, wenn ich tanz'
Und will ich mal shoppen gehen, ungestört
Schmier ich mir 'n bisschen Kacke meiner Tochter auf mein Shirt
Dann denken sie vielleicht: „Ey, Alter, der hat 'nen Schaden“
Doch wenigstens traut sich keiner mich nach 'nem Foto zu fragen

Ye-ye-yeow
Hokuspokus Abrakadabra und dann dreimal schwarzer Kater
So zaubern wir neue Schlager
Und burnen alles was da war
Doch nicht a lá Tütata
Mehr wie 'n Jaguar im Lada
Was eh wie Kloßbrühe klar war
Weil für Hits haben wir 'ne Ader
Das ist das Mongo-Geschwader
Zusammen sind wir unschlagbar
So rough wie Meinhoff und Baader
Hart wie Keule von Nana
Für Sauberdeutschland das Drama
Dreizehner mit 'ner Sparvar
Respekt an alle Train-Maler
Auf Bullen mach ich das Lama

Booyaka! Ich komm mit mehr Auswahl als 'n Supermarkt
Mich burnen ist 'ne haarige Angelegenheit wie 'n Kampf mit Chewbacca

Ich kick Battle-Raps wie Hacky Sacks, wenn ich MCs untersuch'
Diagnose: Größenwahn im fortgeschrittenen Stadium
Ich komm bei eurer Party rum, mit Ideen krank wie Parkinson
Ihr werdet bloßgestellt, so dass auch trotz Gürtel die Hose fällt
Bei eurer Show hat Flow gefehlt, heute geht ihr mal ohne Geld

Hamburg City macht den Markt klar
Mit Buback, Eimsbush, Yo Mama
So fleißig wie die Japaner
Und täglich werden wir larger
Wenn da 'n Jam letztes Jahr war
Wo nix aus Hamburg am Start war
War's wie Jimi ohne Wah-Wah
Oder Schimi ohne Parka

Ahn das mal! Wir bringen frischen Flavor wie Zahnpasta
Team Eimsbush mit Styles einer andern Art in den nächsten Jahren am Start
Tropf und ich schon mehr Gras verbrannt, als jeder Rastamann
Ihr Typen rappt just for fun? Es hört sich unfassbar an!

Ey, das ist das Derbste

Was soll der Scheiß, eure Songs sind Psychoterror wie 'n Poltergeist
Und erst seitdem ich sie kenn', weiß ich wirklich was Folter heißt
Niveaulos, doch wir bringen Rap höher als ein Pilot muss
Dreihundertsechzig Grad rund wie 'n Globus, wieso bloß

Ey, Alder
Die meisten rappen so lala
Die Beats sind süchtig nach mager
Mann und um solche Versager
Macht man dann so 'n großes Trara
Scheiß auf das ganze Theater
Wie hoch der Promoetat war
Style ist unbezahlbar
Und ohne bist du nur AA
Ich bin ein Vinylliebhaber
Und du ein CD-Jasager
Ich sample gern Jamaikaner
Du samplest Hannoveraner
Mein Rap ist derbe, der Knaller
Du rappst schlechter als dein Vadder
Ich hab Fans im Promilager
Deine haben noch nicht mal Schamhaar

Was ist los? Ihr Typen meint ihr kickt krasse Flows?
Ihr macht euch größer als ihr seid, wie Leute mit Buffalos
Und sowas geht auf keinen Fall klar, frag mal MC B
Hier kommt Samy D. Mit mehr Boo-Yah als die Family!

Ey, das ist das Derbste

Foxy Music

Ja, yeah
Wir können alle einpacken und nach Hause gehen
Denn für Rap gibt's 'ne App auch auf PC
Jetzt kriegt jeder 'n paar Mausklicks und umsonst
Ein komplettes Heimstudio mit Ausblick auf die Bronx
Ausgerüstet mit 'nem digitalen Beatknopf
Der alle Sytles liefert, von Lil' John bis Pete Rock
Und dank dem Spitterlyzer kann der Enkel mit der Oma
In Sekunde schnell rappen, sowie Redman und J Hova
Ja, ihr lacht, doch ihr wisst, dass ich recht hab
Da jeder Hans oder Franz heute Rap macht
Und ich warte, wo sind die Unikate
Die Suche bleibt vergebens, wie die, nach der Bundeslage
Denn alle klingen irgendwie gleich
Haben keine Ideen und schielen nur über den Teich
Kochen nach fremden Rezepten, wie 'n Hobbykoch
Machen Mucke nich' im Studio, sonder im Copyshop

Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt rappen wie ich?
Deluxemäßig flowen, Styles kicken wie ich?
Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt schreiben wie ich?
Die Leute live rocken, nur oft bleiben sie nicht
Ich sag: Wie jetzt? Ihr Typen wollt rappen wie ich?
Deluxemäßig flowen, Styles kicken wie ich?
Wie jetzt? Heutzutage will jeder mitspielen
Mcen und DJen, nur leider geht da nich' viel (ja, ja)

Hör' mir zu Digga, ahnma
Ich spitte seit ich rauskam aus meiner Mama
Damals konntest du uns noch zu siebt sehen
Dann kam die erste LP, ich war siebzehn
Rap noch in Kinderschuhen, Größe höchstens zwanzig
Danach der Beginner-Boom, ich war höchstens zwanzig
Eins, Zwo Mikrofon-Check
Und vor der Bühne plötzlich mehr als höchstens zwanzig
Jetzt gibt es Gangsterrap, Hipsterrap und die OGs
Dicker Rentner in der Trotzphase
Erzähl mir nicht es herrschen kalte dunkle Zeiten
Jammer mich nicht voll, Digga, Daunjacke Rotznase
Alles ist gut, wie es ist
Alter Fuchs, neues Fell, dicke Trommeln in mei'm Ohr
Hier hinter'm point of no return
Auf halber Strecke zwischen weißt du noch und stell dir vor

Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr
Denn vielleicht tust du's wieder
Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr

Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr
Denn vielleicht kommt es wieder
Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr

Ja, ja, ich werde nie mehr glauben, alles hält für immer
Ausgenommen sind die Rolling Stones und die Beginner
Ansonsten geht alles zu Ende - wie uns die Geschichte zeigt
Checkt Eimsbush, Harald Schmidt und Lipton Ice
Und immer nur das Gute, das Böse stirbt nicht
Checkt BMG, Beckmann und Eistee-Pfirsich
Am Ende bleiben nur die Sachen, die ich öde finde
Weil alle schönen Dinge, irgendwann flöten gingen
Aber warum, ich kriegs echt nich gerafft?
Gibt es da 'ne Freimaurerloge für schlechten Geschmack?
Entertainmenttripplesixer, die alles töten was Spaß macht
Gesponsert von Sat1 und McDonalds und Karstadt
Darf ich wegen denen nie mehr Aaliyah sehen
Doch auf allen Kanälen läuft Shania Twain
Spielen sie mit dem Showbiz wie mit Playmobil
Schickt 'n Jigga in Rente, macht 'n Jacko pädophil
Ich sag, jemand muss sie stoppen, aber ich kann es nicht
Denn sie kennen meine Stimme und sie kennen mein Gesicht, ja

Ah, yo, ah, yo, Digga
Ich hab noch nie wirklich gewusst, weshalb ich eigentlich lebe
Und wie es wär', wenn es das Leben und all die Scheiße nich' gäbe
Doch über solche Dinge, wie: „Wieso sind wir hier?“
Werd ich nie mehr in grellen Klassenzimmern philosophiern
Nie mehr morgens zwischen übereifrigen Kindern sitzen
Die beim sich zu Wort melden, dumm mit dem Finger schnippen
Das Gefühl haben, dass ich vor Mathe-Tests hatte
Das Gefühl der Kopf is 'ne kaputte Festplatte
Ja, es gibt Zeiten, denen muss ich die rote Karte zeigen:
Zeiten mit wenig Spaß und ohne Schokoladenseiten
Wie jene als schicke Anti-Fa mit Läuse und Krätze
Als ich im Alles-ist-scheiße-Style Häuser besetzte
Nach dem Motto „Hauptsache Anti“, doch gar nichts checken
Gingen wir gegen das System vegetarisch essen
Was war ich nich damals für 'nen derber Spinner
Dennoch sind es Zeiten, an die ich mich gern erinner'

Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr
Denn vielleicht tust du's wieder
Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr

Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr
Denn vielleicht kommt es wieder
Ich sag nie mehr: Nie mehr (never say never again)

Never, never say never again
Never, never say never again

Ja, der eine kommt von da, wo sie Hosen aus Leder tragen
Der andere aus der Stadt, aus der die Attentäter kamen
Der dritte von kommt da, wo hm, naja aus Bremerhaven
Und zusammen machen sie Alarm wie 'n Peterwagen
Moment mal, was erzählst du da den Leuten bloß Lederhosen?
Die sind viel zu eng für mich wegen meinen mega Hoden
Man verarscht mich deshalb auch, ich würd' in einer Gegend wohnen
Wo Militärs Versuche machen und Radioaktivität erproben
Ey yo, du meinst, dein Leben mit großen Hoden wär schwer
Mein Pimmel ist zwei Zentimeter vom Boden entfernt
Ja man, ich werde schreien: „Lobet den Herrn“
Wenn sie dreibeinige Hosen zur Mode erklären
Ja ja, mach du nur Witze, doch für mich ist es ein Grundproblem
Meine Bowlingkugeln machen mir des Leben unbequem
Schwimmen, Dicker, ist nicht, denn sonst würd' ich untergehen
Wie viele Kilo wiegen die denn so? So circa hundertzehn!
Mein Lieber, du bist nicht allein mit den Problemen
Mich nennen sie doch auch das Superdildophänomen
Muss immer Großraumtaxi fahren und kann nie die Metro nehmen
Und brauche riesige Kondome aus Neopren

Kauft euch alle mal Boote, denn ich muss piseln, Leute
Mit meiner Riesenkeule, größer als die Siegessäule
Scheiße man, damit kriegst du sicher viele Bräute
Ne, die sind alle geplatzt wie Friedensträume
Dicker, ich dachte fette Eier wären bei Frauen 'e geile Taktik
Der Abstand zwischen meinen Knien neun Meter dreiundachtzig
Deshalb wundert's mich auch, dass ich niemals eine abkrieg
Wenn ich charmant am Lächeln vor ihnen auf meinem Sack sitz'
Seit dem elften September leb' ich in Angst
Vielleicht stürzen die auch Flugzeuge auf meinen Schwanz
Darum, seh ich was Verdächtiges in meiner Reichweite
Dann gibt 's 'ne Breitseite mit meiner Fleischpeitsche

Ey, woher hast du diese Nikes, Eizi?
Ich wusste gar nicht, dass es die auch in weiß gibt
Du sammelst schon seit vielen Jahren so fleißig
Wie viel Paare hast du? Neunhundertdreißig?

Ich komme raus aus dem Haus, schrei': „Yeah“
An meinen Füßen, da sind neue Nike Air
Alle wollen wissen: „Digga, wo hast du die her?“
Ich krieg nie genug, Digga, ich will immer mehr
Air Max und Dunks in meinem Schrank
Denn ich bring meine Kohle lieber nicht zur Bank
Ich krieg nie genug, Digga, ich will immer mehr
Alle wollen wissen: „Digga, wo hast du die her?“

Ich sag: „Falls es noch nicht jeder weiß
Ich rocke Air Max, denn die sind der Scheiß“
90er, 1er oder auch Lites
Aus Hongkong und London und nicht von Snipes
Mein Ebay-Account, der läuft heiß
Ich kauf sie mir doppelt, weil ein Paar nicht reicht
Hemden und Hosen, die sitzen jetzt tight
Doch an den Füßen, der Air Max, der bleibt

Ich komme raus aus dem Haus, schrei': „Yeah“
An meinen Füßen, da sind neue Nike Air
Alle wollen wissen: „Digga, wo hast du die her?“

Sie schütteln den Kopf, fragen mich, was das soll
Das Fach von Herrn Eißfeldt, das ist immer voll
Orange Kartons aus Paris und Stockholm
Leder vom Rind und vom Strauß und vom Wolf
Ich hab sie in lila, in blau und in gold
Ich rocke sie fresh, Digga, und niemals oll
Trete mir drauf und ich zieh' meinen Colt

Voll erwischt, du Fisch zappelst am Haken
Heute Nacht wirst du im Zelt vor'm Plattenladen warten
Dabei ein Radio, falls es nochmal wiederkommt
Spontanes Desinteresse an all den anderen Liedern prompt
Die alle gleich aussehen und zu viel Schminke nehmen
Aus fünfzig Wörtern wählen, um das gleiche zu erzählen
Mit Schönheitsoperationen an digitalen Konsolen
Stylemäßig immer wieder gut beraten von Polen
Für dich gibt's nur noch eins und sonst keins
Und hält jemand nicht deins für Nummer eins
Siehst du rot, wie Heinz und sperrst ihn ein
Quälst ihn mit Simple Minds, bis er weint

Das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe, das ist Liebe
Das ist Liebe auf den ersten Kick
Nichtmal Drum 'n' Bass hält jetzt mit deinem Herzen mit
Unser Beat hat „Boom“ gemacht (Unser Beat hat „Boom“ gemacht)
Und es hat „Zoom“ gemacht

Hast du im Leben nix in Petto, ist alles Ghetto
Das heißt Glück brutto und Frust netto
Und im Gesicht' 'n Tränentattoo, ey, dann wird's Zeit für Musik
Weil dann tanzt du, und fliegst durch die Plattenboutique
Und ist deine Freundin weg, dass heißt deine Ex
Ist der Griff zum lieben Lied der Beginner dein Reflex
Nicht mehr Seiten - sondern Sprünge auf der Platte
Komm vor, bleib' entspannt, kauf 'ne Neue, is' doch Latte
Und sieht dein Leben manchmal doof aus
Mach's wie ich, hol' mein' Philosoph 'raus
Schreib 'n Text, komm dann groß raus
Du bist in mich verschossen, mein Pfeil hat dich getroffen
Nun bist du im Beginner-Rausch, früher warst du besoffen
Von zu vielen Produzenten, denn egal, wie sie's schrauben
Nur dünne Tracks und Rap und Pipi in den Augen
Deswegen drück ich selten auf die Tränendrüse
Während ich in den Charts Stehen übe

Wenn wir oben sind, ja, dann bitte alle saufen
Ja, hier wird die Optik noch groß geschrieben

Einfach mal raus aus dem Loch wie Saddam Hussein

Das Ticket kommt aus der Box und geht rein ins Ohr
Ich scheiß auf Miles and More und flieg mit Styles galore

Der Mond ist unsre Sonne
Oh ja, wir benötigen kein Licht
Oh nein, nur Dunkelheit und Stille
Ich sag: „Mehr brauchen wir nicht!“

Ah, yo
Neben mir den Sohn im Bett, über mir den Mond in Sicht
Hinter mir ein harter Tag, aufzubleiben, heut' lohnt es sich
Nachts vermiss' ich Sonne, doch Tags vermiss' Fairplay
Denn leb' ich nachts, heb ich ab wie Britisch Airways, Mensch
Dann hab ich mehr Ideen als 'n ganzes Patentamt
Mit Raps vom Derbsten und brennenden Kerzen am Adventskranz
Und hab statt Bock auf 'n Bett, Bock auf Rap, während ich wachliege
Wieder aufsteh', den Sound aufdreh' und den Krach liebe
Wir sind keine Machtmenschen, wir sind Nachtmenschen
Wir wollen uns und euch für den nächsten Tag Kraft spenden
Das hat wenig zu tun mit Saufen gehen und Party machen
Morgenstund' hat Gold im Mund, doch Abendstund' macht Platinplatten
Und während der Mond scheint wie die Sonne
Schmeiß ich den Müll von tagsüber einfach rein in die Tonne
Ich schmied 'nen Plan, während ich mir von morgen 'n Bild mache
Leo in den Arm wie früher mit 'ner Milchflasche
Die Große zur Schule bringen, den Kleinen in den Kindergarten
Und danach 'n paar Stunden für meine Beginner haben
Ich freu mich drauf, während meine Frau schläft und ich Texte schreib'
Dennoch bleib' ich wach bis die Sonne aufgeht wie Blätterteig

Der Mond ist unsre Sonne
Oh ja, wir benötigen kein Licht
Oh nein, nur Dunkelheit und Stille
Ich sag: „Mehr brauchen wir nicht!“

Ich sag: „Wenn die Sonne unter und der Mond aufgeht
Das ist der Moment, wo Eizi Eiz auflebt“
Und rausgeht mit dem Fahrrad durch sein Viertel cruist
Denn Eimsbüttel ist es am schönsten, wenn Eimsbüttel ruht
Wenn alle schlafen ,die Penner und die Millionäre
Die Straßen leer wie bei Küblböck die Kinosäle
Oh ja man, ich mag es genau so
Alles lautlos und keine Autos
Freie Fahrt für den Typ aufm Rad
Mit dem iPod am Start, Volume auf Anschlag
Bergab, vierspurig, ich fahr' Schlangenlinien
So kann es weitergehen, von mir aus bis nach Argentinien
Frische Luft um die Ohren, die den Kopf reinigt
Darum ist mir jede Nacht wie ein Gott heilig
Denn nur zu so unchristlichen Zeiten
Kann ich stylen und feilen an Meilensteinen, ja

Der Mond ist unsere Sonne (ja, mann)
Oh ja, wir benötigen kein Licht
Oh nein, nur Dunkelheit und Stille
Ich sag: „Mehr brauchen wir nicht!“

Ne man, mehr nicht
Und auch wenn er sich versteckt hält
Wer denn?
Hinter Wolken und Beton
Ach ja, der Mond, ich bin stoned
Dann wird er immer für uns dasein
Oh ja, bis die Morgensonne kommt

The mind, the mind, the mind
The mind of a child is a beginner's mind 
And beginner's mind is about having sort of an attitude of 
Openness and eagerness and a lack of preconceptions
When it comes to studying a subject
In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities
In the expert's mind there are few
So by approaching a subject the way a beginner or a child would
We start to open up possibilities and we lead ourselves open to a

Beginner,"Ah wie ich in den Seilen häng
Letzte Nacht war ich ziemlich peinlich denn
Aus meinem Mund kam nix außer Müll
Und ich hab mehr Kohle verbrannt als'n Grill

Ich würd mich gern wegzaubern Abrakadabra
Fuck, wieder so 'n rabenschwarzer Kater
Gestern noch Superman, heute Drach-man
Der wie 'n Scheintoter in sei'm Bett abhängt
Und ich hasse diesen Tag später
Wenn man 'nen Helm hat wie Darth Vader
Game Over, Schach-Matt, Durchfall, Kopfschmerz
Mann, ich fühl mich Asbach Uralt
Doch wen wundert's nach 50 Kurzen
Ich geh auf Klo nochmal gründlich furzen
Und würd' mein Elend gern vertuschen
Doch es dampft aus meinen Poren selbst nach einer Stunde duschen
Und jedermann riecht es, jedermann sieht's
Ich seh aus wie'n Obdachloser mit Elefantitis
Der Herr der Augenringe, müde und allein
Bis es nächste Woche wieder heißt einer geht noch rein!

Gestern war ich blau, heute seh' ich schwarz
Versteck mich im Bett
Denn so voll wie ich war
So leer bin ich jetzt
Bewege mich träge durch eigenen Nebel
Kein Wind für die Segel und immernoch Pegel
Denn so voll wie ich war
So leer bin ich jetzt

Ich wach auf, oder so ähnlich
Seh' nix, die Augen krustig und klebrig
Fühl mich eklig, hab Angst ich übergeb' mich
Dreh' mich um und schlaf' noch ein wenig
Aber geht nicht, denn in meinem Schädel 
Spielt Lars Ulrich Schlagzeug und ich hab noch Pegel
Und ist das Vogelzwitschern oder Lungenpfeifen
Rihanna kann sich in dem Pelz auf meiner Zunge kleiden
Nie mehr Alkohol, wirklich, das schwör' ich
Mein Körper fühlt sich an wie Dresden '45
Und wenn du dich im Club bis 7 vergnügst
Hast du Karl Dall auf Crack, der dich im Spiegel begrüßt
Mir egal ich werd' heut eh nicht mehr rausgehen
Nur noch vom Bett zum Kühlschrank zur Couch gehen
Und dann hock ich da und kau auf meinem Zwieback
Roll mich in die Decke und denke, dass mich keiner lieb hat?

Geh' durch die Straßen ohne Farben, ohne Leben
Beißende soziale Kälte bläst mir entgegen

Ohne Migration, vollkommen unterfremdet

Covers freezing land where I was born

Watch the streams of frozen tears
Spilled with blood of forefathers

And spirits gather, floating in the mist

Visions of destruction's ruin and tragedies
Tasting pure sin, fade into the pit
And walk through my beloved, endless woods

On the sea ov motion

Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
That myself I redefine
Look in and above
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin
She's eager to rise
And so eager to please

Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars
Looking for company
Where art Thou?

From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth

split my skin, fuck my wounds
Desecrate the Inner Sanctum in which I hide
Drag me through the mud, blind my whitening eyes
That I may see darkness in the tunnels ov light

pain I cannot deny
As I rot in this empty shell
Swamped is disaffection
Introducing to my newborn hell

be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered

I nevermourn, I never look back
As long as Thy phosphoric rays
Grant me more pleasure than pain
I, who is evil can receive no good
Though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch ov grace...

pain is timeless
When I question the laws ov god
Drowned in everlasting confusion
Caress my hate against the mob

be it not so!
Thou shall see me not in agony
Failure was and is no option
'tis my undying self
The ever wandering son ov the morn
Abandoned, yet never to be conquered
The opponent!
My life's work is complete...

Behemoth,"From long forgotten eons,
At sunrise thou shouldst come.
Desired for so fucking long.
Ascend at my command,
Surmount the sea,
Throw open portals of life;
And scale this endless mountain.
Of grace and of tears,
Oh voice unspoken, mourn unheard,
Abandoned heart so desolate!

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne,
When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!
Forever and beyond.

When heavenly chants mute;
Thy apparition I behold. 
Oh Venus, the sweetest of them all,
Let me bathe in thy divinity.
Descend! And Thou hast descended,
Depart not yet!
I crave for warmth of blissful rays,
And fateless eyes encourage me.
The ancient's dreaming.
The wolf's unchained.
Disobedience has such a victorious taste!

Rise!
Bow down before the kingless throne,
When sun is yet to rise.
Consume this putrid sphere!

Behemoth,"In my church of disbelief 
It canst get no better 
When days turn from black to grey 
In church of indifference 
So innocent in their guilt 
Perfect in their imperfection 
Let my children play 

In my church of liberation 
When doubts and fears wither away 
I stand alone vs. the world 
In the church of man 
Where god is trapped in human flesh 
I never pray 
In church of pain 
I spoil none but myself 
Yet my monologue's unheard 

In my church of hope 
Yearning for Thy sweet embrace 
The waters of Styx I have crossed 
In this church of sulfur rain 
Flaming mouth of Sheol 
In my church of broken word 
It's so little that I ask 
The brightest of the days 
The darkest of the nights 

What once was 
I wish no longer be 
Fear of separation is no more 
One cosmic breath-the whole eternity 
Unbroken flow of awareness conquers entropy

Let them shine through me 
Split the seas 
Awake inner divinity

Spending my money, honey, I didn't care
Taking my friends out for a mighty good time
I drank that good gin, champagne and wine

Just as soon as my money got low
I couldn't find no friends and I had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it till that eagle grins

'Cause I found out that nobody wants you
Nobody wants you when they find out
That you're down and out
In your pocket, there's not not one penny
And as for friends, you don't have any

Just let you get back up on your feet again

Intro:

Weisst do noch Beirut?
Ich kam ohne ein Cent in meiner Tasche nach Berlin!
Ohne ein Cent! Kannste dich erinnern?
Ja man haha, wie könnt? ich das vergessen?!

(Part 1):

Ich kam nach Berlin, ich hab bei Beirut geschlafen
Man ich war nie ein Rapper hab nur ?n Gabelstapler gefahren
Doch dann kam alles anders ich verschickte hunderte von Demotapes
Keiner wollt mich haben ausser MC Basstard wollt mich sehen
Und dort saß ich nun, und trank ?nen grünen Tee
Und fragte Basstard wie es nun um meine Zukunft steht
Do musst das Rappen üben, man also tat ich das
Ich nahm Block und Stift in meine Hand und schrieb dann Tag und Nacht
Ich nahm dann kurz danach ?nen Song hinter dem Kotti auf
Woroc kann?s bestätigen ich lebte förmlich für den Traum
Schon nach dem zweiten Song, ich nannte es ?Das Ghettolied?
Wurde mir klar dass ich den Sound mach den die Strasse liebt
Hab meine Eltern mitgebracht doch erst den Song verteilt
Keiner hat daran geglaubt dass er beim Major unterschreibt
Das war mein eigner Hype, ich hab ihn selbst kreiert
Doch seit Ashraf kenne spür ich wie der Weg nach oben führt

Refrain (2x):

Wir gehen auf?s Ganze wir wollen alles oder nichts
Das hier ist unsre letzte Chance es geht um alles oder nichts
Wir schuften all die Jahre hart, doch ich hab das Glück vermisst
Komm arbeit weiter Junge, bis do glücklich bist

(Part 2):

Ich hab?s satt, dass meine Eltern sich beschweren
Ich hab?s satt nein ich will kein Job-Center mehr
Ich hab?s satt Hartz IV zu kassieren
Ich hab?s satt meine Freiheit zu riskieren
Ich hab?s satt zu hören dass aus mir sowieso nichts wird
Der 20 Jährige der wird von Al?Massiva präsentiert
Ich hab die Scheisse satt, ich will nach oben Junge
Ich atme ein, ich pump den Sauerstoff in meine Lunge
Ich hab es satt diese tausend Gerüchte zu hören
Ich hab es satt dass sich die Lehrer über mich beschweren
Ich hab es satt dass all die Rapper nur noch Lügen erzählen
Ich hab es satt ohne ein Cent in meiner Tasche zu leben
Ich hab es satt zu hören dass ich kein Berliner wär?
Denn als Nichtberliner macht man dir das Leben schwer
Ich seh das positiv, ich bin nur ?n Berliner mehr
Ich bin dieser Wahlberliner, ich bin der berliner Bär

Refrain (2x):

Wir gehen auf?s Ganze wir wollen alles oder nichts
Das hier ist unsre letzte Chance es geht um alles oder nichts
Wir schuften all die Jahre hart, doch ich hab das Glück vermisst
Komm arbeit weiter Junge, bis do glücklich bist

(Part 3):

Ich geh auf?s Ganze ich will alles oder nichts
Ich teil dein Schädel auf Beton wenn do den Gangster unterbrichst
Ich bin gesignt, guck M-A-S hat das Talent entdeckt
Do behauptest Rap sei dein Geschäft doch es ist mein Geschäft
Sein Geschäft, das ist unser Leben, unser Traum
Ich weiss genau ich steiger mich und das mit Gänsehaut
Al?Massiva jeder wollt? uns in den Dreck ziehen
Ich nutze mein Talent und ihr geht unter so wie Maxfield
Graue Wolken denn I'm Ghetto gibt?s kein Sonnenschein
Die Bullen haben nur ?n Job wegen meinem Freundeskreis
Rechne mit dem Schlimmsten, meine Zeit ist angebrochen
Ihr kommt angekrochen mich kann nicht mal ein Tsunami stoppen
Stop! Wir sitzen alle auf ?n Schuldenberg
Jeder macht, jeder rennt dem gleichen Cent hinterher
Wir machen Hits für Hits doch ihr Hunde fördert nicht
Guck ich förder mich, ich bin der Junge der befördert ist

Refrain (2x):

Wir gehen auf?s Ganze wir wollen alles oder nichts
Das hier ist unsre letzte Chance es geht um alles oder nichts
Wir schuften all die Jahre hart, doch ich hab das Glück vermisst
Komm arbeit weiter Junge, bis do glücklich bist
",Alles Oder Nichts,2009
Beirut,"Part 1,Massiv,Beirut):

Ich sehe Menschen die das Gute in dir gar nicht sehen
Ich seh die Jugend wie sie mit den Drogen untergehen
Ich sehe Mütter die in tiefer Trauer Kinder quälen
Ich seh die Eltern wie sie ratlos vor dem Richter stehen
Ich sehe Mädchen die am Strassenrand die Stunden zählen
Die für 20 Euro splitternackt I'm Auto Runden drehen
Ich seh das Mädchen wie sie Schmerzen hat vor lauter Wehnen
Ich seh die Junkies wie sie in den Nadeln baden gehen
Ich sehe Typen die I'm Einkaufszentrum klauen gehen
Die Jugend ist gefangen in der Kriminalität
Ich seh so vieles aber kann es leider nicht verstehen
Ich seh dein Sohn wie er verwarlost auf der Parkbank schläft
Ich seh ?nen Bullen der ?nen Unschuldigen niederschlägt
Ich seh den Typen der vor seiner Mum die Hand erhebt
Ich seh so viel wie konnt man all das Übel übersehen?
Weil wir der Wahrheit nicht ins Auge sehen!

Refrain (2x):

Wir sind blind vor Hass weil unsre Zeit zu schnell vergeht
Uns kommt es vor als ob schon jetzt die letzte Stunde schlägt
Guck wie wir untergehen, die letzten Stunden zählen
Guck wir sind blind weil wir der Wahrheit nicht ins Auge sehen

(Part 2):

Ich seh die Kinder schon mit 14 in der Spielothek
Er klaut das Geld von seinem Vater er kann der Sucht nicht widerstehen
Ich seh die Frau sie weint ihr Mann hat ihr das Herz gebrochen
Sie belogen, sie betrogen, mitten in ihr Herz gestochen
Ich seh die Narbe guck mein Bruder wurde angeschossen
Es ist einfach zu viel Blut geflossen
Ich seh Soldaten die I'm Krieg von ihren Kindern träumen
Ich seh kleine Kinder die I'm Kriegsgebiet die Mienen räumen
Ich seh kleine Mädchen voller Hornhaut einen Teppich stricken
Sie sind ganz verwahrlost und sie bitten nur um eine Bitte
Ich seh Menschen schicken ihre Eltern in das Altersheim
Sie ham sie großgezogen doch jetzt sind sie ganz allein
Ich seh die Menschen die das Gute in dir gar nicht sehen
Dich zu Boden drücken sogar wenn do grad? nach Gnade flehst
Ich seh so viel wie konnt? man all das Übel übersehen?
Weil wir der Wahrheit nicht ins Auge sehen!

Refrain (2x):

Wir sind blind vor Hass weil unsre Zeit zu schnell vergeht
Uns kommt es vor als ob schon jetzt die letzte Stunde schlägt
Guck wie wir untergehen, die letzten Stunden zählen
Guck wir sind blind weil wir der Wahrheit nicht ins Auge sehen

Caro RZA qui la storia è tesa
Potersi esprimere sta diventando un'impresa, o meglio
Poterlo fare liberi da vincoli politici
Senza assecondare orrendi gusti estetici

Appena fuori standard ti senti solo dire
Di essere troppo all'avanguardia e quindi incollocabile
Fuori tempo minimo per essere comprensibile
Condannato alla gavetta eterna a raccattare briciole

Per semplice che sia RZA mio, credimi
Sono anni che va avanti questo gioco degli screditi
Dei titoli assegnati senza meriti
Da chi il fischio d'arbitro la vinto ad una lottery

Troppi incompetenti nelle posizioni cardine
Troppe le barriere che si alzano ad un ordine
Troppi quei sorrisi a mascherare I modi barbari
Troppe le energie necessarie ad esser liberi

Prima che I teppisti dell'estetica
Istigati dall'istinto
Si insinuano negli intestini
Artistici di direttori stitici
Avanzano con moti di rivolta peristaltici

Risalgono alla volta dello stomaco
Altamente indigeribili si insediano
Aprendo ulcere profonde come gole
Urlandoci parole fino a farle traboccare

Volando in un conato salvatore
A metà della riunione
Ma dimmi, ti pare giusto RZA?
Che si debba fare questa cosa
Ogni volta che uno si riposa?
Dopo aver provato a dare il meglio

Dopo avere fatto un altro figlio
Vederselo strappare da chirurghi
Dilettanti allo sbaraglio
Che se commettono uno sbaglio capita
Fanno una modifica e il tempo si decapita
Non versano una lacrima, bacio all'anima
Avanti il prossimo

So I asked me father quite seriously
To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee.

And this is what he said to me.

He said, ""The woman piaba and the man piaba
and the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass,
The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm,
And the famous grandy scratch scratch.

Known to the world as Albert Einstein.
He said ""Son, from the beginning of time and creativity
There existed the force of relativity
Pi r square and a minus ten means a routine only when
The solar system in one light year
Make the Hayden planetarium disappear
So if Mt Everest doesn't move
I am positive that it will prove

I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He spoke the name Bojangles then he danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants, a better stance
Oh he jumped so high, he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Traveled about

After twenty years he still grieves

He said I dance now at every chance in Honky tonks
For drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
'Cause I drinks a bit

You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that she's half crazy
And that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That came all the way from China
And just when you want to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her
'Cause she's touched your perfect body with her mind

And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From a lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain
Only drowning men could se Him
He said ""All men shall be sailors,
Then, until the sea shall free them""
But He Himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken almost human,
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone

And you want to travel with Him
And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust Him
For He's touched your perfect body with His mind

Suzanne takes you down to her place by the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever

On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
A mid the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way for ever
While Suzanne holds her mirror

And you want to travel blind
And you think you maybe trust her

Bela B.,"Du hast gearbeitet wie ein Tier
Und es hat keinen interessiert
Hattest dein Ziel stets im Visier
Doch nur dein Spiegelbild hat applaudiert
Und es war trotzdem nicht umsonst
Im Zweifel war es für die Kunst
Allein darauf lässt dus nicht beruhen
Denn wenn du ehrlich zu dir bist
Weißt du wenns nochmal soweit ist
Du würdest alles ganz genauso tun, denn

Irgendetwas bleibt
Irgendetwas bleibt ganz sicher zurück
Als Zeugnis für eine Hoffnung
Ein zu früh versprochenes Glück
Der Traum ist aus
Er bliebt nur für einen kurzen Augenblick
Doch es bleibt etwas bleibt
Immer bleibt etwas zurück

Jetzt ist sie vorbei
Die Liebe, die ein Leben hält
So lange gab es nur euch Zwei
Jetzt bist du der einsamste Mensch der Welt
Gelähmt vom allertiefstem Schmerz
Verfluchst du dein verletztes Herz
Und die Erinnerung lässt dich nicht ruhen
Das zu verkraften fällt dir schwer
Doch wenns noch einmal soweit wär
Würdest dus wieder ganz genauso tun, denn

Irgendetwas bleibt
Irgendetwas bleibt ganz sicher zurück

Dann wird ein Mann noch steh‘n und einer bleibt liegen

Doch für mein Pferd, da lass ich jede Schönheit gehen
Vom Pokern pleite, von den Huren ausgenommen,
Wo kann ich einen letzten Whiskey herbekommen?

Willst hier raus, musst Du mich erst besiegen

Béla Fleck,"One day I'd like to be rich and famous
Maybe be funny like Andy and Ames
Be on TV and sing like Stevie
And have a girl who'd never leave me

But I'd really like a place
Where there could be no war
A bright and shiny world where there ain't no poor
Where there's opportunity, peace and unity
Where people can be what they want to be

And where Apartheid could never happen again
Where people don't judge you by the color of your skin
Where I hold your hand and you hold mine
Where a helpful hand is never hard to find
A place where people care
Where no one could bear
When someone's hungry, with nothin' there
Where the heart is never cold
The young are never needy,
The old are never poor,
And the rich are never greedy

So bring the power to the people
The people to the power
Cuz now is the time, this is the hour
To stop thinkin' about war start thinkin' about peace
So on this life, we can get another lease
With a lesson to learn
A new direction to turn
So we can take it to the sky where we belong
Cuz 'fore to long, we been to wrong
We've got the right notes
But we play the wrong song
Stop thinkin' with your wallet
Think with your mind
So we can move ahead
Instead of behind
We got the people selling drugs
People are dying
Politicians talking and we know they're lyin'
Taxes for the poor, none for the rich
People starvin' here in American
Now ain't that a bummer

And now my heats been turned off
From my job, I've been laid off
What am I gonna do?
Well, is the shape I'm in
Because of my dark skin?
Now I know that can't be true
But since we're all down here
Let's work to make it better
Do our best for what it's worth
But you know the rules are bent
When you have to pay rent
Just to live on earth
Talk about justice

We're gonna do something now
That's gonna be really slick
We're gonna listen to Mr. Fleck and Chick

I'm gonna say one more thing
Then I'll get outta your face
How 'bout a sound
With a little bass

And we got missles on the ground
Lasers in space
Underground shelters, just in case
That something goes boom
Certain doom
Cuz in our hearts we didn't make enough room
For the love
It comes from up above
Let's stop talking war
And let's offer the dove

Cuz when it's done it's over
When it's over, it's done

And see nobobdy won

but love grows old, and waxes cold

but not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

Have you this misery a very long time? 
Well if you if, I'll lay it on the line

Put on your sailing shoes 
Everyone will start to cheer 
When you put on your sailin' shoes",Sailin' Shoes,2008
Béla Fleck,"One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go 
Let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin' through

In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go 
Let me go

And no matter how hard I try 
I can't escape these things inside I know 
I know
When all the pieces fall apart 
You will be the only one who knows
Who knows

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand

Béla Fleck,"Listen while you read!
Songwriters: Jimmy Cliff
They tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
The day that you're born to when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry

As sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

The officers are tryin' to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
Though they think they've got the battle won
I say, ""Forgive them, Lord, they know not what they've done""

As sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share of what's mine
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all
Harder they come, harder they'll fall, one and all

Though I know that when you're dead, you can't
Rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave

Béla Fleck & the Flecktones,"One day I'd like to be rich and famous
Maybe be funny like Andy and Ames
Be on TV and sing like Stevie
And have a girl who'd never leave me

But I'd really like a place
Where there could be no war
A bright and shiny world where there ain't no poor
Where there's opportunity, peace and unity
Where people can be what they want to be

And where Apartheid could never happen again
Where people don't judge you by the color of your skin
Where I hold your hand and you hold mine
Where a helpful hand is never hard to find
A place where people care
Where no one could bear
When someone's hungry, with nothin' there
Where the heart is never cold
The young are never needy,
The old are never poor,
And the rich are never greedy

So bring the power to the people
The people to the power
Cuz now is the time, this is the hour
To stop thinkin' about war start thinkin' about peace
So on this life, we can get another lease
With a lesson to learn
A new direction to turn
So we can take it to the sky where we belong
Cuz 'fore to long, we been to wrong
We've got the right notes
But we play the wrong song
Stop thinkin' with your wallet
Think with your mind
So we can move ahead
Instead of behind
We got the people selling drugs
People are dying
Politicians talking and we know they're lyin'
Taxes for the poor, none for the rich
People starvin' here in American
Now ain't that a bummer

And now my heats been turned off
From my job, I've been laid off
What am I gonna do?
Well, is the shape I'm in
Because of my dark skin?
Now I know that can't be true
But since we're all down here
Let's work to make it better
Do our best for what it's worth
But you know the rules are bent
When you have to pay rent
Just to live on earth
Talk about justice

We're gonna do something now
That's gonna be really slick
We're gonna listen to Mr. Fleck and Chick

I'm gonna say one more thing
Then I'll get outta your face
How 'bout a sound
With a little bass

And we got missles on the ground
Lasers in space
Underground shelters, just in case
That something goes boom
Certain doom
Cuz in our hearts we didn't make enough room
For the love
It comes from up above
Let's stop talking war
And let's offer the dove

Cuz when it's done it's over
When it's over, it's done
We look back at the wars
And see nobobdy won
It's time to make a better place
For out daughters and our sons
Or life will be a blast

Meet me before time in a moment so close
Find another way to open your heart to me

Every now and then there's a moment so close
I can see the future, telescope in front of me
Isn't it the way for a moment so near
To be further from the past and how we want to be

Way up high
The little folks zooming by
Ask them why
Or if they know the way we're goin'

Underneath the skin, in a moment so close
A little particles running 'round inside of me
Smaller than it goes, is a moment so near
More than I comprehendin' is a part of me

Started withe the light shinin' down from the sun
In a moment it would travel accross the universe
Couldn't you believe in a moment so real
More than words could say
And more than eyes could see you there

The ancient ways we turn
Descendents from the sky
De-act them where the spilled
To late to wonder why

Way up high
We're looking for a northern light
Hopin' that the evenin' star
Could point the way to where we're goin'

So close
So near
Where is
The faith

A moment close at hand
Whose hand will shake the ground
The answers all to clear
The questions to be found

Way up high
The little folks zooming by
Don't ask why
As if they know the way we're goin'

The dark, to fly
To take, the sky
To clear, so high
To late, don't try
So close, so near
It is, the fear

Funny how it goes with a moment so near
In a little while you can almost feel your fear
Meet me before time in a moment so close
Find another way to open your heart to me",A Moment So Close,2000

Béla Mavrák,"There's a story the gypsies know is true
That when your love wears golden earrings,
She belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
But if you wear those golden earrings,
Love will come to you.

By the burning fire,they will glow with ev'ry coal.
You will hear desire whisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy,
Make love your guiding light,
And let that pair of golden earrings
Cast their spell tonight.",Golden Earrings,
Béla Szakcsi Lakatos,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Todo acabó, no queda más
Seremos dos extraños
Yo te olvidaré, me olvidarás
Hasta nunca.

Y dónde quedó ese botón
Que lleva a la felicidad
Luna de miel, rosa pastel
Clichés y tonterías

Y al final, ni hablar
Los dos nos destruimos
Y al final qué tal
Tu y yo ya no existimos

No, no quiero ser esa mujer
Ella se fue a un abismo
Y tú no eres aquél que prometió
Sería mi súper héroe

Y que todo acabó, no queda más
Seremos dos extraños,
Yo te olvidaré, me olvidarás
Hasta nunca

Yo ya no me acordaría de ti
Pensar que un día fui la respuesta
De la pregunta que hoy quiero olvidar

¿Donde esta el corazón de quién tu amas?
Tal vez en un rincón del mar de tus besos
Del mar que quiero secar
Del mar

Tal vez si yo fuera un poco más sensata
Habría inventado una poción
Para borrar el sabor de tu boca
Y la pregunta que hoy quiero olvidar

¿Donde esta el corazón de quién tu amas?
Tal vez en un rincón del mar de tus besos
Del mar que quiero secar
Del mar que un día fue para mi
Y, ¿hoy de quién?

Yo lo sé
Una noche que habla de amigos, un cocktail
No lo sé
Mi vestido está adentro del closet
Y no sé que usaré
Mi cabeza que sólo da vueltas
Es por él

Luces de color, un flash eléctrico
La noche se acerca
Automático, late en mi interior
No para, se acerca
No paras de bailar, no paras de bailar
La noche se acerca
Por más que trato de buscar
No te puedo ver

Fluorescente se muestra tu cara
Sólo te quiero ver
En la pista que sólo me llamas
Sólo yo giraré
Es la música que me acelera
Sólo yo volaré

Es por él

In front of Dorsey High with a marijuana cigarette
At the marketplace, very African
Sippin' on some liquor that I copped from the Pakistan
Shoelaces, red, gold, green
'Bout to hit up that parade for the Martin Luther King
Niggas at Louisiana Chicken sat trippin'
Ck shirts on, Anti-Crippin'
Damn
I'm just try'na move these incense
This situation so intense
Still see the families barbecuein', drill teams 
In the middle of the street this is how we do it
This was 9-6 and that was the jam still
Back when niggas banged heavy metal like anvil
Droppin' off the cliff on the head of that coyote
Gettin' chased by the blue bird, just like cody
Get it? Forget it
I'm up at autobahn
Walkin' past people sellin' jewelry on they front lawn
Seen this rap nigga I used to have beef with
Walkin' in his tank top like he on some G-Shit

Saw my homies from my neighborhood comin' up the street
Dressed in all blue from the head to they feet
They didn't see me, but I seen them
I try to dip out that's when I hear the homie Demon he like
""What up Nick, cuz?""
I'm like ""Shit, fuck""
These motherfuckers Goddamn
I just don't understand
Gettin' caught up with these niggas wasn't part of the plan
I act like I'm happy to see 'em
I dap 'em up
And in the back of my mind I know they about to act up
""Haaa, what y'all niggas doin' up here?""
(Nothin' cuz, heard some enemies was up here)
(You wanna leave Nick?)
(You got a problem?)
(Guess you only kick it with us when you got a problem)
I just had them tools at my school last week
I told them fools they're trippin', then they came up there mad deep
A friend in need is a friend indeed
So I tried to distract 'em and I offered 'em some weed
It didn't work, they seen them dudes at the chicken spot
All them blood niggas standin' up on the rooftop
Didn't take long before they spotted us
And any other day they would've been done shotted us
Too many people in the street to bear witness
And they all hopped down from the roof with a quickness
I seen one of 'em try to reach in his waist
So Colossus threw a barbecue grill in his face
Sparks flyin' everywhere, people is screamin'
That's when two of 'em tried to hop on Demon
And I seen a fist comin' out of my periphery
And all of the sudden the asphalt got slippery
I got hit
My feet slipped out from under me
Now I'm goin' down, down, down, like a submarine
Knocked out cold in the middle of Crenshaw
A nigga named Grit got credit for the pinfall
I woke up, slightly concussed in handcuffs
Bleedin' from my head, I could barely even stand up
Police askin' me what transpired
When I said I didn't know they was callin' me a liar
A call on they radio said shots fired
So they had to let me go 'cause a priority was hired
They drove off, tires screechin', lights flashin'
Homies pulled up and told me get my ass in
I got to the crib and I got me a ice pack
These niggas wanna smoke right before they go strike back
Now they got jokes, laughin' cause I got knocked out
I'm happy that I'm home, I give a fuck what they talkin' 'bout
On the couch with a concussion, niggas clownin' me but well
It's better than havin' a concussion in the county jail

Ya know you called me on the phone 
And just because I was alone
Yes, you came around wooin' 
Ah, you'd better ask somebody if you don't know what you're doin'

Now you kissed me and you rocked my soul
And don't come around knockin' rock 'n' roll

Belford Hendricks,"This bitter earth
Well, what a fruit it bears
What good is love
Mmh, that no one shares?
And if my life is like the dust
Ooh, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I?
Heaven only knows

Oh, this bitter earth
Yes, can it be so cold?
Today you're young
Too soon you're old
But while a voice
Within me cries
I'm sure someone
May answer my call
And this bitter earth, ooh
May not, oh be so bitter after all",This Bitter Earth,2002
Belford Hendricks,"Unforgettable, that's what you are
Unforgettable  though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more

Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,2002
