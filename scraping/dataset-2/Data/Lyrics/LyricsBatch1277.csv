Wilton Felder,"So far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't help to know you're just time away
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood
Holding you again would only do me good
Oh how I wish I could but you're so far away

One more song about moving along the highway
I can't say much of anything that's new
But if I could only work this life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
So far away, yeah, you're so far away

Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
Nothing else to do but close my mind
And I sure hope the road don't get to own me
There's so many dreams that I've yet to find

But you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place any more?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door
And it doesn't  help to know you're so far away
So far away, yeah, you're so far away",So Far Away,2006
Wilton Gaynair Quintet,"Sophisticated lady tryin' to change my ways
Just because you're caught in your social maze
I think it's 'bout time that you realize
Your money and your power's got you mesmerized

Pretty lady, get back
Pretty lady, yea
Sophisticated lady put your blue jeans on
You're anybody's baby when your mama's gone

Educated lady with your college degree
Amazes me why you just can't see
Learned everything from your books on the shelf
But no one ever taught you how to think for yourself

Pretty lady, get back

Wim Bohets,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2004
Wim Bohets,"I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into

Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized 
How happy you made me, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

I'm standing on the edge of time
Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes 
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Yesterday's a dream
Now I face the morning
Crying on the breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy

Well you came and you gave without taking
And I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy",Mandy,2004
Wim Sonneveld,"We can hear it growing louder
Songs from every nation
Rising to your throne
Saints in every generation
Singing for your glory
Telling what you've done

from the north and south, we are crying out
There is hope in Jesus' name

You're amazing God, You're amazing God
You can bear the weight of every heavy heart
You can heal the pain, you can clean the stain
You can turn our tears into songs of praise
You're amazing God

Beauty rises from the ashes
Sorrow turns to gladness
When our God is near
You speak light into our darkness
You heal the broken-hearted
You wipe away our tears

songs of praise surround us, songs of praise surround us
Hear it growing louder, we are growing louder",The Red Blues,2002
Win Butler,"Pulled into Nazareth, feeling 'bout half past dead
Just need a place where I can lay my head
Hey mister can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?
He just grinned, shook my hand, 'no' was all he said

[Chorus:]
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
and put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
I said, 'Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'
She said, 'I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around'

[Chorus]
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
'Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?'
He said, 'Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?'

[Chorus]
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, 'I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog'
I said, 'Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man'
He said, 'That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can'

[Chorus]
Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinkin' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone",The Weight,2017
Win Win,"In your mind
You build pyramids round yourself
And into time, you'll wonder what you have left
No one can see the design of your mind
Tell you can leave constructor

[Chorus]
Laugh out laugh, but don't laugh alone
Stand up proud, your feelings are fun
Close one height to see what you've done
I won't cry as you're breaking this song

When you talk it's the opposite of yourself
Take it aim, with arms that will make to fail
The covers of... too far the... 
No one can read it's been thin from the start

Laugh out laugh, but don't laugh alone
Stand up proud, your feelings are fun
Close one height to see what you've done
I won't cry as you're breaking this song",Salt Days,2012
Win Win,"It's been so long
And it felt so long and it was so long
With all those clouds around you
Oh, the clouds around you
Hey
It's been so long
And it felt so long and it was so long
With all those clouds around you
Oh, the clouds around you
Hey
Been so long since you went in world
And the fog's around you
Lose your arms and legs
And just swim out forever then you'll
Flip through the sidewalk
And wake up on the other side
Maybe it's been too long
Are you water row?
And was the motion slow?
Do you remember the memory of ageless bodies to glow
It's been so long
And it felt so long and it was so long
With all those clouds around you
Oh, the clouds around you
Hey

Win Win,"Find another lover
Take another pill
Shake the arms that wrap around you
Skip out on the bill

Find another lover
Take another pill
It's the morning after
Find another thrill

Trying to waste another day
Trying to waste another day
Trying to waste another day

Everybody wants you
When your cup is full
Kiss yourself to settle down
If you had only felt the pull

There must be someone better
Something else to give
A different set of quilted lips
That never harms refrains

Trying to waste another day
Trying to waste another day

Winans Phase 2,"There is a joy in the journey,
There's a light we can love on the way.
There is a wonder and wildness to life,
And freedom for those who obey.
All those who seek it shall find it,
A pardon for all who believe.
Hope for the hopeless and sight for the blind
To all who've been born of the Spirit

And who share incarnation with him;
Who belong to eternity, stranded in time,
And weary of struggling with sin.
Forget not the hope
That's before you,
And never stop counting the cost.
Remember the hopelessness when you were lost?",El Shaddai,1999
Winans Phase 2,"Now part of living right
Is being prepared to fight
That means there's gonna be sleepless nights
In this walk with Christ
But Lord you know
Anytime day or night I'll go
Even if my own mother says no

Anywhere you lead I'll follow
If you need somebody Lord, I'll go
If nobody else wants to go
I'm saying Lord, it's alright send me

I'll be glad to go
And let the whole world know
What it takes to be saved for sure
And that they must endure
With my word in hand
I'll spread it through the lands
With the power of prayer I can
Reach the souls of man

Anywhere you lead I'll follow
If you need somebody Lord, I'll go
If nobody else wants to go
I'm saying Lord, it's alright send me

And for the ones that don't believe
That I will be where he leads me
Even if I have to fall down on my kness
It's alright with me, I'll follow thee

Anywhere you lead I'll follow
If you need somebody Lord, I'll go
If nobody else wants to go
I'm saying Lord, it's alright send me",It's Alright (Send Me),1999
Winans Phase 2,"Sometimes I just can't find the words
To tell you the way that I feel
Cause I found a love that's so real
And I've been searching all my life
For someone to show me the way
Then you turned my night into day
I see clearly now, my arms are open wide
And I'm gonna make it through with you here by my side

[Chorus:]
As long as the stars light up the sky
Until the rivers have all run dry
There'll always be love in this heart of mine
Forever true (always for you)
As long as the world keeps turning round
I'll always be thankful for what I've found
I'll never let the sun go down
I'll keep shining through
Always for you
Drifting on a lonely sea
Without a friend in the world
Then you were the voice that I heard
And when your arms reached out for me
You made me feel like I belong
You gave me the strength to go on
You are my hope, my prayer, when things are going rough
You always give me the miracle of love
[Chorus]
Always, always for you with you by my side
Sha la la la here by my side, here by my side
I see clearly now, my arms are open wide
And I'm gonna make it through with you here by my side

Winans Phase 2,"[Chorus]
If you're tired of all the pain
And you're hoping that the seasons change
It's time to rearrange
Come on over to the other side

If you're hurting from a broken heart
And you're searching for another start
It's time to realize
Come on over to the other side

Now the party's come and gone
Been up all night long
Heard the same old songs
Still you feel alone

Is this how life should be?
Shame and misery
What can set you free
And make you happy?

[Chorus]

Crying tears of shame
Looking for new hope
Reaching for those friends
That left you long ago

Scoping out the world
For a better life
But if you look to him
He'll give you some insight

[Chorus]",Come on Over,1999
Winans Phase 2,"No way, no way, no, no, no
I can't wait for another day
For shelter in your arms (I'm sure you know)
All the ways that you comfort me
It really soothes my soul
With everyday away, those memories come rushing back
Making me long to feel your touch (I'm sure you know)
Everything that I'm going through
Because I turned against your love

[Chorus]
Everyday away, the more I think about you
Everyday away, the more I need you near to me
Everyday away, the more I think about you
Everyday away, I realize how dear you are to me

This time that I spend alone
Has opened up my eyes (I'm sure you know)
I thank you, Lord, for showing me
A love that never dies
'Cause you've showed me all the beauty, Jesus
That your love can bring, and this time I surrender to you, my Jesus
No one else, Lord, will ever take your place

[Chorus]",Everyday Away,1999
Winans Phase 2,"I know you heard about the Winans see
We're a Godly dynasty
Serving G O D, next in line is me
Not the X but next generation of several men of God
Taking it to another level

Devil what's up? Is this a joke or what?
Steady hoping you can crack open the Coconut
You can't see us, we're covered by the blood
And we're just chips off the old block
Representing Jesus

Hey, Phase 2 who we gonna give the praise to Jesus
Plus thank Him for the ones who raised you
I'm Marvin Jr. some say the second and I'm respecting
My daddy for the pastor of perfecting

He taught me to be holy and guard against the levin
Can't wait to go to heaven saved since I was seven
Doing what Jesus would do, not what everyone does
I'm sanctified and I'm still have fun

'cause I'm Carvin, son of Carvin
Twin brother of uncle Marvin
I'm saved and tall and dark skin
Taking heed to words from the wise

Chumping humble pies and never compromise
Saying God is tops yo props go to pops thou
He brought me up in church through a legacy of gospel
Surrounded by a course of saints that came before us
Back to grandpa David and Delores

Then they had children keeping the holy cycle
To David, Ronald, then the twins and Michael to Daniel, BeBe
CeCe, Angie and Debbie let me praise God 'cause my whole family
Is set free Hallelujah, I'm buzzin'
Two short of a dozen sibling singing for God

Now it's me and my cousin, what in the world would we end for
Let's make it ten more following examples of our mentor
What's up with you, what, what about you? Who Me?
I thought you knew, Carvin Jr. is a Winans too
What! What about you, the legacy ain't through, say what
'Cause you know that I'm a Winans too

What, what about you? Who me?
I thought you knew, Coconut is a Winans too
What, what about you? The legacy ain't through
'Cause you know I'm a Winans too

Follow you as you follow God you that I'm a Winans
You know that I'm a Winans, so what about you Phase 2
Follow you as you follow God you know that I'm a Winans
You know that I'm a Winans, so what about you Phase 2

Phase 2 coming back at you we young but never last stature
On a fat track I think that ate a fat batch of
Cookies rookies flowing to a beat that ain't starving
I'm Juan second son of Carvin a tight beat to excite peeps

Unlike a sleeping pill young teenage christians we gots to keep it real
I'm not deranged don't think it's strange 'cause we're the
Winans but still it's time to make that change
Flip flop gospel R&B dipped and hip hop us copy-cattin' y'all

Will be a trip pop I learn from them but why would I pretend to
Be any one else when I got my own identity, buch respect to the
Winans and BeBe and CeCe, but we are Phase 2 gots to be me
God called us to reach a whole 'nother day and time
Passing the mic to Mike I'll relay the rhyme

We're grooving so keep it moving, yo we will not cease
Yo, I'm Mike son of Mike last and not least
Heads boopin' fingers poppin' like hot grease
We jammin' and we got Jesus so we got peace

See I believe God's word and I never doubted
Walk it out saints shout and the devil pouted
Hell is crowded full of people that's 'bout it, 'bout it
But I strive to be God's man and proud about it
Hands in the air for Jesus my price payer
I'm not player but I'm a prayer

And ladies I'm just the type of guy to warn my dates
Don't think we're gonna mate, 'cause I don't fornicate
That's how we do Lord always givin' You praise
Straight from the Winans same God new phase

And ever since I was sucking on my baby bottle
You were the model I wanna follow
What's up with you, what, what about you? Who me?
I thought you knew, what Mike Jr. is a Winans too

What, what about you? Who me? I thought you knew
Juanie Juan is a Winans too, what, what about you?
The legacy ain't through, 'cause you know that I'm a Winans too
You know that I'm a Winans, you know that I'm a Winans
You know that I'm a Winans, you know that I'm a Winans
",I'm a Winans Too,1999
Winans Phase 2,"When I think of all the things you've done for me
It brings a smile to my face
And so I close my eyes to suddenly see
Memories of my sweetest days, sweetest days
But I never said thank you; I never really tried
And when I think about it, I just want to cry
There are so many things that I want to say
I would do anything to see you

[Chorus]
Just for a day's hoop
Just for a day's hoop
I know I love you, I tell myself
I just didn't know how to say it
But I wonder if you hear me when I pray at night
Sometimes I forget that you're by my side
Did you know that you were the reason I live my life

Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Winds,"In a fate beyond the mind's eye
I see no reasoned foresight
Whether eyes can envision the trace
The sun will cast light anyway

And when I arose from the heavens
I found this to be true
For who was I to foresee my waning
Time's presence has passed

And in the darkest hour of my existence
Vanity was still my demise

As silence arrives to fill my world
I realize my stillness of mind
While beyond the dreamscapes
Echoes revolve from afar

I can hear their voices, speaking of my angels
Whispering thoughts of a kingdom divine
To me, the fallen?
",Reason's Desire,
Winds,"In an instant our fates were sealed
With no option of repent
In the night, so far away
Out of harms reach, is this where I belong?

Here I stand in the midst of it all
While I look behind
And all I see is that broken tree of old
Alone in the cold

Cast aside by a moment in time
Derived by a quest in wonder
I see shadows against the stars as they draw nearer
The moon like a painting in the water

What do I seach for in the distance?
This memory haunts me still

The memories I once had
Dreamlike shadows
Now washed away by the rivers of time
The darker side of the two

This is the reason why
It is all written in blood



",Bloodstained and Sworn,2002
Winds,"As I opened my eyes, I saw...
Clarity speaking to me through promising thoughts
A white shimmering light
At the base of creation
Yet when the light commenced, I saw nothing...
Nothing but darkness in my eyes
",Clarity,2002
Winds,"As time extends its shadow
I reflect the final view
As the sun sets for the last time
I mirror the dusk of night

Darkness falls into my world
As I breathe in the essence of life
I clench to my spirit in wonder
As I take in this end of mine

From their burst of flames I came to be
And to them I shall now return
Beyond all horizons...

Until the creation mists sparkle once more
And then amidst the glow of radiant stars
I shall arise again



",Continuance,2002
Winds,"Before the silence was broken - I looked through the eyes of time
In the earliest days of memory - back when the days were young
Foresighted by forgotten memories - from a different death
I learned my ways - and still I wander

My reflection becomes pale in the dense light
Over the water of drowning souls
From tears cried by a fallen angel - for a fallen souls
Where the heating hands of garce failed to reach

Searching for the keys to unlock doors
That can solve the hidden mysteries of the soul

As I enter through the portal and await the new days
I look behind for nothing more to see
A veil of stars is waiting - for me to join them
Into an eternity of dreams...



",An Eternity of Dreams,2002
Winds,"Of thoughts to my being I wonder
I contemplate my inner self
My senses' only assailant
In this reality

So I rise above my creation
Into my mind beyond my perspectives
I release myself from my inner chains
To free my soul from damnation

I convey my essence of spirit
As it shines upon me
How beautifully tragic it is
Yet with a glimmer in its eyes",Existence,2002
Winds,"I stand upon the portal
Mirrored in the reflecting water
Watching my own image, as I ask myself
What am I doing here?

I came slowly into the night
From unknown corners of the universe
I tried to find the ways to wander
But my mind is torn between the two

While this river flows down the past
I dream it all away - for you
While my thoughts wander into the coming
Fallen are the stars - for you

As the sun sets into the water
I dream it all away - for you
As the skies darken the world
Fallen are the stars - for you

I drive into oblivions wonderalnds
Of timeless moments in a mind's mystery joy
They came silence - as never heard before
As for the first time I heard the angels cry



",In All Reflections,2002
Winds,"A burst of flames from a radiant glow
Indeed they are the essence of beauty
The source of all creation

In wonder and amazement I stare at them
The shining light from a veil of bright stars

Silently in the night
They whisper to me the words of life
As I become aware of my existence



",Inception Perspective,2002
Winds,"If there is only this one existence
Be this the darkest of my days

If I am meant to indure
Let the world falter
Beyond the confines of man

Too bound to see the light of the world
In this earthly paradise

Where truth shall rise above all
This is where I belong

All that search and question
May they find and know
As opposed to eternal bliss
In the confines above

This one existence, mirrored in time
This one entity of a mind
Upon a world of despair,
Seeking for its place
What is to become of it all?



",Mirrored in Time,2002
Winds,"I am now at the edge of my being
God of my eternity
I am the will of fate
Forever and beyond
What I desired above all

Within is the path to find my way
I search the inner depths of my soul
Yet how I would find my serenity
I never could foresee...

I seek to find the balance

And within my reflection...
The ways of mind

I am at one with existence
Foundation by my hands
I am the will to create
Perfection in my own image



",Of Divine Nature,2002
Winds,"In the time of silence
I saw a trace for my will to be

While in the remnants of my heart
I saw them shine through clouded eyes

In the depths of the night
I reach beyond the brightest stars...

And I touch your wings with my remorse
As I drain my fountain of spring

My deepest reverence
My exposed serenity

From the depths pf my boundless heart
I pledge myself to thee

My days of novelty have decayed
I find myself at the end of infinity
I gaze to see the angels...



",Passion's Quest,2002
Winds,"Truth to existence?
I found in my dreams
Yet I saw, in the fields of souls
Doubt in glints of an eye

Among the many I found the few
And none could foresee the coming of their fate

Bewildered by confusions
Fearing what they never knew
They chose to remain? restrained

Grieved I was to the depths of my soul
For I could not reverse the tide
By tragic mourns for the vile
I cleaned my essence, and thus became divine",Realization,2002
Winds,"Beyond the world I wandered
To find a birth in my death
And at the crown of my journey
I saw dawn far away

Scattered remnants of beauty
Behind ruins of decay
This is the fate of the fallen soul
Destined to walk alone
With none at side and none above

My time has come, yet again
To be the soul survivor
What a lonely existence
In this cosmos of mine

Singing power to the people
But their power's corrupt
Burning crosses and secretly
Carry swastikas and M-16's
Nevermind the pages of history
It just keeps repeating, keeps repeating
It's always the same
Seems like nothing will ever change
We pay to wear the blindfold
But look out 'cause they're movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Yankee Doodle leadin' lambs to slaughter
Just for the thrill
Good things come to those who wait
good advice just a bit too late
Any chance for trust went up in smoke
When a preacher's lust was sponsored by Coke
Day after day
It's always the same
We pay to wear the blindfold
Baby look out 'cause they're movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Disbelievers drink the poisonwater
Time stands still
Don't fill my eyes, fill my head
'Til I'm overloaded
You talk and you talk and you talk
But I don't hear anything
Times are changin'
There ain't no cure
It's a wasteland
One thing's for sure
Ain't no gold to grind the axe
So keep your fingers crossed
While you're crossin' the tracks
'Cause good blind faith ain't good enough
Baby's heat crumbled to dust
Hooray for the Outlaw
Keeps movin'
In for the kill
In for the kill
Yankee Doodle leadin' lambs to slaughter
Just for the thrill
Don't fill my eyes, fill my head
'Til I'm overloaded
You talk and you talk
You know I don't hear it anymore
But you keep on movin'

Eyes burning and my muscles eat glass
Kiss my frag, hope it sets me free
As I pray to the sky

Breakdown the door with a one legged huh!
Graduate, now you've worn your gun in
Now you're one...
Best be prayin' to the sky

You're dancing out your head, a free fall....

You see your angel flying
Your heart is dying
You never saw it coming
Might be right up ahead

Chasing a shadow that's moving through ash
You hold her in your minds as your way to get back home
And she prays to the sky

While the frozen shock lights the back of your face
Only seen the sun for a hundred and two days
Hits you right between the eyes

You're dancing ougt your head, a free fall...

You see your angel flying
Your heart is dying
Will you see it coming?
Might be right up ahead

Now many ways can you hold on
If you know I believe in you?

The ground bleeds fire and your eyes burn green 
But you gotta believe that we're all born free
Not just left to do or die

And when I turned, it was love at first sight
I said please excuse me, I didn't catch your name
Oh it'd be a shame not to see you again

And just when I thought she was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet and brought me to the floor, she said

I'm only seventeen (seventeen) but I'll show you love like you've never seen
She's only seventeen (seventeen) daddy says she's too young, but she's old enough for me

Come to my place, we can talk it over, oh everything going down in your head
She said take it easy, I need some time, time to work it out, to make you mine

And just when I thought she was comin' to my door
She whispered sweet and brought me to the floor, she said

I'm only seventeen (seventeen) you ain't seen love, ain't seen nothing like me
She's only seventeen, seventeen

Such a bad girl, loves to work me overtime
Feels good (ha), dancin' close to the borderline
She's a magic mountain, she's a leather glove
Oh she's my soul, it must be love

When I was heading out on the road

And the Kendal freeway's fast

And they never gonna take her away

Where they play the west coast sound
Sailor Sam he came from Birmingham
But he never will be found
Doing fine when a London sign
Greets me like a long lost friend
Mister Motor won't you check her out
She's got to take me back again

Ain't nobody else gonna know the way she feels

And they never gonna take her away

Got no time for a rum and lime
I want to get my right foot down
Shake some dust off of this old bus
I gotta get her out of town
Spend the day up on the motorway
Where the carburetors blast

Any time you choose;
It's hard to find the people feeling run-down;
There's no time for blues.

If you don't know just what to really do
Just take a walk along the avenue;
You'll hear the sounds come a-floatin' through
Along about midnight.

They close the windows and they dim the light
To hide their doings from a stranger's sight;
Everything is going right,
'Long about midnight.

Pianos tinkle, and the couples sway,
Taking the pleasures they find,
They don't care how they live by day,
Why not leave trouble behind?

They really mean it; it's the real McCoy.

Winifred Atwell,"The man who only lives for making money
Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny
Likewise the man who works for fame

There's no guarantee that time won't erase his name
The fact is, the only work that really brings enjoyment
Is the kind that is for girl and boy meant
Fall in love and you won't regret it
That's the best work of all, if you can get it
Holding hands at midnight

'Neath a starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Strolling with the one girl
Sighing sigh after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try

Waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for anything more?
Loving one who loves you
And then taking that vow
It's nice work if you can get it
And if you get it, won't you tell me how?""

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed

Wink Martindale,"During the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had
Been on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The
Next morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant
Commanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer
The text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took
Them out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread
Them out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, ""Soldier, put away those
Cards."" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and
Brought before the Provost Marshall

The Marshall said, ""Sergeant, why have you brought this man
Here?"" ""For playing cards in church, Sir."" ""And what have you to say for
Yourself, son?"" ""Much, Sir,"" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, ""I
Hope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever
Punished."" The soldier said, ""Sir, I have been on the march for about six
Days. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy
You, Sir, with the purity of my intentions."" And with that, the boy
Started his story:

""You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there
Is but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into
Two parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think
Of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I
Think of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew

Mark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five
Wise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were
Wise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the
Six, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and
Earth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God
Rested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the
Eight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was
Noah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I
Think of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't
Even thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God
Handed down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it
Reminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I
See the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of
Heaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number
Of spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year
There are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the
Number of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of
Months in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter

I say goodbye, farewell, adieu
To each and all I say goodbye
I know it's been fun but we're living a lie.

You said you spoke straight from the heart
But that was the one thing that kept us apart
'Cause when I read between the lines
I saw that the only heart speaking was mine.

To each and everyone of you
I say goodbye, indeed I do
If you should ask me why I go
I wouldn't say 'cause you should know.

Nothing's been lost and nothing's been won
I took from you, you took from me
But I suppose that's how it had to be.

Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true,
Or is he holding you the way I do?
Tho' love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know,
Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

While you're with another man,
If you want me, answer ""yes"" or ""no,""

Winston Groovy,"You might believe, and still you feel the chase has just begun.
That you must reach that horizon before the setting of the sun.

Don't slow down don't touch the ground.
You know what you will find.

Winston Marshall,"I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

Lie la lie",The Boxer [*],2012

But nothing I found

My thoughts are captured by the magical chants
Of the spirits, but I cannot see them with these dead eyes
Lost I am in these dismal streams
Lost I am forever in my life

The snow is falling on the withering leaves, I am left in the cold
The shadows are crying in the moonlight
Is this night the last of my life

Have we arrived from our journey, I must ask you now
At last I can cry, 'cause these sad words are calling me tonight
My eyes bleed for you my star, my pride and the love of my heart
But why did you had to fly so far, I raged and it tore me apart
I promise to you with sadness and hate
Wherever I might go, you will know...

I give my life to the withering leaves
O the bleeding moonlight
To the crying shadows
I GIVE MY LIFE TO YOU",Sadness and Hate,2004

Oh sleeping stars, why are you so sad tonight
Oh sleeping stars, will you shine for me tonight
Oh sleeping stars

Can you see them float in the night sky
Can you hear those echoes of their sweet cries, creating a tune
Can you see them shine so bright
Can you feel their loneliness through their cold light, touching you

My eyes feel so heavy when the stars are calling me
- Join with us eternally -
I'm falling in deep trance and my powers are weakening
I'm falling in a world between dreams and reality

I am now alone in the silent light
And there's nothing but darkness around me
Deeper into unknown the strange light is guiding me
Wake me until it's too late

Suddenly I feel a warmth go through my body
But I feel that a part of me has died, I sense the change in me
I must have been away so long
So please stay with me for a while",Sleeping Stars,2004
Wintersun,"So mysterious is your world,
Concealed beyond the stars
Far away from the earth,
It flows one with time and dark as the night
Million shapes and colors
Are storming inside your mind
Creating endless dimensions
Forming universes without walls

Let go of the stars, the stars that fell into the sea
Let go of your thoughts and dreams,
What can you see now

(You cannot save them anymore)
Wanderer of time
It's too late now
Creator of Dimensions
Destroy the walls of time
Hands of the blind are holding your fate
Tides of life will take you away, will take you away

Starchild!
Visions are born from the unknown force
It dominates the way of time
The dream only ends, when the worlds come to an end,
When the world comes to an end
Starchild!
You cannot escape to the dark streams of the sea,
To suppress your dreams
Nothing can keep you away from the need to create
'Cause your path is free

I've hold the fire within myself
Years I've walked in the coldest winds
Through the deserts of sand and snow
The time is passing and I know
That I'm wasting my life, destroying my dreams
I'm diving into the bottomless sea
From sorrow and pain I find my strength
The more pain I feel, the more I see
Now I'm watching my life flowing in the dark
Like streams of fear running through my heart
And it's wearing me down until I'm gone
Soon I'll join the endless whirls of stars
And I fall deeper into the unknown voids (Something is dying, yet something is born)
And I fall into infinity like a burning star (When will I find my silent dawn)

I fall like a burning star!
I fall like a burning star!
I fall like a burning star!

The curtains of mist are fading
And the veils of star clouds are revealed
Storms of new energy
Flows in the depths of my mind
New constellations are born
In total harmony of perfection
And the dissonant unbalance was broken
As the colors fell straight from the light

I'm floating in the sea of stars,
I'm drifting away from the shore
I will be lost in the dream when the dark days come
But I will make the time run backwards
And I'll make the stars shine again
I will light up the sky to a bright crimson nights
And they'll shine together forever
With brilliant silver colors they'll shine forever

The whirls of stars takes you now far away
Away from the cold nightmare
Let go of your thoughts and dreams
And you will feel the warmth once again
Starchild, in the Sea of Stars you fall
You fall like a burning,
Starchild, in the Sea of Stars you fall
But there is no end to creation",Starchild,2004
Wintersun,"Divine creations now destroyed to uncover the haunted atmosphere
Strange visions of the ancient spirits, travesty of man appears
Coldness and the storming winds lurking for prey
The forces of the Winter reign in dreadful way, there's no escape

I'm following the mistress of night
Through the gates of snow we'll fly
We'll fly

Winter - The realm of eternal ice
Snowfall and darkness descends upon the vales of time
Distant caress of the sun's fading light
The lands were painted white with the Winter's might

My hands are frozen, my mind is at the edge of madness
Oh how many nights and days, I've been lost in this land of sadness

From the primitive thoughts, under the glimmering snow
And burning stones, they'll rise

You can rule in afterlife, just concede your soul to me,
(Your life is cheap) no price """,Winter Madness,2004

 let us swear allegiance to a land that's free.
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair, as we
 raise our voices in a solemn prayer.

Through the night with a light from above.
From the mountians, to the prairies,
To the oceans white with foam.

That sav'd a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears reliev'd
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believ'd!

Thro' many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come;
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promis'd good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures

Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease
I shall possess, within the vail,
A life of joy and peace.

The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who call'd me here below, 
Will be for ever mine.",Amazing Grace,2002

Und Muscheln fallen aus ihrer Hand

Den verrussten Himmel über der Stadt
Der Wind wirft sich wütend gegen die Fenster
Er heult, wie ein hungriges Tier

Reißt Dackel von Leinen

Solange Blut durch meine Adern fließt

Das ist wie ein Mantra gegen den Lauf der Zeit 
Ein Pakt mit der Sonne gegen Dunkelheit
Das ist meine Flagge, die ich einst gehisst
Weil es wenn's noch nicht gut ist
Auch noch nicht zu Ende ist
Das ist mein Versprechen, mein heiliges Land 
Die schwankende Brücke über den Kraterrand 
Meine letzte Instanz, die niemals vergisst 
Dass es wenn's noch nicht gut ist
Auch noch nicht zu Ende ist

Ich glaub nicht an ein Schicksal
Das irgendwann die Kreise für uns schließt 
Nein, hohe Wellen tragen stets
Den Namen des Sturmes, der sie wachsen ließ

Ich schrei' es zum Himmel, ich flüster’s in den Wind 
Sag es in endlosen Schleifen vor mich hin
Die letzte Bastion, das Wort aus meinem Mund
Als silberner Streif an meinem Horizont

Ich spür's auf den Lippen
Ich spür es auf der Haut
Ich sage es leise, ich sage es laut
Ich schrei's aus mir raus, ich schrei' es in mich rein 
Was noch nicht gut ist, kann nicht zu Ende sein",Mantra,2015
Wirtz,"Ich bin dir nah und wohl gesonnen 
Du siehst mich klar, ich dich verschwommen 
Bin dir wahrhaftig, ich bin dir Freund 
Sie dir zur Seite, seit Ewigkeit
Doch du bist nicht mehr zu fassen

Du fährst im dunkeln ohne Licht
Ich kann dich sehen, sie sehen dich nicht
Du fährst im dunkeln ohne Licht
Und nur ne Frage der Zeit, bis es dich erwischt

Ich muss gestehen, ich mach mir Sorgen
Du lebst als gäb’s kein Gestern, als gäb’s kein Morgen
Du hinterlässt verbrannte Erde
Du ziehst die Lines, anstatt der Lehre 
Du hängst am Gas, du kannst’s nicht lassen
Und du bist nicht mehr zu fassen

Verachtest den Wind, der dich trägt
Vergiftest das Land, auf dem du stehst
Schlägst Türen zu, reißt Brücken ein
Viel Spaß dabei, viel Spaß allein",Regentropfen,2015
Wirtz,"Hab das Gefühl das irgendwo 
In mir ne lücke klafft 
Als hätte etwas das zu mir gehört 
Es nicht bis zu mir geschafft 
Wie ne wohl bekannte Melodie 
Aus 'nem Lied das ich nich' kenn
Tief begrabene Erinnerung 
Die auf meiner seele brennen 

Bitter süßer klang 
Schwimm den Tag entlang 
Sehnsucht greif den Augenblick 
Reis mich fort 
Lässt mich zurück 
Tag in fernem Glanz 
Sehnsucht geht nie ganz

Stromaufwärts treibt es das schwere Herz hin 
zur quelle die es seit Ewigkeit sucht
Es kommt mir vor als ob von irgendwo her 
jemand meinen namen ruft

Wohl vertrauter klang 
Schwimmt den tag entlang 
Sehnsucht greif den Augenblick 
Reis mich fort 
Lässt mich zurück
Tag in fernem glanz 
Sehnsucht geht nie ganz

Gedanken fliegen 
Hoch und höher 
Auf und davon 
Wie die vogel gen süden
? lauscht ihren klang

Sehnsucht greif den augenblick
Reiss mich fort 
Lässt mich zurück
Tag in fernem glanz
Sehnsucht geht nie ganz",Sehnsucht,2015
Wirtz,"Es hat alles seine Stunde 
Und ein jedes seine Zeit 
Denn wir gehören dem Jetzt 
Und nicht der Ewigkeit

Wir beschreiben leere Blätter
Wir schlagen’s nicht in Stein
Wir müssen nur wir selbst
Und nicht wie Götter sein

Es war der Glanz in deinen Augen
Die Glut in deinem Blick
Der Moment, wo ich erkannte
Von hier ab kein Zurück

Der Abschied wohnte uns inne
Wie gegeben, so genommen
Die Geschichten unserer Tränen
Erzählen davon

Viel Glück auf deiner Reise
Vermiss dich jetzt schon jeden Tag
Viel Glück, zieh deine Kreise
Mit festem Flügelschlag

Geschichten sind da zu Ende 
Wo Erinnerung beginnt
Und aus vielen losen Fäden
Das große Ganze spinnt
Es ist gekommen, wie es musste
Und es kam nicht von ungefähr
Die Wahrheit ist all das, was vor dir liegt
Ist bei mir ´ne Weile her

Fliege hoch, fliege schnell, fliege weit
Lebe jetzt, lebe stolz, allezeit
Gebe vor, gebe nach, glaub an dich
Blick voraus, blick zurück, ich denk an dich",Viel Glück,2015
Wirtz,"Dein Blick genug 
Seitdem wie im Flug 
Der Rest verschwindet
Hast mich angezündet

Das Eis getaut
Der Tieger miaut
Er streckt seine Glieder
Ich erkenne mich kaum noch wieder

Für dich geh ich
Aus der Matrix ans Licht
Ich tanz deinen Namen
Vergess die anderen Damen

Wenn du willst
Fang ich ab morgen mit Yoga an
Verkauf das Auto, fahr Straßenbahn
Nein, im Ernst, wenn du willst
Sing ich am Sonntag im Kirchenchor
Und freu mich Über ein Bayern-Tor

Verbrenn mein Geld
Wer Supersuperheld
Ich zieh in ne Höhle
Verkauf dem Teufel meine Seele

Ich steh morgens auf
Geh mit dem Hund ums Haus
Werd Fan von Justin Bieber
Verhau die Klitschko-Brüder

Wenn du willst
Hör ich ab jetzt nur noch Volksmusik
Und schiebe Wale ins Meer zurück
Nein, im Ernst, wenn du willst
Steh ich mit ? Am Straßenrand
Und zieh ein Hemd voller Kotze an

Für dich würde ich alles machen
Stehlen, lügen, Autos knacken
Schwimm durch Meere, steig auf Berge
Hol den Himmel auf die Erde

Wenn du willst
Ziehen wir bei deiner Mutter ein
Werde ich Mitglied im Golfverein
Nein, im Ernst, wenn du willst
Geh ich zum Fußball in Birkenstock
Zünde Bengalos im Gästeblock
Ganz im Ernst, wenn du willst
Kaufen wir einen Gartenzwerg
Und jeden Tag gibt's ein Feuerwerk",Wenn du willst,2015
Wirtz,"Wir zählen Lichter 
Schauen in Gesichter 
Wir werfen Blicke 
Aus leeren Augen weit
In glitzernde Dunkelheit

Wir taumeln durch die Stadt
Rastlos, wie jede Nacht
Jagen die Illusion, dass irgendwas irgendwann
Etwas verändern kann

Wir rauchen Zigaretten
In dunklen Ecken
Wir leben uns ganz nebenbei

Wir bleiben hier
Wir treiben auf dem Lichtermeer
Wir bleiben hier
Die Wogen toben hin und her
Wir bleiben hier
Und ja, wir waren schon immer da
Wir bleiben hier
Vor aller Augen unsichtbar

Wir wanken Geistern gleich
Durch unser Schattenreich
Wir können nicht bestehen im hellen Licht
Doch in Dunkelheit erstrahlen wir schön

Wir rauchen Zigaretten
In dunklen Ecken 
Wir leben uns ganz nebenbei",Wir,2015
Wirtz,"Hör mir zu
Was mir in diesem Leben fehlt bist du
Was ist nur geschehen bei ihr
Ich denk an dich, was immer ich auch tu
Was ist nur, was ist nur mit mir

Du hast mein Herz gebrochen, als du bei ihr warst
Aus Tagen wurden Wochen oder auch ein Jahr
Oh Baby, ich kann nicht glauben, dass du mich verlässt
Ich seh in deinen Augen sie nimmt dich mir weg

Und ich seh'
Dass du schon entschieden hast du gehst
Aber weißt du denn nicht mehr, wo ich bin
Und ich seh
Dass für mich dein Herz jetzt nicht mehr schlägt
Wo willst du, wo willst du nur hin

Du hast mein Herz gebrochen, als du bei ihr warst
Aus Tagen wurden Wochen oder auch ein Jahr
Oh Baby, ich kann nicht glauben, dass du mich verlässt
Ich seh' in deinen Augen sie nimmt dich mir weg

Oh Baby, ich kann nicht glauben, dass du mich verlässt
Ich seh' in deinen Augen sie nimmt dich mir weg",Du hast mein Herz gebrochen,2015
Wirtz,"Sie sitzt auf ihrem alten Sofa
Aus der Wirtschaftswunder–Zeit
Zwei Glückwunschkarten auf dem Tisch
Denn es ist längst vorbei
Alles Gute zum einundsechzigsten
Liebe Omi tschüs bis bald
Die Kinder sind jetzt groß und außer Haus
Die Wohnung ist oft kalt

Irgendwas hat sie immer zu tun
Sie teilt sich die Hausarbeit ein
Und jeden Abend schaltet sie ab
Und das Fernsehen ein
Das war nicht immer so
Erst seit sie allein ist
Seit ihr Mann starb
Den sie mit feuchten Augen vermißt

Sie hat so gern getanzt mit ihm
Und manchmal wenn´s zu sehr weh tut
Legt sie ihre alte Lieblingsplatte auf
Und tanzt ganz für sich

Wenn sie diesen Tango hört
Vergißt sie die Zeit
Wie sie jetzt lebt ist weit weit entfernt
Wie ein längst verglühter Stern

Wenn sie diesen Tango hört
Vergißt sie die Zeit
Wie sie jetzt lebt ist weit weit entfernt
Wie ein längst verglühter Stern

Aus der Heimat verjagt und vertrieben
Nach Hitlers großem Krieg
Auch sie hat kräftig mitbezahlt
Für den deutschen Traum vom Sieg
Dann der lange harte Wiederaufbau
Für ein kleines Stückchen Glück
Das lang ersehnte Eigenheim
Kinder für die Republik

Die sollten´s später besser haben
Darum packte sie fleißig mit an
So blieb ihr oft zu wenig Zeit
Für sich und ihren Mann
Ein ganzes Leben lang zusammen
Gelitten geschuftet gespart
Jetzt wäre´ doch endlich etwas Zeit für mehr
Jetzt ist er nicht mehr da

Sie hat so gern getanzt mit ihm
Und manchmal wenn´s zu sehr weh tut
Legt sie ihre alte Lieblingsplatte auf
Und tanzt ganz für sich

Wenn sie diesen Tango hört
Vergißt sie die Zeit
Wie sie jetzt lebt ist weit weit entfernt
Wie ein längst verglühter Stern

Wenn sie diesen Tango hört
Vergißt sie die Zeit
Wie sie jetzt lebt ist weit weit entfernt
Wie ein längst verglühter Stern",Wenn sie diesen Tango hört,2015
Wirtz,"Keine Pause, was auch immer geschieht
Wir hinterlassen kleine Zeichen, auch wenn keiner sie sieht
Fliehkraft stärker als die Gravitation
Keine Antwort, keine Absolution

Neue Erde auf verseuchtes Gebiet
Kleine Schritte, großer Unterschied

Selbst wenn all unsere Träume auf dem Weg verbrennen

Selbst wären wir nur auf der Welt um dagegen zu rennen

Der alles hinterfragt
Das Drehbuch klar
Egal was ich jetzt sag 
Was willst du von mir hören? 
Was soll ich dir noch schwören?
Kein Wort der Welt spricht lauter als die Tat

Es mag wahr sein
Dass ich von mir nicht alles zeig'
Es ist nicht wahr
Dass ich nichts sage wenn ich schweig'
Es wäre leichter
Den Flammen aus dem Weg zu gehen
Doch ich bleibe hier, bleib' neben dir im Feuer stehen

Alles was mal war
Ist plötzlich nicht mehr da
Und du stehst hier als wär's dir scheißegal
Du willst es lieber leicht
Dann schmeiß' doch hin den Scheiß
Und red' dir ein es hätte nicht gereicht

Doch dir muss klar sein
Dass auch ich mein bestes geb'
Ja, es mag wahr sein
Dass mein Herz sich gern verschließt

Dass du für mich die eine bist
Ja, es wäre leichter

Doch ich bleibe hier, bleib hier, mit dir im Regen stehen",Ich bleibe hier,2017
Wirtz,"Ich weiß ich hab dir endlos viel zugemutet
Dein Herz und dein Geist völlig ausgeblutet
Es kommt aus dem nichts um mich zu verbrennen
Es wütet wie Feuer, frisst mich auf von innen
Es ist größer als ich und wenn es mich dann verschlingt
Kommt der Hass auf mich selbst, der dann alles bestimmt
Ich hab das Gefühl, ich müsse alles zerschlagen
Und versink' in dem Loch, das ich mir selbst gegraben

Gib mich bitte nicht auf
Ich droh abzusaufen
Bitte hör noch nicht auf an mich zu glauben
Tausend Gründe dafür mich jetzt aufzugeben
Bitte finde den einen Grund dagegen

Ich reiße die Brücken ab, die man mir gebaut
Ich enttäusche die Menschen, die an mich geglaubt
Bringe alle dazu mich endlich fallen zu lassen
Damit ich gute Gründe hab alle zu hassen
Ich kämpf jeden Tag und es wird langsam besser
Mein Kopf gleicht 'nem Zylinder mit 'nem Kolbenfresser
Ich hoff' ich werd das alles auf die Reihe kriegen
Ich hoff' ich werd das auf die Reihe kriegen

Gib mich bitte nicht auf
Ich droh' abzusaufen
Bitte hör' noch nicht auf an mich zu glauben
Tausend Gründe dafür mich jetzt aufzugeben
Bitte finde den einen Grund dagegen

Y ustedes meten mano, es verdad, pero en los zipper
Y no me importa si tienen combo, si tienen torta
Yo mis enemies les tiro con trafico y con mi escolta
Mírenme, como un humilde se revela
El general de la vieja y de la nueva escuela
Hey, chamaco, no te envuelvas
Soy el único veterano que tiene la sangre nueva
Un gigante aquí, tanto así
Que solo le dan portada cuando hablan de mí
Me ven en bet, trl por mtv, ¡please! 
Pa' acá tu no podrás subir
¿Quieres llegar a mi nivel? Les daré dos soluciones:
Cante más y no hable tanta mierda en tus canciones
Sigo subiendo everyday

Fuera dr. J, jordan y lebron james

Abran pasa al ministro, yo suministro
Yo controlo las calles y los gistros
El profesor moreno controlando la carretera
Postea'o en la escalera
Con la burra te tabaco y madera
El enviado con moño y que anda aborrecido
El que se me pegue de aquí se va partido
Entren y sáquenmelo del caserío
Que ando con la trulla y con la espalda frio
Que no te pille en un carrito de piraguas
Abanza como, titichaguas por el área de caguas
Va haber lluvia de balas, cómprate un paraguas
Bobo, yo soy el capo, tu solo gritas ""agua! ""

Usted es una rata, siga cantando pa' las gatas
Que en esto de la calle, papi, puedes ser mi chata
Trata, pa meterme por la culata
Coge por la orilla o te vo'a sacar la guata (ajaja)
Quieres sentir la ronca, siga tirando balas locas
Soca', 'tas guerreando con el motha*fucka'
Te tengo en coca, salte del carril que va la truck'a
Mamabicho, yo a usted no le quepo por la boca

Te voy a dar con mis becerros
Yo los mato como el cerro
Mama*hierro, hagan planes pa' su entierro
Mucho guille pa' después llamar los perros
Yo no le temo a la muerte, a la vida nunca me aferro
Yo soy de calle cria'o, mucha vidas eh privau
Ando con una estrella en el pecho y la morena al la'o
Usted es un bobo cria'o, no sea tan caripela'o
Si no quiere que le vuele el pecho camine con cuida'o

Déjense ver que quiero saber quien va tumbarme el vuelo
Cada vez que salgo a to' estos viejos se les paran los pelos
Hipócritas, no me saluden, y rompan el hielo
Háblame claro y pal suelo, llego antes ok
El de la morena y me guille el que los trilla
En bolsa negra y camilla me fui a las millas
Como los cepilla, les da fuego y los levanta del piso
Y siempre fiel los pilla

(¡Ustedes son hijos míos!)
Raperos, calmen su brutality
Ustedes to's me pagan royalties
Tanto leido no me hablen de loyalty
Yo se que to's envidian mi flow y mi versatility
Y no pueden con mi productivity
Ustedes conmigo no tienen ni una opportunity
Pues, compárense con mis capacity
Sigan mascando lo que luny hace, el beat
Y don te batea un hit

Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil
Solo hay un intento, enemy
Vengan donde mi si me quieren ver morir
Verme en un ataúd no va a ser fácil

Ustedes suenan bien pero a veces azaroso
Ninguno queda cabrón, como siempre, maravilloso
Llegó la habilidad de cantar y rapear
Versatilidad y estilo difícil de copiar
La maravilla, el bajo mundo me aclama
Y entiendo que 'toy prepara'o para el dinero y la fama
Me critican porque el mejor de los novatos me creo
No es que me creo, es que ninguno igual a mi palabreo
Yo me destaco por ser entre ellos el primero

Yo soy aquel que te mata

Tell you what
Let's fuck with this course first
Just put it down (breathing in)
F-L-E-S-H
Running this whole motherfucking

Chorus (2x)

Flesh hitting them with the scriptures
Finna get what you prepared to the wise
My enterprise
Mo thug millennium Mardi
Be the one to test my size
Flesh hitting them with the scriptures
Finna get what you prepared to the wise
My enterprise
Mo thug millennium Mardi
Be the one to test don't try

Verse 1

And when it began it was the world
And we got heard again and again
And all that the world was kept with God
In ? in it was God himself the boyfriend
And everything that was made
Was made by him
Without him nothing would be in existence
Hit them up psycho
For the life what's life
For me it's this rapping and this ? this shine
Figure it out and again
The Lord oh yes
The Lord has spoken a world
And the word was me flesh
Now every last word that is spoken from the God comes
alive
And giving it you will need it
Exercise good teaching prophesy
In the last days
Open your mind and focus your eyes
And pay attention
Listen off course to what they be kicking up words
So fix them in your eardrum
You want some now come get some
Many mo faking no less
Send and a merchant
You probably see the gift and pick it up hutch
Protest this plain it simple
Get it then let it
Mo got the blessing
Cause then he is resting
Don't let these demons mess and distract him
If you let them
Suggest you pick up the bible
Then you say hellow
Then they protect you, Holy Ghost
Here be the original cost of cig
And them all keep smoking

Chorus (2x)

Jesus wept, get to you
Nobody sought to work in his footsteps in the beginning
When he was placed on the face of the earth
Onto the cross, onto resurrection
Lots found the Lords direction
If you want to leave it there
Only Jesus Christ be willing to find
Then follow the rapper the Lord got here
Who ever think now but the change
They got chains bound to their souls
Oh no, here come on again
5th dog holler and hail they go
Letting and foe
Flesh harass those so cold
When I put it down rapping
You want to diss this out it
Never then put my pistol in your mouth
What's happening monster?
Break off the enemy taking more conches
Leave it alone to sieve in the world
I'm taking no nonsense
His coming since defeat them and you stay
And safe up with your own last
Put your ass
Keep sending and ever repent
Take a look at your past
You nothing like in the first lane
You seemingly suddenly like in sane
Gotta maintain
My nigga get down for your thing
And make a change
Pin pass get them up quick
Because it will be
Hear the  destruction coming I say
Hear the destruction coming
You better hurry and do something (hey)

And I'm that nigga Mr. Sawed Off Leathaface
And I dedicate this shit to all them motherfuckas who used to be down

You know them niggaz that always talk the real shit
But they can never walk the real shit
Listen up this ones for you, for you

I'ma stick you like I took ya picture, Kodak smile
You know that number to dial when in need of work, I proceeds to lurk
Squattin and schemin plottin on demon
And It's a whole lot of semen in this dick
Packin bisquit, once the bisquits is baked
It boils down to the risk us niggaz take
Try Asu and leave ya loable to get floored
And if you ain't fully insured you ain't just asleep, nigga snore
I got somethin it (all things)
You got some Henny nigga pour it (we can all drank)
I done lost somethin I ain't tryin to find and I know it's love
Even though I'm dying inside, nigga is still a thug
The company I keep be wantin me to heat fuck boom
I don't really want to scorn, how I'm supposed to warn?
My folk once provoked, It's on and not gradually
Casualties is random, and like I tell 'em I dump naturally

[Verse 2: K -Mont]
Ay, yo, ay yo whatever you, saw I seen it
Whatever I say, I mean it
Most of y'all bitch niggaz wasn't thugs until Bone screamed it
Recognize the wisdom fuck that nigga shootin clips
Matter of fact I'm tired of talkin, pull you pistol keep walkin
Catch me on the puly wearin a hoody
Or standin on nigga lines, stressin, conversation about dyin it's Thugline
That niggaz be askin who is he?

Takin over the yard, nigga Thugline's in charge
On guard a new clique, and we got new shit
These niggaz ain't nobody you want to fool with either, so be cool with it
Then niggaz won't have any problems
357 revolver is all it takes to squash an solve 'em
We all in this business to get paid
But meanwhile, we gotta go fight off the enemies that hate us for these styles
Made us some cheese, now fuck the world

The corner dweller on the lane
Sorrow was her only feeling
For she could have no living shame

Where can you go and what can you do
When you don't know what you're lookin' for?

You made the sun start to shine,
You said,""baby, come in out of the rain"".

And the feeling tells you, out of sympathy,
To open up your wings, turn your head to the sky,
Take off like a bird, let your heart be free.

I found deep feeling devotion
The day that I found your love.

I can see above the diamond-studded sky,
Hear the sound of night life passing by,
Scent the early morning with every breath of air,
Taste the secret potion that we both share.

I found deep feeling devotion
The day I found your love.

Black magical lady luck,
Who will show me the way.

When you have your freedom
Without worldly care,
Around human share.
Along the way there's evil waitin' for you,
And evil's not judge and jury, but yourself.

And you have cast your dice,
Take your chances as they come, one by one,
The hand of fate is as cold as ice.

How does it feel to be on top of the world?
Looking around, you see the ground below.
How does it feel to be on top of the world?
Living a life that only you can know.

Say goodbye to the old days,
They're over and gone.
Facing up to the realization
That we've got to move on.
This love and attraction
Has taken it's toll.
Your lies and illusions
Left me out in the cold.

Love lost, you pay the cost of a lonely way -
This time you chose to go too far.

How does it feel...

Wishbone Ash,"I'm leaving to search for something new,
Leaving everything I ever knew.
A hundred years in the sunshine
Hasn't taught me all there is to know.

In the valley, we will gather there,
Helpless in our surrender.
Tomorrow the plow becomes the sword 
Make us stronger in our danger.

Time will pass away,
Time will guard our secret.
I'll return again
To fight another day.

Wishbone Ash,"[Chorus]
The struggle lives hard times, we do or die
My whole crews fly hands high to the sky
So maintain son elevate try to build
But now you're still 'cause incarceration is for real
Yeah son you know its on
Now who would be the clown in the nine-six to mess around and catch a
Fist
I show no mercy if you irk me
I got physical that alert me when some herb tried to jerk me
Or put the squeeze on it, break down the cipher
But it won't work, were tight like the Q-Tip in the fight
Now is you insane is your brain intact
We be official when it comes to this no B.S. rap
Here comes the lyrical, aerial raid right where you rest at
Now test that
I snatch your heart right through your chest black
Gettin ill thoughts when I sleep at night
I gotta maintain, blot the blood stains on my brain
>From the clappin, we can make it happen
Remember you ain't a killer, you only rappin
I hate it, rappers overexaggeratin
And never shot a gun in they life, they only masterbatin
So come clean and keep it real if you like my sound
And wave your hands in the air and put the nines down
[Chorus: 2X]
Brothas fought daily in the streets, we reek havoc
On every block someones flippin like an acrobat
I'm kinda young but I still gotta hold my own
And Ima maintain what's mine till the day I'm grown
 
I keep my crew up, people say I got a gang
But I don't smoke I don't shoot and my crew don't slang
We just hang tryin to get up in this rap game
So I can gain so fame and build my crews name
Rollin with juvenile thugs wit bad grades and bad ways
Who woulda thought that I had some AIDS
Dream totes and aspirations
Brothas are tired of being broke so maybe that's why they free-basing
Wastin time doing nothing
Livin like an outcast gotta get up get out and get something
[Chorus: 2X]
Look into my eyes see if you can see what I can see
In my reality the whole world is after me
Schemin on the key but yo I got this locked down
Me and lost and found comin out the underground
Takin no prisoners my listeners we keep it real
My thoughts are militant, when I'm in the killin field
Click click, my minds automatic, so where's the static
I got some joints up in my attic if you want to grab it
I form a cipher where my peace brothers don't sleep
You try to creep I guarantee that's when you feel the heat
I come correct in this rap game
Rappers act insane
Meanwhile I'm blowin the mic an back in the frame
They can't see me, they can't feel the real G
I represent, commercial rap will never kill me

Casts the die of destiny
It's a perfect life she gives to you
Not to lose so innocently
Leading the way, she rises above
Unexpected adversity
I hear her calling, keeper of the light
The words of warning, thunder in the night
I hear her calling, guarding what is right
I see her waiting, keeper of the light

A silhouette on the skyline, a symbol of your liberty
Protecting time that's passing by
Mother knows, never lies
A better life the children will see
A world of change, full of hope and sympathy

Never wanted this illusion
In our lives.

Familiar conversations,
In our lives, in our lives.
Competing against everyone,
A trap, that, and a snare.
Return to nature, no solution, so beware!

How can it be this way?
Shouldn't be so.
Surviving day after day,
Unwilling to let go.

Why don't we, why don't we,
Share this time?
Why don't we, why don't we,

Aware of the unexpected
In our lives.
Transforming greed and pillage,
Not to be rejected -

When the fountain of youth was sprung,
Lost and gone, everyone.

In the man is the child alive,
To know and feel how to survive,
But the world was as cold as ice
When they looked for paradise.

Love in hand, the first to fight,
The golden dawn was a nasty sight.
The world turns as cold as ice,
Lost cause in paradise.

He must go without a single word.

Wishire,"I woke up this morning to face another day
The sun wasn't shining in this world that I had made
I looked to the mirror to see what I'd become
And somehow I knew that part of me was gone

I looked and looked and couldn't find
Something to fill this heart of mine
And all that I could do
Is think of You

The further I get from me
Closer to You, I believe
I want to be closer still
Where You are, what You will

I'm tired of chasing temporary things
The short-lived satisfaction my foolishness can bring
I feel it's coming down to this, I think it's time to take a risk
I know just what to do, I'll make my way to You

The further I get from me
Closer to You, I believe
I want to be closer still
Where You are, what You will

The further I get from me
Closer to You, I believe
I want to be closer still
Where You are, what You will

Wisin,"Si tú te vas 
Se muere el amor 
El que tú me das 
Y llega el dolor 
Seré un vagabundo 
Solo en este mundo sin rumbo 

Me delata la mirada 
Hacerme el tonto ¿para qué? 
Si a mí no me importa nada 
Prefiero vivir y perder 
Que no haber vivido nada 
Si te vas 
Quedare en un dolor 
Que jamás conocí 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(No sé cómo explicarte) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(En mi mundo y que cada segundo) 
Me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé 

(Señorita el doblete) 

Suave, suave 
Como usted sabe 
Sacúdelo, muévelo 
Que nunca se acabe 
Duro, la reina de la clave 
Te lo juro, que lo que siento en el pecho no me cabe 
Te imagino diciendo que me ilumino 
Si no te tuviera, te digo que me arruino 
Culpa del destino que te puso en mi camino 
Que nadie se meta con este amor clandestino 

Andas en mi cabeza 
Bella princesa 
Olvida los problemas y las tristezas 
Me ves y el corazón me lo atraviesas 
Belleza date un trago y ponte traviesa 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(No se cómo explicarte) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Porque tú eres mi mundo y que cada segundo) 
Me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Y así me pasan las horas) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (imaginándote) 
Contigo me case (oye) 
Y por siempre te amé 

Imagínate que tú conoces lo que desconoces 
Yo me convierto en lobo después de las doce 
Si no tuviera a mi loba pa’ que la despose 
Me voy con la manada hasta que me destroce 
Porque en la calle hay mucha compe 
Siempre lo bueno se corrompe 

Pero no quiero otra mujer aprovechándose 
Cuando tú eres la que me encanta chica 
Nunca yo me atreveré a dejarte sola 
Chiqui, chiqui, chiqui, chica nunca sola 
Por ti yo guardé mi pistola 
Las gaticas no me controlan 
Capturando yo lo sé 
Pero me quiere a la vez 
Solo pide que te de 
My love que te, my love que te  

A través de mi carta quiero confesarte 
que han sido enteras las noches sin poder besarte 
notaras que lleva mi perfume y no encuentro estampa
que sigo olvidadizo y que caigo en mi propia trampa 

quizás te pasa igual y sientes que no es normal 
que no duermes en la noche y entiendes que no es real 
con la distancia llama los recuerdos de la cama 
tu eres reina de mi cabeza, yo el rey que tu amas (Don) 

Donde vas, regresa pronto, vuelve a mi
sin ti ya no puedo pensar ya no puedo dormir 
no me acostumbro a vivir lejos de ti 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(D, d, DY, Gaby Music) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas 
(Chino & nacho baby) 
Porque me la paso imaginando que (jumbo)
Contigo me case (el que produce solo) 
Y por siempre te amé (love you girl, girl, girl) 

Andas en mi cabeza nena a todas horas 
(Cada segundo, cada minuto) 
El mundo me da vueltas tú me descontrolas

Tito el bambino (oh)

yo que vine buscándote a ti
tu viniste a lo mismo
porque conmigo te quieres ir
y porque esperar ya vamonos de aquí
que la noche es larga
y lo que yo tengo es pa ti

tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
tu olor me mata cuando tenemos sexo
tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
tu olor me mata

solo tu y yo sabemos que en un cuarto es totalmente distinto
que en los momentos de pasion nos llenamos del instinto
entre tu y yo guardamos un secreto que ante todos es prohibido
pero tu eres mi tentación
y contigo no soy prohibido

tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
tu olor me mata cuando tenemos sexo
tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
tu olor me mata

se que estoy jugando con fuego
pero hay algo adentro que quiero quemar
quiero revolcarme en la almohada
y las sabanas de nuestro amor quiero llenar
quiero llenar la casa de todas mis fantasías
haciéndolo en cualquier lugar
en lo oscuro nos sorprenda el día
y uno de los dos no pueda mas

seras tu, seré yo
te aseguro de mi parte quiero continuar
seras tu, seré yo
te aseguro de mi parte quiero continuar

yo que vine buscándote a ti
tu viniste a lo mismo
porque conmigo te quieres ir
y porque esperar ya va monos de aquí
que la noche es larga
y lo que yo tengo es pa ti

tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
tu olor me mata cuando tenemos sexo
tu olor me mata cuando hacemos el amor
tu olor me mata
