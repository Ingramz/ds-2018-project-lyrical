Steve Fishell,"Don't you know I feel so bad
Feel like a ballgame on a rainy day
Yes I do, yall

Don't you know I feel so bad
Lord like a ballgame on a rainy day

Whoa since I lost my woman
I shake my head and then I walk away
I have to walk away
(Y'all listen to this)

I just wanna tell you people
I wanna tell you just how I feel
I just wanna tell you people out there
I wanna tell you just how I feel, oh, how I feel
Don't you know that I feel so bad
My woman gave me a dirty deal
The child messed up my mind
Oh, yes she did

Listen y'all
I got one more thing I want to talk to you about

Sometimes I want to leave it
Then again I want to stay
Do you hear what I say now?
Sometimes I want to leave it
Then again I want to stay

You see, the thing is
I already got my suitcase packed up
So I guess I have to catch a train and then I'll ride away
Oh yes I will

I said I'm gonna move
I said I'm gonna move on 
Oh, I'm gonna move on
Yeah, I wanna move on

Don't you know I feel so bad
I feel so bad
Whoa",Feel So Bad,2013
Steve Fishell,"That's all it took
The mention of your name
And all my love for you burst into flames
I tried so hard
To let you got but look how
I still tremble at your name

That's all it took
That's all it took

To make me know that I still care
It seems my heart just can't give up
The dreams we used to share
I tell my friends I'm happy
But they read me like a book
And when today I heard them say your name

That's all it took
That's all it took

To make me yearn for your embrace
I guess I might as well admit
No one can take your place
I fell for you completely
Sinker, line and hook

And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took
And when today I heard them say your name
That's all it took",That's All It Took,2013
Steve Fister,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves
Before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town",When Love Comes to Town,

Steve Fontano,"I've been crying
'Cause I'm lonely (for you)
Smiles have all turned to tears
But tears won't wash away the fears
That you're never ever gonna return
To ease the fire that within me burns

It keeps me crying baby for you
Keeps me sighin' baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me
(Come see about me)
See about your baby

I've given up my friends just for you
My friends are gone
And you have too
No peace shall I find
Until you come back
And be mine
No matter what you do or say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Keep on crying baby for you
I'm gonna keep sighin' baby for you
So come on hurry
Come on and see about me
(Come see about me)
See about you baby

Sometime's up
Sometime's down
My life's so uncertain
With you not around
From my arms you maybe out of reach
But my heart says you're here to keep

Keeps me crying baby for you
Keep on, keep on crying baby for you
So won't you hurry
Come on boy, see about me (Come see about me)
See about you baby (Come see about me)
You know I'm so lonely (Come see about me)
I love you only (Come see about me)
See about your baby (Come see about me)

Steve Fontano,"You're the only one that I rely on
A shoulder there for me to cry on
And the hours alone that I'm without you
All I ever do is think about you

No one knows that you so understanding
Even though my love is so demanding
Everytime you look at me 
Then you'll know we'll both agree
That no other love for me

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time

Didn't like you much when I first met you
But somehow I couldn't quite forget you
Said you didn't want a friend or lover
That your life was happy with another

But as time went by my love grew stronger
Knew that I just couldn't wait any longer
For I couldn't let you know
When I have to tell you so
That I love you then you know

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time

Now the tears are gone and I'm not crying
When you say you love me you're not lying

So when people want to stare
I know I don't really care
Just as long as you are there

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time

I couldn't live without your love
Now I know you're really mine
Gotta have you all the time",I Couldn't Live Without Your Love,2001
Steve Fontano,"Just Like That

[Violent J]
Jump out of bed and I head for the grapenuts
Eat em quick or they soggy and that sucks
Trying to find a clean pair of socks and a shirt
Still sporting the same drawers even though they hurt
In the fridge, there's a Faygo, it tastes ill
'cause it's flatter then a bitch on a big wheel
I got a few money back and a little change
So I'm heading to the store when the phone rings
""What up man, check it out, I know this bitch
She's got another friend with her and her dad's rich
If we find us a ride out to Wyandotte
guaranteed, we can fuck em both on the spot""
Oh shit, let me call Bill Bill
I want to let my nuts through the windmill
He ain't home, fuck, I'll call Mike Clark
'cause I know he can get the fuckin Skylark
He said he can, but he's broke and it needs gas
But I want to buy these Faygo, think fast
I know my brother Jump Steady's got a few bones
But that's going through his shit when he ain't home
""Nevermind J, Legs loned me a ten
No need to get punched in your head again
Tell Mike to scoop me up right away
And it's Faygo and neden hoes all day""
Fuck yeah, I throw my Pro Winds on my feet
Lock the house, and wait for em in the street
I wish I had a piece of gum or something fuck
My mouth still kind of tastes grapenuts
Here they come, nope, wasn't them
Seems like the same car's driving by again
It pulls up, ""hey man, you're outta luck""
What, what ya say man

Steve Fontano,"I used to be the apple of your eye
I had you with me every day,
But now whenever you are passing by
You're always looking the other way
It's little things like this
That prompt me to say:

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely presents you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything from
The five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop
And now I'm out on my own.
But after thinking it over and over,
I got what was coming to me
Just like the sting of a bee

Steve Forbert,"Buildings an' people down under the skies, 
I walk down the street lookin' out through my eyes, 
I'm getting so skinny it hurts to sit down, 
I'm deep in the well, I'm in the rat trap town. 

Where it's dirty for dirty, it's an eye for an eye, 
it's a tooth for a tooth an' a sigh for a sigh 
an' ev'rything's edgy like musical chairs 
an' ev'ryone's lookin', but who really cares? 

Well, I'm tryna get up, tryna laugh in my head, 
I'm walkin' on eggs and I'm climbin' on thread. 
There's motors an' traffic an' racket an' horns; 
my weary ol' stairway is wobbly an' worn. 

There a hissin' of heaters an' bangin' ol' pipes, 
screaming of women an' laughin' all night, 
there's babies a-cryin' an' somebody's dog, 
he's barkin' so loudly, there's a man in the hall... 

Hell, it's some kinda lunatic followin' me. 
He's down by the john so I can't take a pee. 
I'm 's'posed t' be happy, I'm here where it's at, 
I'm a face in the crowd, I'm a big city cat.

Hanging out like I used to do, hope to find some old friends I knew
Hear the news in the honky tonk, who got married, yes, and who split up G 
Drinking beer while the jukebox plays, brand new songs for brand new days
Quiet nights and empty streets, sleepy town, humble home
Same old waltz in the wind, by the railroad track
Riding out to a country bridge, moonlight shining across the ridge
Frozen trees neath a billion stars, 7 friends jammed in Robby's car
High as kites and wild and gone, drunk as well and laughing loud
Back at home I say good night (Good night) and I close the door
Sunday morning the church bell rings, the organ plays and the choir
sings. Where am I while the preacher speaks? Dreaming dreams neath
my sheets asleep
Waking up and trying to think, what went down, what'd we do? I rub
my eyes and I shake my head and feel the sun
Plane takes off on the old runway, snow fell light on the ground 
today Lost an hour that I gained before, headed back to my New York
door. fare thee well, adios, adieu and best of luck to all of you I
ain't no saint and I don't pretend to be, but I hope you all found a G

Steve Forbert,"Take your seat in the table
Watch the cabaret fill
Ted came down for the singer
He saw the name on the bill

How the minutes were draggin'
As the audience grew
Ted was growing impatient
As he swallowed his brew

""It's time to welcome the artist""
He heard somebody say
Saw a face in the floodlight
And everything was okay

Singer man, do your work
Sing your song, make it hurt
Sing the tears, sing the pain
Make it all so real

Then the singer was singing
All his serious songs
And his Band wa a-playing
And Ted was hummin' along

Meanwhile back in a corner
There was a table for two
Where sat the singer's cute lover
And she was drinkin' a few

All snuggled up with a stranger
Who had his hand on her thigh
She was receivin' his message
And gazing into his eyes

Singer man, do your work
Sing your song, make it hurt
Sing the tears, sing the pain
Make it all so real

So the sound came a-rollin'
Tumblin' into the night
And all the people were ravin'
Sayin', ""Man, our singer's alright""

""He's such a burnin' performer
What a fabulous show""
Little lover was stirrin'
She was ready to go

An' while the singer was wailing
She got up to depart
The crowd was stompin' and cheering
She was breakin' his heart

Singer man, do your work
Sing your song, make it hurt
Sing the tears, sing the pain
Make it all so real

Ted was feelin' terrific
As the crowd filtered out
Ravin' on 'bout the hero
There were whistles and shouts

There was a guy with his sweetheart
Ted came walkin' on past
He could hear what was spoken
He could hear what she asked

She said, ""Don't you envy the hero?""
An' the fella answered his girl
""Yes, he's the ultimate singer
He's on top of the world""

Sing your song, make it hurt
Sing the tears, sing the pain

He's out somewhere and gamblin' and perhaps he's in a fight
And yes you know about the woman, and you know there's three or four
Perhaps he's out there laughin' now and dancin' 'round the floor
And yes you try to make the best of it, which isn't much I know
You thought you've had your fill of it, you see that it wasn't so, oh
No

Now your babies are sleepin' soundly and you hang your head and think
He damn near broke your nose last night and hardly does he drink
And as the wind blows at the windows and the clouds go by the moon
The walls closin' around you and your sadness still's around
And yet you try to make the best of it, which isn't much I know
You thought you've had your fill of it, but you see that it wasn't so, oh
No, oh no

You know you make your own decisions and you live the life you choose
I watch it from the sidelines and it sure gives me the blues
You know you're sure to find me waiting, should you ever come around
I am the one who loves you while he drives you further down
And yes you try to make the best of it, which isn't much I know
You thought you've had your fill of it, but you see that it wasn't so, oh

Ya howl and ya curse at the gate
Til she tried to give you the key

You got no right to her love
You with your bloody hot brain
Aw, don???t try to suck her back in
No one could make her remain

Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose now let her go
She???ll be leaving ya while the sun goes down
She doesn???t love you anymore

Say goodbye she???s gonna let it all unwind
Say goodbye she???ll la-la-leave it all behind
She???s meant to be gone let her leave without fighting
Rollin away down the line

You???ve shown so much of your hate
She???s seen so much of your greed
She???s taken shit for so long, yes, yes
That you ain???t got nothin she needs

You don???t deserve her no how
Go fading back into fate
Go sit ya down where ya were
Don???t grab and beg it???s too late

Just say goodbye to little Jo
Just turn her loose man, let her go
She???ll be leaving while the sun goes down
She doesn???t love you anymore

Steve Forbert,"Well, the road seems so long before me, I'm feeling confused and
hungry, dark clouds are blocking moonlight -- time is sleepin road 
signs are all against me, daybreak sorta seems to take forever cars
pass and put me down, I'm tired and freezing

*Well I'll find you and I'll hold youin my memory and once again
I'm living in those harmonies, the sweet love that you give sure 
goes a long long way and I, I, won't forget it*

I'm trying to be an honest injun, slow walking down a noisy
sidewalk, cruel words from rowdy cowboys here in boomtown seems
everybody's shooting six-guns I'm sick of trying to please 'em all I
heard tell that it can't be done and I don't deny it
 train coming rolling down the track now, click clack and I can't go

back now, hot kettle on your mama's stove and I've ...heard it 
whistle I don't wanna see no fortune teller, I'd rather do without
prediction I'll see it when it's all around me, hey, what's the
hurry? *","The Sweet Love That You Give (Sure Goes a Long, Long Way)",1979
Steve Forbert,"Wait till the snow falls down on the doorstep
Wait till the branches make cracks on the sky
Wind at your window, screams while you sleepy
You live near your fire as the winter blows by

Wait till the sidewalk shivers the beggars
Robbed in their blankets they try to hang on
Light from the street lane seems to shine better
After the autumn has been here and gone

God help the lost and lonely, God help the poor
Cold days and ice nights only
Hard times for sure, hard times for sure

Wait till the winter makes it all brittle
Colors all fade and the earth seems to die
Black chimneys coughing, landlords are hiding
No one can find them, it's useless to try

Wait till the river freezes up solid
Way up the line and the boats are all stuck
Gray and the gambler tries to make sense, he's
Far from his home and he's down on his luck

God help the lost and lonely, God help the poor
Cold days and ice nights only
Hard times for sure, hard times for sure

Dancers and snow queens, handsome and lovely
Skate on the lake and fall deeply in love
Silver skates gliding, faces all glowing
Smooth and warm fingers and thumbs and their gloves

Cold days and ice nights only
Hard times for sure, hard times for sure",Wait,1979

Steve Forbert,"""Oh the engine's gone dead,"" cried the men who work there
And she passed up the dock on the wide Delaware
Then the ship ran aground and the oil got away
And they penned that report, ""The Big Spill"" on that day
It was hundreds of thousands of gallons galore
Stretching thirty-two miles down the Delaware shore
There were geese in the marshes out looking for food
They got stuck where they stood in the oncoming crude
And it's oil, oil
Ah, drifting to the sea
Oil, oil
Don't buy it at the station, you can have it now for free
Just come on down to the shoreline where the water used to be
In the well-charted waters of the Nantucket shoals
There's a ship run aground full of oil, we were told
In a week's worth of rough winter weather and waves
The boat started cracking and it could not be saved
It was seven-point-six million gallons this time
Consider the danger and think of the crime
As it poured out a slick stretching into the tide
Over hundred-miles and yes, it came deep, it came wide
And it's oil, oil
Oil pouring in the sea
Oil, oil
Oh, don't buy it at the station, you can have it now for free
Just come on down to the shoreline where the water used to be
There's talk of some writing found in the ship's log
Saying one of the helmsmen's unfit for his job
And the ship's gyro compass was six degrees shy
Their charts were outdated but they, they tried to get by
And you know it's oil, oil
Yeah, pouring in the sea
Oil, oil
Don't buy it at the station, you can have it now for free
Just come on down to the shoreline where the water used to be
Yeahhh
Now both of these ships, like a great many more
Got registered in through Liberian doors
Inspections are quick and regulations are few
Just sign on the line and go find you a crew, yes
One of these ships was the Olympic Games
The Argo Merchant was the other one's name
Well it's sad, but it's true, things got worse for the seas
'Cause I ain't even mentioned Amoco Cadiz
Amoco Cadiz, between England and France
The big super tanker out there taking it's chance
With its one-hundred-thousand black tons of the slime
Amoco Cadiz spilled the most of all time
Yes, ya' know it's oil, oil
Man, it's creepin' in the sea
Oil, oil
Oh, don't buy it at the station, you can have it now for free
Just come on down to the shoreline where the water used to be
Now down in the Gulf east of Mexico Way
There's something gone wrong, so the papers all say
A Mexican oil well is leaking it's goo
They say it's the worse that things have ever come to
Yes it's gallons of sludge, sixty-million and more
It's cruising and oozing towards many a shore
Yes, things have got bad but they will probably get worse
If you can't drink the oil, oh, you might, you might die of thirst
Because it's oil, it's oil
And it's creeping in the sea
Oil, oil
Don't buy it at the station, you can have it now for free
Just come on down to the shoreline where the water used to be",The Oil Song,1993

Standing by the old iron gate
List'ning to the sirens in the wind wail by

Rounds the bend at twelve-o-five

Been inside a whale
Been inside a grief just like a jail

And good luck in your Dear John letter
And I thought I'd die
'cause I thought we were carved in stone
And it made me cry as I walked through the clear, cold weather
And then I dried my eyes
And I tried livin' all alone.

Well, the clouds piled high
And the snow didn't make things better.
As the time crawled by
I went down through a dark ordeal.
Then to my surprise there blew
A breeze from the springtime heather
And as it breathed on me,
I could feel how my heart could heal.

Count up the months,
Count up the days you've been gone,

But now you've been gone for too long.

And you just drop by
On a night with a full moon shining
And you just say ""hi""
And you ask if I'm by myself,
Well, you might think I'm still the same fool you left here pining,
Hey, but I'm a brand new guy
And I suggest you go somewhere else.

Hangin' with the chandeliers

Yeah, your bare shoulders shine sweet and soft,
But you might take a chill,
Could I hold you? Could I still?

Could we meet in that joint on the point
And look out for the moon?

Gotta long, old, winding road, boy

And back in Baltimore the morning came
Her face was paradise; you hear her name
Can't break her spell, oh, no, you can't break her spell
She's bound for distant lands, and she won't be back
Her voice was soft and sweet, her skin so black
And fare you well, oh, say well, well, well, and fare you well

Gotta love to live
Gotta lost, old, lonesome road, boy",Planet Earth Song,2001
Steve Forbert,"He's always alone, wrapped up in his plight
With his hands in his pockets he's walkin' in the night
With his dark eyes lookin'; he's a poor boy
His dark eyes lookin'; he's a poor boy

He can't seem to keep any buttons on his clothes
And the shoes on his feet are pinching on his toes
And his hair wants a cuttin'; he's a poor boy
His hair wants a cuttin'; he's a poor boy

[Chorus:]
Hey (now, now) poor boy
What's it all about?
Hey, poor boy
Can you hear me when I shout?

Well, he's workin' everyday, slavin' for his pay
And all the pretty women - they love to swish and sway
And they always overlook him; he's a poor boy
They always overlook him; he's a poor boy

Well, May turns into June, walking through the park
And way off in his world he's a-dreamin' in the dark
With his mind on fire; he's a poor boy
His mind on fire; he's a poor boy

[Chorus]

Well, the streets are alive, every body laughs
People come and go, and they're snappin' photographs
And he's over by the river; he's a poor boy
He's over by the river; he's a poor boy

Well, spring has come and gone now
And how much time you got?
Time's a-flyin' by, yes, and summer's gettin' hot, and he's

You are the one
And I'll be hangin' on to the things we done; meanwhile...

Way on past the midnight hour
There ain't nowhere to walk or run to get away
The world and the work's before me
I'm caught in the plans I made up
I don't know when, but I'll be back to you someday

Baby's wakin' up in the delta sun
She's wakin' up to blues, and she's on the run
That land is old
And it's haunted by a ghost in the chains of gold, blood chains
Babe, I want to cool you down for free
I want to do for you what you done for me

And you've been livin' with a brain full of sunset fire too long

Steve Forbert,"I went down to the corner, just to meet my gal
I found her standing on the sidewalk, talking to my pal
I strolled back to the bar room, to get another drink of gin
The first thing I knew I was reelin', rocking and drunk again

I kept drinking gin and liqour, till way up in the night
When my pal came to the bar room, we had an awful fight
I reached down for my razor, and then we knocked around
But when I pulled my pistol, I quickly smoked him down

The gambling bar room blues

I went down to see my baby, and met her on the way
I told her I'd have to leave her, I told her I could not stay
I started down to the station, and stopped in at the bar
There I met a policeman, riding in a motor car

We both drank lots of liqour, that flat footed cop and I
I thought he would never leave me, Lord, I thought I'd die
My baby came in to join us, and then it began to rain
Then I had to hurry, hurry, to catch that midnight train

I laid my head in the bar room door, I never get drunk anymore
I pawned my watch and my golden chain
I pawned my baby's diamond ring

Course I had it bad, not as bad as this is
It sure was better back then
Yeah It sure was better back then

Working in the rain beneath surplus tarp
Foreman in the wagon twanging a sad Jews harp
Passing out at night still in my mud caked jeans
I was living off of berries and beans
I hated it, you know, now I swear I miss it
Every time I look down on my pale white skin
Course I had it bad, not as bad as this is
It sure was better back then
It sure was better back then

Steve Forbert & the Rough Squirrels,"Well, you said goodbye
And good luck in your Dear John letter
And I thought I'd die
'cause I thought we were carved in stone
And it made me cry as I walked through the clear, cold weather
And then I dried my eyes
And I tried livin' all alone.

Well, the clouds piled high
And the snow didn't make things better.
As the time crawled by
I went down through a dark ordeal.
Then to my surprise there blew
A breeze from the springtime heather
And as it breathed on me,
I could feel how my heart could heal.

Now you come back
Just when ev'rything's better,
Now you come back
Just when ev'rything's great,
Now you come back,
But I've got it together,
Now you come back,
But it's a little too late.

Count up the seasons,
Count up the months,
Count up the days you've been gone,
I was a grievin' fool for you once,
But now you've been gone for too long.

And you just drop by
On a night with a full moon shining
And you just say ""hi""
And you ask if I'm by myself,
Well, you might think I'm still the same fool you left here pining,
Hey, but I'm a brand new guy
And I suggest you go somewhere else.

Now you come back
Just when ev'rything's better,
Now you come back
Just when ev'rything's great,
Now you come back,
But I've got it together,
Now you come back,
But it's little too late.

And they still say love is blind;

Hangin' with the chandeliers
And so refined, -fined, girl.

Yeah, your bare shoulders shine sweet and soft,
But you might take a chill,
Could I hold you? Could I still?

Can I see you? Can I soon?
Could we meet in that joint on the point
And look out for the moon?

Steve Gaubatz,"So often as I wait for sleep I find myself reciting
The words I've said or should have said
Like scenes that need rewriting

The smiles I never answered
Doors perhaps I should have opened
Songs forgotten in the morning

I relived the roles I've played
The tears I may have squandered
The many pipers I have paid along the roads I wandered

Yet all the time I knew it
Love was somewhere out there waiting
Though I may regret a kiss or two

If I had changed a single day
What went amiss or went astray
I may have never found my way to you",On My Way to You,2003

Are we a pair?
Me here at last on the ground,
you in mid-air.
Where are the clowns?

Isn't it bliss?
Don't you approve?
One who keeps tearing around,
one who can't move.
Where are the clowns?
There ought to be clowns.

Just when I'd stopped
opening doors,
finally knowing 
the one that I wanted was yours,
Making my entrance again,
with my usual flair,
Sure of my lines,
no one is there.

Don't you love farce?
My fault, I fear.
I thought that you'd want what I want 
sorry, my dear.
And where are the clowns?
Quick, send in the clowns.
Don't bother, they're here.

Isn't it rich?
Isn't it queer?

in my career?

Steve Gaubatz,"Last night I waved goodbye,
Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

Steve Geofrey,"I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love

Steve Gilmore,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Steve Gilmore,"I'm impressed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With his influential friends

He's got very big connections
And I follow his directions
Bernie knows his way around
And so I always do what Bernie recommends

I am blessed
With my attorney Bernie
I'm impressed
With the way he runs the store

He's got Dodger season boxes
And an office full of foxes
It's amazing all the different things
Your average guy might need a lawyer for

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I'm in touch
With my attorney Bernie
In a clutch
He can speed right to the scene

And if I'm locked up in the jail
With just one phone call for my bail
He said to call his club collect
Or deal directly with his answering machine

And when I dine
With my attorney Bernie
He buys wine
From the rare imported rack

That's 'cause Bernie is a purist
And not your polyester tourist
Bernie waves the glass around awhile
Then takes a sip and always sends it back

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

I admire
My attorney Bernie
I admire
Any guy who knows his stuff

Sure we blew a couple ventures
With a counterfeit debentures
But you win a few, you lose a few
Like Bernie says, ""You keep on hanging tough""

Thanks to you
My attorney Bernie
Thanks to you
I'm considered well to do

Sure I made out like a bandit
Just exactly like you planned it
But like Murray, my accountant
Told me yesterday, I owe it all to you.

Bernie tells me what to do
Bernie lays it on the line
Bernie says, we sue, we sue
Bernie says, we sign, we sign

Rolls past the houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no names
And freight yards full of old black men
And the graveyards of rusted automobiles

Steve Goodman,"The Dutchman is not the kind of man
Who keeps his thumb jammed in the dam
That holds his dreams in
That's a secret that only Margaret knows

When Amsterdam is golden in the summer
Margaret brings him breakfast, she believes him
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow
He's mad as he can be, Margaret only sees that sometimes
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee
Long ago, I used to be a young man
Dear Margaret remembers that for me

The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes
And his cap and coat are patched with the love
Margaret sewed there
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam

He watches the tug-boats down canals
An' calls out to them when he thinks he knows the Captain
Margaret comes to take him home again
Through unforgiving streets that trip him, though she holds his arm
Sometimes he thinks he's alone and he calls her name

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me

The winters whirl the windmills 'round
She winds his muffler tighter, they sit in the kitchen
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew
He sees her for a moment, he calls her name
She makes the bed up singing some old love song

She learned it when the song was very new
He hums a line or two, they hum together in the dark
The Dutchman falls asleep, Margaret blows the candles out

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me

Let us go to the banks of the ocean
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee
Long ago, I used to be a young man
And dear Margaret remembers that for me

The streetlamps are on in Chicago tonight
And lovers are gazing at stars
The stores are all closing
And Daley is dosing and the fatman's counting the cars
And there's more cars than places to put 'em, he said
But I've got room for them all
So round 'em up boys
'cause I want some more toys

Be it Edsel or Chevy there's no car to heavy
And no one can make us shut down

We break into cars when we gotta
With pick axe and hammer and saw
And they said that this garage had no license
But little care I for the law
All my drivers are friendly and courteous
Their good manners ya always will get
'Cause they're all recent graduates of the charm school in Joliet

Be it Edsel or Chevy there's no car to heavy
And no one can make us shut down

And when all the cars are collected
And all of their fenders are ruined
Then I'll tow every boat in Belmont Harbor
To the Lincoln Park Lagoon
And when I've collected the ransom
And sunk all the ones that won't yield
Then I'll tow all the planes that are blocking the runways
At Midway, O'Hare and Meigs Field

I'd like to do this next song especially for you. And for the King.""

Well
I walk up to the mike and and then I shake my hips
I take a deep breath and put a snare on my lips
See me on the street you wouldn't know my name
But imitating Elvis is my claim to fame
So when you put my imitation name in lights
There'll be imitation good rockin' tonight

'Cause I'm an an Elvis imitator and I just can't stop
Imitating Elvis from the bottom to the top
Imitate the way he talked, the way he smiled
I throw away my scarf and make the crowd go wild
This imitation Elvis may not be the King
But baby I'm the next best thing

Singing Viva Las Vegas and the G.I. Blues
Won't you Love Me Tender in my Blue Suede Shoes
Well let me be your teddy bear, if you must
Oh baby Please Surrender, 'cause I need your touch
Well if you feelin' lonely, need a place to dwell
Come on down to imitation heartbreak hotel

We're gonna rock (rock rock rock)
Ooooh we're gonna rock (rock rock rock)
Ooooh we're gonna rock (rock rock rock)
Ooooh we're gonna rock (rock rock rock)

Yeah my gold lamee cape and my sequined suit
Pompadou haircut and my high-heeled boots
Imitating Elvis is the only way
I can make it through my imitation day
I know this rocking music can't be denied
'Cause I was imitating him before he died

Well I'm an an Elvis imitator and I just can't stop
Imitating Elvis from the bottom to the top
I imitate the way he walked, the way he smiled
I throw away my scarf and make the crowd go wild
This imitation Elvis may not be the king

And my whole world lies waiting behind door number three

I plan my apparel, I wore a big barrel
And they rolled me to the very first row
And I held up a sign and it says, ""Kiss me, I'm a beggar
And Monty I sure need the dough""

When he stares into the vacuum of your eyes
And he says, ""Do you wanna make it even""

Steve Goodman,"By the shores of old Lake Michigan
Where the hawk wind blows so cold 
An old Cub fan lay dying
In his midnight hour, the toll

Around his bed, his friends had all gathered
They knew his time was short
On his head, they put this bright blue cap
From his all-time favorite sport 

He told 'em, ""It's late, and it's getting dark in here
And I know it's to time to go
But before I leave the lineup
Boys, there's just one thing that I'd like to know

""Do they still play the blues in Chicago
When baseball season rolls around?
When the snow melts away, do the Cubbies still play
In their ivy-covered burial ground?

""When I was a boy, they were my pride and joy
But now they only bring fatigue
To the home of the brave, the land of the free
And the doormat of the National League""

He told his friends, ""You know, the law of averages says
Anything will happen that can"" that's what it says
""But the last time the Cubs won a National League pennant
Was the year we dropped the bomb on Japan

""The Cubs made me a criminal, sent me down a wayward path
They stole my youth from me, that's the truth
I'd forsake my teachers to go sit in the bleachers
In flagrant truancy

""And then one thing led to another
And soon I discovered alcohol, gambling, dope
Football, hockey, lacrosse, tennis
But what do you expect?

""When you raise up a young boy's hopes
And then just crush 'em like so many paper beer cups
Year after, year after, year
After year, after year, after year, after year, after year
'Till those hopes are just so much popcorn
For the pigeons beneath the 'L' tracks to eat""

He said, ""You know, I'll never see Wrigley Field anymore before my eternal rest
So if you have your pencils and your scorecards ready
Then I'll read you my last request""

He said, ""Give me a doubleheader funeral in Wrigley Field
On some sunny weekend day, no lights
Have the organ play the National Anthem
And then a little 'Na Na Na Na, Hey Hey Hey, Goodbye'

""Make six bullpen pitchers carry my coffin
And six groundskeepers clear my path
Have the umpires bark me out at every base
In all their holy wrath

""It's a beautiful day for a funeral
Hey, Ernie, let's play two
Somebody go get Jack Brick-house to come back
And conduct just one more interview

""Have the Cubbies run right out into the middle of the field
Have Keith Moreland drop a routine fly
Give everybody two bags of peanuts and a frosty malt
And I'll be ready to die

""Build a big fire on home plate out of your Louisville Slugger baseball bats 
And toss my coffin in
Let my ashes blow in a beautiful snow
From the prevailing thirty-mile-an-hour southwest wind

""And when my last remains go flying over the left field wall

I will come to my final resting place
Out on Waveland Avenue""

The dying man's friends told him to cut it out
They said, ""Stop it"" and ""That's an awful shame""
He whispered, ""Don't cry, we'll meet by and by
Near the heavenly hall of fame""

He said, ""I've got seasons tickets to watch the angels now
So it's just what I'm gonna do""
He said, ""But you the living, you're stuck here with the Cubs
So it's me who feels sorry for you""

And he said, ""Oh, play, play that 'Lonesome Losers' tune
That's the one I like the best""
Closed his eyes and slipped away
Well, Scotty, it was the dying Cub fan's last request, so here it is

""Do they still play the blues in Chicago
When baseball season rolls around?
When the snow melts away, do the Cubbies still play
In their ivy-covered burial ground?

When I was a boy, they were my pride and joy
But now they only bring fatigue
To the home of the brave, the land of the free
And the doormat of the National League""",A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request,1994

For they always bring me tears
I can't forgive the way they robbed me of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be boughten
They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this morning
Always look the same to me

To light up this ole town

And Japanese Sedans

Where's the party?
Where's the party?
Where's the party?

Sometimes I wish the radio
Would learn another song
I'd stay at home and watch TV
If there was somethin' on

Ooh, but why should I get all dressed up
When there's no place to go
Everybody looks at me
As if they think I know

Where's the party?

Wait for her to call

Well, a friend of mine named Steve Goodman wrote that song
And he told me it was the perfect country and western song
I wrote him back a letter and I told him it was not the
Perfect country and western song because he hadn't said
Anything at all about momma, or trains, or trucks
Or prison or gettin' drunk. Well, he sat down and
Wrote another verse to this song and he sent it to me and
After reading it I realized that my friend had written the
Perfect country and western song. And I felt obliged to include
It on this album. The last verse goes like this here

It was steak and potatoes and lobster and babe, I sure felt fine
But now all you give me is seaweed and alfalfa sprouts
And sunflower seeds and I got my doubts
Babe, you left me here with the chicken cordon bleus

My stomach's so empty and all I got is food for thought
And I've been sittin' here thinkin'
'Bout the twenty pounds of groceries we bought
We bought ten pounds of brown rice and five more of beans
And five pounds of Granola and you know what that means
I'm just a regular fella with the chicken cordon bleus

Now won't you to play me them fat licks?

I'm starved for affection and babe, I can't take no more
You know this stuff is so weird that the cockroaches moved next door
Babe, can you see that old dog, he's out in the street
He's got a big smile on his face 'cause they let him meat
And babe, I got the lemon and the chicken cordon bleus

Babe, I'm goin down to the bakery and I'm going to find me a jelly roll
And some cannoli, some French pastry
A chocolate éclair don't sound too bad, how about some lasagna?
You know fat is where it's at, my shadow disappears

Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower 'cause Lincoln won the war

Well, he used to sing me ""Blood On The Saddle""
And rock me on his knee

And he'd take me with him too!

Went to school in Bowling Green
Traded in a milking cow

Somewhere along the way your heart will be burning
Drawn into the holy flame of truth

As night falls on their own Emmaus Road
Some push Him away
And never see the mystery unfold

The word that has been spoken
As He breaks the bread of life
Their eyes will open

By fading light, let's kiss goodnight
And then we trace God's daily grace
Thankful we're still holding hands

There's a truth we know
God is holding us in His arms

Thoughts stray far away to all that lies ahead
In frail days when strength fades
Will we still mean all that we said?

We'll walk forever holding hands

Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me,2000
Steve Grossman,"First the tide rushes in, plants a kiss on the shore
Then rolls out to sea and the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side like the oncoming tide 
With one burning thought, will your arms open wide?
At last face to face, and as we kiss through an embrace 
I can tell, I can feel you are love, you are real
Really mine in the rain, in the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb I'm at peace in the web of your arms

But your lips deny they're true,
Will your answer really change things
Making me blue?

The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""

Skimming by as eyes of the past
But the rising tide absorbs them, effortlessly claiming

They told of one who tired of all 
Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""

And soon they dared to laugh

I represent a firm of gentlemen who recently purchased this 
House and all the others in the road
In the interest of humanity we've found a better place for you 
To go, go-woh, go-woh

Oh no, this I can't believe
Oh Mary, they're asking us to leave

Get 'em out by Friday
I've told you before, 's good many gone if we let them stay
And if it isn't easy
You can squeeze a little grease and our troubles will soon run away

After all this time, they ask us to leave
And I told them we could pay double the rent
I don't know why it seemed so funny
Seeing as how they'd take more money
The Winkler called again, he came here this morning
With four hundred pounds and a photograph of the place he has found
A block of flats with central heating 
I think we're going to find it hard 

Now we've got them
I've always said that cash cash cash can do anything well 
Work can be rewarding 
When a flash of intuition is a gift that helps you excel-sell-sell-sell

Here we are in Harlow New Town 
Did you recognize your block across the square, over there 
Sadly since last time we spoke
We've found we've had to raise the rent again
Just a bit

Oh no, this I can't believe 
Oh Mary, and we agreed to leave

This is an announcement from Genetic Control
It is my sad duty to inform you of a four foot restriction on 
Humanoid height 

I hear the directors of Genetic Control have been buying all the 
Properties that have recently been sold, taking risks oh so bold
It's said now that people will be shorter in height
They can fit twice as many in the same building site
They say it's alright
Beginning with the tenants of the town of Harlow
In the interest of humanity, they've been told they must go
Told they must go-go-go-go

I think I've fixed a new deal 
A dozen properties, we'll buy at five and sell at thirty four 
Some are still inhabited

Steve Hackett,"Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes
As the sound of motorcars fades in the night time
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right
And it's hello babe, with your guardian eyes so blue 
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true

Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""

A time of valor, and legends born 
A time when honor meant much more to a man than life 
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong 
Through lance and sword. 

Why, why can we never be sure till we die 
Or have killed for an answer, 
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe 
That no race has been grander

Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore. 

A dusty table 
Musty smells 
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor 
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey 
That scars the panes. 
Gone the carving, 
And those who left their mark, 
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway 
And the weak must die according to nature's law 
As old as they.

Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me.

That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea.

He traveled the wide open road, 
The blinkered arcade, 
In search of another to share in his life. 
Nowhere. 
Everyone looked so strange to him. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 

And wept as they led him away to a cage 
Beast that can talk, read the sign. 
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame 
And questioned his story again. 
But soon they grew bored of their prey 
Beast that can talk? 
More like a freak or publicity stunt.

No. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold

There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination 
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold. 
Let me take you there, show you a living story 
Let me show you others such as me

Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out. 
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw 
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,

Where no reason remains
Dreamers and drifters
Make their entrance onto the stage
Non-stop scenery changes
With promptings in the dark
Trapped in unremitting violence
As trees stripped of their bark
When they're buried in your dream

With rows and rows of chairs
Well it might be war or Christmas
With the tanks and guns and flares
Or a witch that wields her broomstick

When they're buried in your dream
I was trapped on the edge of a waterfall
In an old riverboat

the roundabout still turning,
ahead they see a small girl
on her way home with a pram.

Years seem so few (four instead of two).

Steve Hackett,"Dark and grey, an english film, the wednesday play
We always watch the queen on christmas day
Won't you stay?

Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors you're still dry
The outlook's fine, though wales might have some rain
Saved again

Let's skip the news, boy (I'll make some tea)
The arabs and the jews, boy (too much for me)
They get me confused, boy (puts me off to sleep)
And the thing I hate, oh lord
Is staying up late, to watch some debate, on some nation's fate

Hypnotised by Batman, Tarzan, still surprised
You've won the west in time to be our guest
Name your prize

Drop of wine, a glass of beer, dear what's the time?
The grime on the tyne is mine, all mine, all mine
Five past nine

Blood on the rooftops, Venice in the spring
Streets of San Francisco, a word from Peking
The trouble was started by a young Errol Flynn
Better in my day, oh lord
For when we got bored, we'd have a world war, happy but poor

So let's skip the news, boy (I'll go make that tea)
Blood on the rooftops (too much for me)

Steve Hackett,"Body was found at the vicarage quarter past nine
People die from sudden strokes all the time
Verdict of misadventure mending the roof
The doctors niece, whilst tending the rosehedge
Stung to death by a swarm of bees
""My wife's cooking is out of this world take a bite""

Died from some rare tropical disease in the night
Dab hand at pharmaceuticals, still no one guessed
The village vet was drowned in the pigswill
You wonder whose turn will be next
""In the world of sinners all are condemned
My son this gun's loaded""

Steve Hackett,"Things they taught you at school
Can sometimes disappear
Why do you disbelieve
The things I said were true
Of a land nothing planned
It just happens
Girls and boys who shout come out to play
With a queen cold as ice
You'd best take my advice
To steer clear of her charm
She's easily annoyed
What's that sound, you turn around
It just happens there are bells
And reindeer drawing a sleigh
There troubled with snow covered peaks
Till the end of time
We know you're a daughter of Eve
And a friend of mine - no
Yes I'm certain that you
Will influence the rest
She could turn you to stone
You're suitably impressed
And so easily led
There just happen to be repercussions
Months ahead
Oh there troubled with snow covered peaks
Till the end of time
We know you're a daughter of Eve
And a friend of mine - no",Narnia,2001

And I'm trying too hard
It might be that I need to
Get out in the country

There are many ways of seeking my fortune
I don't really have to lose my mind
On the highway (my) thoughts always racing

Away to the sun

From lying around
There's surely something to it all

Away to the sun

Taking a friend
I know that I can share

The night forms
Look at us like a double decker bus
Climbing to the top of St. Paul's
To watch the storms
Stand clear of the doors there's
Handel in the Strand
You'll find a better class of
Ventriloquist on the radio
Calling you back to a time
That's never been
In the Circus of Becoming
It all starts with a spark

Under a perfect moon
I know you don't get out much
But that's changing soon

At the wedding feast

I'd like to steal your heart
At the country fair
And braid wild flowers
In your hair

Oh when you come away
I'll win back something lost
For your hands to hold
From an unknown wood

And tipped with gold
Yes a magic wand
To set you free
Then I'll place this world

At your feet
Oh when you come away
Set the Captain's Table
At the Four Ways Inn

You can throw all caution
To the wind
I'll make no sudden moves
When I'm next to you

But just be patient
And my love I'll prove
Oh when you come away",Come Away,2003
Steve Hackett,"A poet walks amongst the Gods
But jealous men have pulled me down
Now exiled in a foreign land
I coax my demons into life

While people cross themselves and say
The Devil is an Englishman
Beelzebub in human form
I mingle with the noblemen

Young girls fall pleading at my feet
As I defile them one by one
Devouring half of London Town
The Devil is an Englishman

A nest of tiny scorpions
Are breeding in my cranium
Poet Laureate of hell
The Devil is an Englishman

As leeches suck upon the flesh
For those who trek beyond the grave
This dark demented soul lives on

Steve Hackett,"The river called and cried
Across the twisted steel
Blues on fire island
Had a magic to heal

Souls full of anger
Sadness and despair
A harbour in my heart
Where love was there

Well the Hotel was raised to the ground
But the spirits still visit there
They rebuilt it stone by stone
I sometimes stand and stare

I see a red light like a flame
And a beast that can't be tamed
Anchored to a place
Where love was there

Hell was never hotter
When Butter had his day
Like the loaves and fishes
A miracle at play

A thin crowd became a multitude
Pounding on the door
A sound to wake the dead
Tearing through the floor

Everything's washed away
By the tides of time
But every now and then
It all comes back again

I'm captive in a place
Both a palace and a dive
I've a picture in my mind

Bursting into life
Restless statues

Steve Hackett,"Manderley was a dream of
Full moon and empty sky
Lost lands and sunken cities
Wave of silk from a perfect smile

Though the gates are held fast
Once again you're inside
There the key to the past
Is buried by her side

Rebecca
Shattered Cupid stowed away
You behaved like a parlour maid
Tongue tied newly wed bride

Back in all your yesterdays
Dressed to kill at the ball
Eager to show what you wear
Never to excel

In a house that she still shares
Rebecca
Day by day she's your reality
Day by day a stronger personality

If by fire she could reclaim
The very walls that scream her name
Ashes aglow on the breeze above
Her house of plenty but not of love

Drowning just as in life
The manicured lawns are gone
Fleeting as her kiss
Lonely as her song

Steve Hackett,"As the rainfall
Drums it's own tune
On the roof of the bandstand
Keep off the grass sign

By the lakeside
Where it leaves you Autumn
In the meanwhile
The hours seem to fly

With busy days and nights
Take it in your stride
As worrying is interest paid on trouble
Long before it's due

Silver snowstorm
Music without words
Blowing through the airwaves

Through Mermaid Street
To the World's End
Through the Avenue of the 18th day

By an August moon
Richmond Bridge
And Ebury Street by the sea
Over the Broadway and run

To the end of the Pier
From Kent to Cornwall they're
Submerged by the swelling tide

More like a woman

I watched her through the rain
On a buffalo dawn
Running barefoot through the corn
Her wild rose complexion
With eyes downturned
Became my obsession
I knew I had to return

To a place called freedom
To a place called freedom

High Indian cheekbones
Held by wonder
She moaned like the whining wind
Chased by thunder
Torn between home
And the horizon
A dancing gazelle
In eternity's sunrise

Steve Hackett,"Echoes of the broadway everglades
With her mythical madonnas still walking in their shades
Lenny bruce, declares a truce and plays his other hand
Marshall mcluhan, casual viewin', head buried in the sand
Sirens on the rooftops wailing, but there's no ship sailing
Groucho, with his movies trailing, stands alone with his punchline failing
Klu klux klan serve hot soul food and the band plays 'in the mood'
The cheerleader waves her cyanide wand, there's a smell of
Peach blossom and bitter almonde
Caryl chessman sniffs the air and leads the parade, he know in a scent
You can bottle all you made
There's howard hughes in blue suede shoes, smiling at the majorettes
Smoking winston cigarettes
And as the song and dance begins, the children play at home
With needles, needles and pins",Broadway Melody of 1974,2011
Steve Hackett,"There is lambswool under my naked feet
The wool is soft and warm
Gives off some kind of heat
A salamander scurries into flame to be destroyed
Imaginary creatures are trapped in birth on celluloid
The fleas cling to the golden fleece
Hoping they'll find peace
Each thought and gesture are caught in celluloid
There's no hiding in memory
There's no room to avoid

The crawlers cover the floor in the red ochre corridor
For my second sight of people, they've more lifeblood than before
They're moving in time to a heavy wooden door
Where the needle's eye is winking, closing on the poor
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
""We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out""

There's only one direction in the faces that I see
It's upward to the ceiling, where the chamber's said to be
Like the forest fight for sunlight, that takes root in every tree
They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they're free
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
""We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out""

Mild-mannered supermen are held in kryptonite
And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright
Through the door a harvest feast is lit by candlelight
It's the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight
The carpet crawlers heed their callers:
""We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out
We've got to get in to get out""

The porcelain mannequin with shattered skin fears attack
And the eager pack lift up their pitchers, they carry all they lack
The liquid has congealed, which has seeped out through the crack
And the tickler takes his stickleback
The carpet crawlers heed their callers,
""We've got to get in to get out 
We've got to get in to get out

Steve Hackett,"Play me Old King Cole
That I may join with you
All your hearts now seem so far from me
It hardly seems to matter now

And the nurse will tell you lies 
Of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this half-world
It hardly seems to matter now

Play me my song
Here it comes again
Play me my song
Here it comes again

Just a little bit
Just a little bit more time
Time left to live out my life

Play me my song
Here it comes again
Play me my song

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
So he called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three

On the mantlepiece
And I want, and I feel, and I know, and I touch
The walls

She's a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair and let me get to know your face
She's a lady, she is mine
Oh, brush back your hair and let me get to know your flesh

I've been waiting here for so long 
And all this time that passed me by 
It doesn't seem to matter now

Casting doubt on all I have to say

Why don't you touch me, touch me

Steve Hackett,"Awaken my sanity
Slavery falls to the ground
Chains fall to gravity
Truth can now be found
My freedom yet escapes me as if I am still in chains
The memory of servitude it somehow keeps me sane
Shadows, my enemy
Yet beyond them now I see
Fear lingered in me
Kept me from being free
Pierce the veil of solitude and turn away
I must
Sand in the hour glass my time is up at last
Go forth and be all you can be
So you can see the path ahead
Let our voice guide you on
I feel only pain
But I know that everything shall pass
The end of the path that forever ignites
White light is blinding me
Robbing me of my sight
Somehow it sets me free
Calling me to unite
A spell upon me cast
Bringing the final light of a long awaited dusk
Blessed, you are the one
Who opened his eyes to light
Now go in peace
And step out of this maze
I thought that I'm insane
I always knew there has to be more than this
I am on my way out while you're embracing the dark
When a messiah is born it's like a late blooming of a flower 
Rising in the netherworld, waters of hope, falling on an orphaned land
No longer the slave
Now I roam onto the unknown
But as sure as my heart beats
I'm not afraid of the light",Chains Fall to Gravity,2018

On the phone
long, long distance
always through such strong resistance
First you say you're to busy
I wonder if you even miss me

Never there

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2003

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Steve Harley,"Was in the early evening and the sun was punching into my head
Outside a stockholm cafe at the river's edge we sat and smiled
We said how rich we were and how warm we felt with a cognac heart
Talked over women in a lonely voice and began to jive

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a scene from ""death in the afternoon"" when I almost cried
I realized papa wanted me to live in his bull ring life
It made me hungry for peace and it made me wild and tore my heart
It didn't help to wipe away the fears like he often claimed

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a frenzy from the midnight air when I saw the light
I realized only children can live upon a timeless flight
It made me hungry for youth and it made me sad and made me laugh
To think that as we live and learn we only follow god's path

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time
",All Men Are Hungry,1976
Steve Harley,"I was a drifter in a rock 'n' roll safari
Took a fancy to an ape in malawi
Who kissed my head and my eyes went all starry
And so I ran and was screaming ""where the hell are we ? ""

He begged : ""don't go, don't cry !""

There was a tiger I fought for the glory
The bloody battle was fierce and was gawry
Was like a scene from a kipling story
He sucked my blood like he's eating tandoori

He yelled: ""don't go, don't cry !""

I took a plane and was greeted in england
By many people and my spine started tingling
They stole my time and they all started mingling
I ran so hard that my feet started stinging

They screamed: ""don't go, don't cry !""

Professionals I got fired
Had a good time in a way
Took a different trip a day
Buried the fear that I was
Only here to be borrowed or hired

(shame ! shame !)

Young enough to have some fun
Old enough to hold a gun
I can remember playing games with
Pistols not so long ago
Many times I reminisce
About this solitude and bliss
We enjoyed as children
O did we really have to grow ?

Chorus: oh what a shame, nothing can stay the same
(shame ! shame !)

She came to me soft, asunder
Showed me the distant thunder blue
Told me the clouds could help us all
Told me the prophet says the man is deep in you

Begged her never tell then wept

Only lend you a clue....

Steve Harley,"As the sun was coming up on the danube, the hotel room was alive
It's heart was beating hard as thunder, there were three of us
There for the night
And we were talking about the magnificent river of strauss
We were saying that nothing is sacred, it's everything else
We put a match to a candle and watched it flicker and spark
We just stared at ourselves until we couldn't keep our tired
Eyelids apart
Then someone (I think it was me) said: ""somehow this is rich,
""we're sitting here on thr danube and nobody noticed the
Blue water bitch""

Ohh la la, it's fun to be so kitsch

We went out to the balcony, the danube a glorius flame
We tookpolaroid pictures and swore that we're never again going
To be the same
It was a moment when nothing was stirring save these two and me
And the clouds were beginning to gather and crash overhead from
The glorius sea

We swayed to and fro and talked of michaelangelo
And of how there was too much beauty here to take it in one go
Then from a corner a tap on the door put the room in a flood
There was God in my mind but the problem was water - not blood !

Ohh la la , it's fun to drink of blood

They ran around me, demented, white lightning flashed in their heads
I was getting bewildered, put on my armour, I was scared of
Attack from the reds
And with a pound lodged in mu nose I felt kind of rich and serene
I yelled: "" lenny, come quick, get the other boy, take him out
Of this scene !""

When he disappeared, there was only lenny and me
And we hit on a thousand subjects at once in spite of the dusky
Beat
Then lenny opened his eye for a second and pulled down the blind
Saying: ""go if you must but you know you'll always be easy
To find""

Ohh la la, it's fun to make it blind

We heard phaedre speak of the philistines of paris
But she talked to herself like a parasite so we both struggled
Free
I said: ""zizi jeanmaire wouldn't take this and neither will we
""if they call me napoleon again I'll be forced to let the lion
Free

""I'll tear down all the paper walls they hide behind
""I'll be damned if I'll take much more of this, I'm beginning
To see the signs""
Then I glanced at lenny and saw that my confidante was beginning
To jest
Well, he came out of my subconscious and that's where I put him
Away to rest

Ohh la la, it's so fun to be depressed

I can't get over my beginnings, I can't imagine my end
I want to escape this wilderness I'm living in, I want to be
Somebody's friend
I could do with a little peace, o lord, and my heart cries out
For love
But to realise all of one's fantasies hasgot to be too much

Steve Harley,"Shall I begin from here to tell everything ?
Relinquish honour in order to make it ring ?

We've been playing cat and mouse now for far too long
I can't let it simmer and just go gruelling on
I have to make my move
I've still got so much to prove
You can't imagine the life that I've had

If I could put the words together
If only I could put the words together

Steve Harley,"He can remember hearing words of wonder
""failure is on the inside""
So often does he wonder
How hard it is without a guide

This manipulator of crazes
He can win any race that you name
Like a disease he comes in stages
And affects everybody the same

Chorus: he's just a body, a beat-up body
He gets his kicks on a fatal crash
And he carries a sign that screams
""red is a mean, mean colour !""

He keeps his money under his mattress
And his conscience in his pocket
He heart runs on batteries
He has two eyes to each socket

Now here's a thing, a very silly thing
He say's it's easy easy to make a million
Yeah, here's a thing, avery silly thing
He say's you steal from a broken brazilian

Chorus: he's just a body, a beat-up body
He gets his kicks on a fatal crash
And he carries a sign that screams
""red is a mean, mean colour !""

Life's a game of colours and shades
Llife's an ugly hue
Life's a pageant that we paint.

Can you remember being south of brighton
Head full of floating memories
Swimming to the grey horizon
Trying to escape the enemy

Who can quote from a thousand young poets
And with a flag on his backhe can shine
Who has a dream but can never show it
Who is drunk from the mad man's wine

Chorus: he's just a body, a beat-up body
He gets his kicks on a fatal crash
And he carries a sign that screams
""red is a mean, mean colour !""

I'm sinking fast- I'll soon be down on my knees

I can't hope to be the ""devil-may-care""
Maybe I'll settle with you all in my hair

The girl has found another and gone away.
With her went my future my life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room.
I know to you, it might sound strange but I wish it would rain,

'Cause so badly I wanna go outside
But everyone knows that a man ain't supposed to cry
Listen, I gotta cry 'cause crying eases the pain,
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside.
Words could never explain, I just wish it would rain.

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain,
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain,
Cause rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying,
Crying when I go outside.
To the world outside my tears,
I refuse to explain, oh I wish it would rain,
Let it rain, let it rain.

To black or white
And step on it

Between the shadow and uncertain colour
Between the word and sign
Between the man and all his time
Between the sidewalk and the moving stairway
Between the yay and nay !
There falls the thruth we aim to slay
There falls the thruth we do so righteous flay
Come black or white
And step on it
Black or white

Until we gather life and all our dreams
Until we cool the heat
Until we share our cup of meat
Until the trail of waste is put to stud
Until we drift away
Towards the picture in the frame
Our celebratian comes a game to play
Just black or white
And step on it

He got nicotine stains in his eyes
He got nothing to protect but his pride

The Hemingway stacatto, the tragic bravado can frighten

Deliver the dawn to the Moulin-Rouge on the horizon 
Watch it tumbling down, tumbling down

To rise from the ashes and fly

Sensing that there's something wrong
So she's gonna fly, scheming for an alibi

There were ladies and babies being trampled to hell
Where ihe flames flickered happy and sad
And the honey-coloured moon was bouncing around
He was laughing, saying: ""dear, this is mad!!!""

Oh, come on! let's sling it and do it again!""

And be drownded or burned - it's all ihe same!""

Steve Harley,"When I woke up, when I opened up my eyes
Drinking the sun without blinking
And when I reached out, when I reached out for a sign
Holding a gun without sinking
(ooh, it was a fine feeling, ooh, it was a mighty fine feeling)
Then I thought about the younger days
When I was looking for a friend
Thought about the way my mama would carry me to the end

Chorus: oh mama, will you carry me again
My eyes are blind without my mama

When I looked up, when I focused on the sky
Touching it's heart but not stinging
And then I took it and I realized it might
Shake like a bell without ringing
(ohh, it was a fine feeling, ohh, it was a mighty fine feeling)
Then I thought about the younger days
When I had no-one to fight
Thought about the way my mama would carry me through the night

Multitudes of every skin, around the glowing sparks they begin
To sing
Everybody is watching the dancer, all the way from barcelona
Teddy boy's are farming, it's all a little alarming

Chorus: I felt forty-five and was barely alive
I saw a human tribe and was terrified

Cross-legged and nonchalant, I try to make the sermon read
Back to front
Laughing all the time, this soeech goes like a dream and all
Of us hits the streets
Everybody screams ""follow the leader"" and begging now for food from
The feeder
Murder taps my shoulder - I fell the air getting colder

Chorus: I felt forty-five and was barely alive
I saw a human tribe and was terrified

Simply, now it's matter of time, everything is loose but soon
It will be fine
Giving out whiskey and rules, we're just dangling our feet sitting
Here by the pool

Of sleeping in sorrow, woking in pain

I have visions of many things.
Love's happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
 
Maybe, the fruits of love grow all around 
but for me they come a tumblin' down.
Ev'ry day heartaches grow a little stronger;
I can't stand this pain much longer.
I walk in shadows, searching for light,
cold and alone, no comfort in sight.
Hoping and prayin' for 
Someone to care, always movin' and goin' nowhere.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
Maybe, I'm searching though I don't succeed,
but someone look, there's a growing need.
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning;
all that's left is an unhappy ending.
 
What becomes of the brokenhearted who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find some kind of peace of mind.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.
I'll be looking ev'ry day;
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothing's gonna stop me now;
I'll find a way some how.
I'll be searching ev'rywhere just find someone to care.

We'll be a pair of swells and dig the best hotels 
Hit the throttle 
We'll do the rhumba too and say the life we knew 
Was so gay 

Ah, teach me to rock, I'm getting caught in a pocket 
Of Saki 
We can go to a hop and do Suburban Bop 
Cool and sharply 
Queue for the cops, you got no reason to not 
Be Malaki 
Your Gossamer and Fluff are gonna be enough 
For today

On the borders 
We'll dig the hustle-around and hear the Virgin sound

When she asked me would I like to wait and to see?
Would I like to try and explain?
Would I like to try and explain?
How my heart is feeling tonight with all the strain?
And I said I could take much more from such a friend
Although I hoped we weren't very far away from the end
For the time it's a-getting late,
Yeah, the time it's a-getting late
And my heart is hurting a little bit from the weight

She just said:
""I've got a bed here for you
I've got a bed here for me
So you can look into my eyes
And tell me what you see . . .'

She's like a rosebud in my heart and in my dreams

How I'd love to lie in her arms

I wasn't me who wrote to Gideon
I only ate the homing pigeon
And ordered taxis in the early hours
And sent a wreath of withered flowers
I broke both her heels, that was quite a deal
I've said I'm sorry for having fun

Chorus: Now you say I'm responsible for killing them
I say it was god - He was willing them

It wasn't me who lit the kerosene
I only polished the floor with vaseline
And asked the doctor not to come around
And hid her savings in the lost and found
It was all electric when her cuts went septic
I then apologized again

It wasn't only me who blew their brains
I certainly admit to putting chains
Around their necks so they couldn't move
But there were others being quite crude
That was quite a gang waiting for the bang
I only take the blame for lighting the fuse

Outside a stockholm cafe at the river's edge we sat and smiled
We said how rich we were and how warm we felt with a cognac heart
Talked over women in a lonely voice and began to jive

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a scene from ""death in the afternoon"" when I almost cried
I realized papa wanted me to live in his bull ring life
It made me hungry for peace and it made me wild and tore my heart
It didn't help to wipe away the fears like he often claimed

All the men are hungry, all the men are in search of time

Was in a frenzy from the midnight air when I saw the light
I realized only children can live upon a timeless flight
It made me hungry for youth and it made me sad and made me laugh

There was a tiger I fought for the glory
The bloody battle was fierce and was gawry
Was like a scene from a kipling story

Old enough to hold a gun

About this solitude and bliss
We enjoyed as children
O did we really have to grow ?

Showed me the distant thunder blue
Told me the clouds could help us all
Told me the prophet says the man is deep in you

Begged her never tell then wept

Only lend you a clue....

Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel,"As the sun was coming up on the danube, the hotel room was alive
It's heart was beating hard as thunder, there were three of us
There for the night
And we were talking about the magnificent river of strauss
We were saying that nothing is sacred, it's everything else
We put a match to a candle and watched it flicker and spark
We just stared at ourselves until we couldn't keep our tired
Eyelids apart
Then someone (I think it was me) said: ""somehow this is rich,
""we're sitting here on thr danube and nobody noticed the
Blue water bitch""

Ohh la la, it's fun to be so kitsch

We went out to the balcony, the danube a glorius flame
We tookpolaroid pictures and swore that we're never again going
To be the same
It was a moment when nothing was stirring save these two and me
And the clouds were beginning to gather and crash overhead from
The glorius sea

We swayed to and fro and talked of michaelangelo
And of how there was too much beauty here to take it in one go
Then from a corner a tap on the door put the room in a flood
There was God in my mind but the problem was water - not blood !

Ohh la la , it's fun to drink of blood

They ran around me, demented, white lightning flashed in their heads
I was getting bewildered, put on my armour, I was scared of
Attack from the reds
And with a pound lodged in mu nose I felt kind of rich and serene
I yelled: "" lenny, come quick, get the other boy, take him out
Of this scene !""

When he disappeared, there was only lenny and me
And we hit on a thousand subjects at once in spite of the dusky
Beat
Then lenny opened his eye for a second and pulled down the blind
Saying: ""go if you must but you know you'll always be easy
To find""

Ohh la la, it's fun to make it blind

We heard phaedre speak of the philistines of paris
But she talked to herself like a parasite so we both struggled
Free
I said: ""zizi jeanmaire wouldn't take this and neither will we
""if they call me napoleon again I'll be forced to let the lion
Free

""I'll tear down all the paper walls they hide behind
""I'll be damned if I'll take much more of this, I'm beginning
To see the signs""
Then I glanced at lenny and saw that my confidante was beginning
To jest
Well, he came out of my subconscious and that's where I put him
Away to rest

If I was told I could never see another city

All our prejudice aside?

You so slow, shift your ideas, make your mind up
In a jiffy, let's be fair
We'd all be taken off tonight
Turn off your eyes and shut the light
Oh, you're the most, you're so unreal
We'd all be dead without your spiel

Ooh - bom bom bom bom

Oh Mr. Soft, go to town and bring the dawnin'
In the mornin' on your way
Mr. Soft, put your feet upon the waters
And play Jesus for that day

Spot the starman, ruff and tumble
Fight the good fights, sling your axe
Watch the speaker, lead the packs

I been losing my brain cells at a million a day

I seen everything in every shape, seen 1984 in a terrible state
Seen you Quasimodo hanging on my gate

Oh! He was so hung-up and wasted
Oh! He was so physically devastated
He was young enough
He was well-slung enough, oh

I seen my own epitaph, I been to heaven and back
Was introduced to St. Peter where we was having a chat
I felt him losing his mind, I began to retreat
But Desdemona and me, we had a ball in a tree
She read my palm in a moment, it was shocking to me
We were so mystified, we scream out of fear

Oh! She was so hung-up and wasted
Oh! She was so physically devastated
She was young enough
She was well-slung enough destroyed

I been writing a song, we all been singing along
It's like a mild schizophrenia - wondering where we belong!
Sling it all out the window, start all over again, yoh
Oh, come into my heart, come and tear me apart
I want to be claustrophobic - got a passion ha ha!
I'm so confused, I wish I could die die die

Gonna break into a bank, if he surrendered
Imagine the shame

Playing cat and mouse like a hero on d-day
Shoeless boy, this is shotgun baby
Running from the law like it's a holiday
He's a good boy in his heart, but a fool
Don't wanna be a fugitive, he'd rather be at home
Or in school

He's got his father in his mind, and this message to get
Out, I wanna steal, wanna give, wanna die, wanna live,
Wanna find my own identity like any other teenage kid

Hope seems a stranger, shackled in doubt

In the sea in my eyes

So that's no way to talk
That's my life in your hands
Built on solid rock, not grains of sand

Step into the light with your violins
I'll keep reaching out, 'till one of us wins
We're almost in danger - admit it, it's plain-
Of sleeping in sorrow, woking in pain

And he carries a sign that screams

He keeps his money under his mattress
And his conscience in his pocket
He heart runs on batteries
He has two eyes to each socket

He say's it's easy easy to make a million
Yeah, here's a thing, avery silly thing

Head full of floating memories
Swimming to the grey horizon
Trying to escape the enemy

And with a flag on his backhe can shine
Who has a dream but can never show it
Who is drunk from the mad man's wine

Whenever anyone seems
To treat me like a freak
It makes me see I'm the
Only one who feels
That I know what is real

Sometimes it feels like a game
Of deadly hide and seek

Then I'll be gone
Maybe then, you will see",Futureal,1998
Steve Harris,"I feel the breeze on my face in expectance
Not very long before the storm reaches here
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again
Feel something strong as the power draws near

Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone
It takes me back to my childhood again

And as I wait and I look for an answer
To all the things going round in my head
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when
It's maybe threatening to happen again

As the ominous light draws near
There's a lone dog howls in the park
All the people hurry inside
As a lightning flash lights dark
The storm is nearly here
Only God will know

You're sitting alone you watch
As the wind is blowing treetops
And the swaying rustling leaves
Plenty of time to perceive
As you wait for rain to fall
Only God knows

(Steve Hill)
 
I'm lost in the jungle...not really minding at all.
Just one thing bothers me, how did I get here?
When you're in the jungle, what do you do for fun?
Dance with an antelope ...I doubt it.
 
Sleepless creatures and their families...look at me with thought-filled eyes
Plants and reptiles knowing things I'll never know.
 
Bridge:
Just who is that beast? Tell us what he wants!
Doesn't have much hair...neither back nor front,
Could he be a tree? Not without some bark.
Maybe he's a friend, friend of the aardvark.
 
[Instrumental  Break]
 
Just who is that beast? What was that he said?
Not what you'd expect... from a quadruped.
Doesn't trill his tongue...like a jungle fowl.
Doesn't have the smell...of the wolf that howls.
 
When I think about it...crocodiles aren't all that crude
Even though they don't know how I got here.
I'm trapped in delusion, lost in a kingdom of dreams.
Could this be serious? ...I doubt it.

Steve Hillage,"The sun sings that he wants you all to know
What dawns behind our lunar sea
For since our very words were commandeered
We've explored the infinite circuitry

To try and find a scheme that gave us form
It burns our curiosity
And the answers that we sit and hope to find
Are living here inside of we

And so we set foot on the pathway
Between the pillars of black and white
To put aside the fears and doubts that hold this old world down
And open up our hidden store of light within

I saw all the stars that glimmer above me get off
Their pegs and gently flicker down
And all the people of the world dissolve into a sparkling dust
And through the holy vortex, for a second it did pass
And then it returned to what it used to be

And in the second of realization
The angel of the rainbow was watching us to see
If we were ready now to be a color in his harmony
Ah, I love its holy mystery

No need for sitting always on our own
Staring desperately at all of the problems of this world
We see mistakes maybe our high is blown
But sometimes you need the black to see the white
To find the core of love and beauty

So we can change our lead back into gold
And make the chemical wedding twixt ecstasy and concentration
We've got to learn to use our hearts and minds
As the building stones to make the new age world electric temple

So people look into each others eyes and gaze at them with certainty
We're gathered here today from all around to celebrate eternity
The spirit in the air is never far immersed in our totality
And the answers that we sit and hope to find
Are living here in side of we

Never let the seal of love be broken lest you act too suddenly
We're waiting for the energy to come in the age of electricity
Magnetic tape time swirling back and forth
A-faster than the eye can see
And the answers that we sit and hope to find
Are swimming in our mercury

Swimming inside Nature
Diving through the flowers
Popping out at the bottom of the sea
In minutes that seem like hours

I want you to come with me
Journeying with your mind

We'll learn to feel the divas
And feed them with our vibes
Hear the music of the spheres
Through the ears of the cauliflowers
And the living grass that breathes

I want you to come with me

And sink beneath the turbulence
And leave the restless images behind us
And touch the secret power of nature

Do not feed the animals
Someone else can do that, angel
You don't need them animals
I won't bite you if you try to
Reach into the cage

None of them was you
I was exhausted by the end of the day

The one to whom you might
So many animals in the zoo

Steve Hogarth,"You are the deep water
You are the thin ice
The edge of the high cliff
And the November fires
You are my church bells
And the silent early hours
You are the ghost I hear
Echo in the half-light
Ecstasy and heart failure
Trembling and pounding in the magic spell
You are my wild flower and my wishing well
The spinning cut crystal above my bed
that dazzles and jabs me
Indigo blue and postbox red
I run away and away and away from you and everyone
But you hide in all the places I try to hide
I make believe I make excuses I make fun
But you hide in all the places I try to hide
Oh my love
I know what I am
A lost cause
Selfish beyond forgiveness
Oh my heart
Knows what I am
A lost cause
Hopeless
But can you know
How my heart knows you
The shallow water running from the deep water
Running dry",The Deep Water,1998
Steve Hogarth,"I have an animal inside me
He sleeps during the day
But he kicks and ticks even when he's sleeping
Never completely goes away
And as the evening shadows stretch themselves
The animal begins to wake
Comes out to see what is for breakfast
He takes whatever he can take
He isn't murderous or wicked
Sometimes he's like a little child
But he's voracious and insatiable
He's self-destructive and he's wild
I sometimes think about the animal
Sometimes I'm proud, Sometimes ashamed
I know he drove me from my hometown
Made me feel like I'm not the same
I know he stops me being boring
I think so anyway
And I don't know if I control him
But I must try to keep him chained
But he doesn't think about the future
He lives completely in the NOW
Doo bee doo bee dooo...
I sometimes see the other animals
Controlling other peoples lives
Doing things they thought they'd never do
And not really knowing why
So we must all beg for forgiveness
Say sorry and explain
Until the evening shadows stretch themselves
And here we go again...",The Evening Shadows,1998
Steve Hogarth,"A hundred thousand hearts a day
Are vacuumed in along these runways
In specks of iron from around the world
Drawn to the magnetism in this place
I've watched them land in the Heathrow haze
Through 'Nothing to Declare' into cars that speed away

I'm watching the aeroplanes comin' in
Waiting for a miracle
Watching the aeroplanes comin' in
Wonderin' if I'll see you again
Wonder if I'll see you again

I understand how you had to leave
You said 'back soon' and I must believe
My feelings haven't changed since that fateful day
You left me grounded and you flew away

Over my house into the clouds
To foreign lands in the sunshine
I watch the seven forty sevens climb
Over my house into the clouds
To foreign lands in the sunshine

I wave bye bye, bye bye,
A hundred thousand hearts a day
Come gliding down but they don't explain
An empty seat on a sold out flight
A year ago on an empty night
I watched you down but you never came
Through 'Nothing to Declare' like a sign hangin' on my name

I'm watching the aeroplanes comin' in
Waiting for a miracle
Watching the aeroplanes
Wonderin' if I'll see you... again

Over my house

Or would I write it off as something of a terrible mistake...

Would I be scared, Would I be in awe

Why is it I'm expected to feel so ashamed
Is it a garden full of flowers
Or a jungle full of scorpions and snakes
A cellar full of demons
A heaven full of angels
You hatchin in that bosom
A wide open horizon
or a desert plain
A box of nice surprises
Or a cauldron full of pain
If I strip away that outer skin
Find a way to get you drunk
What kind of picture would you paint me
Michelangelo or Munch ?
Could you really be
As perfect as you are to me
Could you really be

Steve Hogarth,"(Hello, mirror, so glad to see you, my friend, it's been a while)

Staring at the empty page before me
All the years of wreckage run through my head
Patterns of my live have thawed and torn me
Revealing hurtful shame and deep lament
Overwhelming sorrow now absorbs me
As the pen begins to trace my darkest past
Signs throughout my life that should have warned me
Of all the wrongs I've done for which I must repent

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Sometimes you've got to be strong
When you think it's too late

Staring at the finished page before me
All the damage now so clear and evident
Thinking 'bout the dreaded task in store for me
A bitter fear at the thought of my amends
Hoping that the step will help restore me
To face my past and ask for forgiveness
Cleaning up my dirty side of this un-swept street
Could this be the beginning of the end?

I once thought it better to regret
Things that I have done, then haven't

Sometimes you've got to be wrong
Learn the hard way
Just when you're through hanging on
You're saved

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development
We will be amazed before we are halfway through.
We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness.
We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.
We will comprehend the word serenity, and we will know peace
No matter how far down the scale we have gone.
We will see how our experience can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear.
We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows.
Self-seeking will slip away.
Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change.
Fear of people and economic insecurity will leave us.
We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us.
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.
Are these extravagant promises? We think not.
They have been fulfilled amongst others
Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.
We will always be true to our principles.

You're only as sick as your secrets
But the truth shall set you free.
The truth is the truth.
That's all you can do is live with it.",Repentance,2007

Steve Holy,"She hates bein' on her own, but she does her best
Empty nights create the hunger for love and tenderness
She spends so much time alone
She says it makes her wonder
If she'll ever find someone who'll make her feel alive
And satisfy the hunger

He always reads a lot at night, but he's gettin' tired of it
An empty house deepens desire for true companionship
When he sees himself in the mirror, he don't look no younger
He just keeps on fightin' the fear that'll he'll go through life
And not satisfy the hunger

Oh the hunger, the need for lovin' arms
Oh the hunger, longing for contentment of the heart

She picks up a second job at an all night diner
Anything that she can do to fill the empty hours
Then by chance her destiny he's there across the counter

El Camino ain't working
Monday night an' I'm hurting
For company

Bummed a ride to the hideaway
I'm the only guy in the place
Bored silly, wasn't gonna stay
Then she walks in, Heaven sent
And it occurs to me

What a good night to be lonely
Somebody's looking out for me
Oh, what an opportunity
Right out of the blue

Is it luck or a twist of fate?
Doesn't really matter either way
It's a good night
A good night to be lonely

Dollars worth of quarters
Played some songs and ordered
One for me and one for her
As I tipped my hat

Said that she felt restless
Just moved here from Texas
That's when I suggested
Maybe she could dance with me
She said, ""Thought you'd never ask""

What a good night to be lonely
Somebody's looking out for me
Oh, what an opportunity
Right out of the blue

Is it luck or a twist of fate?
Doesn't really matter either way

Feels just like I'm dreaming

But can we tell which are the games

Sharpness of the color sun shine
Straight light searching all the meanings of the song
Long last treatment of the telling that
Relates to all the words sung
Dreamer easy in the chair that really fits you

Love comes to you and then after
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise
Sharp distance
How can the wind with its arms all around me
Sharp distance
How can the wind with so many around me
I feel lost in the city",Heart of the Sunrise,1981
Steve Howe,"Long distance runaround
Long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Cold summer listening
Hot color melting the anger to stone
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Long distance runaround
Long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye

Cold summer listening
Hot colour melting the anger to stone
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Looking for the sunshine",Long Distance Runaround,1981
