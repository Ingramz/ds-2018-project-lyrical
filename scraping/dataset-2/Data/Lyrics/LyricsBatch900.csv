Barney Kessel,"Walked with no one and talked with no one
And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1994
Barney Kessel,"Out on the plains down near Santa fe
I met a cowboy ridin' the range one day
And as he jogged along I heard him singing
A most peculiar cowboy song
It was a ditty, he learned in the city
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Get along, get hip little doggies
Get along, better be on your way
Get along, get hip little doggies
And he trucked them on down the old fairway
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Singin' his cowboy song
He's just too much
He's got a knocked out western accent with a Harlem touch
He was raised on local weed
He's what you call a swing half breed
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah

Get along little doggie, better be on your way, your way,
Get along little doggie
And he trucked them on down the old fairway
Singin' his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yeah
Comma ti yippity yi yeah.

Yip yip singing his cowboy song
Yip yip as he was joggling along
Yip yip he sings with a harlem touch
Yip yip that guy is just too much
Singing his cow cow boogie in the strangest way
Comma ti yi yi yi yi yi yeah.",Cow Cow Boogie,1995
Barney Kessel,"Whether you are here or yonder, 
Whether you are false or true
Whether you remain or wander, 
I'm growing fonder of you
Even though your friends forsake you, 
Even though you don't succeed
Wouldn't I be glad to take you, 
Give you the break you need

More than you know, more than you know
Girl of my heart, I love you so
Lately I find you're on my mind
More than you know

Whether you're right, whether you're wrong
Girl of my heart, I'll string along
You need me so
Much more than you'll ever know (ever know)        
Loving you the way that I do      
  
There's nothing I can do about it        
Loving may be all you can give        
But baby I can't live without it
Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry
If you got tired and said ""Good-bye""

More than I'd show
More than you'd ever know",More Than You Know,1996
Barney Kessel,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1996
Barney Kessel,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream
'Til somebody else came near
Somebody else came near you
I felt the winter's chill
And now I sit and wonder night and day
Why I love you still",What Is This Thing Called Love?,1998
Barney Kessel,"Say, it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Say, it's only a paper moon

It's a Barnum and Bailey world

But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

It's phony it's plain to see
How happy I would be
If you believed in me",It's Only a Paper Moon,1998
Barney Kessel,"And I'm alright here and I'm all ready to leave this town and leave all of you crying all over someone that you just can't have again love again drink again 
Find someone else that you know, 
Cause you know it will make you feel better cause you better feel something why else are you here?

Just say I love you sweetheart.
I'll be yours tonight
Just say I love you sweetheart.
I'll make you stronger.

It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.

I'm sorry if you all have some sexual confusion
It's too late for that can't you see what you've done?
I don't sleep with my friends I don't lie when I need it I'm doing my best not to lead you on.
It's just too bad that I've been there myself and it's just too bad that I'm so much like all of you.

Just say I love you sweetheart.
It's not wrong at all
Just say I love you sweetheart.
I want to make you stronger and
You won't be wrong at all this time

It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.
It's not wrong at all.

Can't even breathe in here 
I can't even look at you tell me how it feels 
When they all start to laugh at you 
Tell me how it feels when they all start to laugh at you
Tell me how it feels when they all start to laugh at you 
Tell me how it feels when they all start to laugh at you 

When they all start to laugh at you

Please say I'm not too early",I Love You,1998
Barney Kessel,"I don't care what the weatherman says
When the weatherman says it's raining
You'll never hear me complaining
I'm certain the sun will shine

I don't care how the weather vane points
When the weather vane points to gloomy
It's gotta be sunny to me
When your eyes look into mine

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those eyes?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get so lit up?
Gosh all, git up, how'd they get that size?

Golly gee, when you turn those heaters on
Woe is me, got to put my cheaters on

Jeepers creepers, where'd ya get those peepers?
Oh, those weepers, how they hypnotize!
Where'd ya get those eyes?",Jeepers Creepers,1999
Barney Kessel,"I was just minding my business
Life was a beautiful song
Didn't have a care nor worry
Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time

Them there eyes",Them There Eyes,1999
Barney Kessel,"Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Since everyone spread the story 
With his own little personal touch
 
Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream
Is over my head
Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance
True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue
When we're apart the words in my heart
Reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memory
And other arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear it from me
And you never will
Do nothin' till you hear from me

Barney Kessel,"When a girl has the heart of a mother
It must go to someone of course
It can't be sister or brother
And so I love my horse
But horses are frequently silly
Mine ran from the beach of Okhala
And left me alone for a filly
So I have picked you up

I'm a sentimental sap, that's all
What's the use of trying not to fall?
I have no will, you've made your kill
Cause you took advantage of me
I'm just like an apple on a bough
And you're gonna shake me down somehow
So, what's the use, you've cooked my goose
Cause you took advantage of me

I'm so hot and bothered that
I don't know my elbow from my ear
I suffer something awful each time
You go and much worse when you're near
Here I am with all my bridges burned
Just a babe in arms where you're concerned
So lock the doors and call me yours
Cause you took advantage of me.

Barney Kessel,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

And the promise to be near each time you call,
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all.
I can only give you country walks in springtime,
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall,
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all.
There are those I am sure who have told you,
They will give you the world for a toy.
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy.

Pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,

If your endurance is great.
I'll learn by easy stages
If you're courageous and wait.

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,
Maybe by the time I'm fifty
I'll get up and do a nifty.

That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish

Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything

The birds off the trees?

Just disappear

Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak

And to reach the highest peak,
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek.

If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.

Say, what's in this drink 
No cabs to be had out there

To break this spell 
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir 
Mind if I move a little closer
At least I'm gonna say that I tried 
What's the sense in hurting my pride
I really can't stay 
Baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside

C'mon baby

I simply must go 
Baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no 
Ooh baby, it's cold outside

I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm 
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious 
Man, your lips look so delicious
My brother will be there at the door 
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 
Gosh your lips look delicious
Well maybe just a half a drink more 
Never such a blizzard before

I've got to go home 
Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb 
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand 
Your eyes are like starlight now
But don't you see 
How can you do this thing to me
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Making my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied 
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay 
Get over that old out
Ah, but it's cold outside

Baby it's cold outside

Brr its cold
It's cold out there
Cant you stay awhile longer baby
Well, I really shouldn't, alright

And fill them 'til they overflow, with rose and cherry red

Crystal of a raindrop are all I'll ever need

Let both of your feet beat time to the drum
And let your heart go rat-a-tat-tat

See the pretty lady toss that baton high
Ain't she cute as a Daisy?
Watch the fella with the big base drum go by
Ain't you glad that you stayed?

Hear the tuba play that 'Oom Pah Pah'

Up outta your seat, down off-a the stand
Step out to the sweet, beat  the bugle plays
A sound that you'll remember all your days
And when you see that leader proudly raise his hand
Just follow the band

Hear the trumpet blast, heat the cornet blare
Hear the boom of the bass and the rattle of the snare
With the sweetest burst of melody I know goes the piccolo

Hear the silver tone of the xylophone
Hear the glide and the bellow of the slide trombone
Then a burst of crystal, listen to it peel, it's the glockenspiel

With the most majestic manner
You'll remember all your life
Comes mellophone, comes saxophone
Comes sousaphone, comes fife

Then the brass sings out the woodwinds sigh
The trumpets shout and the drums reply
With a crash and a bang as the whole she bang goes by

What a sight to see (oh!) 

And then he swung from the tree and he lit on the ground
And he started to rock, really rockin' around
It was a crazy ditty with a swingin' tune
(Sing a boop-boop, a-boopa lopa lum bam boom)

Se fue a buscar otros lugares
DejÃ³ su casa why su ciudad

Un caso perdido para la sociedad.
VagÃ³ sin rumbo fijo
Quiso disfrutar viviÃ³ mil aventuras
Noches sin final
Nunca fue un hombre de negocios
Siempre se abstuvo de votar

Un hombre sin moral
Un caso perdido
Para la sociedad.
Hoy no se tiene que preocupar
De conservar un capital
Vive al dÃ­a en su refugio
No tiene nada que ocultar.

PasÃ³ de toda ayuda espiritual

When chains are torn by courage born

A life worthwhile for you and me 
And with our love through tears and thorns

Barratt Waugh,"A ray of hope flickers in the sky 
A tiny star lights up way up high 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn', 
This comes to pass when a child is born. 

A silent wish sails the seven seas

The winds of change whisper in the trees 
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn, 
This comes to pass when a child is born. 

A rosy dawn settles all around

You got to feel you're on solid ground 
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn 
This come to pass when a child is born. 

It's all a dream, an illusion now.

It must come true some time soon somehow 
All across the land dawns a brand new morn 
This comes to pass when a child is born.

Chi si volta è perso e resta qua
Io so per certo amico
Mi son voltato anch'io

E per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché
In questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto
Per scrollarsi via di dosso

Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa
E allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio a senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Io mi prenderò il mio posto
E tu seduta lì al mio fianco
Mi dirai destinazione paradiso

Making sure that we only give you the best

Barren Cross,"Two thousand years ago, there came a man
A man who was hated and loved, worshiped and killed
But what was this man all about and what did he do
What made him different and why
Did his name live on too

[Chorus]
For me to live is Christ, to die is gain
There's no other name by which I'm saved
I've got the power it's in my sights
Because with him I'm not afraid to die

Now I will disclose his name, it's Jesus Christ
Why did he come just to die and how did he rise
Why is our system of dating based on one man's death?
And why is the world upside-down
Cause of one man's life

[Chorus]

Now I must warn you they'll tell you don't need god
They are the foolish and they are the ones who will burn, burn in hell
But if you accept him you'll be born again
Do it now! You will live!
Feel the power of god like lead,
Feel the metal from inside my head
Feel the steel, take his flight
For when it leaves, heaven will be in sight

If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord
And if you believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead,
Then you will be saved and forgiven, you just have to ask
He 'll never leave or forsake you, his promise is fact

Close to the edge, I was running out of time
Close to the edge, but now there's peace of mind

And now I look to the north and I see in front of me
A shining blue light in the distance, oh I see
A castle of ivory gold, look out, behold
It almost never became my home

Close to the edge, I was running out of time
Close to the edge, walking on a thin, thin line

Close to the edge, the spotlight shines on you now
Close to the edge, you better make your choice soon now
Close to the edge, your heart's the key that makes you free

You're close to the edge

Don't burn out the light, it ain't burning bright,
Son, can't you see where you're going, you're close to the edge

I know you cry, you don't want to die,
So take what I've found, and you'll be miles and miles from the edge
You're close to the edge

But you ain't got the time to know what it means,

Then we danced in the dark under September stars in the pourin' rain

That all I need in this life is your crazy love
If I never get to see the Northern lights
If I never get to see the Eiffel Tower at night
Oh if all I got is your hand in my hand
Baby I could die a happy man, oh yes I could

Baby that red dress brings me to my knees
Oh but that black dress makes it hard to breathe

It's too good to be true, nothing better than you
In my wildest dreams

And I know that I can't ever tell you enough
What I need in this life is your crazy love

And I'm gonna be there
That city's calling
And I'm gonna be there
In Quedat, they wants me
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibes
All over the world

Yo, all over the world, spread the vibe
Big dogs, from the West, we ride
With the war cry, me amigos at my side
Ready to take the world on, do or die
As the fly down low, lyrical Van Gogh
Stay international with the ill I-D-O
Money making flows, pesos from Mexico
To European ends and yens from Tokyo
Amend for the years that we rocked skid row
In a trash bungalow, trying to juggle our flow
But you know how the struggle go, life move slow
Yo, plus it's extra hard when you got no dough
But we strive on, mentality stay strong
Dropping bombs on the world from North West Saigon
Deep in the Babylon, def gone won watch them run
The heart is wicked and judgment soon come

Now, this is a message in the bottle, like Robinson Caruso
I can't' feel the warmth of the sun, I'm like Pluto
So I open seven shakras, break the seven seals
Bust the dopest poetry rhyme just like Kaleel
Jebron, I bring the dawn to decepticons
It's that of the dreaded fist with Misfit and Red 1
I used to read the psalms and uhh, holy Koran
Now I only read the birds in the trees, then I'm gone
Like a breeze on a summer day, never run away
From the judgment day when Armageddon come say
If I had 24 hours to live, here's what I'd do
I'd make everybody know G-O-D's inside of you
And spread love from Kelowna to Kalamazoo
Cause no matter how many are called the chosen are few

In Paris, they want it
And I'm gonna be there
I hear Indies calling
And I'm gonna be there
In Japan, they're crying
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibe
All over the world
Oh yeah, so say, night and day

Well let me hit why y'all with this one, words of the drum
Vocalize my lingo, let you all know where I'm from
Conscious of what goes 'round the world, chores(?) to be done
But still we sticking to the hip hop, constitution
Four elements, we taking it, with that we making it
Honeys be shaking it, my vibe relating it
To the DJs 'round the world, they can done
Spin this in their cipher, and you're sure of the number one spot
In my category, you'll be my heart
So pump that shit for me, through the intercity
So they can bug off the ill hop hop
The Rascalz crew, and you we just don't stop
So take it to the top, and rock the world with the hot onslaught
You can't leave, 'cause the rhythm and rhyme got ya caught

Mother Africa wants me
And we're gonna be there
London City's calling
And I'm gonna be there
West Indies love we
And we're gonna be there, spreading the vibe
All over, all over, oh yeah
Brazil, I hear you calling

The vibes is so right
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Warn them already, we have to warn them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Oh yeah!
The vibe is so right

That city's calling
And I'm gonna be there
In Quedat, they wants me
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibes
All over the world

Yo, all over the world, spread the vibe
Big dogs, from the West, we ride
With the war cry, me amigos at my side
Ready to take the world on, do or die
As the fly down low, lyrical Van Gogh
Stay international with the ill I-D-O
Money making flows, pesos from Mexico
To European ends and yens from Tokyo
Amend for the years that we rocked skid row
In a trash bungalow, trying to juggle our flow
But you know how the struggle go, life move slow
Yo, plus it's extra hard when you got no dough
But we strive on, mentality stay strong
Dropping bombs on the world from North West Saigon
Deep in the Babylon, def gone won watch them run
The heart is wicked and judgment soon come

Now, this is a message in the bottle, like Robinson Caruso
I can't' feel the warmth of the sun, I'm like Pluto
So I open seven shakras, break the seven seals
Bust the dopest poetry rhyme just like Kaleel
Jebron, I bring the dawn to decepticons
It's that of the dreaded fist with Misfit and Red 1
I used to read the psalms and uhh, holy Koran
Now I only read the birds in the trees, then I'm gone
Like a breeze on a summer day, never run away
From the judgment day when Armageddon come say
If I had 24 hours to live, here's what I'd do
I'd make everybody know G-O-D's inside of you
And spread love from Kelowna to Kalamazoo
Cause no matter how many are called the chosen are few

In Paris, they want it
And I'm gonna be there
I hear Indies calling
And I'm gonna be there
In Japan, they're crying
And I'm gonna be there, spreading the vibe
All over the world
Oh yeah, so say, night and day

Well let me hit why y'all with this one, words of the drum
Vocalize my lingo, let you all know where I'm from
Conscious of what goes 'round the world, chores(?) to be done
But still we sticking to the hip hop, constitution
Four elements, we taking it, with that we making it
Honeys be shaking it, my vibe relating it
To the DJs 'round the world, they can done
Spin this in their cipher, and you're sure of the number one spot
In my category, you'll be my heart
So pump that shit for me, through the intercity
So they can bug off the ill hop hop
The Rascalz crew, and you we just don't stop
So take it to the top, and rock the world with the hot onslaught
You can't leave, 'cause the rhythm and rhyme got ya caught

Mother Africa wants me
And we're gonna be there
London City's calling
And I'm gonna be there
West Indies love we
And we're gonna be there, spreading the vibe
All over, all over, oh yeah
Brazil, I hear you calling

Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Warn them already, we have to warn them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again
Tell them already, we have to tell them again

Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Child's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back

Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back
like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that
Scream, wake the neighbors from they sleep
Grab the sheets witcha teeth, wiggle ya butt cheeks 
Quarter styles over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenience store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin ya kitty
Then we drive into the sunset, pull over
Get up on the hood ma, I ain't done yet, uhh
[Chorus]
[Shyne] (Barrington Levy)
We've been together for a few months now
Did it all, Four Seasons to the Trump
Beverly Hills bungalows in ya underclothes
In Paris, Eiffel Tower bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seem
See me flip a couple things, load up magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one, whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter
Whether it's BBQ's or Mr. Child's platter
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs, didn't hit the charts and smash
If my car was a train on the surface or back
I think you'd be right there (know you'll be right there)
Cause we right there, no Cartier charms
Just you in my arms, no Sean don
Just a bottle of Evian; see'mon, uh
[Chorus]
[Barrington Levy]
So I draw from my tonic and I take one sip
Should've seen me cause I gallop like a horse'll get whipped
Come quick yeahhhhhhhhh, come quick whoaaaaaaaaaa
Cause you I love, and not another
Although some may change, girl you know I will never
I'ma love love love love love love you forever, oh-ii
Always be there - for me
Always be there
Be there for me
Ohhhhhhhhh, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah, ayah
Ohhhhhhhhh

A stranger is staring at me

The needs of a man

But I don't understand

But over the mountains
Across the sea
I know love is waiting
I hear it calling to me
Calling my name

I'm looking for love all around me
Looking for love to surround me

Alone again, it's always the same
I've just been marking my time
Since the day I was born
With no one to blame

Which way to go

Ladies who don't hang around with no progressive friends
They don't have no time to play a silly game

Shallow mans are all the same
All the fellas who get played
Not because they pour the drinks it means they're gettin laid
Show her some respect and maybe wouldn't have been played

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

Hey look kids you need to change your tune
That avenue you traveling unraveling soon
You'll be battling doom but does it matter to you
Worried 'bout who was laughing at you
Your appearance is more important than what's really real
'Cause here it is situation's bad not meaning good
A lot be in the hood that got me with
Nowhere to put my trust in no discussion
Spontaneous combustion
Lust and greed if you ain't up to speed
You's a duck in need
Cats ain't got enough to eat
So there's bluffs and beef
Chicks up the street
That tricks come to see
Guns under the sheets
Shells pummel your meat
Forgetting former, still
Dude you're sorta chill sitting on bout forty mill
But his whole quart'll get spilled
Over those sort of deals
That get you sorta killed or up in court looking for appeals

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

Yo what up fam
You don't know who I am
Last week you was acting like you was my man
But you wasn't hey
Served you're purpose dog
At the end of the day
Is it worth it all
Immersed in all the worth the world got to offer
But perpetrating proper like nothing can stop ya
Can't even trust my doctor she in it for profit
And everybody looking for some kind of profit
Situation mad toxic my man got hit
'Cause the bird he was with wouldn't stop squawking
She juggling five cats and they all lost in
The illusion of love that she used for profit
The usual topic chickens and benjamins
You supposed to be my kin Mexican or Asian European or Korean or Jamaican
Makes no difference
Our existence is still shared between us in essence

Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

Show some love for your brothers and sisters
Show some love for the whole wide world
Show some love for your enemies and frenemies
Show some love for the rejects on the street
Show some love for the whole wide world

'Cause the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

If the world is bad refer to your dad
And his before four score what's the reason he saw for
Karma is real part of the deal when's how you started the deal
'Cause everything is 360
It will start the cartwheel
And snowballs so don't forget now cause I told y'all
Dead the 'cause all it do is hold y'all captive
All in the world you're trapped in
Relaxing you can't feel what's happening
I deal with facts man
I was at the crossroads dealing with lost souls that couldn't cross though
Lost hope off dope
Out to jostle
Any unweary traveler that would fall the talk show
It's foul how they play it
But you can't stray to show love take
Courage and strength and realize we ain't sure as we think you know

The world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had
Take me away
Yes the world's gone bad
We've lost the love we had

So down I want to go
So cold I have to go
So down I need to go
So cold as I go

Even though love no more

Let another motherfucker run up

Shoot to kill when it's time for action
See you can't hide, from this homicide, that ain't no lie
Better kiss that black ass goodbye

Don't ever forget that golden rule in the game

Why, women and money don't mix, like drinking an' driving

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000

once again runnin' away with me.
It was just my imagination runnin' away with me. Oo

But it was Just my imagination once again runnin' way with me.
Tell you it was just my imagination runnin' away with me.
 
Ev'ry night on my knees I pray Dear Lord, Hear my plea;
Don't ever let another take her love from me or I would surely die.
Her love is heavenly, when her arms enfold me,
I hear a tender rhapsody; but in reality she doesn't even know me.

      All over again! All over again! All over again!

      Artilleryman: We'll build shops and hospitals and barracks, right under their noses, right under their feet. Everything we need: banks, prisons and schools. We'll send scouting parties to collect books and stuff, and then like you we'll teach the kids. Not poems and rubbish; science, so we can get everything working! We'll build villages and towns, and... and we'll play each other at cricket! Listen, maybe one day we'll capture a fighting machine, eh, learn how to make 'em ourselves, and then: WALLOP!

We drank, and then he insisted upon playing cards. With our species on the edge of extermination, with no prospect but a horrible death, we actually played games. Later he talked more of his plan, but I saw flames flashing in the deep blue night, red weed glowing, tripod figures moving distantly, and I put down my champagne glass. I felt a traitor to my kind, and I knew I must leave this strange dreamer.

Barry DeSouza,"There were a dozen dead bodies in the Euston road, their outlines softened by the black dust. All was still, houses locked and empty, shops closed, but looters had helped themselves to wine and food, and outside a jewelers some gold chains and a watch were scattered on the pavement.

      Martian: Ulla!

I stopped, staring towards the sound. It seemed as if that mighty desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.

      Martian: Ulla!

The desolating cry worked upon my mind. The wailing took possession of me. I was intensely weary, footsore, hungry and thirsty. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the dead? Why was I alive when London was lying in state in its black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely, drifting from street to empty street, drawn inexorably towards that cry.

      Martian: Ulla!

I saw, over the trees on Primrose Hill, the fighting machine from which the howling came. I crossed Regent's Canal. There stood a second machine, upright, but as still as the first.

      Martian: Ulla!

Abruptly, the sound ceased. Suddenly the desolation, the solitude, became unendurable. While that voice sounded London still seemed alive. now suddenly there was a change, the passing of something, and all that remained was this gaunt quiet.
I looked up, and saw a third machine. It was erect and motionless, like the others. An insane resolve possessed me: I would give my life to the Martians, here and now.
I marched recklessly towards the titan and saw that a multitude of black birds were circling and clustering about the hood. I began running along the road. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation as I ran up the hill towards the monster. Out of the hood hung red shreds, at which the hungry birds now pecked and tore.
I scrambled up to the crest of Primrose hill, the Martian's camp was below me. A mighty space it was, and scattered about it, in their overturned machines, were the Martians, slain after all man's devices had failed by the humblest creatures on the earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. Directly the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies attacked them. From that moment, they were doomed.
The torment was ended. The people scattered over the country, desperate, leaderless, starved, the thousands who had fled by sea including the one most dear to me; all could return, the pulse of life growing stronger and stronger would beat again.
As life returns to normal, the question of another attack from Mars causes universal concern. Is our planet safe, or is this time of peace merely a reprieve? It may be that across the immensity of space, they have learned their lessons , and even now await their opportunity. Perhaps the future belongs not to us, but to the Martians.",Dead London [Early Band Run-Through],1981
Barry DeSouza,"For three days I fought my way along roads packed with refugees, the homeless, burdened with boxes and bundles containing their valuables. All that was of value to me was in London. By the time I reached their little red brick house, Carrie and her father were gone.

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old,
And darker days are drawing near,
The winter winds will be much colder,
Now you're not here.

I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky
And one by one they disappear,
I wish that I was flying with them
Now you're not here.
Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away...

Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way,
You always loved this time of year
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here 

Fire suddenly leapt from house to house. The population panicked and ran, and I was swept along with them, aimless and lost without Carrie. Finally, I headed eastward for the ocean and my only hope of survival: a boat out of England.

Like the sun through the trees you came to love me,
Like a leaf on the breeze you blew away...

A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
As if to hide a lonely tear
My life will be forever autumn,
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here
Cause you're not here

As I hastened through Covent Garden, Blackfriars and Billingsgate, more and more people joined the painful exodus. Sad, weary women, their children stumbling in the street with tears, their men bitter and angry, the rich rubbing shoulders with beggars and outcasts. Dogs snarled and whined, the horse's bits were covered with foam, and here and there were wounded soldiers, as helpless as the rest.
We saw tripods wading up the Thames, cutting through bridges as though they were paper. Waterloo bridge, Westminster bridge, one appeared above Big Ben.

Ulla! 

Never before in the history of the world, had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered together. This was no disciplined march, it was a stampede, without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed and unprovisioned driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout of civilization, of the massacre of mankind.
A vast crowd buffeted me towards the already packed steamer. I looked up enviously at those safely on board... straight into the eyes of my beloved Carrie. At sight of me she began to fight her way along the packed deck to the gangplank. At that very moment, it was raised, and I caught a last glimpse of her despairing face as the crowd swept me away from her.

Barry Forgie,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in

How can I win
Where will I be tomorrow

Barry Gibb,"Now I like the way you move
Anyway that you make it work
And you offer something new
And the doorway is open for me

Now a man needs a woman
And I know that for me is true
And life, we got too much reality
There's gotta be other things to do

Me electrify you
Simply mystify you
Very strange but nice

Now somebody wrong
And somebody right
And somebody knows
it's neither one thing or the other

It's a fine line
between taking and giving
It's a fine line

Anyway that you wanna be

Anytime after the midnight hour

Now love, don't get short on the action
Anyway you got the energy
My heart is a part of the plans you made
You're the star of my sexual fantasy

Simply mystify you
Hope you stay all night

I'll have you for dinner

for the worse or for the better

It's wild, it's weird, it's what we think about
This ain't no strip, club, shame on you 'cause
you know somebody that got a bead on what you need
Don't sacrifice your love
You analyze, don't minimize
what only you can rise above

Now, I know that, don't you think
I know you're watching me
You got no claim to make
Well, that's no excuse
And know the truth
You got brain drain, long as there's a game to play
Sad, but there's only one fool to blame

It's a fine line, fine line

You don't think my love should tie you down
I say love can turn your groove around
Watch me please you
Watch me play your game
Someday love will make your water flow

I should have been a stronger man

Barry Gibb,"You took a mystery and made me want it 
You got a pedestal and put me on it 
You made me love you out of feeling nothing 
Something that you do 
And I was there and not dancing with anyone 
You took a little, then you took me over 
You set your mark on stealing my heart away 
Crying, trying, anything for you 

I'm in the middle of a chain reaction 
You give me all the after midnight action 
I want to get you where I can let you make all that love to me 
I'm on a journey for the inspiration 
To anywhere and there ain't no salvation 
I need you to get me nearer to you 
So you can set me free 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 

You make me tremble when your hand moves lower 
You taste a little then you swallow slower 
Nature has a way of yielding treasure 
Pleasure made for you, oh 
You gotta plan, your future is on the run 
Shine a light for the whole world over 
You never find your love if you hide away 
Crying, dying, all you gotta do is 

Get in the middle of a chain reaction 
You get a medal when you're lost in action 
I want to get your love all ready for the sweet sensation 
Instant radiation 
You let me hold you for the first explosion 
We get a picture of our love in motion 
My arms will cover, my lips will smother you 
With no more left to say 
We talk about love, love, love 
We talk about love 
You let me hold you for the first explosion 
My arms will cover you

Barry Gibb,"(B. Gibb/M. Gibb/G. Bitzer)

Love can't be love
If it's just for the moment
Only to pass the night away
As we both get nearer
Deeper love is so much clearer
Long as we do it face to face

And I have known
All the lost lonely people
My world has found a place in your smile
If you're searching
For a different love than mine
You'll never stop me loving you

More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face

You make a man
Like a child with your power
Help me to find my way inside
Let me drink your potion
Let me drown in your emotion
Lover to lover, face to face

In time we learn
From the lost lonely people
That love can last as long as time
There was never born another one for me
And you'll never stop me loving you

More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face

I'll be with you when the world is lies
And the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be

More of your love
More of the warmer ride
May love for everyone be as true
No letting go, but let each other know
If we never try
Then we never lie face to face

I'll be with you when the world is lies
And the music dies
Just as long as I know there will be
More of your love
More of the warmer ride...

You battle on with the love you're living on

And the words that fly inside my head
And saying what is left unsaid

And heart knows where the home is
And I can feel the light that shines on me
It's shining on me

You know where to find me
And where you go, I'll follow you
And nothing on that road that lies ahead
Will keep us apart

'Cause I know where your heart is
And heart knows

Who could have known
That we were written on the wind
Together through some ever changing times
Stories people told what we didn't know
How it didn't matter anyway

'Cause we were holding hands
And we held on tight
Searching for the vision
In the dark of night

And always I come back to you
No matter how you drift away
My love will bring you home

'Cause I know where your heart is
And know where every part is
And nothing on that road that lies ahead
Will keep us apart

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud

But nobody ever hears him
Or the sounds he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

Charming and debonaire

So rare You have a way that's beyond compare

In everything you do
You have that something, that certain manner
You thrill me more than the ""Star Spangled Banner""

Barry Harris,"Midnight, you heavy laden, it's midnight
Come on and trade in your old dreams for new
Your new dreams for old
I know where they're bought
I know where they're sold
Midnight, you've got to get there at midnight
And you'll be met there by others like you
Brothers as blue
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
 
Midnight, look at the steeple, it's midnight
Unhappy people, it's ringing with joy
It's ringing with cheer
'Cause yesterday's gone
Tomorrow is near
Midnight, the heart is lighter at midnight
Things will be brighter the moment you find
More of your kind
Smiling on the street of dreams
 
Love laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new 
On the street of dreams
Gold, sliver and gold
All you can hold is in the moonbeams
Poor, no one is poor
Long as love is sure

Barry Harris,"Star eyes,
That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

Star eyes,
When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1960
Barry Harris,"Oooooh... 

It happened the moment, when you were revealed 
'Cause you were a dream that you should not have been 
A fantasy real 
You gave me this beating baby 
This rhythm inside 
And you made me feel good and feel nice and feel loved 
Give me paradise 

So shouldn't I realize 
You're the highest of the high 
If you don't know, then I'll say it 
So don't ever wonder 

Shouldn't I realize 
You're the highest of the high 
If you don't know, then I'll say it 
So don't ever wonder 

So tell me how long 
How long it's gonna take until you speak, babe 
'Cause I can't live my life 
Without you here by my side 
Ooh... 
You gave me the feelin', feelin' in my life 

So shouldn't I realize 
You're the highest of the high 
If you don't know, then I'll say it

Barry Harris,"My heart is sad and lonely

I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Barry Harris,"Once I was young
Yesterday, perhaps
Danced with Jim and Paul
And kissed some other chaps

Once I was young
But never was naive
I thought I had a trick or two
Up my imaginary sleeve
And now I know I was naive

I didn't know what time it was
Then I met you
Oh, what a lovely time it was
How sublime it was too

I didn't know what day it was
You held my hand
Warm like the month of May it was
And I'll say it was grand

Grand to be alive, to be young
To be mad, to be yours alone
Grand to see your face, feel your touch
Hear your voice say, ""I'm all your own""

I didn't know what year it was

I wanted love and here it was
Shining out of your eyes

Barry Harris,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious time
In thinking such a thing could be
That you could ever care for me
I'm sure you hate to hear
That I adore you, dear
But grant me

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy to Love,1961
Barry Harris,"I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stood still

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Though not a single word was spoken
I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still

I took one look at you
That's all I meant to do
And then my heart stopped right there

My feet could step and walk
My lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still

Or was it yesterday?
I was rehearsing a speech,
Really, I think it's a peach!
Hope you don't think it's a breach

I mean I'm in a mess!

Longin' to tell you but, afraid and shy,
I'd let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'd leave me, off you would go in the mist of day

Barry Harris,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1969

And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.

Nearer your heart?

Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

Alone where we have walked together

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,2008
Barry Harris Trio,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,2008

The myst'ry of their fading light

Across the sand so I may keep

You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue

Barry Lloyd,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,

Stayed beneath my feet before.

In the heart of town?

Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

That I would rather be.

Because my gal had turned me down.
Then we met and you can bet
I knew from the first, you were my love,
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.
My heart really flew, the day you caught my eye.
I hope that we two will never say ""Good-bye.""
Clouds of gray have silver linings
When they reverse. I found your love
And that's when the old gray cloudburst.

Hey, baby
I'm gonna tell you 'bout your lovin'
And your kissn' and your huggin'
And your sweet turtle-dovin' pretty baby.
I won't be satisfied til I hear 'em play,
""Here comes the bride.""

Listen to me baby and I don't mean maybe.
Listen to my story, it's terrifficly true.
I gotta find a way of telling
You that I really go for you.
I hope you really believe me baby
'cause I certainly do.

'Cause you're thrillin' me, you're really,
Really thrilling when you tell me
That you probably got a kind of crush on me,
That moves me, grooves me.
How divine can one woman be?

Well little darlin', you got me fallin'.
You got me goofy and gay.
I'm gonna get carried away.
Just think, you're gonna be mine someday.

Oh, let's spin a little,
Park a little, stop a little,
Spark a little, live a little, love a little,
Maybe turtle-dove a little baby.
Every time you hold me so near,
Nobody loves me like you, dear.

Let's stop a little, squeeze a little,
Probably maybe tease a little,
Try a little, sigh a little,
Maybe have to cry a little bit,
'cause to tell you the truth,
I'm gonna love you and that's it.

'Cause I love you baby,
Love you baby, love you baby, love you baby,
With all my heart.
Oh, listen to me while I say I let
A lot little ladies get away

I know, pretty baby,
I know you're the one, yes you're the one.
I knew when I met you
What a break it was to get you.

When it's cloudy and gray and that's the worst.
How do you cause the cloud to burst?
You got to find a lover,
Find a lover, find a lover, find a lover.

If it's silvery under clouds of gray.
How do you chase the clouds away?
You gotta find a little girl
And make her love you a lot.
Don't ever leave unless you flip your
Lid and really want to ruin the plot.

Sounds easy does it?
Light as a breeze thru the trees.
Boy, how pleasant was it?
Pleasant as one summer day, boy.

It's so wonderful, what a love can do.
Look at what love has done for you.

And realized that you were my dish, babe

Though sometimes she talks like a fool
But she helps at the store in the holiday rush
And she picks up the kids after school
And she puts down the phone
When her husband comes home

And she changes from mother to wife
'Til she feels the words hanging between them
And she hangs by her words to her life

She says I swear I love my husband,
I love my kids
I wanted to be like my mother
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did
Oh there might have been time to be me
For myself, for myself

There's so many things that she wishes
She don't even know what she's missin'
And that's how she knows that she missed

She's a sweetheart, except when she's moody
It's hard to get through to her then
Depressed for a while
When the youngest was born
Oh but that happens now and again

She might take a drink with the housework
Or when Michael's kept late at the shop
A Martini or two before dinner
But she always knows when to stop

She says I swear I love my husband
And I love my kids
You know I wanted to be like my mother
But if I hadn't done it as soon as I did

Now it's seldom if ever they go
Once you've paid for the sitter
And parkin' the car
There's no money left for the show

When a glass fell and broke on the tile
And she cut her wrist (quite by mistake)
It was real touch and go for a while

You know I wanted to be like my, my mother

There's a reason to stay together

Night after night The two of us 
Convinced that it's right, hiding the yawns 
Somehow getting along together 

Afraid we'd always be alone 
We made a home that we could always share 
Just to know that someone would be there 
Even if we never learned to care

Wasn't finding inspiration in my bed.
I was wondering if all this was a warning,

I appreciate you offering me yours,
But I got to use my own and let it guide me.
It's the only thing to get me home for sure.

Let's hear some good news for the lady.
She's coming out from far behind
And if she seems a little slow,
It only goes to show
That everything will grow in its own time

Well I haven't really lost my sense of humor;
(say) it all depends on where you're coming from.
But I would tend to give some credence to the rumor
That this bird in flight just might be on the run.

Let's hear some good news for the lady.
She's coming out from far behind.
So if she seems a little slow,
It only goes to show
That everything will grow in its own time

I sort of hope you'll understand (that I've been there before)
That I can't always join the band you want
And if I hide behind the words I'm saying,
Don't let it fool you; you're not comin' through.

I need some good news for my lady.
She's coming up and wants to shine.
So if she needs the time to pause,

Barry Manilow,"Got dust on my piano
And dishes in the sink
Your side of the bed is cold
I haven't slept a wink
So I read your goodbye letter
To the face inside my drink
Lay me down and roll me out to sea

Got your picture in my wallet
And some pictures in my mind
A pocketful of memories
I never thought I'd find
And it's rainin' like a Monday
And the world seems so unkind
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

Lay me down, roll me out to sea
Calling on a mighty wave to cover me
Lay me down
Roll me out to sea
Heaven, if you're ready shine your light on me

Now listen to my story
Cause I haven't told it all
I saw her with her new love
She turned to me and called
When they asked, ""How ya' doing?""
I could crumbled like a wall
So lay me down and roll me out to sea

While making love in some hotel
I am a part of you

You'll never know my name

I am the strings that enter softly
Or three guitars that glitter gold
I am the thousand trumpet lines

Intended eyes,
The way to get a dying record sold
I never ride the road
I never play around
I played what they set down

I'm a working musician
Living from week to week
I'm the voice through each empty men
Tried to speak
A studio musician
Blowin' the chance I see

And when the woodwind coushing rises
I start to dream
With the low brass bed
But I awake the horns

I'm a man of the moment

I think we're losing touch

Who had ever guessed, that we could fall
After all the things we had in common
Where they too common after all?

And I like what I said, and I liked what I heard
And I started to think, I could think about starting again

We where laughing again over memories and wine
And the years in between didn't seem along time
When I smile she knew why in awhile it was starting again

And I started to think, I could feel again
All the bad times seemed unreal
When she looked in my eyes
The cheating, the lies, the things that were wrong seem far behind

Then I started to think, I could care again
And my fears all disappeared
When she called me by name, I knew that she changed
The flaws were all gone, the saint remained

But it started again when I asked her to stay
And she said there's this friend who's in town just for today
And she really felt bad but she had to be leavin' again

And she left me again as she left me before
Still pretending she cared when we kissed at the door
But I saw in her eyes that the lies were all starting again

Just when I'd started to feel again
When all the bad times seemed unreal
When it all seemed so right
And I tough that tonight if she said she cared

She really might just when my fears disappeared again
And I heard what I wanted to hear it all started again

Now, I've got the time to know you better

Some of my devils upped and left me free
To find a quite space
I'm not as out of place

I'm not as lonely as I was before
I don't go [Incomprehensible] there's an open door to leave by
I'm starting to believe my own existence
Has a right to be

And I'm coming home again

And I can't remember why I went away
But it's looking now like maybe I can stay

The poets cry for dreams they never saw
The only certainty is nothing sure
And nothing stays the same
Go back where they came

And though my answers are still undefined
By taking chances, I can start to find some reasons
Something to believe that I can make it through
I can make it through

And I'm coming home again

Hey what went wrong

Barry Manilow,"We're goin' hoppin', we're goin' hoppin' today
Where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way
We're gonna drop in on all the music they play
On the bandstand (bandstand)

We're goin' swingin', we're gonna swing in the crowd
And we'll be clingin' and floatin' high as a cloud
The phones are ringin', my mom and dad are so proud
I'm on bandstand (bandstand)

And I'll jump and hey, I may even show 'em my handstand
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American bandstand
When we dance real slow I'll show all the guys in the grandstand
What a swinger I am, I am on American bandstand

We're goin' hoppin', we're goin' hoppin' today
Where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way
We're gonna drop in on all the music they play

Bandstand, bandstand, bandstand
Bandstand, bandstand, bandstand

Hey I'm makin' my mark, gee, this joint is jumpin'
They made such a fuss just to see us arrive
Hey it's Mr.Dick Clark, what a place you've got here
Swell spot, the music's hot here, best in the east
Give it at least a seventy five

Now for all you Joe's, here goes my American handstand
Because I'm on, because I'm on the American bandstand
As we dance real slow, I'm showin' the guys on the grandstand
That I like my girl but I love American bandstand

The singers' croonin', he ain't the greatest but gee
My baby's swoonin' in front of all of TV
So if you tune in, you'll see my baby and me
On the bandstand (bandstand)

And now we're hoppin' and we'll be hoppin' all day
Where things are poppin' the Philadelphia way
And you can drop in on all the music they play
On the bandstand

And we'll rock and roll and stroll on American
Lindy hop and slop, it's American
Tune in, I'm on, turn on, I'm in, I'm on
Today, bandstand",Bandstand Boogie,1978
Barry Manilow,"You know I can't smile without you
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing
I'm finding it hard to do anything
You see I feel sad when you're sad
I feel glad when you're glad
If you only knew what I'm going through
I just can't smile without you

You came along just like a song
And brighten my day
Who would have believed that you where part of a dream
Now it all seems light years away

And now you know I can't smile without you

Barry Manilow,"Even now when there's someone else who cares
When there's someone home who's waiting just for me
Even now I think about you as I'm climbin' up the stairs
And I wonder what to do so she won't see

That even now when I know it wasn't right
And I've found a better life than what we had
Even now I wake up cryin' in the middle of the night
And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad

Even now when I have come so far
I wonder where you are, I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now when I come shining through, I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew, even now

Even now when I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone
Even now I still remember and the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on, even now

Even now when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you and God, I wish you knew
Somehow, even now",Even Now,1978
Barry Manilow,"There you are, lookin' just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am, close to gettin' tangled up inside the thought of you
Do you love him as much as I love her?
And will that love be strong when old feelings start to stir?

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

Love's so strange, playin' hide and seek with hearts and always hurtin'
We're the fools standin' close enough to touch those burnin' memories
And if I hold you for the sake of all those times love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

Whoa, no, we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

It's all going by us too fast
Oh, why don't we try a slow dance
And maybe this moment will last

All night long we've been dancing
Dancing too far away
All night long I've been waiting for them to play
A slow dance

Why don't we try a slow dance
Before it all comes to a close
We'll see how it feels
And see where the feelings goes
Oh, why don't we try a slow dance
And then who knows

Barry Manilow,"Her name is Bobbie Lee and she's movin'
She's gotta make her dream come true
Some might said she took a dead wrong turn
But she took the only road she knew
There's nothin' gonna stop or stall her
And luck is on her side tonight
They're pullin' over to the curb to call her
Man, she loves these city lights

She says
So what's the difference
I gotta live
I gotta be somebody
And I wanna go where the apples grow
And all I need is the money
Hey mister, smile and buy my time
And I don't want you fillin' funny
Just think of Bonnie Lee like a busy bee
Gettin' by by sellin' honey

She's got this picture of her brother
That she took when she left home
She rolled her hair up like her mother
With her mother's ivory comb
She was sweet sixteen last Easter
But she know how to treat you right
Tomorrow she's gonna be in the movies
But she won't forget tonight

She says
So what's the difference
I gotta live
I gotta be somebody
I wanna go where the apples grow
And all that I need is the money
Hey mister, smile and buy my time
And I don't want you feelin' funny
You just think of Bobbie Lee like a busy bee
Gettin' by by sellin honey

So what's the difference
I gotta live
I gotta be somebody
I gotta go where the apples grow
And all I need is the money

And I don't want you feelin' funny
You just keep thinking of Bobbie Lee like that busy, busy bee
Gettin' by by sellin honey

But all I say is, ""Leave me in the gloom"" 
And here I stay within my lonely room 
'Cause

I don't want to walk without you, Baby 
Walk without my arm about you, Baby

I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind

And the dogs played around on the sand
Winter cold cut the air, hangin' still everywhere
Dressed in gray, did he say, ""Hold my hand""
I said, ""Love's easier when it's far away""
We sat and watched a distant light

We're two ships that pass in the night
We both smile and we say, ""It's alright""
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight
Like those ships that pass in the night

There's a boat on the line where the sea meets the sky
There's another that rides far behind
And it seems you and I are like strangers a wide ways apart
As we drift on through time
He said, ""It's harder now we're far away""
We only read you when you write

We're two ships that pass in the night
And we smile when we say it's alright
We're still here, it's just that we're out of sight

A fine day to fly balloons or tell him a story 
Hand in his hand to wonder 
Till day is done

Sundays are theirs to explore 
Alone by law 
One day to keep the two from turning to strangers, 
One to know the answers 
Be firm, be fun

The father weaves through the weekend streets 
Sunday alone, Monday comin´on 
He leaves the child by a modest home 
That they share no more 
With the woman who waits indoors 
Till she knows he's gone

Newspaper says to look for rain today
No one around for company
And so I turn to memories to pass the time away

Seems as it was untouched by time
I can't recall quite all the names
Each one is precious all the same
How strange to think
How many friends were lost somewhere behind

Where are they now
How I miss those companions
Who walked the canyons of the night
By my side
Where are they now
Like so many crazy dancers
We live only for the answers in a song
But that was long ago
Where are they now
When love was new and wonderful
There was no word impossible
The future we saw with our minds
Was something of our hearts design
Between today and yesterday
Life came between us all

And the milkman he smiles
