Big Rich,"I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now
You're gonna wanna hold me 
Just like I always told you 
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Nobody here will ever find me
But I always be around
Just like the songs I leave behind me
I'm gonna live forever now

You fathers and you mothers 
Be good to one another
Please try to raise your children right
Don't let the darkness take 'em
Don't make 'em feel forsaken
Just lead them safely to the light
When this old world has blown asunder
And all the stars from fall this sky
Remember someone really loves you
We'll live forever you and I

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now 

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now

I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna catch tomorrow now

I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever now
I'm gonna live forever now

Big ROCC,"[ verse 1: mc ren ]
Niggas in the hood lookin at me crazy
Tellin niggas like they wanna fuck my old lady
Same fuckin shit every day at 8 o'clock
Nigga, start my day off raisin off the cock
I throw the khakis on, with the t-shirt
Never knowin when a nigga might hit the dirt
I'm thinkin, how in the fuck can I get high quicker
Mix the blunt with some muthafuckin malt liquor
These niggas that I love, I don't trust em, but I stay close to em
In case I gotta do em
We from the same set, but that don't mean shit no mo'
I be premeditatin with the .44 (.44)
My hoe be tellin a nigga to peel they caps back
Cause I know where them niggas hide they shit at
Shit be on my mind, return a shot call
Broke as fuck, it's about to get hot, y'all

[ chorus: big rocc ]
Niggas starvin while you're home with the mills
Niggas killin while you're doin dope deals
Out flossin, throwin 100 $ bills
Time to set yo ass up for the kill
Death of a shot caller, who can you trust?
It might be your number 1 nigga that bust
A cap, he's the next one to take charge
Smoke him and his bitch in his backyard

[ verse 2: mc ren ]
A nigga's sittin on the curb
Hear that nigga come bumpin with the suburb
Got my niggas on point, same niggas he be fuckin hoes with
And rollin up the blunts when he wanna get lit
Homie, when that nigga put the mutahfucka in park?
That's the signal, little nigga, pump 3 in his heart
Don't feel shit, cause it's real shit, he a bitch
Niggas in the hood doin bad while he gettin rich
Off this shit we be killin niggas fo'
Can't make a move less this muthafucka say so
Nigga, fuck that, I'm runnin this shit
I'ma look him in his eyes when his punk-ass gettin hit
But if you miss, nigga, I'ma kill you
Cause if he get away, muthafucka, then we all through
Fuck 3 shots, nigga, add 2
And handle what the fuck you gotta do
Kill the shot caller

Man, you know we been smokin niggas for this muthafucka
This nigga ain't paid us shit, man
(I know, dog)
Hold up, hold up, hold up, dog
Man, gimme the gat, I - damn
Hey nigga, you got my muthafuckin money?
Nigga, fuck yo money, nigga
No nigga, fuck you
( *shots* )
Oh shit, oh shit...
Damn!

[ verse 3: tha chill ]
These o.g.'s got me twisted like twizzler
Got me heated and hot, and all I'm thinkin is killin ya
Peelin ya cap back, like starter, fool
I'm comin to get you niggas off my block, so I pack a full
Glock with big slugs, and you know I buck no doubs
Cause you know a nigga steelo, how I did them fools a week ago
One week passed, I'm hearin you wanna wet us
When you see ren, rocc, tha chill, you're puttin on the jetters
What the fuck? these niggas tryin to bust on me?
So I'm cockin up the can and ready to make them do some gas
And do some flippin, and all that
Cause niggas out here shot call, get they ass jacked
And that's the main fact, big payback for you punk muthafucks
Disrespectin the crew, it's mandatory that I buck
Ass down from comptown, mr. shot caller
Gonna be a fast faller if he ain't a fast talker
Fast walker, or better yet better be a fast runner
Chill on the scope with the cannon, finna gun ya
Dumpin 9 to the gut like ""nigga, what? ""
This ol' b.g. big baller, fuck the muthafuckin shot caller

Big Ron,"I hear my poisons in the multitude
Why was I damned a human deemed too rude
Somewhere between the madness and my mind
I live with legions called the human kind

I wander aimlessly amongst the herd
Infesting shadows, I am undeterred
I give opinion cause you give no peace
They say we manifest the new disease

[Chorus]
My head explodes
My soul berates
Erratic bonds, 
They scar my face
I won't, exist
I won't, persist

I cast a weary gaze into the crowd
Ten thousand reasons dropped into my mouth
My theoretix can't begin to live
So I have nothing more than life to give

(Mr. Gzus)
It's a thrill to me that you niggas want to kill me
I think you all know this saga
They mad cause they wish they had the shit that I had
I'm fucking there babies moma
My soldiers salute with their guns high
Aim and they'll shoot you with one try
I never understood why, niggas snitch and bitches lie
How a motherfucker gonna testify
When he's doing the same shit that I'm doing?
Yap to the feds for a little bit of bread
Now The whole fucking game is ruined
A lot of these niggas are two faced
They need to use glue for they tooth paste
They better strap up or get their boots laced
Or get victim of a 44 shell case
Your bitch said she like the way my dick taste
Now the hoe back up in your face
To the rules of the game you're a disgrace
Never trust no bitch in the first place
Me and Big Sco came to blast these hoes'
Who can't keep shit on the hush
When we come, guns bust
Ruckus hit the dust, it's only us

Chorus:

(Big Sco)
These niggas want drama?
Who the fuck these busta testing
Bout to teach em a lesson, when I get to blesson
Wit the motherfucking smith & wesson
No question let me make one suggestion
Don't fuck around with a nigga that you can't fuck with
Cause I buck quick what's wrong dog?
You mad at me cause your bitch suck dick
Just duck quick cause when I let that thing off
When I break it off ring it off it's over with
Busting nuts I'm all over the shoulder shit
You can't fuck with a nigga y'all know this shit is on
Some popo shit but when it comes to me I don't know no shit
You got to go bitch gotta find a big ditch for a bitch snitch
Hit the nigga with 6 in the mix
Ima fix the mother fucker cause he a big bitch
Swiftly hit the nigga with the fifty caliber
Challenger, I'm a damage ya, you a amateur
I got stamina, kill a nigga put it on camera
Fuck around I'll have to handle ya, dismantle ya, ha
This what I do to a enemy
Split a motherfuckers head like Kennedy
Fuck y'all, don't you know its ten of me
So don't pretend to be no friend to me
Big guns those things are like kin to me
Simply I bust and the ones I can't touch
Well put it like this, them bitches get fucked, my dick get sucked
y'all can't fuck with us
Listen you don't want to bang with me hang with me

That have accepted of the mission of improbable, 
To become some particle, purged
By the discourage of suffering, 
Anger, hate, religions and war, 
It's tough to explain, debate, 
Or even explore, but I die
Straight to the core,
And explosion of introspect so quiet, 
He can definitely, yet he can breath 
Into the sins lounges into the most tempered thug,

'Tis a bull that has been through the mud 
With a point of the head of a heavy weight,

Reality of the butcher trap to the grand Negro's flights 
Of fancy from the abstract mind of a hip hop super nerd, 
As long as the truth is heard, 
The truth must be spoken, 
My youth has been smokin' and drankin', 
drankin' and smokin', 
A life like that may seem right, but 
That ain't what the seem like, 
We ain't tight unless y'all tight, 
Might bless me and all types, 
The goal is for all grown-ups to be sat upon by true kings

All pretenders must fall into the phantoms of they own character fall, 
But as long as we attempt to tell ourselves, 
We are not free 

All in once say it, Bubba K now, 
Here to doubt, where's today?
On the Grey Hound, sittin' 
In the back on top close to 8 pounds,
Run for a innocent town that I can shake down,
Passed the Mississippi, I swim in the great lakes now, 
Made it this far, but I still can't escape now, 
Law ran in, back in the A town, 
And all I'm worth is all that ain't found, 
My brother in Denver used to do a lil dirt, 
Maybe move with him, I can do a lil' work, can't produce a walk, 
I do a lil smirk, shop at Wal-Mart, I do shoes and a shirt, 
Tried to call mama, she denied the call, 
She ain't smoke the shit I provide for y'all
Try to doze of with PM Tylenol, just move a lil piece, can't smile it off, 

Y'all ain't free, Not yet free, 
Not yet free, Not yet free

Continuing my voyage, in the Colorado, 
Can't live life with my Doraldo,
This pill is hard for you to swallow, 
This pig shit in which for you to wallow, 
I'm posted up here, at least until tomorrow, 
Get a pound of Buffalo Nik's that you can swallow
Only thing I'm holdin' is pain, 
You can borrow, a whole pocket of change,
For your sorrow, Lotta Kat'z busted, but they can't find the hop,

Playing field where the main team kill bodies
And wannabe John Gottis shoulda been Zulu
But who knew but too few in my crew

And the rest didn't listen now some of the best is missing
Some of the rest is dissing, some of your chest is missing
Some of your views is changing, but none of your time remaining
It's a goddam shame a lot of fake niggas claim heaven sent

But me, I'm hell bent on destruction of the mass constructions
Of the mass destruction, of my ass restructuring
Of the past reflecting off the last injection

Love looks like you
What does love love feel like?
Love feels like this
What does love smell like?
Love smells like us

What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again
Why, must we fly so low?
Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love
Open up you flower please let me taste your love
Honeysuckle sweet, can't stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue
Hitting every spot of you, what you gonna do
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room
Up and down it seems to go
Oh my god I think I'm bout to explode

Stank love, stank love, stank love, stank love

My fingertips scan flesh so supple
No longer a couple like two in one skin
Where do you end and where do I begin
Both brains become one mind sensually
Every nerve becoming it's own individual entity
With its own lusts, it's own needs to serve
Longing for the love of all the other nevers
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction
In the burning chill of please we bathe
Engulfing, encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave
Of an impact so deep, but not one of destruction
But of creation, elation in the re-making
No taking in the relation, no taking in the relation
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love

The future is now
Time and space are one in the same

Enough time in space and we running the game
Almost is unacceptable
The cosmos is a receptacle
For the spectacle of my ascension

Inhabiting multiple dimensions of perspective
All my actions selective
At all costs, I must obtain the objective
Regain the inception intended at the conception

Bring forth the four horsemen, brotherhood is a fortress
Strong protection but the raw selection leaves your voice choiceless

5 in the morning, wide and yawning, can't turn my beat up
On the way to a bopper with a crib that I kick my feet up
See the candy was shining, freshly priming, first time I seen her
Now she wanna ride high with her head in the sky look down on all her people
Ain't it crazy how pavement be cracking when I'm slabbing them 'bows
Hoes go to jump in and can't find the handles on my doors
So much twerking and working in here, I should install a pole
For them strippers that love to suck and fuck and get, get down on the floor
Transformers can't fuck with this, not the way my doors flip
Skyscraper tall when I creep and crawl, is that Krit or a solar eclipse
Rise of the apes in my trunk, while my chariot swang down

Said she wanna ride with a pimp, wanna get that dick that she deserves
Said my back seat softer than a pillow top, paint so wet that it hit the spot
And I'ma quench ya thirst, that little nigga should've did it first
You was holding hands and I was in her purse
I'm getting throwed up under city lights
She right side checking lipstick, tryna make sure that her titties right
We in the parking lot with the trunk open and sipping
Sitting outside the whip with the wood grain wheel like it's 1996
Yea trick I'm riding dirty, Big Sant bitch I know you heard me
Tryna get the 'Lac with the '84s, tag just gon' say “beg for mercy”

Drip the drape with that chuck it stitching and 4s and vogues so I feel right
Candy paint on that body mane, chrome the grill and that woman
Them belts and bucks and 5th wheel on the trunk, you'll hear beat knock when I'm coming
That bass so hard that it's numbing, that chrome so shiny it's blinding
Them seats so soft that I'm sinking in and so it's no need to recline 'em
I drop the top and you see me, got different shit on each TV
Got one with Sopranos, one with The Wire, the one up front is Boardwalk Empire
Wood grain wheel so goddamn new, that sap come out when I grip it

Come on y'all and feel the groove 
Get on down and make your move 
Welcome to the funkiest 
Brooklyn style, laid out like this 

I kicks the flavor good, to represent the neighborhood 
where I come from, and that's the place of Brooklyn 
where the grimies are born and bred 
And bullets are like eyeballs, two to the head 

Well is it Brownsville? Time to represent for the map 
where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps 
The party addict about to explode 
From the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code 

Parlayin' on the corner, drinkin' 40's shootin' cee-lo 
It's a Brooklyn thing, alright? You know our steelo 
And for those who just don't know how it go 
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know 

So yo, who want to set it? You better kick your best G 
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me 
I represent for the fo' main 
And if you're not a booty bandit, then niggaz can't hang 

[Chorus] 

Now, let's get straight down to the point 
I represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin' it to 
Makin' a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget 
where you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not 

and front with what you got 
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real 
What type of mission can I say you on? 
Because you must of done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh 

I'm really happy to see you blew up 
But always remember my man you grew up 
in the PJ's all your life, in a broken home 
(Well alright now) 

Up in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT! 
I be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover 
Bonafied black brother, word to the mother 
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made 

the man with support and always stayed a fan 
My dialectic style is perfected 
in ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted 

Funk'll slam like a doper jam, pops 
I'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam 
So check out the asiatic type of flow 
like water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style 

[Chorus] 

Yo, this is Big Scoob, no practice 
I'm flippin on niggaz like little kids on that mattress 
You know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's 
My lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's 

So hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin' 
My boys in the back, clockin' your jewels, and they scheamin' 
Why did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow 
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile 

No need for beef chief I'm rollin' mad deep 
So pick up your teeth, I got him shakin' like a leaf 
Not tryin to scare you, I just want to aware you 
I bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you 

Yo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these 
while you're guardin' your grill, I'll be beatin' up your kidneys 
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9's 
with my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines 

Where I'm from there's no need for hesitation 
We cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient? 
He's drippin' blood and now he's down to his last breath 
But he won't make it, cause he knows that my joint is def 

The ill, type of Brooklyn artist 
who rocks the har-dest, regard-less 
who you know and where you're from I pull your file

Hey yo, drop it like it's hot, scoob, drop it like it's hot
Pick up your microphone, it's time to rock the spot

Oh my god, tell me, is it really him?
The legendary lyricist makin' matters grim?)
Because when I start to flow the results are so deadly
Rappers start shakin' like the legs on Elvis Presley
Sayin' (it's him, the great) that's how I intimidate
But I just came to get my shit off, so I give them a break
And pickin' up the microphone after I left
Is like givin' mouth-to-mouth to a corpse, a waste of breath
In other words, I don't leave no remains for you
(Forget the men, that's the evil that kane'll do)
I bring it raw, gee, too hardcore, gee
The only way you could fuck with me is in a orgy
The magnificent, none can come swifter than
Cool as, but my skin color is different
We got the milk and honey
My rhymes are just like Abraham Lincoln's face (on the money)
Makin me freshest on the land, but let's not forget
That if I rapped under water they'd be aquafresh
The best, oh yes, I guess (wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
You said that shit in '88)
Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate
And regulate chumps and set em straight
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours
The source to the force, so put it on pause
The one that assures applause, never took a loss
Stronger than some olde e quarts to a can of coors
In other words it's hazardous to your health
So don't do it to yourself

Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not

Don't do it to yourself, don't do it
Yo, you better not do it, you better not

(Stop right there, you better freeze, cease
Don't make me put my timberland boot to your grill piece
Big scoob from brooklyn comin through, don't start me
Don't make me turn your jam into a tec-9 party)

Hey yo, what in the world would ever possess you
To think that you could touch me
Or even try to come above me
Or even think that you could flow this lovely?
Nobody, and I mean nobody on this whole planet can stand it
I rip it apart, and flip up the art cause I'm the best, damn it
I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me
(Step to the Kane) and get bagged just like grocery
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em
With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel
And I got hemorrhoids from shittin' on so many people
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)
The chocolate city for black Cesar incorporated
(and all of the soft get faded)
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than special ed
Cause trust me, kid, it ain't like goin' against anyone else
I'm tellin' you, don't do it to yourself

Don't do it to yourself, don't do it

The others gotta try to survive, doin' the evil 
That men do, peace to every hood that I been through 
I even got love for my homies in South Central 
But to the East my brother, 'cause that's where I stay at 
Runnin' through the streets like a stray cat 
Like that Good Times show it makes me go

Up in the projects, it gets no iller
With true guerillas, and stone cold killers 
It seems that every night, you get to hear the fireworks

Are we gonna shoot some cee-lo, or play a game of craps? 
Matter fact, Shane, ring the intercom 
And see if you can get ten dollars from my moms 
Tell her to throw it out the window if she got it to spare 
'Cause the elevator's broke, and I ain't checkin' for the stairs 
And do me a solid, run to the store shorty 
And pick me up some Olde E, but not a 40 
Just a two-two of brew will do, so I can knock it out fast 
To make the coldness last 

And while you at man see where'd your friend go (word) 
He shoulda been back a hour ago with the indo (yeah) 

And meet us in the back park to get sparked 
So I can be toasted by time it gets dark 
Ayo Jay, I see that bulge in the back of your jeans 
Hope that's the God you Now, know what I mean? 
'Cause if somebody brings the noise, I'ma make it a silent movie 
So take the safety off the toolie 
'Cause I don't want no beef, nah baby
The only thing I want to do is parlay
Peace and harmony is what I relate to

Just like SWV you was Right Here 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we in there 
From all thugs that flex with all the muscle 
Down to the brothers, that got a swift hustle 
Like good golly Miss Three Card Molly, a neat trick 
Where people get beat quick 
Want to see a sweet vic? 

Jackety Jack, blackety black 
You get nuttin' back, and that's a fact 
The sweetest game I ever seen 
All you gotta do is find the red queen 
Just point to it, can anybody point to it?

The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eatin me up, you fast fuckin with jigga

Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a FLICK, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
she says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame

To the whole rap world rhythm nation
And take a taste of this verbal vibration
With more color than you see on animation
And bear witness to my smooth operation
As I give the party people a sensation
And give them all a good feel of jubilation
Me and the mic become a good combination
To rock the house without any complication
The crowd'll give the Kane a standing ovation
That just gives me even more motivation
To pick up the pace and give you more fascination
With the ryhmes in my rap creation
They show the power of the Kane's innovation
And create an extravagant inspiration

For publicity to artist relation
And Rushtown for a great three-year duration
And Carol Lewis for the tour preparation
And Farrakhan for the righteous conversations

It seems you need a little bit of dictation
But what I'ma do for you in this situation
Is supply a process of elimination
Serve justice by means of termination
Because a biter only brings aggravation
A lotta trouble and a lotta frustration
So here's a little bit of useful information
So that you can see some acceleration
It's gonna take hard work and concentration

Write a couple songs and live forever in your pictures
Pick another fight before the kick us out the exit

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn

If you got on $5 underwear

The Cyclops, X-Men, for you dumber kids

Still pull the thickest chick in the sickest denim
Then I spit this venom, like Eddie Brock does
Had the crowd raising eyebrows like The Rock does
Blood, Cuhs, it's all in the same gang
Just brothers in different colors, we need to change things
And this is Strange gang, talking 'bout my chain again
Mine's fine, I got it shined by my Asian friend
At the swap meet in the wrong hood
I'm the bad member but still make the song good
Good enough they had to sign me, better ask Trav

Hearing people scream and shout (""OH MY GOD HE'S GOT A GUN!!"")
'Cause they run their mouth, 
they throwing this tongue about like having some candy clout (It's negros, we better run)
He'on't want (he'ont want it)
He'on't need it (he'on't need it)
If they try to put a case on this, we gon' beat it (we gon' beat it)
Interrupted a groovy movie, so we said fuck it left it and ate at Ruby Tuesday's
Snotty white waitress said sorry, I'm so blunt
One of the homies singing YG's ""Fuck Donald Trump""
And she said ""Fuck Obama""
And we said ""Fuck yo mama""
And your granny too, 'cause we would never touch your nana, bitch
Manager say we gotta leave
Not before I get a shot, I get it then I appease
And he said ""No""
So I got somebody shot off the bar quick, lifted it up and said 
""Here's to you sucking my dick""

Walk up in the party with our guns drawn
Might just leave a body on your front lawn

I have no tolerance for nonsense, get away from me
Me wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin' me

And I'm that way cause back in

Wanna pick a fight because he's sorry
That he ain't Gotti, like I be, cause he

But I make moves and I paid dues and I got common sense

I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Kneeled at the throne, but can’t get on, so I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need, I hope it's comin' quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane that's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, my life has changed and I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down, it feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in, I gets emotional
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy, on some real shit
Won't be defeated if I'm heated, nigga, oh shit!

Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I peep 'em out, try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin' out
Emotions get the best of me, messed up
And then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me, cause I'm always sick
And I can't let it be, pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me, I need depakote
Just to cope, while I keep throwin' them pills down my throat
Dysfunctional blunts will do Smokin' Bombay
Can give me Fung Shui, but I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me

It sounds like they wanna claim KC king
They can't advance in this game cause they weakling
When in the trap making penis that can't see things
Like me at marina grog and galey mane feasting
Party of 70 at the (fogo da'chao)
You niggas small time, me and travis mobilin' now
Holding us down almost everybody know what it sounds of
Tecca nina despite the hate you be throwing around
From now on they will not talk nay talk
And they family won't have to walk cross grave moss
I'm the king it because I mob boss pay cost
I pro ball on em they rock chalk Jayhawk
So bow down cause the king gets hyphy
If you slight me ain't no stopping the nina the almighty
Don't you see the snake and bat shining brightly

Bass ackwards, synonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming maintaining that they factors
When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I shook this place and had to find some space
I killed one of these rap niggas and ate they fucking face
Outta place in this rap game, biggest mistake I ever made
Hit rewind and de-line, deleting everything I layed
Far from a rap nigga, I don’t lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Nina called the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this ain’t 'bout dope?
Bass Ackwards

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
It's funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back order
Flip you ass backwards

What would I do besides grind for them paper stacks?
That's the only way i know to get a Cadillac
See, I refuse to live this life broke another day
All I know is hard work accumulating pay
A never ending saga this the true hustler's ballet
I done tossed more blue cheese than a cobb salad
That paper calling me I answer on the first ring
Championship work ethic, tryna chase a ring
They told me I would never make it but I didn't listen
It ain't my fault that they failed to see God's vision
Worldwide globe-trotter, stacking up commission
And if I knew better, I'd do better please pray for wisdom

But a fucked up move makes moves lesser
I was in it for them bands with the grams measure
Got fucked up dealing with a cool jeffer
But that's my fault
Behind enemy lines I'm gettin' work off
Bitches toast, head hard or soft?
And I'm flamed up talkin' that turf talk
They was comin' for me, couldn't stand that
The two spots upstairs, I ran that
Had foots in [?], they sent us helpers
We movin' metals couldn't plan that
But I man the station despite the hatin'
No fabrication in this conversation
Boogie blazin', a trail of greatness
No time for patience, that's time wasted
Good gracious, my good race and them fiends chasin' that fire blood
Bold statement, I rocked, skated, and bounced the products on my blood

Livin' like the heater huntin' freedom, but it costs
Seekin' out the preacher, but the preacher teachin' false
May be on my feet, now I'm creepin' through the moss
Hoping I ain't lost, man, time can't be bought
So it's tickin' and it's tickin' and I'm try'na turn it off
Ain't dreams on the cross cause they seem to get lost
Any schemes to be boast? Any greed will exhaust
And I'm muh'fuckin' tired, I ain't muh'fuckin' lyin
When I'm muh'fuckin' dyin', better muh'fuckin' grind

So I push a hard line on these bitches all the time
I'll treat you like a bitch, nigga, and beat you from behind
I'ma keep you lookin' fine, I'ma keep you wined and dined
Not a pimp, I'm a pusher, I'm a creature of the grind
I'm a block boy with a life tied to a scale
Built to excel, can't hear the word fail
I'ma savage for the cabbage, I'm to greedy for the kale
And I always work a package like I'm workin' for the mail
Barely missing jail, life lost to a cell
But I'd rather be in prison than be wallowing in Hell
Pray to God for a different route, open up and let me out

All by my lonely, the way I was taught
Continue this run until I get off
Live by the gun, and die by the yawk
One thing for certain: we all gonna die
We all got it coming so take it in stride
But this one is painful, it's hurting inside
I miss you my nigga, I'm tryna stop crying
No healing with time, no needing me lying
They say it gets better, I'll never be fine
I'm losing my mind a piece at a time
It's dark and it's lonely and nowhere to hide

Here today and gone tomorrow
Losing only's filled with sorrow
Living out this liquor bottle
How much longer 'fore I follow?

How much longer 'fore I follow?
One day you'll look up (true) and I'll be gone (gone)
I've been blessed to live this long
These city streets getting colder
And I'm getting older
Gotta get my mind right, yeah

Niggas die every day
Still I think about the time when it might be me next
Still tripping on the daily
When it came so real, niggas ain't been the same since
Still I gotta find a way
To hide the pain that I feel, make ya wanna take a nigga face
Put his mouth on the AK, then I let it flame, leaded pain, nigga bang 'til he thrown away
But I gotta think smarter
Cuz shit gets a little bit harder
Gotta be there for my son, gotta be there for the winning, gotta be the one that feeling for my daughters
Cuz we living in a way
If you get caught slipping, nigga, might be your last day
So you better think twice when you run up on a nigga with the milli that'll hit you like Pompeii
For this, I miss, my niggas, my sorrows I drench
I hit the hemp, drink a fifth, while pumping my grip
I wish that this was it, but still I persist
With a bunch of niggas coming from the gutter
Got 'em running for the cover when I hit 'em with the shit

Don't get too used to this (you might)

Even though she owe for two nights of flat-back fuckin'
If you lookin' for me, you can find me where the bar's at
Intoxicated, inebriated, don't know where the car's at
I started drinkin' 'fore I came here tonight
Blazin' blunts back to back, so I came feelin' right
Lookin' for the right chick to put this thing in her life
And if a nigga wanna trip, it ain't a thing, we can fight
We can party, we can fuck, or we can kick it
Or we can tear this motherfucker up, you dig it?
Either way, it don't matter, 'cause I'm with it
I'm beating something the fuck down, do you get it?

No tellin' man, I'm drunk as fuck, that's how I gets down
And I'm about to fight or fuck, after this next round
Big fella like a monster truck, be knockin' shit down
They hate it when my villains is deep, and we in the building
We keep 'em deep in their feelings

The whisky make me ruder, so I'ma blame it on the liquor

I'm sippin' Bailey's, plus the Rémy try'na creep up on

Another shot, let me get the mob up in the b-b-block and
We put her puffin, plus I'm countin' on them panties droppin'
But don't mistake me, fake me, 'cause I'm mackin'
I grip the milli, really, peel it back and
More than a rap song, bubble on my Motorola

They got the axe on 'em, tippy on my tippy toes
They got the max on their backs, out to get you gone

Everybody, anybody, they can get it man
Judgmental, you can judge me, just don't try to fuck me
Shit get ugly for this money, blood, really trust me
I done seen it, I done done it, I done played the game
I'm older now, so I tried to find another lane
But every now again, the devil creeps inside again
The voices make my choices and reminds me just what violence is
Rubbing on my callouses, slamming liquor, dial it in
Switching on the heathen for the evening, blood I'm diving in
Rolling in the Taurus, gripping on my Taurus
Seventeen with the bean, headfirst I'm a Taurus
Windows heavy tinted making sure they never saw us

No pulling back, it's set in motion rolling downhill
My niggas hungry, ain't no paper shaking round here
Won't think about it, niggas bout it so we all in
You gotta get it how you live it, blood, tag me in
A murder mission, the money's coming, my motivation
No getting distant, no running from me, my situation
The underbelly, the fucking gutter's my preparation
So run it nigga, I'm greedy needing the explanation
I ain't sleeping, I'm sleep deprived and deprivation
Pouring whiskey, I'm pissy, the only way to face it
In the basement I'm hanging plastic, this shit is drastic
Like a movie but real and ain't nobody acting
I only laugh to keep from crying, keep a clear mind
I'm built for it by design, it's a filthy grind
On my soul I ain't whole, got a debt to pay
And Lord knows that I owe when I step away

I'm walkin' the line

Heavy head as I sit and write, my mental scattered everywhere
My thoughts are all jumbled up, a cluster fuck, in despair
My life is such a bitch to bare, the smoke seems to never clear
Takin' calls, helpin' y'all, but when I fall, nobody's there
They tell me life ain't ever fair, tell me that my heart is rare
Tell me how I'm livin' is forgiven if I practice prayer
Wishin' I was unaware, livin' life without a care
Rollin' through the hills on bad wheels, I ain't got a spare
Fightin' but I'm ill prepared, a titan tryin' to hold my square
Enlightened, kinda frightened with the sights as I become aware
Hold the elevator, second thought, I'ma take the stairs
Struggle as I'm getting there, embrace the journey I ain't scared
What they sellin' I can't hear it, I'm rebellin' that's my spirit
Kinda groggy, not the clearest, pourin' whiskey, somethin' serious
A penny for my thoughts, then all these thoughts is bought
Continuing this walk, just hoping I ain't lost

Plant your feet and be a man
Liberty and justice for all like Mamma Yates say
""Niggas, we ain't fuckin' with y'all"" I'm hearin' them say
It's cool if you don't fuck with me
Just let me know what it's 'bout to be
So I can be the monster you devils make me out to be
My country 'tis of thee, we the brave and the free
But its clear that you lied to me in different times where we ain't free
From slave to the white house
Gettin' paid, then a nice house
You can stay, watch what you say, behave keep a tight mouth
You're opinion's one that's given, just be thankful how you livin'
But my soul ain't for sale, only God can do my biddin'
In the country built on violence, they surprised that you're violent
Just surprised how you hide it, and despise how we silent

I tell the truth like, ""Father forgive me, these are all my confessions""
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Who flip like confetti and then when you back they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get get petty, bitch don't give no dap to me nigga
Funny thing about talkin' behind my back
Is that it just keep comin' back to me nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me nigga
You mad at me, this ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night workin' after three
Man, this why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty
Man, the clique is the tightest, the pussy's the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just got it thank God that we got it, blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your profit we profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed (straight up)
I'm way up I feel blessed (straight up, straight up), way up I feel blessed

Look, I ain't gonna say that we back or nothin'
'Cause that implies that we're back from somethin'
If we're back from somethin' it's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothin' less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven bein' much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings from me and my niggas from the Six
Look at what we did
Yeah, be quiet I'm doin' a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit I swear y'all be doin' the most
Stop worryin' about whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worryin' less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need anymore press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doin' this shit, man

I'm here for a good time not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up I feel blessed, way up I feel blessed (straight up)

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every mornin' I'm up 'cause I can't let them down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align you do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm goin' over time on the overtime
Yeah I'm not invested but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never goin' anorexic
I pay my mortgage and electric
Never goin' under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checkin' off my check list
Try and blow my cake just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it’s only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart who, put it back together? (Aight)

I realized when it comes to girls
That chemistry means way more than anatomy
She mad at me, she been mad at me

I'm the livin' proof that you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece

So I'mma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'mma text the room number right now
So you ain't gotta hit the front desk and go ask for me

She been mad, I've been on the go, on a roll
On a roll more than a roller coaster
They can't throw me off track or slow
If I did, I got a long list of hoes on hoes
I quote unquote say I told you so
Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' that 520 like it's 420
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett, I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tucked in, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with

Executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You might be able to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I coulda put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choose him, that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, goin' ham in a rental
On my way, to Sacramento, late night, Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go home, listen
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I make a bitch stand outside forever like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my Styrofoam up, and pour some drank in my mouth

Say you want me to win, but hope I lose

I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seems like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til your unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
'Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying ""Hi Britney"" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line (The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like ""I got some hoes, hit me back""
Fuck it

Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya

You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I don't have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

Oh I could let you down

To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like ""ahhh""
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm care free with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how I'm with her I feel whole too
Go ahead, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he's on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't made it work

Look, no more interviews
I'm not talking about this on a song, feature or interlude
Reporting live from Hawaii with my girl
I brought sand to the beach
Working on vacay in the booth, sand on my feet
I'm from the ground up like a ground-ball play
I'm coming from the underground like it's Groundhog's Day
I'm talking so underground that when I talk about J, nigga
I might mean J Dilla, R.I.P. real niggas
Lately I only do the shit that inspire me
Lately niggas treat the Shade Room like a diary
Oh yeah, is that what you heard?
Believing everything that you hear without confirming it first
And you know the funny thing about it is my ex wanna write a tell all
Fucked up thing about it is she ain’t even tell all
Like how I introduced her to meditation, positive thinking
And the books she probably read in daily rotation
I learned when people lie on you not to return the favor so
I won’t get you embarrassed
I won’t tell them all the other parts about you that's plastic
This my last time putting my ex in a song even though the last one went triple platinum
I’d rather put that energy into what's worth having
Like how I got a platinum album with no solo tour
Niggas say it's over for me I go overboard
Back against the wall like my poster but I’m the poster boy
Not from the city if you let THEY tell it
Greatest rapper of all time if you let YE tell it
You ask me, I don’t got the resume
But, shit, I can go bar for bar for niggas who talking off
And getting egged on by A&Rs who, soon as your shit fallin’ off, they walkin’ off
And if you rappers diss us and ours just know that you dead and you know it
My career been moving perpetual motion
I'm not impressed with the whoopty woop, I don’t know who is who
And can’t pretend like I’m hip to it, no hula hoop
And I can’t lie like I like this shit like I usually do
And I'm just not impressed by you niggas rapping fast
Who sound like one big asthma attack but trash when I’m rapping it back
Who you put in your top five and claim they the savior of rap

So many friends turn to enemies, they frenemies
I don’t know why I act like I’m surprised or it's offending me
I’m saying, though, I should have learned from Hov and Dame
From Stunna and Wayne, Cudi and YE
What happened to our family ways, though?
When I put you on that song with Nas, you had told me that you was forever grateful 
And now we brothers, so it hurt to hit the internet to find out that me and you don’t fuck with each other 
Over a miscommunication that probably could be fixed with a 5 minute conversation, I’m still praying 

For ya, though, I guess I charged it to the game
How much it cost? Around Twenty88
Going off like Kobe when he wore the 'crazy eights'
All y’all niggas looking like my kiddos wearing Bape
Shot my first video in the Harajuku store
With Nigo in the background, that's a picture that you can’t take
With YE and Hype Williams directing each take
And God directing each step that we take

I’m a king, a legend, man, you niggas ain't worthy 
10 years in and a nigga still under 30
I’m feeling like an old man that failed at life
Got reincarnated to do it all again right (That's how I feel)
So I’m treating every second like it's an investment 
Time is money, every second I’m collecting 

Don’t ask me no stupid questions 
""Are you still signed to YE?"" questions, no Roc Nation questions 
Or who I’m dating questions, look, no more interviews 
Unless you wanna talk about the music or something that has a different view
And not the shit that's getting the hits and views
Words misconstrued with no credit, but you niggas approved

My mistakes are my biggest professors and learning life lessons 
I realize it ain’t what you have, it's what you feel, that's what true success is
I am the one of one, after me there's no successor

You're so different

I'll always be right there

You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)
You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)

And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you're on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time
You know what I need (Eh!)
I know what you like (Eh!)
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)
How could this be wrong
When it feels so right
I really need you
I really love you whoa

And I'll never let you go
You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)
Right there (right there)
Cause you listen
And you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change
I'm gonna stay right there (What, Okay, What)
I'll always be right there

Now if all fell through it
Would you catch me before the pavement
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book, and numbers thicker than the dictionary
And bible I got to recycle
I love and I like you
Five course meals even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you

And I'll never let you go (I got you)
You should know
I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)

Big Sean,"I'm sick and tired of friends with benefits,
There were too many goodbyes,
And I can't say I was so innocent,
Cause I told my share of lies,
But it seems like whenever I get close to her,
Love would just be away,
But just when I thought my chances were over,
I stared my future in the face.

I looked at main girl in the eye,
And since then I've been paralyzed,
Something told me she'd be mine,
And I knew it before she said hi(before she said hi)
Hi(hi) hi(hi) hi(hi)
And I knew it before she said hi

I made a lot of broken promises,
I had no respect for words,
And I thought I got all that I'm against,
Until I ran into her,
She whispers to me and it pulls me closer,
Now I can't stay away,
And now I feel like all my pain is over,
I stared my future in the face.

I had a feeling before she said hi,
And she told him bye,
My gift from god,
Fallen star from the sky,
Fell in love the first look at her eyes,

Doing her wrong she keep doing her own,
Now I'm taking her home little goose and patron,
Let's get it on,
Turn off your phone let's get blown,
In the zone?

You without me is like cash without tango,
Forget about the cash life no longer painful,
Look what we came to

They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The light, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
For long

And I'm in love with the lights, the love,
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old!
Table full of new hoes, champagne Nouveau,
But my money is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto.
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend,
Know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends,
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I make Cali
But I just hide my face doing Errol Flynn
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in him,
She got no companion, she Jenifer Aniston,
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend!
And again, and again,
Pass it to my to my mans and them
Fuckin' all the baddest bitches in cities we landing in
But what happens when it all falls,
And the success, is all gone, and its all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity
For now I'm a celebrity

'Cause I'm in love with the lies, the love, the rights, the wrongs,
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The light, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

With the money they said that is the root of all evil,
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us,
But he ain't pass around that collection plate,
'Til it's heavyweight as soon as his speech through

Now hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get a Benz to
Man how is it the root of all evil
If it could take my whole family out to Rio
No more repo with a D-Bo, just speedboats, jewelry all gold
Call me C 3 P O
Smoke so much, I gotta see three PO's
I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mikes like Tito
So I would hate to lose my Mike like Tito

What happens when it all falls,
And the success is all gone, and is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity
For now I'm a celebrity

'Cause I'm in love with the lies, the love, the rights, the wrongs,

I do it for everything in life for love and meaning,
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving,
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next,
L.A. Reid sign checks right after the contract.
I've always had a crazy flow
Pockets was on radio
Active I guess 'cause I was active on the radio.
Way back in high school, yeah nigger CT,
Where I met my nigger Tone Pap Pip CT
Came to the slum village business way before T3

All them hoes hatin'
If you're not down, then what's your location?
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man, you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from ""I love ya"" to ""Ya don't know who ya fuckin' with""
Fresh off of vacay and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys

If you wanna leave fine

Just don't tell me you love me

I wish you were ugly

Wishin' I would've tried more
She wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more
'Cause when I was true,
All I heard was buy more,
Fuck you, who is that? And I don't know why more
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feelin' like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hittin' high notes and you don't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'ed up
Girls dressed alike lookin' like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinkin' ""Damn boy, grow up!""
And I could still hear her leavin'
Crazy, when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not workin'
'Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time?

Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it's cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like

They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I'ma make it, but even if I don't
Don't feel bad 'cause honestly all the times that I had
Those will be the best memories

Let's reminisce

Over the good times and the bad
(I hope that you remember me)
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
(These will be the best memories)
Whoa the memories,
Whoa the memories

Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you to plug
How many trends you gotta set before you considered great
How many missed calls before you considered fake
How many dreams before its considered fate
I'm eating in a world where I'm considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can't look at him in his eyes,
You don't know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say ""in memory""
I'm praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
'Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories

Let's reminisce
(Be the best memories)
Over the good times and the bad
(I hope that you remember me)
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
(These will be the best memories)
Whoa the memories,
Whoa the memories

Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, 'cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan'
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first, I have the memories

Let's reminisce
(Be the best memories)
Over the good times and the bad
(I hope that you remember me)
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Whoa the memories
Whoa the memories

Let's reminisce
On the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Whoa the memories

And you can't slow me down, I'm sorry there's no delay
Me and my committee run the city, you just tryin' to join the relay
Leader of the new school, reportin' from the PA
These niggas call me 'cause but I don't know why, 'cause we can't relate
I got yo sister doin' thangs on camera I can't replay
But she's a waste of time, fuck I could've had a V-8
I turn thousands to milli's, it's time to renovate the ceiling
I'm turning houses to buildings, hustle while you out here chilling
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry
I swear I fuck 'til I'm tired, I'm getting high 'til it's blurry
I'm from the dirty glove, where hammers turn crews into jury's
They'll make you sit down, but as long as you with me ain't no worries
Man I'm puttin' on for my crew, never for these hoes
I'm puttin' on for my city, she puttin' on her clothes

Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice
Debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my twenty three years I done lived a couple lives
Like why? 'cause I stunt, bags of trees, like its fall
The girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard
And when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge
They gave us a bridge card, nigga
Ridin' low, puffin on laow
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said ""me and your grandma proud""
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd

Man I'd rather be young and shit, countin' four oh one K
I'd rather die with a smile instead

Obama suite, you one below, up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding?
Twenty k for the fit because it's twenty four carats
And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-Town reppin'
And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I loved Ashlee Marie
And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET

Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene
Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings
I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King

Tell me that wasn't verse of the year
Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up
Man I turned impossible possible
And what these niggas can barely see in the optical
The same teacher who told me rappin' is what not to do
Said I'm throwin' my life away if I drop outta school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels
(Been this way before)
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules
(Dream of finding so much more)
Little hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication
I'm yellin' fuck 'em all, with a hundred exclamations

Hey man, I've learned my lesson
Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees
(B.I.G) I was out in the world just messin'
With the bad girls, getting refreshed and
Got a call from my girl
Just left saying good girls don't grow on trees

I felt like it was yesterday,
The times we had that went away
We're still young, but of course we felt a lot
Now I've been living like a villainess been shot
I met her through a friend of mine,
Who told me that this girl was fine.
I picked her up and I started to figure out
There's more on the inside than on the out

(What she say? what she say?)
She said don't bother me (hey hey)
She told me that I had to leave
I wanted her just to believe

And good girls don't grow on trees

Just left, good girls don't grow on trees

Helped me get my world in tact
She had my heart, I told her that
Now it hurts every time I think about
The very night that I started with acting out
The morning brought a painful sun
Knowing now just what I've done
She always was the better half for sure
The part of me in life that I preferred

I gave up all of me (hey hey)
Though I tore her up inside
We still kept the love alive (Amen!)

Got a good girl, count your blessings
Instead of spending them up on sex
And good girls don't grow on trees

Just left good girls don't grow on trees

Woah, she's like a diamond out the rough
You know the good girls tainted by the bad world
The good girls hard to find
Woah, she's like H2O, can't get enough
Where are the good girls tainted by the bad world

Look, top floor of the hotel suite
So connected that you know I got a motel cheap
I'm saying I know I don't deserve the Noble Peace
But damn, I don't deserve the ""Go to hell"" speech

When I'm with you, I wish that time could move slow-mo

Cheated on her and she stayed, that’s just real life
Cause it’s hard when you ain’t on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wave but we ain’t on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float

I’m alright (I’m alright)
I’m alright (I’m alright)
Ain’t got no stress (Ain’t got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin’ the life
We livin’ life (We livin’ life)
Now sing it with me
If you’ve been working hard
If you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can nothing stop me now

Yea, yellin’ fuck a 9 to 5 boi
Even if I gotta work from 9 to 9 boi
I’m self made, self paid and I got my city watching
They threw me in the game
I threw up numbers like an auction
‘Cause I do it, do it, do it
Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit, way too much girls
Too much money, those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, you can grasp up my progression
Got the finest with her shirt off and skirt off
Showing her blessings

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders
I’m alright (I’m alright)
I’m alright (I’m alright)
Ain’t got no stress (Ain’t got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin’ the life
We livin’ life (We livin’ life)
Now sing it with me
If you’ve been working hard
If you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can nothing stop me now

I wonder what the haters got to say now
They mad I’m on top of my game and they down
I’m always repping for my gang I stay down
Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round
And the niggas that’s next to me it’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city it’s me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders
I’m alright (I’m alright)
I’m alright (I’m alright)
Ain’t got no stress (Ain’t got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin’ the life
We livin’ life (We livin’ life)
Now sing it with me
If you’ve been working hard
If you believe in God
Sing it with me
Can nothing stop me now

Been hated on, I been doubted
Been talked about and mistreated
Still put in the work that I needed
Now I’m living the things that I’m dreaming
Got my mama straight and my daughter good
And my team right ’cause we eating
Been broke before and now its open doors
I got the dopest flow and they seen it
God keep away all them demons
Been patient dog I’ve been lenient
Been holding out I’ve been fiending
Long as God with me don’t need ‘em
When you winning everybody want a dap up
Gettin' money now your friends wanna act up
I don’t really give a fuck I’ma go hard
No stress, couple cars in the front yard
We the best be the logo, getting money with a mogul
Upgrade from the 2 to the 4 door
Top down so blast it, its yolo
One time form the XO
Ace Hood got these rap niggas petro
Fied No lie nigga day know
From the bottom to the top only Lord knows

Man I’m so blessed (I’m so blessed)
I got the Lord on my shoulders
I’m alright (I’m alright)
I’m alright (I’m alright)
Ain’t got no stress (Ain’t got no stress)
My people with me they celebratin’ the life

Go girl, a go girl
A top notch thoroughbred, pro girl
She go-go live, she go-go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it
She a go girl, a go girl
An all night putting on a show girl
She go live, she go silly
If I tell her bring it back, she'll go-go get it

I got this girl that’s on some ?
She call and say she miss me
I tell her I’ma visit next time I’m in her city
I turn your world to Gotti World, shorty bring your ticket
Jimmy Choo and Red Bottoms, shorty we can kick it
I take her on trips, her boyfriend be tripping
Text her phone a million times, but she ain’t trying to hear it
Tattoos and piercings, Gucci shoes for chirren
Kids just as fresh as she be, She serious
All I do is ball, and all she fuck is winners
Take her to the mall, she don’t want to go to dinner
She a go girl, and I’m trying to get with her
Have you looking right, I had to follow her on Twitter
She’s a go girl

[Chorus]

Go, go, keep on going
I be somewhere throwing money, blowing on that potent
Money in my bank account, pockets hella swollen
And a model girlfriend, so for them cameras we be posing
We just go–go anywhere we wanna
Got a weed connect from Tennessee to California
Twenty grand in Pari, blowing on that Mary
Your bitch on my Johnson cause I’m balling like I’m Larry
And I play my part
I’m out here with them bosses, and she notice from the start
Get thirty K to show, so we both be going hard
Don’t smoke or roll the weed up
If she broke she get her cheese up
Ever slow, she’ll up the speed
Cause she a go girl

[Chorus]

OK now whoa there, keep going, throwing
That big booty, dong in
She wear her heart on her sleeve
Now she just Comme des Garconing
I wake up and show you what this cock-a-doodle-do in the morning
I swear that pussy so good, I wish I could clone it
Go girl, go girl
My new bitch, your old girl
She bust it open for my like a showgirl
Call me king, then tell me that it’s your world
Body Jamaican, but the vagina is Asian
I swear that’s hourglass shape and
That reminds me time wasting
Fuck around, I might taste it
And if I throw it back at her, then she probably gonna chase it
Because she’s a go girl

In exchange for him to love me
'Cause there ain't much difference
In a one night stand then one that ain't for me
Giving too much cause you hate that you love
Everything that he do and you can't deny you want him
So what, light a fire underneath this bitch and blow

Money ain't nothing, money can't buy you love
I don't give a damn if he's sitting on a crib

Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die

Couple niggas on the hitlist and bitches on a different type
Same shit different nights, till I live a different life
Sean you looking tired, damn homie that's all
I've been stressin' so hard I'm surprised I aint going bald
Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into ya'll, hatin'
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slippin like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, buddha love
Niggas sleepin with that mac and I aint talkin' bout computer love
All the wrong people you a price tag
Now you pray to god hoping that you got a christ tag
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, say nay my son
Taking elevators straight up out the slums to a penthouse view
And have the fam there too

Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 mile bred, that's why you see our sick style yeah

5 years ago I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm cali swaggin'
My nigga listen, I'm over the fame
You number 1, I'm 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames, we aint rollin' the same
I'm the best out in this muthafucker
If I could get a check out of this muthafucka big enough to set my kids up for life
I could check out of this muthafucka, with no regrets
If you aint living your life for ya kids, I aint giving yo ass no respect
(Sean, I love you my nigga, I'm out)

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die

I gotta break ya fuckin' heart
I gotta climb these fuckin' charts (I gotta climb)
I gotta do something that's innovative
Creative just to create a legacy before death do us part
I gotta spend one summer in Tijuana with tia and tia's momma
Breakfast in bed is head with plenty of carne asada (I gotta)
I gotta find me a wife to elope (I gotta)
I got a fine, cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like yall, but that's not me
I gotta spread the truth even when the truth can hurt the youth
Need to know every detail about this earth, the devil controls it
So before you scrutinize how I feel ask god if those polls important
The end is near!

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Hit all the girls I want and make sure my niggas right
And my family live that life

As I look up to the sky
Thought about a 100 things to do before I die
Wonderin' if I could live it all in one life
'Cause it could all end in one night

As I look up to the sky
I thought about a 100 things to do before I die",100,2013

I tell her I feel the same
She tell me nigga quit playing you the only one that's not crying

Man, what goes around comes around like some ceiling fan shit
I broke the levy to your eyes

It might be to late, for me to learn from my mistakes
I know that it hurts, I know that it hurts you

This might be the biggest mistake, it's too late
Because two can't be in first place

Wake up then, call your ex and make up then

Fun stopped being fun, and feeling tried to finagle in
We had that independent love, you tried to bring a label in
Girlfriend? Nah, I already got one
You need a good guy, and I'm already not one
She said we lost a kid already, I'm already not that young
My biological clock is ticking, I'm not just trying to have fun
Shits way different from us first chilling
Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Which we could fast forward time and reverse feelings
Is there a warranty for love to return and fix it
She said you good either way, when it was her last night nigga and me today
You the man, huh getting on the tna
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?
And so on and so on, and the shit just always goes on
Nothing about us feeling right

Y'all know where I come from, and uh, shoot I used to come to the D. 
I used to go to Detroit, like, every two weeks to record with J Dilla. 
I be standing at the Atheneum, and then, you know, he'd come scoop me up; he had a Range. 
We'd either eat, we'd eat at a Coney Island, close to his crib. 
He stayed 'round McNich'. 
We'd go down in his basement and stuff, 
And Jay Dee would dig through the records and then he would make a beat. 
And then once he make a beat, I'd be like, 
""Yo that beat cold,"" and then I'd just sit there. 
And Frank, Frank would be around. 
And then you know, and we'd just be kicking it; 
I'd be getting some Heinekens and stuff, and then uh, they'd go to Chocolate City, to the strip club. 
And I wasn't all into the strip clubs at the time, 
So I'm like yo, I'd just be like, I'd sit there and be like, ""I'm about to write this rap."" 
Then one time I was like, ""I'm going to the strip club with y'all."" 
I went to the club, and man they had some good chicken wings, man some good, thick girls, and it was right.

Where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?
Where do we begin now that you’re back from the dead?

I held the funeral the day you left,
A black umbrella and a sad song in my head,
Buried your pictures that I loved the most,
‘Cause if you survived me I just didn’t wanna know,
So you can’t just come back now like a demon uninvited,
No you can’t just expect me to open my door to you because,

I never thought that you and I would ever meet again,

You said ""no matter how much you f*cking make it doesn’t make a difference"",

Swear we’re fucking we’re dominos but, here we are,
Now I’m trying to find an answer in this Bottle girl,
And I’m im driving slow, driving slow, don’t let the piranha’s know

But you gon’ miss me when I’m gone,
Why we gotta wait that long?
Baby do-do-do-do-don’t,
Or should I walk out instead,
Is this live and let die or night of the living dead?

You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say ""be real"" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything

Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone dies
Then she text me like ""Why you still talk to my mama?""
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me the one I fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped pad sch--

I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

All this bread can't be good for my cholesterol
Don't come round' talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire dawg
I can't lie bruh lately I've been stressing heavily
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
Diss you, FF Imperial 'til my burial
Dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti fuck boy material 'til I'm dead, I'm living proof
If you focus on what's in front of you and not what's in the peripheral
It's gone, word, boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama over comma on comma
I'm bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like its haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

I woke up working like a Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

I got 3 jobs like I'm Jamaican though
I need 3 wives like I was Haitian though
One cook, one clean, the other PMS'ing, no hable ingles
If police have questions they don't know what that mean nigga
They say Detroit going through the great depression
Still it's been depressed so long I can't even tell depression here
My homeboy still gon' pull up on them rims big as a Ferris wheel
So many rides up on the curb my lil 'cause thought the fair was here
Like oh, I'm primo, top spot redeemed ho, for who, my team
And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego, pussy and flamingos
Got me thinking the fuck I need to sleep for?

It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March ninth
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbys out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prime night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back when I was seventeen
It's crazy though, 'cause even then I thought I had it all figured out

It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lyin' and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin' overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin' like it's O.J. car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin' out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all trickered out
Even when it, all of it, when you still ain't got

Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns into the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all started at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it

Yeah, I got a brand new benz
Crazy right, brand new benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you at pay's crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas, we had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically
Those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel tower
And you got so drunk threw up, yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go

Long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful,
Disgraceful distasteful yeah I know 
You’re not supposed to have cake and eat too
Crazy how these hos always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D.
And ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY,
I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to you girl
Almost broke every promise to you girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody you was supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, and then propose to
And when thanksgivings come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No I don’t know that number”
“Why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless

And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything

Never did real estate, and still put you in your place

Bought my fam new land, six star crib
Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shout out to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past

Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hos
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She's ask why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

What's the noise all about with this rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game, I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold bow acres it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm coppin' stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on, not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what why I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF good, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D.
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain

When I got my first chain

I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
Stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me
A couple others and dreams, would've seen me
Me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time

Now how the fuck can I chill now?
Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now
How sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is
The troublesome chick, who throws fists
Sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up
But when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, you surely do and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes
So dead it, shred it

I'm so ready to let it go
My life is fucking awesome, I could be fuckin' dead right now
But I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought

Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the god
It might be too late, but the song's will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong

Two niggas with guns, snatch yo wallet
That pickpocket want my I.D and I spray your zone
Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'
Got a new choppa, I need that bitch that want a tag on
If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless

Only real niggas remain
'Ye say that we the new slaves
I need to ball with a chain

With twins so big she can put 'em in the bunk
Oh I love it when she drop it and spread it like time
When I see her camel all I wanna do hump
Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name
Got a mural on the wall I'mma legend
From the motor city and been have drive

Okay, we all in the game we ballin' the same

Big Sean,"I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone till we on
Whats up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""
Man, that shit sounds stupid then I hang up on his ass
Then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursuit it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, ""Let's do it""

When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music

Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches
Thanking God Almighty condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone
That could've come from out the Simpsons man
Who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gon for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing, but fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot, but I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say ""Aye dawg, what you got?"", ""Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, stay young ran the game, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem, it's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And the bunch just synonyms about how he was living in
I ain't even let him finish shit, I mean I can't lie he was alright
But at his age, shit so was I, so give him my email on a fly
And if it sound good, then I reply uh

Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry

I know you're not my child talking like that
Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive
And the easiest way to do that
Is to be grateful for all the things that you do have
For your health, for your family, your friends
All the people that care about you
You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay
Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi",Nothing Is Stopping You,2013

Start the day dissecting weed, then strategize then rest my team

It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds

Got me thinking, ""whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again""

Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you hallelujah
Pour it on you hallelujah, pour it on you hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
Even if it's left overs I still got to eat right
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight, all day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool

One on my arm, that's decoration
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
To the top escalating, elevating
Good music legislation, delegatin'

And I'm going 'til I K.O
Eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll
Even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day
And all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his mothafuckin' soulmate
Cause no time for hand in hand
When you got this paper hand in hand
Bitch I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga na na na na na

Big Sean,"If I go hard, let me tell you that it's worth it
Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush em right off, when they say I don't deserve it
Hands on my heart, you keep my fire burning

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away

If this is a dream won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life
In my fantasy we're running wild

If this is a dream won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life

When it gets rough, then the rain starts pouring
I turn up the heat 'cause the drama ain't important
Let em all talk talk, I'mma just ignore it
Hands on my heart, you you keep me moving forward

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name

Big Sean Don, okay!

Today I woke up feeling like the mayor
I spend about an hour looking in the mirror
As I should, as much as I've been through
It's a wonder I look this damn good
I could probably make it out any situation that you try to put me into
If I swim with the piranhas, guarantee that I'mma probably have a fish dinner
I meet a young girl with a sexy shape
Look like Jessie J, we escapade
Where its extra shade, she make me want to give in
Not take in like collection plates
Wow, all these wars, bras, cars, wall to wall, was all a mirage
And I could lose it all tonight just to show the world I could do it twice
It's my life

If this is a dream won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive
I just can't believe that this is my life

D-d-d-dizzee!

Rascala? Double the dollar
I'm a jet-settin' bredda, more hits than a white collar
But I can't be boxed, flow tight like Bob Marley's locks
I can't be dropped, I'm at the peak and I can't be topped
I'm wilding out, I've lost the plot, I can't be stopped
Pull up in a gnarly 'Rari, barmy, what
Opposite of calmly, I bet I’ll get the party hot
I can't be blocked, 10 years plus running the game
You breddas just come in the game, but now I'm coming again
To get the people going dumb and insane
Hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mud and the rain
Women on shoulders, tops off, shouting my name
I'm all in their brain, why would I complain?
I thought I was the Boy in da Corner
But I'm in a penthouse, now your boy is a baller
I'm living

If this is a dream won't open my eyes
Am I asleep? No, I'm alive

But I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me I'm not see-through
You know how we do

Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, they way we is do deeper
Baby straight up chemistry DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin or workin', so the grind don't stop

I've been held from ten to tens, swear I won't sin again
Bring the Hell to my residence, godly presence with presidents
My day job, it made me shit, public housing ain't got no fence
And college ain't make no sense, niggas whole home invaded quick
I did work, I done pay my dues, I'm induced, now I'm overdue
One hit one, call this voodoo, don't want apes to jump out the zoo
I got one mountain, one problem, plus the issues, I can't solve them
But it's nothin', and I'm still in the club on the couch still fuckin' up somethin'
Nigga please! Mama please, I'm never comin' home 'til I make a hundred, shit
Scratch that, 'til I make a hundred million
Then I'mma stretch that 'til I make a hundred trillion
Who knew one day her son would grow up and learn how to read or write
Did songs with Hov, now hallelujah fell asleep the real McCoy
God damn, how you do that?

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again

So you can gon' and make them lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus
People sayin', ""Ye we need another Yeezus""
Lames try to tell me, ""Cut the wilin' out, out""
But who the fuck is you reachin'
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments

Major coke figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh
Soldiers all in Al-Qaeda, new Mercades for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet the Navy
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and menage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I went childish
'Til I fucked the girl, the girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she said ""That was just some foul shit""

A rubber is the only thing that ever came between us
God damn, now look at everything in between us

More ladies, more drugs and no cases
With jobs and no babies
I hope no phone saving and if so you gon' hate me

Dealing with emotions, that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt, in this game

Why we pointing fingers, anyway?
When we're the same

Break up
Make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds
And stop acting like we're blind?

Stars fall, and the world goes blind, boy
You know, I'll be savin' my love for you, for you

'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on

I guess time's wasting, tick tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh, how do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love could be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper, and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You ask why I love your mom so much 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos, we both ones of ones and we the oddest
Couple only humans 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had

Champagne poppin’, bad thing poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’ (no)
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon’ do it gourmet
I’m hearing fuckin’ voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds off for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That’s Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I’m gambling with watches getting better with time
So I’mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say “time is money”, forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

(Oh) Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin’
Champagne poppin’, bad thing poppin’
Headed to the door, and ain’t a damn thing knockin’ (no)
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin’
Campaign poppin’, champagne poppin’
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin’ (no)

Ay, ay, ay , ay , ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day

Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God’s in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that’s behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I’ve seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I’m a rare diamond that’s hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 To 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain’t no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I’m rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin’ that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say “I need that fadeaway”
Had a crush on what’s her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can’t take his chain away
Real play you can’t take his game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can’t take my dame away, devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that’s my favorite compilation

Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? 'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(Detroit!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit, but Jesus
I can just see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET 'cause if
I wasn't me I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch, 180 Degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
Mcs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static
In your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
But ain't we sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit may even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it it's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger

On top of my ship and I'm not even sinkin'
And I could just sit back and say that I'm happy
But can't spend a day without smokin' and drinkin'
Got champagne problems, and I order more my wardrobe is Aura Gold
I'm a young nigga with a older soul
But still young enough to know I gotta know some more
I made somethin' out of nothin', Sean Don the magician
She doin' tricks with her pussy, I guess she's a vagician

Whippin' through Gotham, hatin' mothafuckas, I wanna off ‘em
Hella endorphins, got me livin' life to the coffin
I'm coughin', wonderin' if I'm goin' insane
Nobody knowin' my pain but I be killin' cause I'm into the game
Now lookin' back it's like ain't nothin' the same
All these Spanish women watchin' me like a novela
Hit you with a Beretta get you wetter than a umbrella
Ain't nobody better do it like me
I know a lot of mothafuckas don't like me
Probably wanna fight me, but I just keep the peace
No need to keep a piece
I keep my enemies on a leash capiche?
And keep it real for the people I reach!",Alright,2014

I ain't going out to eat, but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that Bape out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like ""this the girl I'mma take out""
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way way out

And I've been waiting all God damn year, all year
I can tell that it's near, but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down, like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know about living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yeah, saying I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like sign these
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gonna stop
'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gonna stop
'Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top

One time for the city, treating it like it's the mother ship
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then back then make it like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work

And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish don't call it

Cut your head off get it mailed out stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
'Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos, he ain't throwing up signs
Well let me throw up mine and also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish in lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time, then cross it with pride
That's real my nigga, remember that
And ain't nobody if they remember you they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that

Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit

Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it

And you know we on a roll like we did good in college

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world

All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagine this so much some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress
Starin' at the ceilin' tryna to connect the dots
But its hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're getting fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars and be like ain't too much that's different
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up everyday like you on a mission?

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million dollar cribs havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all just remember one thing
Remember one thing
That one man could change the world

My grandma told me if you write your name in stone you'll never get the white out
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the white house
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from I swear they broke, they need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions that I couldn't survive
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black you had to extra extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise saying

I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything

Big Sean,"Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pull that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pulled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
'Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this cross
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like ""we don't got time for bullshit, dawg""
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the ""um, you owe me"" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
""Oh, you owe me likes""
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for OKCs
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn

Back when my rollie was ticking, no dancing

Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Iceberg and Girbaud was like the wardrobe for the killers,
We pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress and undress that ass, God bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up was the had a homemade aids test fuck
But I ain't flunk once, not before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say ""nigga, come roll""

Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile
They call that the better mile
Tryna get a house up in the woods
Off on 11 Mile, better that, one time for the D
Girls that hold me down Corretta style, free Juan, let him out
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking ""fuck rap""
'Cause there's niggas in the streets getting money under my nose that I mustache
I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
That's why their attitude was ""bitch, you deserved that shit""
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain the same brain and mind

How I'm supposed to shine man, through all the smoke and clouds?

Twenty some but my soul a hundred some
My mind’s racing, it’s racing

It'll probably be that way until the Pearly Gates

These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man (Sheesh)
At least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skiis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan

You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to Hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation

Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (Come on)

Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
'Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake

Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed

Who knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason, you won't die in peace

I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me

My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you brown, they might hold you down
And even hose you down, man
Since I'm a son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Drumpf card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon
So when they take the fame, take the crib
Take our cars, now we gotta take the train
Hood niggas takin' chains, slave master take our names
5-0 take the shot and young souls take the blame
Man, but they can't take away the light

No matter how much they gon' shade you (nah)
Man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
They can't fuck with the light, hell nah the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you

Born in a world going where they told me I can't go
In my lane, though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died, I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing depending on the angles

With a lamp post, door handle shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber
Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter
A banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover

This feel like I'm headed to paradise one-way

We rollin on chrome
Flossin its a sunny day
Niggas smokin blunts
Blowin light green hay
All about our cash
We worked hard and got paid
Stacks mutiplied now its
Time to parlay

(Lil'Flip)
Its a sunny day so I'm a pull out the drop
No chain today but I'm a pull out the watch
You know I'm iced out (bling!)lookin like a wedding cake
I hear niggas whisperin man I bet its fake
But I got cash ride around in drop Jags
With my top back interior all black
With leather seats rimmed up 4 times
I'm in the V-12 watch me blow down
You know me I gotta put my stunt down
And when the laws pass by I put my blunt down
Cause I stay high like a telophone pole
And I roll on vogues and pimp yellow bone hoes
Swangas and blades is what we sit on
I'm talking on my ""flip phone"", ya get it ""flip phone""
Smokin on a zone of that sticky-icky-green
Hoes see me in the Jag and say ""Flip thinks he clean...""

(Hook:Big Shasta rp.2x)

(Lil'Flip)
I'm at the beach party in a pearl white drop
I had to take my bracelet off cause the girls might bop
White Airforce ones Fat Albert tank top Nike head band
Long braids hang out hoes everywhere man its goin down
The traffics so bad cops sayin turn around
But you know niggas we gonna try to sneak in
Some niggas going broke tryna ball this weekend
And TJ takin flicks wit bad broads, Hump in the Benz
Redd in the Jaguar, we leaned out you know
Our car screened out and if we ain't ridin 20s
We chrome 19ed out 84s got me shinin in the lane
We been ridin blades stop stealin our slang!
You know what we really ballin down south and all
Niggas jammin Screw and Swisha House...

Grippin on wood...
Its a sunny day in the hood!

(Lil'Flip)
You see them 20s spinnin when I'm swangin down the strip
Diamonds hanging off my lip, my trunk bangin like a crip
Niggas thinkin I'ma slip but I cain't
If a hater try to jack I'm a waste 'em like drank
I'm ridin on a full tank, switchin lanes like Maurice
Baguettes on my teeth, maurcetts on my teeth
Iceberg on my feet, the Speedy Gonzales
Big Mar, & Big Hawk yea them my compadres
We ball everyday like Catino Mobley
I gotta Cartier but have you seen my Roley
I ride Navigator its my Navigator
I feel like Tela ""bound by haters""as I
Slide by Jaimiaca sippin medicine
We wanna bring our cups in but they won't
Let us in so we hit cornbreads and go back
To the house I'm a hold it down for Screw
Know what I'm talking bout!...

",Sunny Day,2001
Big Shasta,"Come on, uh
I'm bout to cause a disaster, like a earthquake
Eighteen's, got little kids dropping milk shakes
I smoke and sip eights, poured in one soda
Treat my girls like dogs, nigga teach em to roll over
Give em the cold shoulder, if they don't listen
But they quickly convinced, when they see them rims twisting
Better pay attention, to that nigga Lil' Reezy
It takes six dimes in bikinis, just to please me
Better believe me, its real in the field
My chain like yellow lights, it make people ill
In the Porsche switching gears, like a Nascar racer
And the rocks on my bracelet, got it looking like a glacier
I'm a clutch player, like Robert Hory
These cats ain't balling, they telling stories
But ain't gotta worry, bout H.S.E.
If I ain't hating on you, then why you hating on me

We from the deep down South in the city
In the light, and I be seeing these girls be looking pretty
That's why, I got to stay on my grind
So we can be a hundred percent, all the time
Y'all don't know where we from (where we from)
Y'all don't know where we been (where we been)

Its like one for the money, and two is for them hoes
Three is for the drank, Four pass me the smoke
You won't see me riding, in any ole Benz
Unless its jet black, on twenty inch rims
I got more Air Force, than the government
Every color pair, I'm so fly trust me I'm loving it
I never leave the hoe, with just a single rubber
And I crawl like Ringling Brothers, hoes love us
Under the in-fluence, catch me swerving
Playing in a number six, like Julius Irving
My watch and my chain, got me coughing and sneezing
Still a young heathen, as long as I'm breathing
I pay for a show, turn it out then I'm leaving
The way the man told us, its flossing season
This year we got it made, we shining y'all
Even though we got a due, we still grinding y'all

Who am I, name is Lil' Flip
And I roll with, two clips
Just in case, something happen
While y'all niggas yapping, I'ma be capping
Rolling with my strap and, pistol packing
Glock 9's, Tech 9's, even a Mack 10
I'm not acting, I pack clips so
Play your roll, and stick to the script
Before I flip, and empty the clip
I'm Gladys Night, cause I'm a pimp
We eating shrimp, and catching planes
You know I'm great, at catching dames
And what's your name, where you live
Will you give some brain, do you got kids
Cause if you do girl, its okay
So pass the syrup, fuck the courvassier",Deep Down South,2003
Big Shasta,"Oh-oh-oh
Make your cash
My mama used to tell me

Let me state my name, and show my skills
I'm Lil' Flip, and I got that deal
But I keep it real, with my peeps
And I hold my heat, when I'm in the streets
But I can't stop and I won't stop, rapping till I'm dead
Cause every single day, I got ideas in my head
Like trippling my money, and doubling my fans
I did shows for hundreds, but now I'm getting grands
But I give thanks to the man, for giving me a talent
Cause I could still be hustling, trying to feed my family
And y'all think its a fantasy, to want to drive a Benz
But if you get that car, how you gon supply them ends
And you gon want some rims, and you gon want a house
But when rent come around, nigga why your lights out
Now you sitting on the couch, all slouching and mad
Cause you acting like you balling, but you really doing bad
But trust me dog, I've been down the same road
But what I learned, is that you can't let money control
The way you act, the way you talk (the way you talk)
Your attitude, and the way you walk (the way you walk)
The way you feel, the way you think (the way you think)
'Cause everything you got, could be gone by one week

Oh-oh-oh
My daddy used to tell me
Make your cash
My granny used to tell me
Oh-oh-oh
My grandpa used to tell me
Make your cash

To whoever you are, and wherever you be
Whether you punching a clock, or selling them ki's
Just keep your head up, don't get fed up
Just do what you gotta do, to keep your bread up
And watch for your friends, who always want to get you high
Cause that might be the one, friend let you die
Sometimes I cry, yeah nigga I cry
Because half of the people I loved, they already died
Like my cousin, I can't forget my best friend
And my mama's mama, so everyday I'm stressing
But I went and got a tat, for all the people I love 
And money won't change me, I'm still a educated thug
Riding 20 inch dubs, even though I didn't want em
But Hump paid for it so fuck it, I'ma flaunt em
And I'm still in the hood, giving money to the kids
But I don't want publicity, for all the shit I did
But I did it from the heart, not to get famous
Cause I been having paper, and it'll never change us
And if I ain't in the hood, that mean I got a show
That's why I stay on my grind, cause I gotta have dough

You betta learn what the game got to offer
Before you try to jump foot first in it
You gotta watch what you do around certain people
Gotta peep yo' surroundings
Watch for snake niggaz, snake bitches
Know what I'm sayin

A lot of people got crooked ways
'Cause they was broke and they couldn't really make no pay
I knew a dude that worked at the super market
Makin minimum wage, livin poor and starvin
He stopped by my house and told me he was on his ass
Then he asked, could I afford to front a half
I wasn't worried about him tryna play a nigga
I knew where he stayed, So I go and spray the nigga
I ran in and out and laid down the rules
Made sure he understood everything was cool
After 3 hours he pulled in my drive way
With all my money dog, this musta been a great day
But somethin wasn't right, that was just too quick
I found out this bitch was tryna be slick
This lil trick had a mic taped to his chest
So instead I hit him in the head, not the chest

They don't know what the game about
Got caught up short
Because you tried to save a drought

Because you tried to save a drought
The streets is hot
Live with yo' eyes and ears
Mouth closed, on ya toes and you won't get killed nigga

Now see life is a big game, y'all playin to win
Would you risk ya own life if it meant savin ya friend
Would you be a millionaire if you woulda been savin ya ends
Are you really that real nigga that you claimin you been
Would you still act the same to ya friends
Even though you made some change
Or have you changed now that you havin things
But I know what, I can promise you this
Man, life is too short and ain't promisin shit
Look, you never know what tomorrow will bring
That's why I got this mo' wet to drown my sorrows away
'Cause when tomorrow's today and yesterday is last week
Somebody could blast me
For what reason, don't ask me
Tryna be flashy, but game run out the respect
Show none, and get that chain snatched off ya neck
But hoe ass niggaz do hoe ass shit
And hoes don't get whatever, act like ya know that shit

They don't know what the game about
Got caught up short
Because you tried to save a drought
The streets is hot
Live with yo' eyes and ears
Mouth closed, on ya toes and you won't get killed nigga

It's a shame
But who's to blame
You gotta stack yo change
And try ya best to get paid, yea
And if you don't know what the streets'll do
Stay out of harms way 'cause it could happen to you
And you and you or me and the rest of my crew
Just handle your business and do what you do
My mama told me that life is hard
Stay focused, thank God and you'll make it far
But through the pain and scars, I seen it all
But one minute you on top and then you stumble and fall

They don't know what the game about
Got caught up short

All my niggas on lock keep ya head up
My niggas on the block get ya bread up, I'm a get this cheddar
(Hey!) We go make it out the hood mayne
(Hey!) We go make it out the hood mayne

Yeah I made it out the hood but I still go back
To check on my fam and buy my love bro throwbacks
I came a long way, it ain't my fault you went the wrong way
And listen up I'm grown nigga, I don't play
I got show money (yeah), plus liquor money (yeah)
After I get off stage I got picture money
These rap cats ain't stickin' to the G-code
You thing you fly cause you got a few free-throws
I know squares that cook O's, you damn right
And if you want it, you gotta pay the damn price
I do this for the dope boys with them A-K's
I'm a fly yellow nigga like Kay-Kay

Ay, you ain't gotta be fake I know y'all don't like me
Cause when I got shot up, y'all ain't right me
You got a chip on your shoulder, I got a clip in my holster
The difference between us, is I'm focused
Nowadays e'rybody wanna talk about me
But you know you can't mention the South without me
Record labels came, and record labels went
Pay attention to your checks, watch the money you spend
Your kids dirty, but you ride around in a Benz
Everyday at Pappadeux, trickin' ya ends
It ain't the color of our skin, that hold us back
It's a fact, niggas don't know how to act
A few niggas get paid e'rybody want a piece
Shit start goin' wrong e'rybody wanna leave
Record sales low e'rybody wanna beef
(No matter where I go) I keep it H double O-D

[Chorus: x2]

Ay, all my niggas makin' forty-five hunnid a week
We overseas blowin' trees, yeah it's somethin' to see
You'll never hear me say ""I don't need the hood""
All my niggas gettin' fat cause I feed the hood
It ain't my fault y'all niggas don't leave the hood
I did everything y'all ain't believe I could
Huh, you not ahead of me, I got longevity
I'm tryin' to leave my lil' boy, a legacy
I got the recipe, you wanna make a hit
You not impressin' me, talkin' bout bricks
I made it out the hood, and I'm still thuggin'
Accepted by Hollywood, and I'm still hustlin'
And that's a goddamn shame right?
Oh well, I'm tryin' to get my change right
And you'll survive, if you play the game right
I fly G-5's I ain't gotta change flights

I outlast MC's by miles, and I got
The hot style that pops.
I'm givin' hardrocks body shots when I rock.
You can't even test me, no matter how hard you try.
Fuck around, lay around, punk; do or die.
I'm back again, the roughneck nigga from Boston.
When I swing I got mad drama that I bring.
The crews all back me up,
And we come to rip 'cause our shit's too rough, yeah!

Me and my fam, take this rap shit serious.
New York to L.A., and you niggaz best to fear this.
New York to L.A., and you niggaz best to fear this.

is now under complete control""

""Hip-hop is not, what it is today..""

""It's the real... it's the (militia)""

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin name
I eradicate movefakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with lifetakers, have sex with rumpshakers
I make moves so I'ma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's alright, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin up, just straight shuttin up
or we'll start the wettin up

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, til everybody knows
that I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin, my name and face you're rememberin
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia

Everybody's spittin it, the rhyme is hot

You niggaz owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggaz in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is water baby, spread it around
But when you niggaz don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit the buck in the face
of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggaz and how I bust up they nose
And while your, nose is drippin, and drainin blood
I be standing over you screamin, ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in they palm
Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect  you get the tech
I turn you fake niggaz on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggaz, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You snap inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggaz who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay what up, what's up?
I got stripes while you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggaz do best bite
You niggaz can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Prim' brought Bumpy these tracks so I can let you know
Before I slide I'ma leave you this jewel

Get with us, kick it on some fly shit with us

And I've unravelled the thoughts, of many pretty girls

My conversation so stimulatin, they want to sparkle
And I could never approach you with the same old game
I know you don't want to hook up, with the same old lame

From, Brooklyn to Spain, always tight when I'm hookin a dame
I like brains and beauty, your total package may move me
If you choose me then it's only my duty

You upon your back or your toes, near your earlobes
Now your middle exposin ecstasy

Let's take a trip on the low to Acapulco
to see the pretty women with the sexy toes
I got a fetish for your toes girl, plus behind closed doors
you're hot and sexy, like a showgirl

I heard you stretch that body like plastic
Bring it on baby, let me peep the ass(?)tastics
No need to sweat you, already been chosen
I could be no harder if my whole body was frozen

I'm a rub you down with body butter
If you feelin that scratch your name in my back

promise you that I cum, way after you, after you

Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real...
Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real...
Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real...

Verse One:

The bragadocious MC has returned
To backdraft, torch niggas and burn
my sound moves like kilos underground
cock me back, like a sledgehammer I'ma pound
niggas into the ground like stakeness
this shit is fakeness, so I'ma break this
monotony, and show 'em how it's supposed to be done
and keep lame niggas on the run
it's be	-I-G S-H-you-G, try and remove me
find yourself with loose teeth
and you can't stop the unstoppable
___ is droppable
when I'm coming through with my lyrical
I'm the ruffneck shwingin'
drama that I'm bringin'
on your left jaw I'll be tingin'
because left hooks turns mouths to mush
and when you're in my grip your whole game will get crushed...

Chorus:

Crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real...
        to every hardcore that you hit the hard floor

Verse Two:

I'll slam an MC like cowboys do cattle
and rattle any snake mutha fucka who wish to battle
there's no way you can win
I'm wipin' off silly grins
when I come to kick your face in
and I'ma break you down to your atom
and if you test that, then I'ma grab one and bat 'em
down to the ground with this sound
stash your body parts and they're nowhere to be found
I'ma keep my mental on danger
anger proves to you that I'm no stranger
and I'ma keep it real as I can
comin' from murderpan who I am
I'm greater than, that means you're less than
are you a man, I don't think so with gun in your hand
and I live behind a wall
and when I was released Big Shug is still standing tall

Chorus

Verse Three:

Comin' through with the cynderblock flows
Keepin' your ___ hard, while ____ want to tiptoe
through the valleys of death, troubles of hell
no matter how they gas me, head will never swell
I'm sending you up the river in a holey boat
and rippin' your sleeves off your lambskin coat
you want to be tough well come test Shug
and you'll find out that my shit is all good
I represent to the fullest that's all I know
and I've got to come through swingin' elbows
and I'll hold the post, hold down the middle
and niggas get knocked the fuck out when they want to fiddle
you gotta be serious, nothing is too mysterious
niggaz is comin' with the truth
and my punchline is punchin' niggas offline
when I come through we represent everytime

Word to Joe Frazier got ta do what pays ya 
Give a nigga pain like displasure 
But close your hips in nigga you can't win 
I walk around with a scowl and a grin 
Parties try to rock me chicks try to clock me 
Niggaz try to block me but they can't stop me 
I'm a bad man understand where I come from 
Treatin' niggaz dumb, as I drink my rum 
I'm a mad man, I get respect with the Tec 
Put punks in check, Shug's on the set 
I'm the one with the game, the twelve round 
Crack to the concrete, from the underground 
I'm a bad nigga, how do you figure to take me 
You cannot break me, so don't mistake me 
For your brother, I'm not a punk motherfucker see 
I did my time, and now I'm free 
I'm a dope one, ready to rip and wreck shop 
I will not stop, I won't be dropped by the cops 
I'm bad, understand me with the game I kick 
I got crazy bitches like a Trojan on my dick 

Yo Hobb we got more rep than Lucky Luciano 
Suckers we wet to the sound of the dope piano 
This is something you can't handle, here's one example 
I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle 
Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified 
Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die 
Fish niggaz, they get fried upon my skillet 
I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit 
And hittin' you blaow (BLAOW) so what you want to do now? 
You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya 
Got infinite length, with the strength of a real master 
If you don't bow down now you'll get plowed down now 
You know, like POW 
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x3) 
So fuck around, lay around, do or die 
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2)

Word to Mike Tyson, hit you quick like lightnin' 
Swing my left jab first, and then come in with the right 
Cold deck ya, nah I could never respect a 
Punk like you, you get dropped like one two 
And you're out son, just like a one round bout son 
The outcome, is that you'll get that ass hung 
Easily, swiftly, you'ew stupid you can't get with me 
Fuck around, lay around, do or die (Repeat x2) 
I said fuck around, lay around, do or die 

Fumin! Hey, I'm boomin' down on niggaz 
I figure, how could they take out a big nigga 
They don't know, so I don't never give em a clue 
That's you and you and you, and oh yeah you 
You can't get with this or take me down 
I'm always laughin' haha 'cause you punks are clowns 
Since I'm passin' emcees, with my skill 
I'm up on the hill, and I force them dudes to chill 
Rippin' up shit as I do, because I'm violent

Big Sid Catlett,"Sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep
At the close of day
When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep
While we sleep, sleep, sleep
It seems that daytime was just made for laughter and song
Evening brings romance to lovers as they stroll along
Night time brings rest to the weary
Sooths all the hearts that are dreary
Leaves us alone with our day dreams
Brings back sweet golden love dreams while we sleep, sleep, sleep
How we love to sleep

When the joys of the day fade away and the memories sweet
Of the day repeat 
In our dreams they creep

Big Sid Catlett,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1996
Big Sid Catlett,"No use of talkin' no use of talkin'
You'll start in dog-walkin' no matter where.
There's jazz-copation blues modulation,
Just like a Haitian you'll rip and tear.
Most everybody likes the blues

Here's why I'm ravin', here's why I'm ravin'
If it's blues you are cravin' just come on down.
You'll hear 'em playin', you'll hear 'em playin'
Soon you'll be sayin', ""Hon jazz me 'round""
Because your feet they can't refuse.

What's that familiar strain that true blue note refrain
It's drivin' me insane,
Can't keep still, tho' it's against my will;
I'm on my P's and Q's I just can't refuse.

There goes that melody, it sounds so good to me,
And I am up a tree,
It's a shame, you don't know the name;
It's a brand new blues, 
The Royal Garden Blues.

Everybody grab somebody And start jazzing 'round

Hon don't you hear that trombone moan? 
Just listen to that saxophone.
Gee, hear that clarinet and flute, 
Cornet jazzin' with a mute,
Makes me just throw myself away, 
When I hear 'em play.

That weepin' melancholy strain, 
Say, but it's soothing to the brain;
Just wanna get right up and dance, 
Don't care I'll take most any chance;
No other blues I'd care to choose, 
But Royal Garden Blues.",Royal Garden Blues,1996

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven

Big Sid Catlett,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Count the dollars on the Lexy don't waste your time 
Let it shine let it shine let it shine
Mizzolas and 850 flossin' I'm tossin'

Chokin' hard up off the indo smoke

Keepin' these haters upon they toes 'cause they know I'm ready to ride
Hide but you can't get away
This is your dead homie you should of put your tool away
But you still pull it on me, see I ain't trippin' 
I got foot soldiers that do dirt for me
Love me enough to hurt for me and do some work for me

I wouldn't of done it if I didn't have to
In the wrong place at the right time evil minds learkin'
Thought I was over peerkin' searchin' for a home I feel alone
On these cold streets, sleepin' on couches with no sheets

I'm facin' more time then I really got to give
Damn I want to live in 2-1-3

And although deez steadily grinding for cheese
Trunk fulla keys on my way O.T. from 5-1-0 to the 2-1-3
I puts it down bendin' the corner with my all blue Chevy
My mind on gettin' the fetti, my heater cocked back and ready
With G's crime related, affiliated eyes faded
Big bodies paper plated stayin' shaded for federated
My crews full of nothin' but riders high off the Remy
Chuck Taylors neck pieces and knitted beenies (uh ha)
Mashin' on the regular hustlin' day and night
Went from chronic to water but now we pushin' the China white
Much loved by many but now by many hated

Doin' ten instead of me in my Benz on some twins 
Sippin' Hen smokin' indica bomb 
And keep my pedal to the metal til I'm high and gone 
I know you rich niggas hate me, can I keep it real and feel this rap shit? 
Didn't make me, got out the pen and flip the '97 
Drop Mercedes, I'm the placenta of no love 
Til the lord save me, straight thugs that'll dump slugs 
Til they fuckin' grave, mass murder motherfuckers to the front page 
When we hit, we empty clips til we get paid 
I've been a slave from my cradle to the grave 
Nigga, fuck the world, I was raised in hell

That's why we buck shit down and yell ""Fuck the world!"" 
I'd rather die here in hell then die doin' life in jail 
But take the shot with a Mac 12, order hits on the pack tailed
From the block to Wotts, we are thug niggas raised in hell 

I'm bailin' through the set wit a 40, smokin' a cigarette 
Blastin' my radio, oldie tunes by The Marvellettes 
Gangbangin' vets on parole as I stroll through 
They rassle Gz like two craps and they strapped too 
Oh how I love these niggas but I hate em with a passion 
But I ride for these motherfuckers, when I don't even ask 
Thug fashion from head to toe, I let the world know 
That this is Thug Life, motherfucker, til I leave this ho 
So as my knuckles drag the concrete, big homies hit the streets 
Transgressions under pressure, preyin' on the weak 
I sink like a fish, I wish upon a ghetto star 
If the enemies come through and ride on me they won't get far 
Big homey got out, hold 22's on a hang 
Runnin' around, sweatin' motherfuckers, talkin' bout ""Let's throw them thangs"" 
Bang, I hit him with a bat and heard his skull crack 
Then I got him the wind in the trach til he shattered, to get the Mac 

[Chorus]

It ain't no love for bitch niggas 
As I dump slugs and pull the plug on you bitch niggas 
Pick up my phone and have some thugs hit you trick niggas 
Wit on gloves or low tommy guns on them stitch niggas 
Hit niggas with H-K's, split niggas with AK's when we mash for the cash 
Doin' a hundred, blastin' buck shots off in that ass 
True outlaws ready for war, souls will never die 
The same day we meet death, the same day we ride 
Dumpin' slugs with Tek 9's, more bulletproofs my 4-5 
I just let em fly, screamin' out ""Bitch nigga die"" 
We's about be a killer nigga, look outside 
Tell me one reason why I should pray for eternal life 
Born and taught in hell, with a gun store on every corner 
Bodyguard, bulletproof doors, it's hard to be a goner 
Strapped with heat, these West Coast streets of Killafornia 
From day one, they have straps on em, 'cause we was raised in hell

You ain't never had the shit til you got dug by a thug

I'm having a ball
Watch out for I fall
I'm headed for the girl that's standing on the wall
No flashing no bills
Just testing my skills

Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President (Me and my homies is wonderin' what's goin on, holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
Cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies want to die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ride for M'Thulu like I ride for Geronimo

These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Oh you'se a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
Cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness, amongst the crashed and the heartless
And young soul bros, ready to rode a star ship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Want to ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin' pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin' to drastic measures tryin' to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin' better
But you keep, tellin' us, that it is
While your motherfuckin' troops keep killin' our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin' with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Strapped and angry, with no hope and heart broke
Fightin' first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggas lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
To people beefin' and things, squeakin' on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
For a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223's'll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
And I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
And it ain't gon' get better

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I want to meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin' for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin' low?
Y'all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President, hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin'?
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle til we come up
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. Clinton, shit
It's gettin' harder and harder for a motherfucker
To make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin' for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin', all the blacks and
Police beatin' me in the streets, fuck peace
These niggas actin up in the hood, send mo' troops",Letter to the President,1999
Big Skye,"There you go, 
Acting like a hoe

I don't know why I'll be fucking with you

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a hoe into a housewife, baby, and there you go

There you go, actin' like a hoe

Hoe! Girl you need to check yourself

These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin' hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin' too much
When she be dyin' to fuck me you be buyin' her stuff, hoe

See girlfriend I know, your whole M.M.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20 it ain't Outhin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a hoe? but there you go

How she, don't even trip she got a man at home
You need to stop chasin' dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like, damn, we can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty, and stop callin' while I'm workin' you hurtin' me
All this bullshit is irkin' me girl, but there you go

I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
'Cause there you go, just like a hoe, caught in the streets
Like givin' yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin', so stop playin'(hoe)
You hear what I'm sayin, you only good for parlayin'
I'm layin' down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby 'cause I stay on the move

Big Skye,"[Syke talking]
Ain't been no love around here for a long time
When the love gon' come back
Huh, I don't know, I don't know
But till then, keep doing it like I do it

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed,
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related,
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear,
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last,
What's the aftermath all I know, is ain't no love

[Chorus: G-Money]
Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
It ain't no love fuck the love
See I'ma thug wit mad slugs
And trippin' off these hoes up under my rug
Blind and I can't see sometimes
 
This Remy Martin got me high
Givin' my shit a try,
My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down wid me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
They say reach in your heart and you will find yo mind
Everyday in the streets got my foresight blind
My aftertime is narrow peepin' down the barrel of a four
Just a nigga or a killa I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some want to die I want to stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka duckin' season, gimme the reason
Why I should change into a softy,
After livin' so lofty
It cost me my soul outta control in a devil's world
Me my niggas and my girl,
It ain't no love

[Chorus til fade]",Ain't No Love,2002
Big Skye,"Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama, busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

""And come off this trip""

Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
From him scrappin when niggas was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""

Big Smo,"I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up
'Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day
Fired my truck up, grabbed my coffee
Kissed my baby, got on my way
'Cause I'm workin' 'til it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's pay
So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's wage

Yeah, I'm up early with the birdies, ready to get dirty
This ain't a song for you if you asleep at 7:30
I rise like the sun; I'm the bag of the pounds
A full throttle in the bottle like that home-made shine

I'm just tryin' to make a livin', boss man trippin'
My overtime's strong; I don't pay him no attention
Money in the mason jar, country boy pension
No lady, three kids, take a lot to fill the kitchen

Fingernails dirty, my back stay hurtin'
You can bet I got to play for every penny that I'm earnin'
I ain't askin' for a raise, but I know the boss heard me
Nobody on this job site's workin' like I'm workin'

Thirty below to a hundred degrees
You ain't pushin' hard enough if your hands don't bleed
I'm the first to clock in and the last to leave
I ain't never had a problem rollin' up my sleeves

I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up
'Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day
Fired my truck up, grabbed my coffee
Kissed my baby, got on my way
'Cause I'm workin' 'til it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's pay
So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's wage

I'm out the door by the sun up, focused on the come-up
We never sleep in, that ain't how we was brought up
I push it to the limit when the money gets low
And been known to work past when the plant whistle blows

Pay check feelin' like a lottery ticket
I might save a couple bucks if my kids don't spend it
It don't matter cause I love it every day of my life
Spent more time on the clock than I do with my wife

State to state, never late, puttin' miles on the road
Drop it off, fill it up, get me to my next load
Call my old lady, let her know I'll be late
And I ain't worry cause I know that she goin' to save me a plate

I told you
Thirty below to a hundred degrees
You ain't pushin' hard enough if your hands don't bleed
I'm the first to clock in and the last to leave
I ain't never had a problem rollin' up my sleeves

I woke up this mornin', tied my boots up
'Cause I knew it's goin' to be a long day

'Cause I'm workin' 'til it's hurtin'
That's the only way to make an honest day's pay
So I'm workin' even when it's hurtin'

Workin', workin'

Workin', workin'

Kissed my baby, got on my way

Big Smo,"To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him didn't have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business no one dared to make a slip
For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side slowly lookin' all around
He's an outlaw loose and running came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

The morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death

There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

It's the Kam, god damn I guess I am kinda sexy

Cause I'ma hog baby, straight up, you think I'm ugly?
Well I keep it so real girls still want to fuck me
You see what gutter niggaz do to catch a houserat?
Just use peanut butter and a bigger mousetrap

'c'mon big money! Big money!'

Oh you funny but sonny I ain't just some hoochie you can yank up
By the time you finished with this coochie you be bankrupt {*whistle*}

But don't trip, at least you got some nice partin gifts

Shit, I lifts up skirts and pull panties to the side
F**kin with me, you be swallowin more than your pride
I ride like Bloods and Crips between them hips
until you sayin 'Hold up!' I leave both your lips swoll up

[Ms. Red Bone]
I don't know about all that goin down South biz
But if you want to bet then put some coochie where your mouth is

Friends killin friends for paper, what a shame (uhh)
And everybody thinkin they players, what a game (damn)

I done seen this whole shit change
Looked again and realized that ain't shit changed (WHAT?!)
Except the fact that I'm a grown man now (uhh) standin on my own two
Used to hate guns, now a nigga own two (C'MON!)

Twin glocks for cops and use I promise to
I ain't goin out like Amadou, you know what I'ma do (AIGHT?)
So sit back and try to visualize if you can
All the stories of a wise man - walk with me

[Chorus]
Look at my life.. look at how I live
Look at what I go through.. so what I've got to give (THIS IS IT!!)
Look at my li-ife.. look at how I live
Look at what I go through.. so what I've got to give (THIS IS IT!!)

[Big Stan]

(My nigga!) 
Now I've done seen life play jokes with death as a punchline
In a world with no hope, struggle to get mine
I was raised in a time of regret and bad news (uh-huh)

So I was taught my values by bad dudes (uhh)
Hustlers and killers.. they taught me wrong from right
Told me everything that's wrong is right, like
Hopin' a train, poppin' the thing

And havin' hot blocks poppin with 'caine, lockin' the game (Come on!)
And the more shit, change, the more it's the same
And the more you try to get rid of it, the more it remains
You remember when the kid's dream to get to the top

Was bein' doctors, firemen, even the cops?
Look at the kids now, lost, no hope
To get ahead they plan to rap, play ball, or sell dope (ooooh)
And if you thinkin we the problem you wrong
A generation died at the same time our fathers was born

[Chorus]

[Big Stan]
I've seen a broken home influence a good kid to go bad
'Cause boys with sane minds to go mad (uhh)
And young girls to lose they innocence so fast
And so often the results are so sad

Losin' her skirt, don't even know what flirt means
So a baby's poppin' up with a baby at thirteen (damn)
A few years, she tried to settle down with her man
Tried to stop fuckin' all them other niggas and can't

Though she want to, the curse got her doin' this dirt
'Cause she saw mommy do it whenever daddy went to work (damn)
And it hurts, I know the pain call it the truth
Bad parents are destroyin' the youth, I been there (WHAT?!)

I've watched men beat on my mother my whole life
So when I hit my baby mother I thought it was alright (NO!!!)
Maybe if I woke up and them niggas was gone
I would of knew that all the hittin' was wrong, talk to me

I need to talk I'm so tired of trying to run, Father
Let's take a walk I'm so sorry for what I've done, Father
It ain't my fault The devil's been on my back lately He's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle But it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual But I need you, God
A lot of things that I used to I don't want to
Runnin' the streets like I used ta
I know I'm gonna speak the word for you one day
Up in the light -- Hallelujah!! -- on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life the blessings that you have saved me
And for my wife
You have carried me enough times and that's the truth
Carried me through the rough times throughout my youth
And through it that I saw you was still wit me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin' to get me

I'm lookin' at life a lil' different now since you hugged me
And I always loved my people but now they love me
Thank you for the love, Lord, we praise ya
Jacob, ascendants, from Africa to Asia
Bleeding the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout your name in times of need
And times of joy and when we bleed
And when we are overcome with grief
You don't have to tell me twice; I'm a take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I never knew I had 
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad, 
All praise is due to ya, that's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya, 
Thank you Father

Uh I never knew a love like this before
Messin' with the Thug Life, I missed it all
Open up the doors and let me in 
I'm done wit the cards so let's begin
Prayers that you give to me, I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now you got me smiling
From inside of my heart when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain any more only sunshine
No pain anymore.... I really love mine
You wash away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, in thirty years
You know that
One day I'll speak the word
You know that!
When I do, I will be hear
You know that!

And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin' all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round. Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair cause the game ain't fair
And I'll take it there fuckin' with the right one baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one baby

I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas

Ain't no one goin' turn me 'round

The places where they send you, and it's easy to go

Stand you in a row

You could just say no

Everybody goes
As far as they can,
They don't just care.
They stood on the stairs
Laughing at your errors
Your mother's dead
She said, ""Don't be afraid.""

Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handling my business nigga keep on coasting
Where you going I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowing against the grain niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit

Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

We gotta go  (gotta go, gotta go)
We gotta go (yeah baby) (it's check it out time)
We gotta go (let's go nigga, gotta go)
We gotta go (Y'all know what time it is!) (Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man)
We gotta go (call that valet motherfucker, tell him to get a nigga shoe)
We gotta go ('cause we out this, motherfucker)

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
'Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
'Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

We gotta go (ayo man Pac ay)
We gotta go (where the where the fuck is Daz at man?)
We gotta go (This nigga locked up or somethin'?)
We gotta go (The only one not to leave) (yo man)
We gotta go (it's check out time it's time to get out this mother)
We gotta go (You seem them bitches?)
We gotta go (We out man, fuck that shit)
We gotta go (Yo Rece!)
We gotta go (Yo nigga, whassup, whassup?)

Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go
We gotta go (Ay, it's check out time)
We gotta go (Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin')
We gotta go (where my shoes go, nigga?)
We gotta go (where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?)

Big Syke,"[Syke talking]
Damn, the world's so crazy out here,
Never know what's going on,
Never know why things happen,
But they do,
Well just take it

Verse 1:

As my inner thoughts of reality set in, another day begins,
Cause you never know you were alseep until ya wake up
Will me and my ex-girl make up?,
I don't know but life's a question,
After death is there a resurrection?
Cause the chaos and the mayhem got me crazy,
When will I have my first baby?,
But is there love there?, do I really care?,
I swear, life ain't fair
So much pain and sorrow
Will I see tomorrow
Make a path for my kids to follow,
So it's me against the world,
Can't nobody talke to me
I need psychotherapy,
Forever I cry inside,
I can't hide,
Just tell me why

Chorus:

Why do we do the things that we do? (Just tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do? (Tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do? (Tell me why)
Why do we do the things that we do?

Verse 2:

A little kid's refelection is a shadow of death
Just behind him are his first steps
But nobody cares it's just everybody for theyself
So pray to Yahweh if you need help
Cause love don't love nobody alone
Can I stay strong? can I move on?
But I gotta get used to my past being my future road
Seldom travelled but never told,
The world is crazy my mind is paralyzed,
And hypnotized by these walk-bys
Families cry from dead souls lost
I guess our future pays the cost, I want to floss,
But we drownin' in poverty,
My homie said he was gonna get wid me but ain't got wid me
It's so hard on a G tryna elevate in the game
And there's no way to escape the pain
Tell me why

Chorus

Verse 3:

So many trials and tribulations,
We livin' in desperation
Everyone's givin' up there's no motivation,
Organization or self determination
The youth is fallin' and callin' the OGs
Hand up some kis or get degrees, Lord please
I can't take it the world is comin' to an end,
So God forgive me for my sin
Cause I ain't never had a thang, will it change?
So I can rearrange,
The game ah life is the hardest game yet
Cause nobody knows what's coming up next
No respect, for our elders cause they fightin' us scared
what happened to the love we once shared, no one cares
So I soak my pains in Remy Martin and gettin' high
I know that's not the answer,
So I ask why?

Chorus

[Kid #1]: Syke why everybody die?
[Kid #2]: Why the world so crazy?,
[Kid #3]: Why everybody go to jail?
[Kid #4]: Why little kids get kidnapped?

5-1-0 and 2-1-3 is you a baller or a G?

Ha ha ha. 
To thug or not to thug? 
To G or not to G? 
See that's the question. 
Every time I hit L.A. I get love you know 'cause I'm from the Bay.
Dub see, Big Syke you know Spice 1,  feel me. 
Count the dollars on the Lexy don't waste your time 
Let it shine let it shine let it shine
Mizzolas and 850 flossin' I'm tossin' 
Doobies up out the window smokin' often coughin'
Chokin' hard up off the indo smoke
My mens with extra clips Hennessy Lemon squeeze begin to dip on me
The G with the strap up on my side
Keepin' these haters upon they toes 'cause they know I'm ready to ride
Hide but you can't get away
This is your dead homie you should of put your tool away
But you still pull it on me, see I ain't trippin' 
I got foot soldiers that do dirt for me
Love me enough to hurt for me and do some work for me
Black roses is sent to the families with all the lives lost
Kill 'em soft pay off my henchmen like a mob boss
Mobster ballin' out the hooptie
Who could it be? S.P.I.C.E.

Sound like baller I'm caught up in troubled times
Destiny knows help me free my mind
What can I do but stay true and be a man
I'm just doin' what I can
Migrate to Oakland lay low with my dog Spice
Hang out with killers and dodge device
Gotta pay the price took a life or maybe two (was it two?)
I wouldn't of done it if I didn't have to
In the wrong place at the right time evil minds learkin'
Thought I was over peerkin' searchin' for a home I feel alone
On these cold streets, sleepin' on couches with no sheets
God guide me hide me from incarceration and start this desperation
I'm facin' more time then I really got to give
Damn I want to live in 2-1-3

[Chorus]

It's the Dub S.C. on G parolee
And although deez steadily grinding for cheese
Trunk fulla keys on my way O.T. from 5-1-0 to the 2-1-3
I puts it down bendin' the corner with my all blue Chevy
My mind on gettin' the fetti, my heater cocked back and ready
With G's crime related, affiliated eyes faded
Big bodies paper plated stayin' shaded for federated
My crews full of nothin' but riders high off the Remy
Chuck Taylors neck pieces and knitted beenies (uh ha)
Mashin' on the regular hustlin' day and night
Went from chronic to water but now we pushin' the China white
Much loved by many but now by many hated
Trippin' off the the haters lookin' mad 'cause we made it
But don't get mad at me because I executed the game
I got my hustle on lock you can do the same

Ain't been no love around here for a long time
When the love gon' come back
Huh, I don't know, I don't know
But till then, keep doing it like I do it

[Verse 1: Big Syke]
From the first day of birth it was like we was cursed,
For our destiny to ride away in a hearse
Unseen tomorrows so many hearts are hollow
Can't help 'em they'll put me down if I let 'em
I'm givin' fifty feet to the average friend or foe
And I'll kill you fo' you kill me if you don't know
Cause sometimes God put you in the path to kill
But not if your intentions are to hurt or steal
Constantly surrounded by despisers that's intoxicated
Cause all of us are gang related,
Later years fully gettin' there
What do we have here?
One day every family shall shed a tear,
I'm lost I can't find myself, I listen but don't learn
What's the call for help will God let me burn
So I'm takin' everyday like I'm livin' my last,
What's the aftermath all I know, is ain't no love

[Chorus: G-Money]
Love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
I said love don't love nobody
And love don't love no one
It ain't no love, it ain't no love

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
It ain't no love fuck the love
See I'ma thug wit mad slugs
And trippin' off these hoes up under my rug
Blind and I can't see sometimes
 
This Remy Martin got me high
Givin' my shit a try,
My people doubt me why
Hey, I'm way too fly
Thinkin' everybody down wid me until I die
Just like in a nightmare
Straight to fuck from nowhere
Nine's in yo back like you ain't seen jack
Now sticky situations make a motherfucka feel
Like going straight to hell cause at least hell is real
I'm holdin' shit down like a motherfuckin' vet
I'm a real nigga doin' real things, and that you can bet...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Big Syke]
They say reach in your heart and you will find yo mind
Everyday in the streets got my foresight blind
My aftertime is narrow peepin' down the barrel of a four
Just a nigga or a killa I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest
Slug in the chest one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
The desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some want to die I want to stay alive
Eyes on the prize let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucka duckin' season, gimme the reason
Why I should change into a softy,
After livin' so lofty
It cost me my soul outta control in a devil's world
Me my niggas and my girl,
It ain't no love

Now how can I survive with one live without a vest and 4 5? 
Runnin' from the Task Fo' but smashin' for my cash 
Bankin' corners hop it then I blast on their ass 
See them piggies want me dead for sure or in the pen 
Doin' ten instead of me in my Benz on some twins 
Sippin' Hen smokin' indica bomb 
And keep my pedal to the metal til I'm high and gone 
I know you rich niggas hate me, can I keep it real and feel this rap shit? 
Didn't make me, got out the pen and flip the '97 
Drop Mercedes, I'm the placenta of no love 
Til the lord save me, straight thugs that'll dump slugs 
Til they fuckin' grave, mass murder motherfuckers to the front page 
When we hit, we empty clips til we get paid 
I've been a slave from my cradle to the grave 
Nigga, fuck the world, I was raised in hell 

[Chorus] 
That's why we buck shit down and yell ""Fuck the world!"" 
I'd rather die here in hell then die doin' life in jail 
But take the shot with a Mac 12, order hits on the pack tailed
From the block to Wotts, we are thug niggas raised in hell 

I'm bailin' through the set wit a 40, smokin' a cigarette 
Blastin' my radio, oldie tunes by The Marvellettes 
Gangbangin' vets on parole as I stroll through 
They rassle Gz like two craps and they strapped too 
Oh how I love these niggas but I hate em with a passion 
But I ride for these motherfuckers, when I don't even ask 
Thug fashion from head to toe, I let the world know 
That this is Thug Life, motherfucker, til I leave this ho 
So as my knuckles drag the concrete, big homies hit the streets 
Transgressions under pressure, preyin' on the weak 
I sink like a fish, I wish upon a ghetto star 
If the enemies come through and ride on me they won't get far 
Big homey got out, hold 22's on a hang 
Runnin' around, sweatin' motherfuckers, talkin' bout ""Let's throw them thangs"" 
Bang, I hit him with a bat and heard his skull crack 
Then I got him the wind in the trach til he shattered, to get the Mac 

[Chorus]

It ain't no love for bitch niggas 
As I dump slugs and pull the plug on you bitch niggas 
Pick up my phone and have some thugs hit you trick niggas 
Wit on gloves or low tommy guns on them stitch niggas 
Hit niggas with H-K's, split niggas with AK's when we mash for the cash 
Doin' a hundred, blastin' buck shots off in that ass 
True outlaws ready for war, souls will never die 
The same day we meet death, the same day we ride 
Dumpin' slugs with Tek 9's, more bulletproofs my 4-5 
I just let em fly, screamin' out ""Bitch nigga die"" 
We's about be a killer nigga, look outside 
Tell me one reason why I should pray for eternal life 
Born and taught in hell, with a gun store on every corner 
Bodyguard, bulletproof doors, it's hard to be a goner 
Strapped with heat, these West Coast streets of Killafornia 
From day one, they have straps on em, 'cause we was raised in hell

And I'ma ask you is it runnin', baby?
You ain't never had the shit til you got dug by a thug
And fucked doggy style on a bear skin rug
Up and down stairs in the back of a limo
On interstate 5 on the way to San Francisco

I really go crazy baby
When I see a sexy girl

You make me,
You make me go

I'm having a ball
Watch out for I fall
I'm headed for the girl that's standing on the wall
No flashing no bills
Just testing my skills

I'm just in the kitchen cooking you dinner
Hey, you know what? I ain't even gon' be able to make it
I got to take care ah some business
What, what the fuck is your problem?
I'm tired ah this shit, I can't believe this shit

I was so in love with you
Did everything you want me too
Try my best to turn away
The temptation got ya here today
I really want to let you go
But my mind and body's telling me no
It's at your convenience,
So I spend all my time waiting on you
It's at your convenience
So I don't know what to do

Baby I'm bout my money and family and a woman that stands by me
So don't get upset when you can't find me
Don't tie me down,
I'll come around when my business is through,
I know you had plans and things for us to do but maybe you,
Think I'd rather be someplace maxin'
I'd rather be at your place relaxin',
Can't be no everyday quality time playa
I got bills and things to do so I'll see ya later
Wit you it's cool I'd be a fool not to get paid
Lay up under you and not pursue what needs to be made
Parlayin' ain't possible responsible for carryin' the weight
Who you lookin' at when the bills late, oh wait,
What about the trip you want to take to the Bahamas
Ain't gon' be no trip wid all this drama
Ask your momma, about a man always around not wantin' nothing,
Got to separate to get something,
It's at whose convenience?

For wantin' to have your baby
I tell 'em money's not the issue
It's all the time that I miss you
I want to know why ya friends come before me
All the free time you get you ignore me
Breaking dates, you're always late
You're making my love turn into hate
Why does it have to be this way
I thought it was forever and a day
I want it all now

So much trouble in the world baby
Can't nobody feel my pain
The strain and pressure in life you had to sacrifice sometime,
To stay on point on a thin line,
Find the closest denominator to stay together
Whatever choice may be, I'm ready for whatever
'Cause I slept alone and been alone many a nights
With no woman, why we argue over petty fights?
Alright I'm feelin' what ya sayin' okay,
Remember we did it in the Caddy on the highway
My way, I been used to for a long time
Souls are hard to combine, it takes time
Me and my homies have a bond and a plan
I'm your man, it's just some things you don't understand
Can we work it out and try to find a way?
Or never let it out and go our separate ways?
I don't know, huh-huh, but I can handle it baby

Big Syke,"[Syke talkin']
Yeah...... yeah,
The good times,
When you was a little kid
Playing in the yard, you know,

Verse 1:

It seems like yesterday I used to play around the way
Those were the good timez,
Growing up as a child, carefree,
Momma said I was wild by three
Even pops showed me love he was there
I remember hanging out playing truth or dare
Cowboys and indians, ring your bell and run
When the only thing we sprayed was water guns
We didn't have much so we made the best of,
What we could afford but we had love,
Tryna be grown might snick and curse
One tv set gotta cut it on first,
Back in the good timez and the Jeffersons
When ya next door neighbour was ya best friend
Those are the days I miss and reminisce...
So I steady wish, for the good timez

Chorus:

Nothing but the good timez on my mind, can I rewind,
The time back to my early days, as children play,
On the road to tomorrow, some passed away,
So my future feels hollow

Verse 2:

I'm thinking back on my history, in my elementary
I wonder do they still remember me?
That little bad as kid,
The boy that wanted someone to help him, but they never did
So off to the office I go, you know,
A problem case from the get go
Will I ever change before it's too late?
I need to study harder and get my life straight,
Moms and pops praying for the best for me
I was blind and I couldn't see
But they told me friends come and go as you grow
Focus in, play to win, or you will live low,
So I tried to do my best, failed every test
My life was becoming a mess
Even though the past years are far behind,
They in my mind... considered as a good time

Chorus


Verse 3:

I remember playing in the street wid my lil bro
Kickin' it wid Mental and Big K-Dog where you go?,
Dizzy D, Big Chip, rest in peace
Nissy T and all my other people de-ceased,
Can't let my memories slip away
No I ain't okay, cause I haven't seen you today,
Nothing but good timez, on my mind, can I rewind?
The time back when I used to have a seventy-nine 'Lac,
Wid a black phantom and I bought 'em selling crack,
I want 'em back, my teachers Miss Satedon, Miss Nor-ville
Encouraged me, and wished me well,
To excel in life, it's a high price,
Good advice, summer nights fist fights
Saying, things wouldn't be so bad,
If we got the things we never had

If I die right now there somethings I want to say
Don't plan for the future cause the future is today
Live ya life like ya dying, cause in reality you are,
Sometimes sacrificed, but keep praying to the stars

Verse 1:

Stay focused, they say the loc'est will die first
But the calm quiet type seems to be the worst, since birth
Off from the basket to the casket was obituary
To fulfill yo life is necessary, it's scary
That you gotta live to die, why ask why?
I need fortification in this situation passing by
Cryin' inside as I get high, as I ride
Through the Southside wonderin' when I'm gon' die
Fuck a try clock tickin' when ya born
When a baby enter this world we need to mourn
My heart's torn apart from the start
Things are never feelin' right,
Runnin' in the night tryna beam up satellite
Shot a kite to that homie feelin' lonely out here
It seems done into things dreams, and nightmares
Trapped in darkness regardless my mind's touched
Ambushed in poverty so life don't matter much
Such envy and misery surroundin' me my destiny,
Is to ball outta control,
Want a leader follow me on a illest journey searchin' for Yahweh
I'm campaigning for him nigga

Verse 2:

Once told time prosperity's not clear, no fear
My prospective can't find it but it's so near, reappear
Cause I'm almost dead steady dodgin' lead
Wanted by the feds, take me dead, feel what I said,
Step in this world die forever tryna make it
Make a plan get what you can cause niggas fake it
I had to take it cause I see you can't see me wid it,
Searching for greater days, are the ways to get it, shit it's,
Gettin' crazy in the land where nobody cares
A ?placebo? in the mist of the night air
Prepare to get yours, open doors to a money journey
Niggas is counterfeit so bullshit don't concern me,
Follow me and I'll take you where the Gs hang,
Where authentic hogs made it off the street fame
Check game I been and evil mind since '79
Now niggas want me to rewind,
On my way out nigga!

Chorus (along wid Syke)

Verse 3:

I know thugs that'll bury ya
I live in a drug area
Outta sight some nights'll get scarier,
Drivin' on a murder course, no remorse, can't feel,
Even through the pain and sufferin' we keep it real
Let's make a deal I get killed, by a black
If I do, gimme my life back,
On the attack mode, ice cold as I dip ghetto block
Blunt in my mouth, hand on my glock
Poppin' rocks is a past time hobby I take serious,
Some disappear it's mysteriously funny
It's about money where I live and stay
But still ain't got here to this day
I want to lay in a far deep away seclusion
But I can't get away it's an illusion
Nigga prostitution are the drug trade in the States
Like devil case, they all perpetrate,
I'm on my way out

Passin out bullets like they promo
Oh no, Outlawz comin through
Nothin but trouble too, we still do the shit that Pac used to do
Who would of knew, that I'd be pointin guns at you
Takin funs from you, makin fun at you
Busta, ain't nothin but a Jersey ride nigga
Have my fanny so white, enough to sniff lines nigga
Napoleon, a.k.a Maximus 
My plans for this, is rise up, stack chips, nigga rise

(Chorus-Kastro)
We was taught, at all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise

(Verse 3)
(Young Noble)
Addicted to adrenaline rush
That the streets give off from 5-0 when the heat bust off
And I paint it the same 'cause I mastermind
And every game ain't the same gotta change with the times
And get left behind, blessed by God
The judge tryin to stretch the charge
Young niggaz gotta rise up fuck the narcs 
Motha fuckaz can't take orders
You ain't a souljah nigga don't blame Noble
It's the life of ya kid 25 to life bid
Four five to wig, dyin tryin to live
The streets is a restin place and yesterday
And nigga ain't no such thing as extra pay
So give me mine today, and get yours tomorrow
Nigga Pac left the Thug Life love to follow
And I'm O-you-T loyal 'till my casket drop
Hustle hard 'till it's hard for the cash to stop, we must rise

(Big Syke)
Makaveli Kadafi, meant to Big Kato
Only ridaz in this day that's killin willin and able
Gang related incorporated, you can't fade it 
Haters gotta hate and ridaz glad that we made it
Make it take it to the next level
Now change the game, fuck the fame
Bang 'em scrape on the hang
It ain't no thang to rise above the rest
Pass any test, you mention Thug Life you mention the best
So invest in a vest, come bang with the best
The sunrise in the East but my set in the West
Still risin for my nigga Stretch, keep a tech
My paper stay risin whether cash or check

(Chorus-Kastro)
At all costs hold down fort
And let the Lord be the judge in this all out court
Where money, power, guns is boss
And countin big funs is the favorite sport
We must rise, maximize our size
Look alive, be advised it's a war outside
It's like dodge city, not pretty
But don't nobody notice it really you feel me, we must rise",Rize,2001
Big Syke,"I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' ""Fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life, maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust the hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
See, we live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

No one knows what the, future holds, for you
Haha, listen closely
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
After livin' so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggas, and my girl, livin' the good life!

We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
Uh ha, We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

I spend my days and nights not knowin' if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
Bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
We still tryin' to get a hold of the game
Livin' that good life

We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uhh
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't, uhh
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uhh
This is the good life, fuck my foes

Big Syke,"There you go, 
Acting like a hoe

I don't know why I'll be fucking with you

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction

And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin' too much
When she be dyin' to fuck me you be buyin' her stuff, hoe

See girlfriend I know, your whole M.M.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see

But should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do
'Cause there you go, just like a hoe, caught in the streets

Big Syke,"Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama, busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggas swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggas rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggas feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Brothers we better get hip""

""And come off this trip""

Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
Enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like Bruce Nolan, I'm rollin' until the diesel hit me
I'm battered and bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
When I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
From him scrappin when niggas was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Told life you'd be back"" ""There you were""
""Prince of peace must hear our plea""
""Everybody look around"" ""There is no hope""

Big T,"Hi, this is the Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous
Today we're interviewing Lil' Flip (what's up man)
So Lil' Flip tell me, how long have you been rapping
(man I've been rapping ever since)...

[Lil' Flip]
1995, I was in junior high
I saw a lot of shit, so I was glad to be alive
A lot of people died, but a lot of people here
And when I turned 15, my vision got clear

It's time to be a man, time to make a plan
It's cool to make a hundred, but it's best to make a grand
My Granny got sick, and then they found cancer
We got to pay the doctors, but God got the answer

The surgery went good, my Granny doing well
My baby on the way so I can't go to jail
And to my niggas on the block, stop selling rocks
'Cause I'm a tell the truth you can't outsmart the cops

You see what I did, I only drop hits
Chopping up game, why'all chopping up bricks
And some niggas snitch, cause they can't take the heat
How we gone go buy a system when the system got his beat

[Young Redd]
Hey, I'm from the home of the Astros, home of the Rockets
Born to rap yo, with a microphone in my pocket
Always thought I was grown, you couldn't tell me nothing
I would talk shit if you tried to tell me something

But I regret that, I had some minor setbacks
Old people thought my future would be jet black
All my years growing up, I thought life was a game
You can't make it real far, thinking life is a game

Yeah we lost a couple of friends, I almost lost my brother
I don't know what would of happened if we lost eachother
Everyday is something new, I just take it in stride
You only got one life, so enjoy the ride

Sometimes I was paid, sometimes I was broke
Me and Gray started hustling but my mama didn't know
But it's cool, cause now I'm into this music
The man gave us a gift and we loving to use it

And if you look real close you'll see
That you can only be you, and I can be me
'Cause can't nobody ever live my life but me
But you will never see what I see like me huh me

[Chorus: x 2]
And you don't know what I've been through
So you shouldn't judge me
And you don't know what I will and I won't do
So you shouldn't judge me

[Lil Ron]
It's getting harder now I just don't understand
Why the people in the world disgrace the black man
All that I could say, is pray and let it be
Little right and try your best not to end up like me

See I was the nigga that slang dope and steal cars
Glad I stopped before it led behind bars
Heart aches and scars, help me feel my way
Understand today I got a decision to make

Now do I want to live right or continue going wrong
I'm never at home this music keep a nigga gone
But this is what gets me, who are you to judge
'Cause I'm young and black, people still hold a grudge

Just a nudge right now'd push me over the end
When I was 14 I lost a very close friend
And ever since then my life ain't been the same
That's the biggest reason why I had to make a change

[Lil' Flip]
Never judge a book by it's cover, a man by his wealth
And if you already on your feet why don't you help somebody else
This what I was taught, so that's what I live by
'Cause you can't take none of this shit with you when you die

So everyday I try, to keep my head high
But these bird ass niggas always jump fly
Should I take em out the game, naw I'ma use my brain
I'm a kill em with kindness, and blow up my name

I came from nothing, and now I got a little change
A nigga happy now but I went through some pain
And everyday it rain, there's gone be some sunshine
I never thought I could put my whole life in one rhyme

[Chorus: x 2",What I Been Through,2002

They spent the money, he got greedy and put the pistol on him
Shots fired from both sides, but nobody died
I thank God he survived and got out alive
But this gon' hurt you to hear
Kenny went to jail, might be facing some years
Police say it's evidence he broke into someone's residence

You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

Rented a house in Niswah, Minnesota
Shrapnel and oil cans, rhubarb in the yard
I built a ladder out of metal pieces
Father was working hard
Standing beneath the oak tree by the front door
You were inside baking bread
Sister came out and put her arms around me
Blood gushing from my head
You held me in the backseat with a dishrag, soaking up blood with your eyes
I was just five and you were twenty-seven
Praying “don’t let my baby die”

If you wanna leave
You just have to say
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way
You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way

So much more to live your life
To walk the floor
To say goodnight
Do you leave your light on?
Do you leave your light on?

You’re all caught up inside
But you know the way",Mythological Beauty,2017

A vampire

Had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam

And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
Ninety miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with a part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines

And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail

Busta bust for short, for some better know me bust' rhymes
(What's good?) maintainin' (same here, just smashin')
(How the fam?) they all good my nigga, thanks for askin'
You and yours?

We all blessed, things ain't too bad
Still dealin' with last year's sudden loss of my dad
(Man, my condolences) thanks dawg, let's begin
Ain't seen you in a sec, busta what you been up to since then?

Stayin' healthy and keepin' it movin' while I just be showin'
These other niggas how to do it while I'm constantly growin'
I've been learnin' a lot, and still earnin' a lot of money crazy
Doin' my thing and securin' a win for all my babies

Aight, well it's clear in this new year you've been busy
But how you been dealin' with the drama of the loss of your man izzy?

It's been one of the most traumatic times and I'll never forget it
I'm survivin', thus bein' a punchin' bag for those affected
It's somethin' that I accepted, it was hard to understand
The way things happen, but in the end I guess it's god's plan

Word, heard you beefin' with five-oh, couple cases on rotation
And on top of that, bust' rhymes is now on probation?

Yeah, and I thank judge Stevens and we was happy to see
That he ain't send me up north 'cause I got a family to feed

Changed your image up last year, cut the dreads down low
And also, gave the appearance of some major muscles
Now on the low streets been talkin' like it usually do
Busta bust, help us out, the public needs to know

Just for the record the reason a nigga cut off the dread
I had to shed, tired of carryin' weight on my head
Secondly, it's all good when niggaz talk, well they need to back it up
Only needles I use is when I tat-tat-tat it up

Uh, some people sayin' you changed, even your flipmode fam (uh-huh)
I heard the word's came safe from rah digga and baby sham (right)
Said you (passed the courvoisier) to pick up a gun
Said you more concerned about bein' hard than havin' fun

Yo, wow tig', I see you takin' it there, you got your arsenal, huh?
I think I know where you got that from, that vibe article bruh
The press'll turn your family against each other for 'fetti, to sell a book
Besides we all talked already and we good

Wow, that's what's up, be clear it's goin' down
And if you wanna holla' at bust call us up right now
Phone lines is open, what y'all, wanna discuss?
What's good caller, you ""live in the den"" with big tig' and bust
(Hey tig'!) what's good ma? (enjoyin' the show)
(But there's somethin' about busta I've been dyin' to know)
Well holla at him

Hey busta (what's good ma?)
I've been a fan since way back when you dropped ""woo-hah""
(Woo-hah!) yeah, that was my joint
Every album since then always been on point
(Thank you) videos and big shows is hardcore
So why you think your albums haven't sold more?

Well baby, the nature of the business is unstable
Especially when your project ain't properly promoted by your label
E'ry album I put out gold or platinum, just a second
Check the hardware on my walls is major, just for the record

Read about you in a book or two
Now tell me bust, please discuss, were they all lies or some of it true?

Well I read about you in a couple of books too son
But I don't even know, tell me which book you readin' from

Aight, next caller

Hey busta, heard about you on Miss Jones
(Why you bringin' up old shit? you need to leave that alone)
So I'm sayin', is it true what she said?
Did you jump right out from between her legs and start fryin' eggs?

I can't remember exactly but I used to ride to her hood
And pick her up all hours a night, thought the pussy was good
'Bout fifteen years ago, shit
I can't imagine she'd remember that a nigga made a mean egg sandwich

I seen a couple websites try to put you on blast (uh-huh)
With your relationship with homegirl with the real fat ass

Who? you talkin' 'bout deelishis? yeah her body is vicious
She like trouble; thus we only friends, y'all made us a couple

How do you deal with the gossip, rumors and lies
And feelin' like each and every move you make is analyzed?

Yo, it's all good, you see the blessing is a gift and a curse
To be in a position I am, shit could be worse

I know my time's runnin' short so let me get to this thought
I'm sure you wanna thank your fans for all of their support

Absolutely, see y'all are why I shine like the sun
Big up to all my peeps who been ridin' with me since day one
It's why I walk the streets with pride, you niggas know how I shit it
It's why I rep it thorough for all the fans who stay committed

Busta, now you've been gettin' it in since way back when
So what you say to critics sayin' you can't do it again?

See I ain't gotta say shit to 'em, I'm off to somethin' else
Nigga check my résumé, bitch it speak for itself
It's why I always do what I do, and I big up my chest
God put his hands on me, you could see that I'm blessed
And I'm grateful

Aight, it's time to go
But I thank y'all for tunin' on in to the ""live in the den"" show

And if you don't know, now you know
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Don't hurt me
Desert me
Don't give up on me

What would I wanna do that for?

Don't use me

Thought I found someone I thought I finally could adore
But you failed my test, got to know her better so I wasn't the only one
But I'm willing to put my trust you, baby you could put your trust in me

Just like a count to three, you can count on me and your never gonna see
No numbers in my pocket
Anything I'm doing girl I'll drop it for you
'Cause you're the one I'm giving my heart to but I gotta be the only one

You should put yours over my heart

Never been so vulnerable

Big Time Rush,"don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you.

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true

You

I could never get into the party
Never really understood what it was
What’s the big deal anyway?

Oh, I but I decided I should give it a try
The very moment you gave me the invite
I’ve never seen anything like it before
Once you open the door, see I was like

Feels like confetti falling
And it’s a celebration,
Feels like a celebration

Even the butterflies can feel it
Then bliss came with mister first kiss
It was better than they ever explained it

I think I even saw cupid flying round
I caught a glimpse before the lights went down
And when I turn to see the stars in your eyes, I realize, then I was like
