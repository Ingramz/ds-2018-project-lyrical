T.I.,"Bustin' out the bando
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip
I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the F&N make my hip limp
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips
And my bank roll got a big dip
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip
I got drugs in the alley, no tip there
She just wanna have a good day
Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A
I want them birds 'til next May
Never let em fly away
What!? I heard ay
Listen what my nigga Tip say

If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

I'm packin' 11, I'm packin' 11
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe
I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend
Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras, I told on these bitches
When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches

Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I'll be damned if a nigga wipe a hood hoe
Learned that from UGK back in ""Pocket Full of Stones""
Put your money down I could book a hard four
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
But while I flood the shit sick got prob' oh
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga
No murder, no dough, no convo

If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time

Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras, I told on these bitches
When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches

Aye, what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin in the trap, slangin good blow
Maybach used to slang that crack
Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK
If you ever took a loss better bring that back
Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout that
Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me
Because, bye-gones, we don't let em be
Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony
For real, if you listen I can get you paid
But not interested in shit you say

If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time

What you gonna do when I pull up on you, nigga?
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
Pussy nigga know that he a cat like Tigger
(For sure, for sure)
Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

How many niggas standin' around you would die for you?
I’m not bein' funny but if I come through there sprayin'
All them niggas turn to 4 wheelers
Honestly, truth be told, YSL won't fold
Pick his ass off from the balcony
Walk into the house and change clothes
YSL, wipe a nigga nose
We don't give a damn if it's indoors or outdoors
We gotta have that, gon' grab that
Nigga go stab that, smack that shit
Every day I keep the bands on me, I'm a lick
If a nigga think I'm sweet then his tongue gettin' split
I ain't doin' any features unless you give me your bitch
I'ma fuck for the cash then she gettin' robbed by Tick

Eww eww eww
Eww eww eww, eww

Hundred bands inside of my pants
Make the mothafucka dance on the stage
Aye, bitch, it's a parade
Pourin' 4s is a sport, Leanorade
50 whole k spent on my hygiene
Drinkin' so much lean that my pee clean
808 just might be the dream team
Bitch got some good brain, call her Pinky
Bag full of weed, no lighter
In the kitchen wrappin', rappin' like a cypher
You know damn well, I like her, I'mma bite her
In a Bentley on West Lee gettin' trailed by sniper
How the fuck you feel that I don't mean nothin'?
All them years in the bando, no clean nothin'
Runnin' to the cops, tell 'em I don't serve the fiend nothin'
Pullin' off like ""SIKE!""
Bitch I got the bando, fifty hundreds
Spot 'round the corner filled up with onions
Big homie got a whole truckload
Me and Scooter take a trip to New Mexico
All I ever wanted was the money
All I ever wanted was the money
Put your hands in the air if you dare
Any motherfucker to step over here
F&N put 'em in a wheel chair

Teflon, bulletproof the Lambo
Hate rats, got my niggas in the fed
Got money in the bank and money on my head
Really? Niggas sound silly
Wanna talk money, yeah, just counted ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga better Google me
Boy, I really made a million out the fuckin' streets
Boy, I had a white car back in '04
Back in runnin' wood days and ride low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you, nigga?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer
Nah, LA Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the jacks, empower the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

My auntie did 20 years, my pop did like 16
My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?
Really, ho, Billie Jean jackets in my video
Causin' all this racket, on a tennis court
Really made a million in a kitchen fork
Skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt, dinner fork
Often offended, I told that bitch to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends, that's what it is
Verbal telekinesis
Korrupt mixed with Jesus
Big Meech mixed with Yeezus
Keep playin' them games and get shot from them bleachers
I still got my stripes when I'm not wearing Adidas
Got a fresh hairline from Peter
Got me a hockey mask, choppers, started talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter
Niggas ain't killing shit, niggas they playing
They saying they killing shit
Got me an A and a K and a 220 trey
And the shit hit, might burn a little bit
I'm like, ""Really, little bitches, say really""

Fuck these niggas
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me
Niggas say they gon' kill me

Brand new Benz with the top down
In my old neighborhood, all the cop 'round
I don't give a fuck, motherfucker, act up
Let him and the police hear how the Glock sound
Comin' with the bullshit, get shot down
Sucker free, no fly zone in my town
And there ain't no discussion
It's simple, you try me we gon' get to bustin'
I promise, my nigga, you want it, my nigga?
My young niggas ready, they goin' on God
They act like they know ain't no God
We so official, for sure, no facade
Trap a nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my .44 in the door
I'n not finna play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K, myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
Give your boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect, boy, you violate me, we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map
And you still reachin' your hand out for no dap
My demonstration in exchange for your hatin'
I put this flame all in your face, boy you fakin'
We come through in Mercedes and shoot you
You'd think Call of Duty would make it
Bacon, I get my moolah off top
He don't give me my moolah, off top
Give a damn what the naysayers say
And we waitin' a day in the A with the K and I'm gone

I'm ridin' 'round, 7 pounds, nigga, Will Smith
It's a whole heck of y'all and a whole deck of cards
This shit right here you can't deal with
Two ice cubes and some cognac
Spent some time in twin towers, I ain't goin' back
Spent my commissary on some M&M's thinkin' I was Eminem
Runnin' Aftermath in all black
I'll slaughter your house with 5 9's
Leave all of you niggas with crooked eyes
Got the Louisville Slugger, Big Papi Ortiz
Knockin' every button off your buttoned up sleeves
Please that's Jeezy the Snowman
Comin' straight to your window like Bruh Man
Said I ain't killin' your dog but stealin' my hog and fuck my conscience
Puttin' bullets in your doberman, don't fuck with Compton
Don't you fuck with Kendrick, don't fuck with Problem
Don't fuck with YG, I'm Mr. Miyagi, Daniel San, I handle them
My handle's dumb, I had no gun
Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuckin' dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Boi around
And when a nigga say ""Timber"", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down
Fuck you clowns, yeah I put the word on you niggas
Don't A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at T.I.P. or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that Detox come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over
Soulja!

I feel like saying something that's for us, that defines what's in our hearts

Kickin' flave on the gold coast, doing the most
We poppin' gold bottles, twenty thousand toes
In Ibiza, you and me can take a walk on the moon
My watch got it showing in the middle of June
And we can kick it on the water when it's hot on the streets
On the yacht, somewhere south of Paris (gettin' money)
I'll let you get the black card if you play alright
Make you shine on sight, any the day or night
I could never be a bad as they say I be
But I could be good if the wood be good

Get her out dem tennis shoes
Throw some heels on a bi'
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bi'
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle
Drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can write this shit
No further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick
She wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach
From Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes
But I’m looking for a cuter bitch
You the shit

T.I.,"And nigga P said he wanted inspiration (Damn P)
I was really more on some ""fuck the word"" shit so let's see
(Fuck these niggas man, real talk)
I'm a man of respect, man of the people
I stand up to God, to the man of no equal
Man of respect, man of the people
I stand up to God, to the man of no equal

Ain't no breaking me down, bitch I'm breaking the banks
And ain't no holding me down, even if you holding the shanks
I'm controlling the time, nigga thinking some things
Got the heart of a lion, and I'm as strong as a tank
Sittin' on my thrown and my crown, can't separate me from that
I'm king of all us fate, God say be patient for that
Man all I got is my gangster, better not go playing with that
Anything get taken from us, my folk, we takin' in back
Bet we go take us some lives 'fore we go take it to law
Boy I got fire in my eye, look at me see gauges go off
Watch how you come at your fate, nigga better be saving your thoughts
Boy all you got is a cape, I make the nation go off
And nigga who put fear in your heart, respect me
Take a act of God 'fore a nigga check me
Hundred P's and Q's what a nigga best be
Who you got your money on? Bet me, let's see
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirring it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

I stay silent with red even if I'm standing with blue
Whether you're requested or not, bet my demand'll get through
They may be killer to you, hey they my family dude
And anybody could get it, but especially you
These nigga pressin' me, testin' me, what you suggestin' we do?
And wait a second, push your pawn, to play chess with these dude
Yeah we could jump 'em and check em, by sprayin' techs at these fools
Make it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose
You bad, makin' that move, your best move
Or end up in the pen like the next dude
Remeber, there's very few like you they let through
They even fewer, they don't want it, now they get through
To get to the level you on, hard to do homes
More nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong
And you gone, out of there, nigga see you later
'Less you beat 'em a year later, Boosie tell 'em
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble

You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

Get T.I. in the shack, handshake it with 5
Still politicin' with 6, this probably as real as it gets
And bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry
Ain't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity
Say what my pedigree? Silent, guess you talkin' bout I shot it
Bitch you never been to war like I ain't never been to college, c'mon
Fuck what you tellin' me, done lied chill with it
I know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em
Said in court you took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda
Let them sucka niggas rob you, they ain't kill you but they shoulda
And a robbery for me is like a suicide mission
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence, I swear
You and me ain't even fit to compare
I ain't make it all these years on no wing and a prayer
Starin' a bigger nigga out while he standing right there
Got a problem I'ma handle it right there
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirring it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there

Huslte Gang bang green all about a dollar
Better hold her hand if you give a shit about her
When you bring her round me, all I know
I'mma get some head right before I go
Gotta problem we can handle this shit off top
Got the thing let it pop, cool as a cough drop
100 on the watch ball and a decade in
None of my niggas fighting 'less the rest came in
Was a trial defendant, sitting till the check came in
100 of them 21 run it do it again
I ain't got no co-defendant just my family and friends
And a trunk full of chopper rifles, handles and pins
Loaded down in an old brown Buick sedan
Lookin' for it on the way to Alabama again

Insane in the brain, gone mental

With some bad bitches wanna chill like a mentos
Now here's a mental memento, you didn't know
You can fit a bird times 12 in Sorentos

Atl, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles' Disco, Daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple 'til he walked out with a bag
And we got back in the car
What you wanna be he asked?
When you grow up big head?
I just wanna be like you
Ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shared a couple laughs, couple summer pass
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out
For that reason 10 years he won't be around

Picture me in '93
I'm the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch
Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID
Introduce me to the crack game
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir
Welfare, food stamps
Section eight, me and Ma lived in the trap
I said fuck school, it holdin' me back
I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that

Look at me, at 17
Livin' on my own, peddlin'
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed
Tokin' too, cost my first felony
That's one of many, that were to follow
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Told a child I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time
Wake up, 10 years of your life passed
When you get your cake up
Don't it seem like that
When the Feds on your ass passin' out

If you think that you high, baby look above you
It's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do
So left, two, three snap
Right two, three snap

Go to Standing Rock and wanna poison water

I ain't dead nigga, you can take the fame and the chedder
And the game, any deal, I'm still a go-getter
Take my freedom for the moment but it ain't fo-ever
I got the spirit of a god, heart of a dope dealer
I'm a king, seen hangin' with some cold killas
I ain't never back down or ran from no nigga
I ain't sat down yet, pimp, standin' gorilla
Even if I'ma all alone or standin' with four niggas
Tell'em jump, pimpin' it don't get no realer
5'9"" with the soul of a 6'4"" nigga
I separated the fakes, paralyzed from the waist down
From the real stand up guys of the A-Town
Can't even look me in my eyes, put yo face down
I'm outta jail nigga, what you gotta say now?

Hey don't ya wanna be high? 
Hey listen baby come fly with me, take a ride, get high with me. 
I know you wanna be high. 
You never wanna say bye to me, if you ever come fly with me. 
Hey don't ya wanna be high? 
Hey, listen baby, come fly with me, take ride, get high with me. 
I know you wanna be high. 
Promise you'll never say bye to me, if you ever get high with me.

The bucket's on tilt, truck is on stilts 
I did another deal today, at least a couple mil'. 
No I'm askin' you to chill, wanna pat that down I'm tryin to pick you up 
And never put your ass back down. 
Get rid of all your worries, why you draggin' that around? 
Here pop one of these and now pass that around. 
Fire it up, take a shot, now your ass in the clouds. 
Can I bend ya over, throw your ass back down? 
No need sayin' no, we way pass that now. 
I ain't them other niggas, just control the flashback now.
Make three wishes, you can have that now. 
Fuck the finacin', payin' cash right now. 
Miracle man, make your dreams come true. 
Take a ride, get high, bout time you come too.
Bet ya life done changed, ya likin' my last name Done 
Had a couple babies, with a Bentley and a Range. 
Crib on the water, eatin' meals on the plane 
And ya life in the sky like you lived on a plane. 
So much good shit to fill ya brain, 
If the band seem strange, I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]

You see me chillin' out, kickin back in the ride, 
With fly broad on the passenger side. 
Got a nice smile and immaculate eyes. 
Fore' she get inside, she don't have to decide.
Cause she can have it like she want it, we can do it like that. 
And I went and threw it to her and she threw it right back. 
She say nobody gave it to her like that, Hit it from the back, 
I figure you would like that. 
Her head and tight pussy good like that 
And damn she ain't even from the hood like that 
So she probably never kicked it with a cool nigga other niggas had her, 
Didn't know what to do with her. 
Intimidated by her face and her cute figure. 
Cause her waist real small and her ass way bigger 
Don't she know that if I want her, I ain't finna play with her. 
All I gotta do is spend a A with her

[Chorus]

Hey what it is, pretty girl, 
Would you like to come and kick it with a nigga for a night or two 
And you can take your clothes off if you like to. 
And it don't matter 'bout the cost if I like you I just do it shorty, 
I ain't gotta try t. Bust a move, bet ya I can set a fire in you. 
Me chase round behind you? Why boo? 
I'm like you, you know you fly, but I'm fly too. 
You know how to do it, always ride good. 
Match the paint with the wheels, the trunk and the hood. 
You dealin' with a real nigga, get it understood. 
I'm still in the hood, even when in Hollywood. 
With my beat down low and my top let back 
You lookin' for a G. well you got just that
Well I can be a King and you can be my princess Baby all you gotta do is say yes.

Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool you don't want no trouble
Can we lean it to the left, but gas they car
I'm always superclean when you see me on the block

Look
Bet all you see is tats money grills and chains
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain
Names changed but the situation still the same
The bill need payin' n**** simple and plain
Young n**** whos aspiring to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab divided it up with the team
Sold em all double-down did it again
By then you got enough to buy a quarter ounce
You sellin dimes to forty fiends, buy it and bounce
Throw some money to your momma, keep some food in the house
But cop the outfit and Jordans on the day they came out
Better get yourself a pistol, you know them jackers is out
Flip another 7 grams oh you hustlin' now
Time to get yourself a half, make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags, sell it fast, stack o' G's
Now you officially...

[Chorus]

I bet you think you're pretty good at it now huh?

Now once you've flipped a couple o's now the game gets gravy
Take 1250 go get two and a baby
That's 63 grams if you whip that right
You should get back 5 or 6 that night
Stack that money and repeat that twice
Buy you somethin' to ride in, you know it gotta be tight
Next time you buy somethin', take twenty-five hundred
Get 4 and a half it come back in nine dont it?
Now stay low key when the money keep comin'
Keep some n****s on your team, show them suckas they don't want it
By then your connect will clearly see you on the grind
S*** you come and get a nine and he front you what you buyin'
As long as you bring back your money on time
And if you snort blow you do it on your own time
At this rate you'll be at a brick in no time
They say they want some weight tell the n**** stand in line

[Chorus]

Stay with me now shorty, here come the fun part...

Now the robbers plottin on ya, and your name stay buzzin
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
Your connect ain't worried, you and him cool
You know you'll never tell what you and him do
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snitchin' on you, and it's true
Everybody know you sell that s***
The feds come and get ya and they tell you s***
We heard you...

Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool you don't want no trouble
Can we lean it to the left, but gas they car
I'm always superclean when you see me on the block
Keep the money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow that marijuana you know I got it if you want it

Trust me you don't want me up in yo grill
Wit a ski mask on duct taping your kids
You can pray all you want
But I don't forgive
You should have been doin' nothing
But what you do with your dick
I ain't gotta spell it out pimpin you know what it is
The rest gangsta on the real man you know what it is
Plus I got a hundred goons wit me
Dressed in black
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got gauges, half got mags
Bring 'em out bring 'em out
Show 'em where they at
We can do them right here
We can catch them in a trap

Run up on this n****
Put a hole in his hat
Put his brains on the dash in the stalks
He has some dumb fifty more with him
Tell them to hold that

Drop to yo knees

I keep a couple lit off for the n***** who talk s***
When I go to Jacob and I cop that brain
If he tried to see me
I'm a cop that thing
And I'm pop that thing
And the shots gonna stay
The n**** bout to set the trunk wit me
For the most part n**** your stuck with me

Take two break through
Bust so many shots
Come now I'll probably blind y'all n*****

Clap up a n**** then I cap up a n****

Listen to the sizzle from the bullet that the glock burst fro (sss)

And had your body leanin, lookin' like a quarter past four

[Chorus]",Hurt,2007
T.I.P.,"You gotta get your swagger together, nigga, get your suitcase
Starts on the inside, ya dig, I don't need mine, I got cribs where we goin?
If you don't love yourself you can't love nobody
Keep up, nigga, I love myself, you gon' need to travel, ladies
You go and get that Mack diesel, right

I'm the man from Atlanta to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried

What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
I went to Japan and made a mil' in a week, bro
These niggaz can't keep up when they see me in London
So I go out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for

?Bout three days, maybe you'll see me in Haiti
With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies
But my folk got that workin? like they back in the eighties
See the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me
Paparazzi, they be follow me, they all be
Hopin? that they get a shot of me

It's my swag, they wonder what's so special 'bout him?
Why they ain't sellin? records like him? Tell 'em
It's my swag, how he always look so cool?
And why everybody do what he do, so

Gotta be my swag, they wonder why he wear his hat like that?
When girls see him why they act like that? Aye, I don't know
It's my swag, for some reason all the real niggaz love him
Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him
I guess, gotta be my swag

Gettin? money in Frisco, wearin? my raincoat
See I'm gettin? wet and this bitch in the same boat
I came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know
That I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'

I still can't complain? though as long as I ain't broke
I came a long way but, shawty, ain't nothin? changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused, bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'ma do, bro?

Send you to your maker then go to Jamaica
Or either to Cabo, I chill at my condo
My swagger is perfect, hatin? on me ain't worth it
Guarantee you, boy, the Earth my turf if that hurts

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world
Traveled the seven seas and I be
Poppin? bottles with celebrities so you can find me
Flyin? high, smokin? better trees

Girls around the world
They keep callin? me, they call me

Even though their girlfriend wanna fuck him

Regardless what haters say I'm as real as they come
I'm chasin? that paper, baby, however it come
I'm singin? a song and movin? yay by the ton
You never seen a nigga gettin? money so young

How I get from the pen all the way to Berlin
I've been to Switzerland, skiing and pimpin?, goin? again
It ain't nothin? to catch me in the south of France
In a coffee shop smokin? dro in Amsterdam

It ain't nothin? to fly all the way to Dubai
St. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try
G-5 to Moscow and they say I'ma lie
I'ma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die

Tell 'em why ?cause I been around the world

This is impeccable pimpin?
You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to, man
Ha, y'all, niggaz, keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico, my nigga, I'll be in Cuba

By the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti

Y'all gon' wish for a n**** like me

Once I die there ain't no more n***** my type

Bet you don't appreciate a n**** my type
But when I die there ain't no more n***** my type
So just remember me right
Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight
All them haters gon' be filled with delight
God forgive me aight
I sacrifice so they can live my life
If necessary I'll give my life
What you hear is my life
Reputation decorated with stripes
No need crying at the end of my life
Just remember me right

When your back was against the wall remember where could you go
Remember who helped you again like he helped you before
Went out the way to let you know that you ain't never alone
They disrespect you come here until they left you alone
He taught you how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong
Taught you not to accept defeat you go all out or be gone
But it ain't the same in the streets now that he gone
He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong
But he left millions devastated and his family mourned
Sons turn to grown man since their daddy been gone
Daughters grew like him or not he left his family home
Even prepared the funeral service he had in the dome
And then they came to represent for a stand up gent
Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant
Impossible to stop him had a head like cement
Maybe now you'll appreciate the n**** like this...

[Chorus]

If they only knew the man outside of the hype
No matter what the situation he alway try to do right
Still they gossip and told lies, used to take him for granted
Often found it hard to relate, some how they can't understand it
'Cause that respect he gon' demand it, theres a problem he handle it
Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge
They try to knock him off balance when the fed came and got him
Did the time on the edge came home now he ain't stoppin'
Now while them n****s used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him
Swear he had the kinda swagger made the world stop and watch him
Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him
Got better every album, haters hate to see him drop em'
They just talk s*** from a distance, when he around they playin' posse
He use to scare the suckers s***less, probably why them n***** shot him
Hey what it took nothing else than what they could've ever did about him
So go on talk s*** about him
At least you ain't forgot about him...

[Chorus]

Wanna say sorry to my mama
King and lil' mama
See me go through so much drama
You could stand a little thunder
Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber
Stay ready for whatever, make note I'm a do wonder
How he died? On his feet like a man with honor
Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna
Death above the money, deja need me
Don't worry bout me Uncle Phil the ladies with me
See me with your granddaddy
I know you gon' miss daddy
But life ain't always a dream, and horrible s*** happens
Had I let a n**** kill me before I could quit rapping
And get to spend more time with ya, I know we would a been happy
But I had to take the chances, You would have been trappin'
Long as I could keep that from happening
Ya papi could die happy

Remember winnin' in your blood you were born with what it take (OK)...

Sellin' all ya jewelry, considerin' sellin' dope again

Is you crazy pull your gun in the club
See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
If we got to come with a slug why we come to the club
How much more of this s*** you think we can put under the rug
Look we already told them I Told You So,
But all these n***** speaking out whoever spoke before
Don't take it personal people want to be close to folk
What you think the television and the posters for?
(I'm claustrophobic though)
Well then you need to see a doctor for it
Man I ain't joking you close T.I.P. and bout to blow it
Did you forget about them nights in the cells was you honesty
When we was having talks with God and you promise
If he could make away for you to be large and you done it
Out the gate Urban Legend went on to do numbers
Sold a mill made ATL king first week
Five hundred with the Grammy (but not the one that I wanted)
What about them eight figure deals and that other new money
But ask yourself something where the
Gun you got from me?
Keep it real...

You need to think of someone other than yourself some time, did you keep your promise
Keep it real

Don't want to be mistaken, ma, I'm plannin' on relations

The kids painted my windows with black, permanent marker
And left the rest of the car color cover like swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin' but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flyin' through the air lookin' like they're crumpin', the way they're tumbling
I gotta do something
But soon as I hit the carwash, to get the tar off
Then it's right back at it tomorrow
They're like dad, this is in, so get with the trend

How could they be so ignorant look at what hip hop den done
Its allowed us to run a business, we should of made it our money

Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I will not fall, but the edge is closer now

Well I'm the human ultra called Biz Markie
Making music orderly is my specialty
When I go, ah one two, girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em
I know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow
And I can play rapping records and all disco
Like ""Beat It,"" ""Billie Jean,"" by Michael Jackson

Rock from New York City all the way down South
Saying rhymes and making music, with my mouth
I'm a tell you party people how I began
It started when I'm living in Long Island
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Making sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats
Grown people, used to say, ""what""?
Grown people, used to say, ""what""?
Wrong with that kid making that strange noise
It was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboys basement party
They thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me
When they came by the DJ, and saw who it is
They said, ""Make the music with your mouth, Biz!""

Make the music with your mouth, biz!
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
Make the music with your mouth, biz!

It may look and sound easy doing the human beat box
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doing it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all the props, spitting, breathing hard and doing
You need practice, be ambitious in the schooling
Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doing sounds, that's hard to achieve
Making two or three sounds at one time you can't believe
When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, ""how you make all those sounds at one time Biz Markie?""
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doing it since, fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm telling you a fact, and just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say, ""What up Biz?""
Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into hysterics!

Make the music with your mouth, biz!
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
Make the music with your mouth, biz!

You heard the proceeding, now here's the sequel
All human beat boxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doing my beat in a special way

Making musical tunes, orally, I have perspective
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou

It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note

I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all the props, spittin, breathin hard and doin
You need practice, be ambitious in the schoolin

Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doin sounds, that's hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you can't believe

When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, ""HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time Biz Markie?""
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doin it since, fifteen years old

And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm tellin you a fact, and just like it is
Even moms pops and cops say, ""Whattup Biz?""

Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test

I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS!

[Chorus]

You heard the proceedin, now here's the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doin my beat in a special way

Makin musical tunes, orally, I have perspective
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou..

[Outro - singing while Biz beatboxes]

MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..

Or is he holding you the way I do?

Should I hang up, or will you tell him he'll have to go?

And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you,
A glowing light will see you through

And we feel the pain of each other's wingsWe were embraced in unclean, impure arms
Because in our loneliness we didn't know any betterThe moment we connect, eternity will awaken - I long for itExposed in a flickering instant that flew by too fast
I can't reach anything alone
These mere wishes and fading words
Can't get get us anywhere by themselvesThough I fixed my eyes right on them, I've still lost sight of the stars
But their light remains, and no one can steal itThe light of our existence is confirmed by our lips
It's dazzling from the emotions that are bottled up inside usIs it love that lies ahead, or will everything break apart? It bewilders me...Intertwined in this heat, wanting to speak the truth
Who do I protect them from?
This feeling you wanted so badly once,
If it's there...Exposed in a flickering instant that flew by too fast

Were at the best place around

Burned the place to the ground

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound

Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds

My eyes were dry with the pain
Sometimes I wish that I would just die
To save me from seeing you again
I knew you used me but I didn't care
I was happy just being together
Well sometimes I wonder if I should be with you
All you ever do is ignore me
You never talk when your friends are around
Too bitchen to see you with me
Won't call won't waste your time
Too busy to send your love to me
That time I held you so tight in my arms
Just wishing the night wasn't ending
That's when you said you couldn't see me
I thought our love was just beginning
Forever is just that but with you it ends
Though you're in mind as I lay here
Can't stand it no longer I've gotta give in
I call you again and again and again

Wrapped in yellowed newsprint, on their benches in the dark
Faces fill with sadness, sorrow drawn from your nights

Lonely men who are tortured, once proud but now forgotten
Gnarled hands hold canes, where guns were once before
Taunted by the children whose parent's lives he saved
Forgotten by a state, whose leg in war he gave
Silver gleams upon his chest, though sweat gleams on his brow
Darker days and sable nights, who work upon his soul
His honor flew away from him, like pigeons on the wind
Spending his last pennies on cheap wine and sins
But still they make the soldiers
And soldiers still grow old

Candy ran me out of my soul
I didn't think it was funny
Too bad she never gonna make it
She never gonna make it all the way home

I packed my bags for New York City
I heard she had some friends
Found her at some big time party
And it never ends
She told me some lie about her money
I knew my soul was on ice
She had me playin' her game
And I paid the price

I ran out of my money
I ran out of my soul
I didn't think it was funny
Too bad she never gonna make it
She never gonna make it all the way home

I found myself this roadside cafe
Thought maybe I'd get some rest
Candy walks in the front door
Goddamn, she's lookin' her best
I knew that this was gonna be the last time
I'd get safe to speak my mind
I told her where she could go
She said she needed a ride

Couldn't believe my eyes

Their message to my mind I'm

My eyes see what they want to see
Lights are flashing. Colors are blurring
There are patterns in my mind
Things are hidden to the world around me

T.S.O.L.,"There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief, yeah
There’s too much confusion
Mmm I can’t get no relief

Business men, they drink my wine
Plowman dig my earth
None were level on the mind
No one up at his word

Yeah, I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?
When i’m sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a plowman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl (like a failed man I worked from the earth up)
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl ('cause your world is the same as mine)

Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though that’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours

While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl

Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious i’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

Told me he would keep it all on the low-low
But I told him, ""boo, I don't really know though""

He had me in a zone when he started to show me things

A player's proposition got 'em wishin they was laced up
Perfect conversation plus my new just game I make up
Talkin bout, mash you got me bout it now I'm gettin dough
Dress in style every day, own many expensive clothes

Ay tell yo' potnahs they can be a part of all the benefits
Ay, pinky finger diamonds all the finest ain't no limits and
what we tryin to do menage-a-trois up in the rental then
you can make a move you never lose with a gentleman
All about my paper fettucini and lucciano
If we keep this pimpin right we movin into condos
Baby want to treat to play, she want to lace me
Dress me up from head to toe and shoppin sprees at Macy's
Ay, copped me all the flyest shit, like Tommy Hilfiger
Calvin Klein cologne just want to zone with a real nigga
We can do it live and go through all your wildest fantasies
Tell me yeah you want to be as freaky as you want to be

Niggaz is so fake and phony
Nine times out of ten they ain't Oscar Mayer beef they Lady Lee bologna
Speakin on shit they never did, soundin like a tweeter
Wishin they was a mid, ho you don't know you blowin out like an amp
Lickin mo' pussy than the post office lick stamps
Money over bitches, boy you don't remember?
Just kick back and sautee, nigga never simmer
Oh yeah you hoes you triflin too, haha

And I'm still in it - gettin richer

I'm havin a move swing
I'm startin to split
Sittin here reminiscin about all this bullshit
Motherfuckers ain't knowin I´m like a kilo of them
Try to shake me up and brake me down turned in a mo game
My daddy wasn't around 
All I got from him was nathin
My niggaz my dogs laced me about the bulletproof waivin
Whether it's in the game or in the gain
Fool I've been told 
Done sold more yak and records I guess I 've been so

Pushin work in the game

Supplyin G's 
To my homies in the streets rollin
That's what they called em
But never 
The niggaz been havin paper forever
And puttin it down for years
And nobody could do it better
Always stay heated
For the case and bid
Keep the stinky man 
Van in the cut
If ever needed
Don't repeat it

Thursty,had a nap for this shit

Stuck and starvin was on the main menu 
And that's all that it was
Had motherfuckers trippin in shit 
With all that blood and crip shit
'cause started out of the street pharmacies to street promotion
It's all the same 
Anyway you look at 
It's to sale products for the cash and for the fame

You can take a man out the ghetto
But can't take the ghetto out the man

Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle 
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal 
Livin' life truly successful 
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope

I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop 
Puttin' it together like a racing track 
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at? 
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle 
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble 
So keep your head up 
And know that things are changing for the better 
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids

None of the spots got batteram 
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam 
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin' 
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin' 
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby

A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey 
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days

T3r Elemento,"Cómo pasaron los años pero sé muy bien
Mi nombre han escuchado
También deben de saber
De todas las hazañas que este hombre ha logrado

Que por los años 80 yo era el encargado
Del mundo del narco
Y que formé un gran imperio que hasta la fecha 
Aún sigue dando

Voy a presentarme
Mi nombre es Rafael Caro Quintero
Pregúntenle a sus abuelos
Yo sé que más de alguno lo escuchó en el noticiero

Soy considerado, el narco de narcos
Y el número uno
Soy de Sinaloa, proveniente de la Noria
Y pa' todo el mundo

La cárcel no es pa' siempre
Como lo aclaré en aquella entrevista
Bien recuerdo las preguntas
Que me estaba haciendo aquella señorita

Yo no conseguí lo que alcancé a tener
Fácil como ella decía
Creo que le quedó bien clara la respuesta que le di
Nada es fácil en la vida

Hoy el tiempo ha pasado, la tormenta terminó
Pienso hacer muchas cosas
Arrepentido jamás, lo hecho, hecho está
Así se escribió la historia

Me relacionaron con la muerte
De un agente de la DEA
Creo que están equivocados, como dice aquel corrido
Yo no maté a Camarena

Mi sentencia se cumplió, después de veintiocho años
Hoy salgo por la puerta
Fue bastante tiempo para pensar bien las cosas
Vengo con más experiencia

Hoy mi pelo ya no es negro pues también cambió
De canas se ha pintado
Aunque estoy un poco viejo, sigo haciendo bien las cosas
Siempre lo he demostrado

Ya me voy a despedir
Respiro al aire libre, hoy estoy muy contento
Visitaré a mi familia, tengo mucho qué contarles
Tengo ganas de verlos

We were together all the way
An endless path unbroken

Let me go
All hopeless fantasies are making fools of me
Let me go
I walk alone and yet I never say goodbye
Let me go
A change of heart a change of mind and heaven fell that night
Let me go 

I tried but could not bring
The best of everything
Too breathless then to wonder
I died a thousand times
Found guilty of no crime
Now everything is thunder

Nighttime I don't need the
Daytime all I want is
Nighttime I don't need the

The facts of life unspoken

As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride

Somebody break me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin' to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, ""Keep it real G""
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

Runnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways

Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though, be placin' triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans

Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin' for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin' bags
We out for power, makin' cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin'
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin' somethin' the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin' to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise

Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin' down
clutchin' a pound, live as sirens, duckin' the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin' time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops

In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin' more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker

I've been thinking
I've been making this mistake from the beginning
I've swallowed my pride, 'cause I'm willing
See, I'd rather take the blame than break it off

Darling understand, my faith waivers

Never saw a future where we weren't together
If we give it some time, I believe it
That the history we share will be enough

Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?

When stars all were shining bright
I was alone, alone until
Until I saw that moon coming over the hill

Well, you know it's up there, just checking me out
It just rises higher on into the night
And it lets me know everything's alright

So don't you worry about where I been

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie

A simple mood
Have I fallen from grace
Don't you tell me nothing is wrong

Should this be going on
Is the sky too grey
Did your milk taste bad today?
Did I fade it bad, was it something I have said, was it something I have said?

Here I go jumping round the bed

And I'm your puppet on a string, and I'm your puppet on a string
Is it so hard to understand
This situation is getting out of here
But maybe there's something I've missed
A brand new love
That's why you look so pissed

Did I drive you mad in my wearing that old hat
Tell me what to do
Should I paint the Grey sky blue, the Grey sky blue?
I wish I could look into your head
And read your thoughts
They're so instead, they're so instead

Should I leave or stay
Should I kiss your blues away

Do anything, 'cause I'm not

There's nowhere I'd rather be tonight, tonight

Funny how you said people never change
Always be together 'til the very end
But that was then and this is now
Funny how I held onto your every word
Trusted and believed, no matter what I heard

Though their sad
Power may prevail
Can possess, conquer,

Long before
Nations' lines were drawn.
When no flags flew,
When no armies stood
My land was born.

And you ask me
Why I love her
Through wars,
Death and despair
She is the constant,
We who don't care.
And you wonder
Will I leave her
But how?

But I'm still there now.

And say it's the only thing 'cause I'm not around to be around

I'm beaten and battered, hell if my dreams get shattered then
Pain gives me the right to be unkind

Bring it on baby, what's with sudden devotion
I trade a river of tears for just a little emotion
You can curse my name, pin it up with my picture
And say it's the last time that I'll be around to be around

Oh well I'm torn and I'm tattered
So the thoughts in my head they get scattered
Oh well pain gives me the right to be unkind
And it set's me here

Right back to the heart of it
Jones Crazy is a slight defense from it
Jones Crazy is a place I call my own, (when I'm alone, dig)

So Bring it on baby, what you getting into
Well I swear at once it was the little things that mattered
But it all seems true to you
Say the hell with my name and say the hell with my picture
Yeah but swear for the one time you need me around to be around
Well I'm around right now

And here I'll stand like it matters
Only once gets through and then gets scattered by the rain
But pain gives me the right to be unkind
And it sets me here

Right back to the heart of it
Jones Crazy is a slight defense from it
Jones Crazy is a place I call my own, (when I'm alone, dig)

Right back to the heart of it
Jones Crazy is a slight defense from it
Jones Crazy is a place I call my own, (when I'm alone, dig)

Tabitha's Secret,"You said adjust your heels girl, they stick out like an anchor
Don't touch the flowers, 'cause you can't hear them well
Couldn't last forever, lord ya know it's gonna end sometime

This is not an order, you don't have to be here
Can you understand me, screamin like the wind blows
Did I blow your mind, leave you breathless

I guess I've changed but yeah couldn't you
Given all we've been through
Heaven knows I've been around and around

Eighty six the candles, I'm scared of the bright lights
Girl, try not to touch me, so you don't feel me
Or you can touch my shoulder, put your lips to my ears and scream
Is there anyone home, won't you answer me

Chorus:
I guess I've changed but yeah couldn't you
Given all we've been through well
Heaven knows I've been around and around
I guess I've strained well how bout that
Here's my life, here's a doorstep
Heaven knows I've been around and around

I guess it's been a good year, for roses and aggressions, for flowers and freeways
I guess I'll put a smile on, or get a new girlfriend, ya put a new hat on

This is not an order, you don't have to answer
Only need to listen, if only for a moment
Did I blow your mind girl, did I leave you breathless, I said

Table for 5,"Firelight caught in your eyes
Twin blue glimmers beneath your brows
The reflections of their shadows
Are there on your stubby nose

Reflections of the moon
In the night I am by your side
I see the sadness in your eyes

You should keep your heart of stone
Life goes on the way it is
It's up to you what you make of it

How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.

And could I leave you running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time

Quería correr hacia ti

Ahora me he enterado del engaño aquel
Pero ahora se
Ahora me he enterado lo perro que fue

Take tenderness, then they fly away

They're all the same, those pretty girls
You can fly away, in the sky away

That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
You can fly away, in the sky away

Taburete,"Yendo más despacio
Nunca aprendí a frenar
Ni a volar más alto
No pasé de tu portal

Vestías de luto
Cuando bailas frenesí
Esto no ha acabado
No ha llegado a su fin

Perdí la fama en un cabaret
Se han olvidado a qué huele la luna
Y en las cantinas, cómo bailan, cómo cantan
Se han olvidado a qué huela la luna

El día es claro, ha salido solo
Te han entrado ganas de bebertelo todo 
Crees que cuando bailas no se esconde el miedo 
Y sobre su cuello flotan los pañuelos 
Solo hace falta que demos la vuelta 
Recapitulemos, paguemos a medias 
Mi sobredosis siempre serán tus piernas 
Que beben del metal que hay en tus venas

Y en las cantinas, cómo bailan, cómo cantan 
Se han olvidado a que huele la luna
Y en las cantinas, cómo ríen, cómo bailan 
Se han olvidado a que huele la luna

Ni te echo de menos

Tad Morose,"From a glade was heard songs of angels that blessed the land 
Now the time of their arrival was predicted years ago and now they shine 
In the time before the ravings of the dark cloaked men began 
Men had lived in peace for ages and they'd lived from of the land 

Now their lives all changed from better to a state still growing worse 
And the ravings of the cloaked men promised darkness in return 
But angels shine 

See the bitter heart sow darkness summon clouds to hide the sun 
And they tower up before you and they cover up the sky 
Hear them sing their songs of hardship under moon that none can see 
Hear them chant, yes hear them raving for the tide to turn on me 
But angels shine 

Then from far away from a land unknown came a man so thin you could see his bones 
'Said when I am gone and the night is still and a few good hearts all unite in will 
Then they pray along with the prayers of mine and the dark men fall as the angels shine",But Angels Shine,1997
Tad Morose,"They told me what I should do
They gave me a way to get to you 
You never stood a chance 
The screen is never truly blank and I can't hide my mind 
Behind lie words that tear inside of me
Their faces find me anywhere and in my room
I feel their stare 
The walls are cold they shimmer blue
Their vision hides inside of you 

This circuit vision 

My memories fade and I appear 
Submerged and lost in digit beams 
I confine myself within myself 
A circuit glows I feel the need 
An interface between man, machine 
They boot my mind and steal my dreams as they feed me deep inside 

Fractal code interlocking my spine 
Feeding new format breaking mine down
System runs steady 
Colour code true ID number strands altered 
Connecting me to you...this circuit vision 

You couldn't dream you had no mind but now my eyes see only what you feed me 
Conversely seen it's all so clear 
Behind the news they're always there 
The integration's just begun I make my move when they say so 
My eyes feed 
Data they must know a night of secrets by the screen is all the programming I need",Circuit Vision,1997
Tad Morose,"Watching the hills from the tower up north he sang, 
No he bellowed a song to the glory to the power of Karak Azul 
His heart now uneasy it would not be stilled

Trollslayers, trollslayers mighty and proud 
Trollslayers now meet your fate in this battle you die for you surely will die 

The dragon tide will sweep you away The dragon tide will darken this day 
Lord, King, see the skies Oh, worse this our doom Accursed be this day

Tad Morose,"Not long ago on a world not so far the King sent four riders pure in their hearts 
Search for the Spirit Search for the Lamb 
All of my children rise 
It's time to leave the Royal Fleet is here 
So be the truth that none of you may enter lest the Royal Crown you bear in your heart 

The Court and the King and his followers stood aboard awaiting the riders to gather them all First came the Lion then came the Lamb 
The fire of the Spirit has now left the land 

Wrapped in the fumes of the underworld all ships leave 
Up rises Five and they claim all that is and will be 
Search for the riders Find us the Lamb
Bring us the Spirit 
His heart in our hands 

Seconds before the departure all eyes fell upon a ragged man 
Torn and wild-eyed he turned facing the crowd Raising his staff to the sky and these are his words 
Now the stars may still shine and horizons be clear but the Spirit is gone 
Come the time the time of no sun 

Spirits of Five grasp control of the world 
Knowing here after Follow the ages of peace 
Under strict supervision 
Hear me ye prophets ye spirits of Five Hear when I speak of starvation and strife 

Their prophets performing an act all will see and worship their master 
Few will escape most are drowned in the eternal sea A time has just ended your work has begun Now come what will be the time of no sun",Time of No Sun,1997

Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.",Don't Blame Me,2010
Tadd Dameron Quintet,"Embrace me, my sweet embraceable you!
Embrace me, you irreplaceable you!

Just one look at you
My heart grew tipsy in me,
You and you alone
Bring out the gypsy in me! 

I love all, the many charms about you!
Above all, I want my arms about you! 

Don't be a naughty baby,
Come to papa, come to papa, do!
My sweet embraceable you!",Embraceable You,2010

Un policía que es mudo
A la cárcel se llevó
A dos jóvenes inquietos
Que en el parque se encontró

Al saber esta noticia
Los padres fueron a ver al juez
Y junto con periodistas
Le preguntaron que como fue

Mandaron traer al mudo
Y oiga usted lo que yo escuché
Mandaron traer al mudo
Y oiga usted lo que yo escuché

Por qué los detuvo

Qué estaban haciendo

Cuál es el delito

De qué los acusa

Que se cuiden todos
Que ahí viene el mudo
Esos reveldones
Ahí viene el mudo

Tadeo Pequeño,"Quisiera nunca haberte conocido
Y jamas haber probado de tus besos
Quisiera haber nacido en otro siglo
Y así evitar el daño que me has hecho
Quisiera repetir ese pasado
Que dejo tantas heridas en mi alma
Para no cometer el mismo error
Y así evadir cada una de sus trampas

Pero ya es muy tarde, el mal ya esta hecho
Y escrito en tu vida todo tu desprecio
Que después que te diviertes abandonas
Hoy sin remordimiento dices que te deje sola…
Y para colmo de mis males
Y con la mente dios sabe
Lo mucho que te quiero y lo que te necesito
La gente me gritaba, que no me convenías
Que tu no eras buena y yo te lo creía

Pues a mi no me importaba
Por que yo me soñaba
Toda mi vida junto a ti
Mientras tu te reías de mi
Ahora me doy cuenta
Que en ti no ay inocencia
Tienes corazon de piedra
Pues no te importo hacerme sufrir

Arrolladora

Pero ya es muy tarde, el mal ya esta hecho

Papa don't feel bad, 
Cold on the street better gotta keep my bang to the bang back.

We hope our friends make it up to heaven, 
And if we fall, then we forgotten,

Tah Murdah,"Word to god
Y'all know who the fuck this is
You know we would kidnap yo kids
You know what the fuck we do
Murder bitch niggas like you
For real, all the time, any place, anywhere
Y'all niggas could get it
Act like y'all don't know

In a world that's ice cold, blacks die slowly
Cats snatch rollies, gats'll leave you holy
My momma always told me the streets will slow me down
Daddy never showed me how the heat will hold me down
So now I rob and steal, spit shit you feel, wit a clique that kills
Yea my shit's that real, I hustle hard all my life
Ran the streets all night
My wife always said everything was gonna be aight
And she was right and that's one reason why I love her
But everything she said went in one ear and out the other
Word to mother, look at it from a thug point of view
When the kids need clothes, what a thug gon do?
Hit the streets and hustle, pick up the heat and bust you
I'm tryin' to eat like Russel
Murda is my hustle But you keep chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch, when the eight (.8mm) spit
You could feel the hatred, taste it
You high right now, you ain't ready to die right now
The .45 will calm you down, you under trauma now
It's drama how a child will shut shit down
Kill a nigga for the fuck of it I get you touched for chips
Fuck that shit, fuck the whip, and fuck you bitch
You can just suck my dick

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time stops

Yo I give a fuck if y'all niggas hate me
I drop bodies off where the lakes be
But lately, I've been hittin' cribs
And safes where the cake be
I take three to the vest for the love of the dolla
I put that hot shit through you and watch you Holla Holla
The same niggas that I ball wit I'ma brawl wit
I'm a tank running in banks and takin' all of it
Player we're flawless, wit nothin' to lose guns bustin'
And brossen niggas y'all can't live
Funny shit about it, niggas wanna hit me, forget about it
Thug shit I'm still livin' y'all niggas just spit about it
I rob and stomp niggas 2/3rd of my life
The other 1/3 spent sittin' on curbs chasin' those birds
If you ever get the urge to come by and try to test
There's only one and then you get numb and lied to rest
It's murder the only code to the ghetto
It's murder, nigga hand me the Bessel
And dance with the devil, guns rapidly spit
Gangsta shit, attractin yo bitch, gettin head and lean back in the whip
I mastered the chips, Nigga I'm tryin to tell you
You're holdin hammers and nails and
We have you where the dogs couldn't smell you

If you chasin' yesterday, you goin' miss tomorrow
It's murda motherfucker, we don't beg or borrow
We take shit, fuck you and yo fake bitch
When the .8 spit you could feel the hatred, taste it
It's your blood, when we show blood, we murderers (murderers)
We throw slugs, we hustlers (hustlers) we sell drugs
And tell thugs live it up till yo time stops

Ja's a motherfuckin' problem
Any nigga think not, I'ma pop him
Put the lean on niggas the minute I spot em
Who's gettin' it, I got him nigga dead and gone
Gonna guide em to the cross roads show em how those guns blow
I'ma degenerate nigga addicted to hydro, switchin' four lanes
Top down wit my eyes closed, got a death wish
Money, drugs, and murderer shit
What you want with this? We'll kidnap yo kids
And clap up yo crib, It's the murderers
Who you know wit guns that kill shit
Just because we're them hot niggas
Sell mo records than Roc niggas
I'ma lock it down for six months and shock niggas
What's my name?
J the A R.U.L.E. with them hoes get between more sheets than Isley
You can't deny me, I'm the motherfuckin' one
Druggin' bitches like Heron(heroin)
The god be the Rule, if you're hot get bice and bice
On your jewel to cop a Bens
20 inch chrome, the shoes, I got nothin' to lose but everything to live for
Thoroughbred demand and supply the raw
I put my smash down from N.Y. to Chi-Town

We gonna bubble hard
Get this money nigga
Hustle night to night
State to state

What, what, what, yeah,
Yo, yo, yo

[Tah Murdah]
When I'm thinking the doe, uh
I'm thinking the O's,
With any and many ways to blow,
Till I'm sitting on doe.
Burying poppy seeds, trying to get them to grow
So if you need, I'm the nigga to know
And that's for show
I love money, especially blood money
That in and out of state,
Out of state, drug money
Used to stash halves under the couch
Till the neighbors start runnin their mouths
And have the feds running in my house
The game will never forget, who slipped and losing their grow
Blowing my head and old timers throwing jewels in it
Seen it all, from heavy weights scared
To them control the blocks niggas get knocked niggas
Who couldn't make there
You coward legal than snake but couldn't take there
Bubble hard most of my life
And I'm still wooling the stripes
To shave the road, blaze the fro
For them chubby faced, uh
I aim for more, Sellaphine
12, 12, bags of capsule,
I'm goin get this dirty money any and every way I have to, have to

Yo, Yo,
One of my elders told me
I'm living the short life
Swinging wit yo, I rather
Die young and then grow old and blue
Whether it's crack, dope, or coke
We slinging it, 20 g's a night, we bringing it
Avoid the law, and from the crack,
Picture the hole in the half a brick, half a brick
To a key, now I supply the dee
And the niggas that I once bought from, buy from me
All sales, retail, Fish scales, Ivory
I'm trying to see if I could build a fortress underground
So when Feds come in lurkin, I'm nowhere to be found
I'm the type to take a brick, bust it down
into dimes and nicks, find some strips and flood the town
If I ever hit the ground, I'm just clickin and cockin
And run up into your spot, and get to poppin instead of shoppin
and not stoppin, until there's profit involved
So when the profit is lost, fuck splittin it
I pocket it all, ya heard?

Chorus

For all ya'll, niggas just watch me take it
Murder plots we making, head shots for baking
And night, hating, but if ya'll niggas ain't running wit my team
And what the fuck I look like, spitting my green
Drop and top on the high beam, see a lot of niggas make moves
But too hard headed to take the jewels
I got to, hit you killers, then will come and get you nigga

Or the fucked up rental, or a hot two seater
As long as the love with me
Hoods will never forget me 
I could put raps in them, and shine up the city
Like elected Frank Nitty, jot a Big Poppa
For reasons of, we run up in a big truck and pop ya
Midnight opera
Over the wheels, slug body marks, and pop up
  
Seem like y'all niggas ain't never gon' learn
Either you hitting, or the nigga getting hit
'Cause son, when I click and cock, my shit gon' pop
And never been, a small nigga 
Always a score nigga
That be up in your braud nigga

Cop yae, from far, but never raw niggas
My A's and SK's will rob when it's war nigga

And if you less than ten, I won't bend
Or y'all niggas to run with it
Gun busting, I done did it
And anything else that come with it
You don't want it
If it's real, put the deal on it
Stand up niggas will have you sitting in chairs with wheels on them
And that murder shit, I'm still on it
Murder for life
Give a fuck if you a accept it
You better respect it, unless it's, one of my fam' members
Leave whoever into this involvement in legal tendency
Laying where the dirt be
You dig this
Better recover with some big shit
Or duck when this fifth spit
  
Another question: Is you willing to die 
Just as much as you want to kill?
  
I went from handcuff recovering 
Blowing up from bubbling
Shot muscling

Got a nigga wet

Murderers, that will split your juggle up
Motherfucker I'll cut ya
And you think Tah touch ya
Then we flip shit with bitches that ride all day
And niggas that get head, on the highway
And niggas hating

Or be played
I'm gon' tell yo' hoe, you in hell waiting
While niggas on Earth
Flossed like they first
For what it's worth
Murderers blast first
  
Niggas respect murder everywhere
It's the streets
Nobody's dancing in the streets
Huh, the streets is ours man, murder

I wonder why
Take a sneak peak kissing herbs on a high
Hah, I'm down for whatever, whenever
Murderers stick together
See Vita, be that chick to hard throb you nigga 
Fuck you, then rob you nigga
A grimy braud, that will set you and wet you
Leave you for my dogs to fetch you
Tie you up and wet you
Unless you, talking pacos again
It don't matter
The longer we spend, the longer we win
And Gotti, showed me how to work these niggas
??? these niggas
And hurt these niggas
And I'll be there, when my niggas need bail
Catch a body, take the stand, and won't tell
T-tale, I flip wholesale retail
Cheap, so you can get deep into this female
  
Gangstas and hoes are together
Don't let nobody tell you no different, man
It's the beginning of time
I love my bitches
  
Motherfucker it's on one
When I come through, niggas run
Niggas know
Equipped with guns, ya heard so
You get plugged up and gutted out
Found dead with a gun in your mouth
Now what you talking about?
Scold on these streets
I'm involved with thugs, who carry heat

That's why we've been blazed, to you, froze it up
Had your name to the crease so you closed it up

Leavin' you nothin' to steal, so no pain to feel
So fuck the world, ya either get when you see the sink skin
No more than my thugs than your guns let off

I earned connections, every time I burn my weapon

Fuck the Feds, nigga, we spit hollow heads
Our motto is 'Shed blood for dead thug'

That shed blood in hell, when my slugs set bail
Pray for death from your cell, I won't bet we got to jail
From pretty niggas with half a nickel flow

I know y'all are ready to die, know why?
'Cause the pain is too much to bare while alive
So I cock my nine then close my eyes
Take another hit an' then creep an' blow minds

These are hard times, niggas, in these streets an' bust blind
Out of fear, out of despair but never in the air
We gonna take to this, point blank range in your Range Rov'
Pistol with the kids an' rape your stray hoe

We The Murderers, yo, what you expect from us?
We niggas you can't trust, that don't really give a fuck
We dedicated to street life, game an' hustle

Now we got the upper hand, so keep your palms up

Everybody want to live, but they want to live scared 
Die motherfucker Die, that¡¦s your life

Niggas know the truth 
Rule raises the roof 
'cause I pop more shots than Abdul-Rauf 
And when the concludes I bring closure to the situ 
Come through squeeze eight out the stolen black pinto 
Niggas know my mental kill or be killed head for the hills 
But don¡¦t never slide down it if you to high ground it 
(puff, puff) uhhh! Is how it sounded two shots through and silent 
And one nigga stripped of his talents 
New fucking Yiddy City the sex and violence 
Where first time offenders get floated to the island 
And one time give a nigga one time 
Breathe wrong and a nigga have a blown mind 
I blow lines like an addict 
Bust guns erratic shine blind like carats 
Rules above average me and this music make a marriage 
So I thee wed till I¡¦m either jailed or dead motherfuckers 
Feel me niggas 
[Black Child] 
Word to God 
Feel us nigga 
We here, again

Drink ""evian"" slowly when I'm on E
And only those who feel me

Especially hoes -n- extasy

We got the murder man that's the spot to chill
Got bitches pop the pill feelin hot for real

Now that's a freaky combination
And freaky conversations 
Lead into freaky situations
Like me tastin your sexuality
Sexy you ever took extasy?
And have you wildin in a club
Smilin at a thug
Express your hugs

Pass the OJ we gettin high tonight, On

[Chorus]
Deutsche Deutsche 
Before i start the Porsche
I keep them pumpin off the Calvin Kleins, Boodo's
And the Nike swoosh
And party saggin like two loose socks
Invest the money in stocks
We gettin the orange juice crops
We ready to get outta hear
Disappear
The bitch get like David Copperfield
When she pop a pill
want to do it in the high heels
On top of a high hill
Cause my nigga ain't tryin to run up then i will
Hit it from behind that's how i polly wit mines
Man we up all night fuckin by the Hollywood sign
Yea got smacked up 
Everytime she backed up
Didn't know there was room in the back
Of the lack truck
I pass her the job then he 
Passed it back
Hope my girl to find a magnum raps
You need a shoe shine job
The way you polish a knob
Backstage panties down eat dick
Good-bye Biotch!!

Every year same cops trying to knock my crew
January 15 go to MLK
Had to nearly come to gun just to get that day
February, only presidents that represent me
Is M-1 and my nigga S-T-I-see
And St. Valentine, he could kiss my ass
The 19th for Malik El-Haj Shabazz
Celebrate him for real, that's love ??
He worked for us, George made us work the field
St. Patrick's Day, crackers better shut they mouth
I'm wearing khakis, pinch me, I'm gonna knock you out
I don't care about no shamrocks or 4-leaf clovers 
Ain't enough luck for cops not filling they quotas
Can't fool me, April 1st, I'm still on ??
Even then I'ma still drop the truth on George
There ain't no Easter egg hunt or no Easter bunny
Just another day for black folk to spend they money
Cinco de Mayo, my Latin homies still ain't free
Capitalism made'em where they still can't eat
So we can't eat
Mother's Day, mamas deserve a lot more 
Than the Sunday they set aside to observe
Memorial Day, never will I do that there
Patriotism for America, I do not care
Father's Day got me thinking about the one's in jail
All the ones who stayed around, all the ones who bailed
Fourth of July, really dog, why ask why
First of all, damn watch the fireworks in the sky
I seen red and blue lights all the time that night
Real guns going off for the ???
Second of all, that ain't my independence day
1776 we was baling hay
Niggas was slaves, busy chasing what they call freedom
And we still wear chains, only now we can't see them
So they made Labor Day 'cause my ??? got jerk?
Even though most niggas still be scheduled to work
Trick or treat, kids? getting candy to eat
Later on down the road start rottin they teeth
And you wonder how the dentists 
Keep gettin dough from us
Trick like the Earth trick Christopher Columbus shit
Hittin America was all a mistake
Stupid faggot ass crackers couldn't find they way
But neither could we 
'cause niggas still fight for this bitch
When the service need soldiers, we the first to enlist
I feel it for vets but how I'ma gon respect they set
They the same white folk that laid the natives to rest
Thanksgiving it's the same, thanks for giving us what
Small pox and gonnorhea from the shit they fuck
All the way up to the ?? make my folk corrupt
Jive turkey, my hollow-points will gobble your guts
And if that ain't enough, right when you think that's it
Christmas the 25th straight takin your ??
Bank accounts cleaned out trying to purchase them gifts
Tis the season for the po' to starve, loadin them clips
Packin them fifths, and you could keep your ho-ho-ho
Gimmie your dough, my house feel so cold
And we need heat, let's be in the spirit to give
I have more than just the wreath 
From the door to your crib nigga

Anyway, back to the jam
Most holidays we celebrate ain't nothing but scams
And lies and tricks and all the real meaning be lost
For me it's time and a half or just another day off
c'mon nigga

Know what I'm sayin
Tired of that bullshit dog
What's up with Huey P. Newton Day 
Or some shit like that, Fred Hampton Day
Fuck that what's up with People Army Day dog
Hedrush Day, DP's Day, I.T Day
You know how it go man we up in this piece like this
want to see some real shit man

Who gon get it for you
Who gon pour it for you, roll it for you

You a leach

Talking about the old days and how you ran the street
Stop looking for coke
Looking for smoke

Some niggas make moves, so watch the next man move

On that dollar-dollar bill thrill

Niggas need meals
And guns still kill
They niggas want oh yes my niggas will in a heartbeat

Make it all better instead of sitting around uptight
Looking down 'cause it ain't right

Or trying to get off crack

Scared to take a risk
Turn around and be the first to make a diss
Try to keep it crisp and tight and let it rip

Hell I coulda died not satisfied
You said you couldn't but you lied
People don't try 'cause they petrified
Of what though
I ain't even worried about the po-po
And once we ??? them
There ain't a place that can't go
And bump takin things slow
Watching people shit from get-go
In my way-get blowed
In my space-get towed
Use shit as fertilizer
Make yourself grow and get wiser

How you act is how you will be
Say it's hard and it never will be easy

True thinking is a deliberative act of the mind
Held fast to its task
Good or bad
The mind will bring into you life what you conceive
Strong will is the master of the body
Directed in the ? in the dictates of desire or reason
Will is itself power to bring forth the motive
On impluse that is strongest
Be it positive or negative
As is the mind, so is the will
Contemplate confidence and belief in your will
So your mind will be clothed 
With the power to have all possessions
Self-possessions, self-restraints, self-direction
And self-complusion to have anything you desire
The law of the will is the law of all rounds
Of symmetric character of self
God gave us a choice to direct thy will
And the power to be or not to be
The choices is ours-Willpower",Willpower,2001

Trying to sing their troubles, their troubles and their fear
Oh, even if I wanna learn how to avoid those fifteen girls
Still running faster than me, what am I doing here?

Love is a state I hope I'll never forget
(Never forget, never forget)
If I could know my fate things would be nicer, things would be better

",Made First Never Forget,2000
Tahiti 80,"Mr. Davies lives in a big house
In a town called L.A
He drinks champagne for breakfast
In his swimming pool

He has a sister named Victoria
She lives somewhere in Australia
To visit her he takes his private jet
He's now a gifted pilor

He doesn't care for his brother
No more place in the picture book

And he gives me complexes
Because he's considered a songwriter
And I'm not at this time

When Mr. Davis goes shopping
He says hello to David Charlie Watts
He gave up pop music
To play squash with Ringo Starr

But that does not matter
When you listen to his selected discography

And he gives me complexes
Because he's considered a songwriter
And I'm not at this time

",Mr. Davis,2000
Tahiti 80,"You spend your days on your own
Thinking about troubles of your own
You dream of the day
You will accept your reflections all alone

You're not the only one
To feel that way you know
I'm not the only one
To feel that emptiness in me

You know that's why
I'd like to be somebody else
Somebody without feelings
Only sensations and money

There is nothing within my range
That can bring this radical change
Everyday's the same
The story's rather tame

Among everyone I know
No one ever shows
What in their heart grows
Or I guess I don't want to know
I'm afraid of what I'd see
People disgust me
When I find out what they're all about

You're not the only one
To feel that way you know
I'm not the only one
To feel that emptiness in me

You know that's why
I'd like to be somebody else
Somebody without feelings
Only sensations and money

Only sensations,
Sensations, sensations, and money",Puzzle,2000
