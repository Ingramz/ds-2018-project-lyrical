Robin Thicke,"Oh you I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next ""G""
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.

Me and Jay-z were cooler than ? 
Seen an all world cover girl
Hey lady I'm sorry if you're in a rush
Don't let me hold ya up, or intervene or interrupt;
But you got the look, I wanna get to know ya better
I had to let her know, yo I couldn't sweat her
Cause 'if you were to see what I was seein'
Almost looked Korean
But European
When she spoke her accent was self-explanatory
Even her body language told a story
Her name was Mahogany, Prince name was Ebony
I said my name was rob, and this is Jay-Z

Baby, aw yeah
I want you to be my, aw yeah.

[Repeat: x2]
Oh you, I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you Mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next ""G""
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.

It's funny how times flies when your havin' fun
We got close and it was almost one
She kissed me slow
But you know how far a kiss go
Fuck around & miss the show
So I told her hold that thought real tight
We'll finish where we left on later tonight
In a rise, I knew that she wanted my agony, agony, agony in her body

Baby, oh yeah
I want you to be my, I want you to be my

[Repeat: x2]
Oh you, I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next ""G""
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.

Showed her some ? Then I took her to the condo
She's poppin' ? but don't know me so well
She asked me how come I don't smile
I said everything's fine
But I'm in a new york state of mind, baby
Yeah, I said everything's fine but I'm in a new york state of mind baby

Oh yeah

Oh you, I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next ""G""
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.

As we reach the kingdom she said
""Bring some champagne out and entertain then sing some
Sentimental song, real gentle""
It hit the spot then you know where we went to
As we embraced & felt our heart pumpin'
She was in the mood for somethin'
So I layed back on my back & relaxed
It wasn't the Perion that made me collapse

[Repeat: x2]
Oh you, I've been goin' crazy
I want to buy a ring and make you mrs. sexy
Want you to have my kids and help you make your next ""G""
Tell me how I can't miss this on beat.

Hey,
I want you to be mine 
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine
I want you to be mine
I want you, to be my",Mrs. Sexy,2009

Robin Thicke,"Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Now usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to a hotel for just a one night stand
See, I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron, man, I'm just tryna take it straight

Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
The sweetest girl in the world and I mean it and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothin' like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child

Tellin' myself I'm a playa so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seein' this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothin' like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm 'bout to handle my business then put that girl in my kitchen

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (uh, that's what I told her)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

All the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-starrin' in one of my movies

Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and get right down to sexin'
Now I ain't got nothin' to do, tonight I got away for my crew
I just wanna put some in you and I can tell that you want it too

And I'm ready, babe and you're ready, babe
So come on ladies let's get up out of this club
Kel's dreamin', Rese's after party come on fuck with us

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant
Knock you up, pregnant, knock you up

Ooh, this song has got me hungry, baby, baby
So tell me that you want me, baby, baby
And girl, I'll love you 'til the sun shines
And girl, I promise I will make you my mine

Around the world in and out of clubs hangin' with chicks
And I don't see nothin' wrong with havin' a kid
Sounds like heaven's callin' us
And girl, well, it's about makin' love

If you choose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be man drama free
I think both of us should leave this club
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there's no phones to ring and plant this magic seed

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Your house, my house don't matter, heat it up
Your city, my city don't matter, give it up
Somethin' about being with you make me wanna, baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby

You can play all you want but I know you feel it too
For 3 weeks you been talkin' about extra bedrooms
In New York meetin' with the realtor
There somethin' you wanna tell me, just say it, I'll pay it

Oh girl, I'ma take care of you
And I'ma still hold you like we brand new
So don't get it twisted for 30 somethin' weeks
I'm still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you make me wanna)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

Take you out to eat uh-uh
Wine and dine uh-uh
Shoppin' spree, uh-uh
You sexin' me uh huh
See, I'm not cheap
Or selfish babe (no ah)
Girl, I'm just thurstin' (no ha)
For that booty, babe

And it's all your fault, baby, you look so good
It's all your fault that it feels like wood
And you look so bored up in this club so let's go
We can hop in the Lamborghini, roll to my big home

Shorty let's go crazy, let's make a lil' Kelly
Baby, I got goodies and I want you to have some (have some)
All I ask that you let me explore your secret garden

Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (you pregnant)
Girl, you make me wanna get you pregnant (oh oh pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)

Robin Thicke,"I met this pretty girl
She was from D.C.
I liked the way that she smiled

Said, “There’s a party tonight,
You oughta come with me.”
She said, “Baby, I’ll try.”

I waited all night long
For her to walk in
For her to bring me her light

Then she came in the room
She looked right at me
She was the vision of my life

[Chorus]
(I love) My life
Everything is wonderful
My life
The sun is out; it’s shining so bright
My life
Just like it’s supposed to go

You and me, we’re living the dream alright, alright
You and me, we’re living the dream tonight, tonight
You and me, we’re living the dream alright, alright

I’m in the perfect place
Can’t wipe the smile off my face
Ain’t nothin’ bringing me down

I feel like clappin’ my hands
I feel like stompin’ my feet
I feel like groovin’ all night

With your body close to me
I hope you can feel my energy
Watch you move your body
Get hot with me
You and I are celebrating tonight

It’s all around me now
You couldn’t stop it if you tried
Today is like no other day
‘Cause I’m havin’ the time of my life

Robin Thicke,"It feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart.
I need you around for every day to start;
I haven't left you alone.

There's something about you, it's there in your eyes,
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find.
All this time away is killing me inside -
I need your love in my life.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,
I want to fall with you again.

We fought in a battle, but nobody won,
And left ourselves a mountain to overcome.

I need us to carry on.

I want to spend time 'til it ends,
I want to fall with you again.
Like we did when we first met,

You can always give 'em some more.

I don't just wanna know about any secret of yours
I wanna know about one special secret
Because tonight I want to learn all about
The secrets in your garden

I wanna read your mind
Know your deepest feelings
I wanna make it right for you
Baby, show me
Let me share the mystery, oh

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Listen to your heart
Tonight make it, alright
Come on, come out tonight

I know a melody that we could sing together
I've got the secret key to you
Let's make music, harmonizing ecstasy
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Sing it to me

Here in the garden
Where temptation feels so right
Passion can make you fall
For what you feel

In the garden, we can make it come alive
Every night oh, woman
Your secret garden, oh oh
Yeah, in the garden

I need to be with you
Let me lay beside you
Do what you want me to all night
Gonna hold you, ooh baby, can I touch you there

Come on, come on, come on, come on
I can keep you satisfied, baby
Come on, come on, come on, all night
Oh we, oh we, baby
Come on, come out tonight

I'll take good care of you
That's what a man's supposed to do
And I'll be there for you all the time
Let your hair down, let me get you in the mood

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Take me with you

Into the garden
Where the temptation feels so right
Passion can make you fall
For what you feel

In the garden, we can make it come a live
Every night, oh woman
Here in your secret garden

You know I've never wanted anyone
I've never wanted anyone as much as I
As much as I want you

I want you to show me
I want you to tell me how you feel
All the secrets

If ya think I'm
I'm gonna take care of you

Robin Thicke,"Paris, France to Michigan
London town and through Berlin
I can't believe this place I'm in
Everywhere and back again
Porcelain and China dolls
Give me one and I've seen them all
Got my back against the wall
Wonder where I'll be tomorrow?

But wait, now how long could this take?
It's hard to find a mate,
When you're gone before he wakes.
They say it's hard to achieve
But can't a girl believe?

Is there somebody who still believes in love?
I know you're out there
There's got to be somebody
I search around the world
But I can't seem to find
Somebody to love

Baby girl, there you at
Looking at me like a putty cat
Wondering where that thing is at
Wondering where your ring is at
Nobody ever did it quite like this
Nobody ever did it quite like you

Gotta take her higher
Rain through my window pane, she the fire to my flame

Twice removed from yesterday's sadness.
Still I am a dream away,
Twice removed from yesterday's sweet madness.",Twice Removed from Yesterday,1973

I'm not alone, than I am
People seem to think I'm superman
But I watch for the love
I'm living in the day of the eagle, the eagle not the, dove

Its like a weight, that brings me down
If I don't move, I'm on the ground
Its in my mind, Its in my soul
Its telling me the things I can't be told
Its a watch for the love
Living in the day of the eagle, eagle not the, dove

Another day, another night
I want to love, they want to fight
I need the time, I got to be alone
I got to meet a lover on my own

Black roof country, no gold pavements, tired starlings
Silver horses ran down moonbeams in your dark eyes
Dawnlight smiles on you leaving, my contentment

I'll wait in this place where the sun never shines
Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves

You said no strings could secure you at the station
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows
I walked into such a sad time at the station
As I walked out, felt my own need just beginning

I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
Lie with you where the shadows run from themselves

At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation for the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's just dressing, goodbye windows, tired starlings

The logic is erratic,
Potato in a jacket,
Toys in the attic,
I rock and I ramble,
My brain is scrambled,
Rap like an animal but I'm a mammal

I been brain-fried, electrified, infected and injectified,
Vivosectified and fed pesticides,
My face is all cut up
My radar's all shut up
Nurse I need a check-up from the neck up,
I'm Batty

It seems to have no effect doctor
They used and abused me,
Battered and bruised me,
Red wires green wires stuck em' right through me,
So hear my Batty word,
And exercise a little prudence,
When dealing with humans,

Phone call Mr Darwin
All the graduate students please move closer scapel, more nitrous oxide
The eye makeup when inserted rectly seems to have some effect
Remove the brain cap
You notice by dipping the bat in a series of pain
After  six hundred packs of cigarettes
The animal seems to exhibit some
I said orally
OMG I'm reading by my genitals
Insert the electro we're losing him
Seems to have no effect doctor
Wait, get me another one get me another animal!
Look professor they dance up and down just like elvis
Fine, strap him down, if he moves medicate him,
Medicate him, medicate me!
Seems to have no effect doctor
Thank you nurse,
Why don't you ever call me?

Doesn't seem like animals comprehend any pain,
They just get used to it!

'Cause I'm a real fruit bat and I'm ready to rap,
I'm ready to snap,
I suffer from sciatica and chapped lips,
And jock itch,
Like a rocket in my pocket and a need to scratch,
But now I can't stop it,
I'm Batty

I'm a real fruit bat and my logic is erratic,

Shave his head its just and animal!

Would real niggas respect me then?
Will some of these white girls wanna be more than my friend?
If I could take all of my tears and cry them into a chain
I wonder how many million more followers I'd gain
I bet my socials would be super lit
It wouldn't even matter what type of vocals that I have to spit
I could turn all this salty water that fell from my eyes into some diamond karats
Then when I cry in public I could finally do so 
Without having someone tell me I should feel embarrassed
'Cause I'm not and I cried a whole lot
When I filed a divorce and when the homie got shot
And not one time did I laugh at Tyrese's tears
'Cause when I was separated from my son I cried every day for almost a year
And at near the end of that year span I was filled with joy
'Cause my new fiance and I were expecting a baby boy
But after forty weeks he was born without a heartbeat
Still we chose to march forward instead of retreat

We bury Pooh in the very same day
They called us said they wanna take my baby away
I beat the case but I didn't beat the odds

""Like why you make it so hard? Why you even let me try?
Why my marriage couldn't work? Why you let my baby die?""
I apologize for not, you about to hear alot
This is not really music, it's me dealing with my thoughts
It was breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe trauma (huh), breathe
It's hard to kill the drama when the trauma won't leave
So if karma does exist I find it hard to believe
'Cause if you reap what you sow, I didn't sow these seeds
I need a Grammy for the damage, platinum plaque as a bandage
A couple healthy kids before I start to understand it
But because the fans demand it and the label said I should
I put it all into these songs and the hopes its understood

E messo al mondo figli migliori di me

La vita lo dirà

Non ho fatto il missionario, ho fatto danni e magie
Per bisogno e per amore
E alle donne ho regalato straordinarie bugie
Con in tasca mille lire
Dillo pure di me
Che nel momento giusto al posto giusto ero lì
Forse sì

E nei sogni e nei guai che sia quello
Che sia mai mi scordo un amico
Poi c'è chi non lo è più e anche chi non c'è più
Ma fa parte del gioco
Ho il mio quarto d'ora di gloria
E frane di malinconia
Ma che vita la mia

Ho cantato a voce piena
Le mie normalità e miei castelli in aria
Poi lontano dalla scena
Ho incontrato città che ti fan mancare l'aria
Però anch'io come te
Ho ancora una valigia di sogni a metà
Da riempire
Poi succede anche a me di non farcela più
O di farcela appena
Siamo uguali io e te, stima volando su e giù

I lose myself in the blinding lights

I got them hypnotized
I get another shout out on the mike
Keep me at all you like
I came to dance not to socialize

Rhythm goes boom boom boom
Same thing drops with the
People all gather around
Rocking to the beat the queen will be crowned

You always seem to come back into my life 
When I thought I´ve forgotten you, you always show up 
It´s drivin´ me crazy, it´s got me going wild

I guess what I´m really tryin´ to say 
Is that I want you to come back, Come back to stay,

And just one, little hint will do

And I know, I give too much
And there is much that I sacrifice
But I've got all the reasons
When I look into your eyes

I know I love you even though I shouldn't
And you should know I've tried to stop

It gives me that feelin'
It gives me that freakin' vibe

You've got that somethin'
That makes me feel so fine
Makes it worth waitin'
Until the day that you will be mine, all mine

You decide to take your time, I just want you to know that
I'll always be here for you friends keep tellin' me
""You gotta let go"", they say that I'm too good for you
And maybe that is true

VERSE 1
In another time, another life
Would have taken time out
In another situation I would have made you mine,
To make sure you'd be fine
I could feel you coming, I knew you would
And it hurts me so to let you go
I want you to live but I'm not all I wanna' give
But I never imagined you'd be so good
Right now nothing can be right,
All I can do is keep believing
Right now nothing can be wrong
That life goes on and on

CHORUS
I'm giving you back, to the stars

I'm giving you back, to where you came from
I'm giving you back, to the ocean
But I'm not forgetting who you areVERSE 2

With you in me I was beautiful
Two months of joy, before the impossible
Every second I long for the day
When the time is right, when there's no wrong
When you come back, come back to stay
I'll be there for you and I'll be strong
I'm still open if you still want me
And I promise I'll be all I can be
Right now nothing can be right
All I can do is keep believing
That life goes on and on
Right now nothing can be wrong,

You made me see a lot clearer
Heaven is not that far

one day I hope to be closer
To be as pure as I know that,
I know that you are

Something is just not right
So lately is a kind of changing
Into someone you don't know is right
You can't figure out why all you do is fine
You don't understand why you're so sure it is a lie
You give, he takes, he gives, you turn away

Healthy love, someting that I'm scared of
Feels like a conspiresy
Why is these so nice to me
Healthy love, something I'm dreaming of
When he's gone he's all I want
When he's gone I can't go on
Healthy love (healthy love)
Healthy love
When he's gone I can't go on.

Listen to yourself
His heart is yours
But I hear hear his trying
All you do is ask for more
How can a girl be sure
When her heart is sore
She can alfoy to ignore that tomorrow he might walk out the door
You give, he takes, he gives, you turn away (why do you turn away? Turn away!)

Healthy love, someting that I'm scared of
Feels like a conspiresy
Why is these so nice to me

If I don't say what you wanna hear
If I don't dress in what you want me to wear

I can't help it cause that's my truth

If my humor makes you bored
If my religion isn't yours
If my authority doesn't fit my youth
I can't help it cause that's my truth

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual
My truth, your truth, his truth, her truth
It doesn't matter as long as it's true

If my culture is something you don't know
Is unfamiliar and uncomfortable
I suggest you get to know my rules
Before you judge me, cause that's my truth

If your opinion is different from mine
If where I say go, is where you draw the line
Even if I may not agree
I will except cause it's your truth and it sets you free

You see the truth often hurts
But if it's honest it's always worth it
Can't deny that I'm subjective
But no truth can be objective
Even though it's universal
It's always individual

For whatever it's worth
Don't you try to compromise

Men too old and the girls too pretty

Baby, won't you come and save me?
Won't you make my world less chilly?
Don't need pity
Just your arms around my body

Won't you come and take me?
Away from the city
Let's do it today
Just want to get away

Met you on the corner of my favorite shop
I don't really care if I know you or not
All I really need, someone to hold me tonight
Doesn't make a difference if it's wrong or it's right

Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you
And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you
But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got
See I don't really care if we make it or not

Lately shit's been driving me crazy
Won't you take me outta this city?
Streets too busy
Men too old and the girls too pretty

Baby, won't you come and save me?
Won't you make my world less chilly?
Don't need pity
Just your arms around my body

Let's just do something else

Met you on the corner of my favorite shop
I don't really care if I know you or not
All I really need, someone to hold me tonight
Doesn't make a difference if it's wrong or it's right

Maybe in a day of two I'm falling for you
And you'll be gone and I'll be painting pictures of you
But for now all that matters is the thing that we've got
See I don't really care if we make it or not

Won't you take me outta this city?

Won't you make my world less chilly?
Don't need pity
Just your arms around my body
Can you do that for me?

I was all in the club havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all on the bar when drifter shawty redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home
With them real thick hips, you so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a lil bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, ""Lil momma, what you drink?
I know that you're a freak
But you know I ain't gon say shh""

See my game is outrageous
I got into the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
'Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

I check constantly, but it was all a dream
I never thought you could be so mean!
Tired of the waiting, so it's time to come clean
And why do boys have to be so shady?

And you wanna feel his touch,
Put your hand in the air, let them know that you truly care

I loved you, did I make that clearly?
And you're thinking that you can play my game,

I can say I did it all with love love love
All with love love love

Make a cast of my body
Pull back out,
So that I can see
Make a world
Are you ruling?
Make a world

I stayed up late when out drinking
Made a new friend with affection
He seemed upset about something
He couldn't make a connection
Despite the best of intentions
I've been looking for meaning
Something good to believe in

Don't let the noise confuse you
It's just something that you're used to
You never knew any different
There's something else if you listen

Who do you love?

So tell me how were you feeling?
I saw you while I was dreaming
We spent some time by the ocean
Next time I look at half frozen
I saw that people were smiling
I passed them by and said nothing
I couldn't make a connection
How do you make a connection

Who do you love?

I was born with something missing
But I know your lip was made for kissing
Ooh baby, when that human music plays I don't know why 

The wind explodes and rips itself to pieces everywhere
It itches in the chimney and it suffocates the air
The angels tried to anchor but they never get the chance
Their limbs are numb and twisted so they're going to have to dance

What scares you most will set you free
That's what the angel said to me, he said

I had a girl the shape of you, I loved her with my breath

In the darkness of the hall
There was someone standing with you
Who just wasn't there at all
And you were laughing

In a corridor of blue

Robyn Hitchcock,"When I was dead I wore a strong perfume
When I was dead I never left the room
And I saw the apples hanging, like moments in the orchard
But falling into action, the moment soon is over - no returns

When I was dead I wasn't interested in sex
I didn't even care what happened next
I was free as a penny whistle, and silent as the glove
I wasn't me to speak of, just a thousand ancient feelings
That vanished into nothing -- into love

When I was dead somebody took my hand (When I was dead)
I couldn't see his face I took his hand (I couldn't see...)
And the Devil asked me to supper -- he said
""Careful with the spoons!""
And God said ""Oh, ignore him! I've got all your albums""
I said ""Yes, but who's got all the tunes?""

Cutting paper napkins into little crescent moons

Bending blood, bending blood,

Like shadows of an acid bird,
That etched her way across the field,
So long ago.
Walking through the field in the summer weeks,
Look at all the creatures round your feet.
Pumping blood, pumping blood,
The mother gave, the mother saves,
White ointment of an acid kiss,
That burned upon the lips she gave you,
So long ago, so long ago.
Fun in the sun, locked in the blood stream,
Shallow bodies writhing on the grass.
Fun in the sun, hair in the slip stream,
Tadpoles shooting through a hollow glass.
Cutting out a silhoutte between,
Everything is older than it seems,
Son of blood, son of blood,
The baby shakes, the baby snakes,
Who crawled across the acid ring
And flicker from your corpuscles,
One sunny day, one sunny day,
Fun in the sun, everyone knows it,
We could be as mellow as the hay.
Fun in the sun, everyone blows it,
They grow up and instantly decay.

Will swim around you when you leave the pub

Are at the window with a quiet scream
The feisty barbel and the gruesome tench
Are decomposing on a yellow bench
There's something fluttering upon the sand
And all I wanna do is hold your hand

Bass, talking about a bass
Let me tell you about a bass
I wanna function with a bass

He'd never make love to a loaf of bread

Robyn Hitchcock,"Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.

Lack of involvement with the father, or over-involvement with the mother,
Can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual fears, and in homosexual
Leanings, narcissism, transexuality 
(Girls from the waist up, men from the waist down), 
Attempts to be your own love object. 

Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once!
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man, but this tends to get overlooked by our
Mother-fixated, overweight, sexist media.

So,
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to
Be ugly in a fully grown adult.

If you give in to them
Every time they cry
They will become little tyrants
But they won't remember why
Then when they are thwarted
By people in later life
They will become psychotic
And they won't make an ideal husband or wife

The escapist teenager who's

I fell in love with an English girl
Her skin was clear and her mum wore pearls
I fell in love with an English girl

She asked me for an almond whirl
I was obliged to the English girl
And when I found the one she curled
All round my neck, did the English girl

But when the wrapper she unfurled
""It's a little bit off,"" said the English girl
Though disappointed, 'round she twirled
Poise was a must for the English girl

The sweet she binned, it was not hurled
Slow motion for the English girl
""How disappointing wanton her""
Said the diamond mouth of the English girl
""I hoped for more,"" said the English girl

So Haggard and I don't mean more
I wilted before the English girl
And like a minx from Ronald's serve
She flittered away, with the English girl

Robyn Hitchcock & the Egyptians,"Sucking on a tap that never dries,
Could you take it right between your eyes?
Bending blood, bending blood,
The father stood, the fathers hood.
Like shadows of an acid bird,
That etched her way across the field,
So long ago.
Walking through the field in the summer weeks,
Look at all the creatures round your feet.
Pumping blood, pumping blood,
The mother gave, the mother saves,
White ointment of an acid kiss,
That burned upon the lips she gave you,
So long ago, so long ago.
Fun in the sun, locked in the blood stream,
Shallow bodies writhing on the grass.
Fun in the sun, hair in the slip stream,
Tadpoles shooting through a hollow glass.
Cutting out a silhoutte between,
Everything is older than it seems,
Son of blood, son of blood,
The baby shakes, the baby snakes,
Who crawled across the acid ring
And flicker from your corpuscles,
One sunny day, one sunny day,
Fun in the sun, everyone knows it,
We could be as mellow as the hay.
Fun in the sun, everyone blows it,
They grow up and instantly decay.
Like shadows of an acid bird
That etched her way across the field

On her face and on her hands,
Till she feels like she's a man.

And when the change comes, and the hair grows all over her skin,
She's a natural; she's part of
The body she's in.

In the Sahara, there she lay
On an ironing board, one day.
She was gone for seven months.
Hadn't guessed what happened once.

When they told her: ""You're pregnant,"" she threw up her hands,
And thousands of fingers
Grew out of the sand.

Are decomposing on a yellow bench

You need love, baby, love, baby, love -- don't you throw it away;
It's the musk on your tongue and your hoof that are making me stay

Cutting paper napkins into little crescent moons
Decision-making apparatus can't survive your death
""Good morning, Mr. Seagrove -- have you met my dead friend Seth?""
""No, sir, I haven't had that pleasure yet""

It eats me away, but there's something inside

Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name, I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow So
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will lead us back to Do, oh, oh, oh

Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will lead us back to Do
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do-- So-- Do

[SPOKEN] Now, children, once you have these notes in your head, you can sing a
million tunes by mixing them up--like this:

For the trap is set and waits for
Its prey!

You have come here
In pursuit of
Your deepest urge,
In pursuit of 
That wish,
Which till now
Has been silent,
Silent...

I have brought you,
That our passions
May fuse and merge - 
In your mind
You've already
Succumbed to me,
Dropped all defences,
Completely succumbed to me -
Now you are here with me:
No second thoughts,
You've decided,
Decided...

Past the point
Of no return -
No backward glances:
The games we've played
Till now are at
An end...
Past all thought
Of ""if"" or ""when"" -
No use resisting:
Abandon thought
And let the dream
Descend...

What raging fire
Shall flood the soul?
Which rich desire
Unlocks its door?
What sweet seduction
Lies before
Us...?

Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold - 
What warm,
Unspoken secrets
Will we learn?
Beyond the point
Of no return...

CHRISTINE
You have brought me
To that moment
Where words run dry,
To that moment
Where speech
Disappears
Into silence,
Silence...

I have come here,
Hardly knowing
The reason why...
In my mind,
I've already
Imagined our
Bodies entwining,
Defenceless and silent -
And now I am
Here with you:
No second thoughts,

I've decided,
Decided...

Past the point 
Of no return - 
No going back now:
Our passion-play
Has now, at last
Begun...
Past all thought
Of right or wrong -
One final question:
How long should we
Two wait, before
We're one...?

When will the blood
Begin to race,
The sleeping bud
Burst into bloom?
When will the flames,
At last consume
Us...?

BOTH
Past the point
Of no return,
The final threshold -
The bridge
Is crossed, so stand
And watch it burn...
We've passed the point
Of no return...

Say you'll share with
Me one
Love, one lifetime...
Lead me, save me

Base it I called it dream and others chase it
Its a pine box and nine lives crossed up like weed strands
Crossed like cross hairs
Cost, his keys paid
Special ops on the scene he's a bee ?
Attach the honey keep my money in the briefcase
With not a comp for me that's nothing when Im easing to get lost
The seasons nothing when I'm feeling grim
Peep as they dealing him
Knowing I am not yet boss
It's a ceiling I do not get
Often when it adds up
Coughing when they roll the dice
I am bad luck
In Vegas too playing Miles Davis Bitches Brew
Same day but the wish is new

Life of a gambler
I play my hand with candor
Tip the vic dancer
Lit the cancer
Kiss the tarantula
Switch the pamper
It's banter
Glitz and glamour
Whip the Fisher
No need to shift the Phantom
The tandem
Male enhancement
The sex is tantric
Perfect the gambit
Protect the King
Play the harem
It's heaven
Roll the seven with discretion
Impressive
The necklace
Make the peasant toss the lettuce with the French Dressing
(I walked in the Casino)
To add the jet to the collection
Fresh glass of nectar the refreshment
Popped a mescaline in like a breath mint
Benevolence
Diamond elements
Million dollar rhetoric
Remy Martin spill on the carpet
Twist pelicans in crisp garments
Triple lemons, Prince charming
The fire army discharges
I pay the lawyer, beat the charges
The energy is harnessed

Roc Marciano,"Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, I ain't like that one
Yo, line for line, straight up lambs on the arm
Giambi lenses, Ken Caminiti, Basworth

Been on the honor roll, sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna, Lo designer
Bending these young Lola Fellanas over, ace the test
Baste the breast with the juices
Under the influence of fly shit, I glide like Ovechkin
Disqus hoody, puff hibiscus, balance be the crispest
Baby girl, you're wylin' if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test, piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park, lamb in the sand
Blam blam a piggie try to put my fam' in the can
Strictly cop and go's, until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos, higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics, the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

Bitch, please, picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45's fire at ya attire, to break your armor up like fine china
Fly designer hoes diggin for gold like a 49er
I hit the diner, the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue Benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner, we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
Bank robbers, bang 38's to taste cobbler
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out, leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Beige fox, 88 Clarks
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa

With my dick in her jaw is givin' her heart failure
Lookin' at the down under like living in Australia
With no feelings involved, like Lauryn Hill killin' us soft
I score at will but when you this fly it's either limit, the sky
Or the unlimited fall, feel like I'm livin' the life of the infamous raw
Criminal who's been spinnin' inside the mirror in the sky
Suspended in time like the General Zod
Connoisseur of the finest colognes, call me the chemical lord
Pure artist and it's for sure dog

But you better not disrespect my
Motherfuckin' gun

God of the semi-automatic but yo ass bet not call me no semi-god

Tall spendin', livin' large (livin' large)
And it's the yard, niggas long winded
I'm gettin' in my car and I'm skrrtin' off (skrrtin' off)
Convict around bricks of raw, I keep the same down chick around different tours
I tore down shit before now the shit be more, 'cause now ya boy sounds just matured
And your shit for clowns, CB4, I don't know, Rihanna, Rita Ora
Either or, it'd be an honor to be a fly on either wall
Of these giant divas anytime you see the dogs, call the hyenas, we at war

Play the trap laid on the air mat before rap
I had the .44 mag in the velour bag
Bag of bitches had 'em bickerin' and back and fourth
This ain't badminton, I had to admit that shit bad for business
I like 'em bad and send your women, friend get apprehended
It's clear as wind that I done mastered this pimpin'
Hopped out the albino rhino, I don't buy no clothes with rhinestones
I'm too refined, I'm not common folk
Ferragamo robe, my skin rose gold, I was rockin' moto 7 years ago
You niggas slow, just dig the hole and don't be difficult
I keep the .40 Colt for hopes to get me smoked

Rocca,"Depuis mon plus jeune âge, je rêve de gloire, de cash-flow,
Dois-je passer ma vie en marge
D'un système qui me dévisage?
Mon panache comme bagage sûr, j'assure mon avenir
Mon futur je le vois prospère, fat, duplex, buzy,
Compte en caisse rempli
Grosse sacoche, Borsalino, BM, Porche
Nombreux rêves de mioche m'ont poussé à remplir mes poches
Avenue Foch, gloire, pouvoir sortir de la rue,
Croire, vouloir se battre pour avoir ce qui t'es dù
N'est jamais cause perdue
Le monde est devant toi, n'attends pas qu'il débarque
Sort de ton cul-de-sac, do cycle infernal do jeune que le béton détraque
De l'ignorance, la délinquence, la violence
Ta soit-disante malchance que toi-même sème par négligence
Échec scolaire, vices, mauvaise compagnies qui te trahissent
Fils! Démolis pour reconstruire ce que tu négligeais jadis
Je crois en moi...en toi...le futur est entre nos mains
Et rien ne doit pouvoir barrer nos chemins...

Refrain
Pour tous les jeunes de l'univers: ce message universel
""Je représente, nous représentons""
Je le dédie à ceux que j'aime
""Dans tout ce béton dans tout ce béton""
Pour tous les jeunes de l'univers: ce message universel
""Je représente, nous représentons""
Pense qu'aujourd'hui, see'est ton jour pour lutter et vaincre garçon!
""Le monde est devant toi, n'attend pas qu'il débarque""

Ceci va pour tous les jeunes des cités
Lascars et filles oubliées, banlieues condamnées, villes et quartiers damnés
Déshérités, exclus de la chance, fils d'immigrés déçus
Tous ceux qui ont dans leurs yeux, quelque chose d'horizon perdu
Fils de chahut, grandissant sous le souffle de l'obus
Ceux qui ont disparu sans jamais avoir connu la joie
Ma génération s'élève do béton comme un drapeau
America Latina, Africa represento Columbia
Le tiers do monde, l'allégresse d'outre-tombe
La tristesse d'un jeune en détresse
Pleurant derrière des barreaux sa jeunesse
Donne l'example, montre aussi que tu peux t'en sortir
L'espérance est vitale comme l'oxygène que l'on respire
see'est le pire des combats, la perpétuelle querelle, la saga,
see'est le dominant sur le dominé, la loi do plus friqué
Renverse les statistiques, sondages
Prouve à ton entourage
Qu'un homme plein de courage, peux creuser son propre passage
Vers la victoire, la réussite
Malgré les multiples conflits raciaux, sociaux
En France...tout effort a une récompence go!!!

Je sème de l'espoir pour tout ceux que j'aime

Refrain

Depuis mon plus jeune âge, je rêve d'explorer le monde, la terre, ses mystères:
Imagine des voyages en première classe sans frontières
Sans passeport, en Concorde, coktail à la main
Observant l'univers do haut do ciel, volant de plus en plus loin
Choisir son destin, être maître de soi-même
Vivre pour ce que l'on aime
Malgré les contraintes do système
S'entraider, parler de fraternité, de confiance, oublier
Ses problèmes ne serait-ce qu'un instant, voir des mains se serrer
Mater la télé, voir moins de misères, de barrières sociales
Chômage, exclusion raciale, de police, front nationnal
Entendre les rires des enfants percer nos coeurs en béton
Préssé de batir un monde parfait basé sur le respect
Mais le monde tourne comme une roulette et rien ne changera
Quand ""le Tout Puissant"" fera ses comptes, lui seul jugera
Filles et garçons avançons d'une case nos pions
Unis, nous sommes la lumière do chemin où nous allons

Nah, it ain't a game, dogg, it's real in the field
X amount of shells pop a nigga like a pill
Top down on the old school 'Ville
Chromed hunned spokes on the mothafuckin' wheels

That will always remain as long as love never pains

Quant’è bella la mia terra

Porto una cartolina di riserva

La strage dei rifiuti
L’aumento dei tumori
Siamo la terra del sole
Non la terra dei fuochi

Sei lo stesso mio fratello

Invece di impugnare quel coltello
La violenza è stata sempre il metodo di chi non ha cervello

Guardo il cielo per cercare chi purtroppo non c’è più

Non so come, non so dove 
L’alta velocità mi porta via dalle persone 
Non trovo le parole, preferisco stare solo 
Non parlo, vorrei che questa gente mi capisse al volo 
Cosa mi rimane di te? 
Una vecchia foto tra l’altro pure sbiadita, 
Avevi il tuo maglione nuovo. 
Sei cresciuta, ti ho visto l’altro giorno con tua madre 
Il taglio nuovo non è male, il tuo colore naturale. 
Sei cresciuta in queste mani ed eravamo bimbi 
Dicevi se facciamo figli, speriamo che mi assomigli
Passi per strada e non saluti, fai un errore 
Non si tratta di rimpianti, si tratta di educazione 
Ci chiedono il perché scriviamo canzoni tristi 
Triste come il mondo di cui siamo protagonisti 
Toglimi la penna di me rimane niente 
La musica è finita e queste luci sono spente. 

Lei non ritorna più, e se torna non è lei 
Adesso sta con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 
Che ne sarà di noi? 
Tu non eri il mostro che ora sei 
Adesso stai con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 

Sento freddo e non è il tempo, è il freddo che c’ho dentro 
Le persone sono come il vento, e tu forse sei l’esempio 
Ma che ne so che cos’è l’amore, conosco I danni 
Gli anni non cancellano la delusione 
Le tue promesse false, come I Ti Amo che dicevi 
Ma la vita non perdona se non dai quando ricevi 
Non so fidarmi di nessuno ed è un peccato 
Mi ha tradito sempre chi mi aveva accarezzato 
Cerchiamo sempre la persona della vita 
Ma poi quando la incontriamo gli diciamo che è finita sai 
L’essere umano non può accontentarsi mai 
Anche dopo la vittoria cercherà qualche altra sfida 
Sono sempre un pazzo che crede ancora al bene 
Lo scrivo dentro a un pezzo solo per farlo sapere 
Me ne torno a casa mia, non è successo niente 
Ti ritorno indietro tutti e torno giù tra la mia gente 

Lei non ritorna più, e se torna non è lei 
Adesso sta con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay 
Che ne sarà di noi? 
Tu non eri il mostro che ora sei 
Adesso stai con lui, sono giorni in cui schiaccerei Replay

Venderei più copie se solo facessi fitness
Il manager è stanco del mio fare neomelodico
Roba da cabaret, da 2pac ad Annarè
Il più disagiato della scena black

R H is back (Macheteros in the house)
Inutile che fingi, pure tua madre è una fan

Sono Rambo in questa royal rumble
Dopo averci fatto hanno gettato via lo stampo

Mi puoi ammanettare, mi scateno col flow
Mi pare elementare eliminare il bon ton
Se mi vedi suonare devi fare chapeau

Le tue mani vanno (su)
I miei cani fanno (wu wu wu)
E il locale viene (giù)

Stronzi all'arrembaggio, la faccia da cazzo, la scarpa col baffo
Rime shuffle, un campione di nome e di fatto
Un rigore di piatto, colmi Oliver Hutton (Gemitaiz)
Col numero 10, goal su pallonetto

Su dall'underground, selfmade, en plein, rap game
Nella corsa all'oro sono il (?) (burnout)
Schianto gli altri rapper sopra il guardrail (take down)

Ma resto uno e nessuno, no glory B.A.P (watch me)
Siete solo news e brutte pose
Pure al sud dicono frate, m'hai spaccat tutt cose
La morte che fai tu prende forma dal mio lapis
Compra views su youtube tanto la mia strofa è gratis (you lose)

Let's go, se viene giù il locale lascia andare lo show
Mi puoi ammanettare, mi scateno col flow
Mi pare elementare eliminare il bon ton
Se mi vedi suonare devi fare chapeau
E il locale viene (giù)
Le tue mani vanno (su)
I miei cani fanno (wu wu wu)
E il locale viene (giù)
Col suono della mia (crew)
E I uajoni fanno (oh oh oh)",The Show,2014
Rocco Hunt,"Vieni con me che ti porto dove sono nato,
Nel posto che mi ha reso un uomo e mi ha educato.
Sono cresciuto qui, sotto questo porticato
E per me poter viaggiare pensa quanto bello è stato.
Tu guardi fisso il mare,
Per te non è normale,
Averlo qui a due passi e vederci il sole tramontare.
I bambini con I castelli di sabbia
Insegnano agli adulti a distruggere I castelli di rabbia.
Il vento in faccia sullo scooter,
La macchina di amici col subwoofer,
Brindiamo alla salute.
Vien cù me, che ancora non hai visto niente.
Stasera lungomare, man e man n'miez a gente.

Vieni con me
Ca te port int a nu post assaj cchiù bell verè
Abbracciat a riva e mare guard e stell e carè
Con te ho fatto un'eccezione,
Nun chiur l'uocchij quando bacio a na guaglion
Vieni con me
Ca te port int a nu post ca nun può mai sapè
Dove nessuno può sentire e a gente nun pò verè
Con te ho fatto un'eccezione,
Comm vuless ca nun ferness sta stagione.

Che tranquillità,
Cellulari spenti e cuori aperti
Spegni I social ed accendi I sentimenti
Era più bello da bambini,
Spensierati ed innocenti
E c ce pozz fà,
Rimpiango spesso I vecchi tempi.
Vieni con te,
Stasera cena, ti porto in costiera
Niente lume di candela, il cielo già fa scena.
Quando ti parleranno male del mio Sud
Tu rinnega tutto e falli scendere qua giù
E spegni la tv,
Tutte quelle parole non ci toccheranno più
Bruciano col sole, un salto ella tradizione,
Nun ce sta paragone.
E andiamo dai miei amici,
Sent già nu buon addor.
E non ridere quando parlo in dialetto
È una lingua per l'UNESCO
Quindi porta più rispetto.
Questa gente non ha niente,
Però sorride sempre,
E se non parlo col dialetto,
A stì person chi e difend?

Rocco Hunt,"Marcos ha 20 anni, come me come tutti gli altri
Quando capisci di sbagliare spesso è troppo tardi
E quanti figli che dei padri pagano gli sbagli,
Con un infanzia triste non puoi cancellare I tagli

Marcos l'incubo dei narcos, passaporto falso
L'ultima missione e dopo torgliersi dal cazzo
Ha un volo da lisbona sa già le indicazioni
Ha già una scusa pronta per l'ufficio immigrazioni
Incontrerà dei colombiani per conto di non so chi
Penso che a vent'anni cristo non esiste o si è fermato qui
La madre l'aspetta, l'affitto l'ha retta in un posto di merda
A marcos gli sta stretta quella cameretta
Bando o no la scuola scegliendo la strada
In un viaggio guadagnava più di quanto gli bastava
Incontrava dei mandanti senza nome senza volto
Marcos ci starà pensando ora di tempo ne avrà molto!

Quante volte mi hanno detto sei uno zero
E in quel momento io ci ho creduto di piu'
Quante volte tocchi il fondo ma per davvero
E in quel momento l'unica forza sei tu
Io sono come marcos tu sei come marcos
Raggiungere una cifra e dopo torglierci dal cazzo
Io sono come marcos tu sei come marcos
Diciamo questa è l'ultima ma poi continuiamo a farlo

Quante volte mi hanno detto sei uno zero
E in quel momento io ci ho creduto di piu'
Quante volte tocchi il fondo ma per davvero
E in quel momento l'unica forza sei tu

Marcos ha 20 anni, come me come tutti gli altri
Adesso da una cella non sa come consolarsi
Immaginava un viaggio calmo come al solito
Poi hanno trovato 20 sfere nello stomaco, quanti ci provano
Prendi il carico e portali indietro
Cambiare vita non è facile però ci credo
Vuole tornare nel quartiere con qualcosa in tasca
Mettiti al suo posto prima o poi la povertà ti stanca!
La mamma piange ogni giorno aspetta che il figlio torna
Una pedina in un gioco di merda poi si sporca
Ogni giorno noi preghiamo un dio che non ci ascolta
Padre nostro qui l'errore è vostro ma la pena è nostra
E questo mondo che gira per I fatti suoi da tempo
Lascia fuori I pesci grandi e mnda I pesciolini dentro
Ho visto vecchi fare magheggi nei seggi
Questi corrotti sono gli stessi che fan le leggi!
Quante volte mi hanno detto sei uno zero
E in quel momento io ci ho creduto di piu'
Quante volte tocchi il fondo ma per davvero
E in quel momento l'unica forza sei tu
Io sono come marcos tu sei come marcos
Raggiungere una cifra e dopo torglierci dal cazzo
Io sono come marcos tu sei come marcos
Diciamo questa è l'ultima ma continuiamo a farlo

Ahmed è come marcos in italia dopo lo sbarco
Lavora in qualche campo si chiede ""com'è che campo?""
Diciamo non è il suo campo diciamo che vuole altro
Non età ne documenti, diciamo che non ha un cazzo
La prima, porta in faccia, seconda porta in faccia, la terza porta in faccia
La quarta si stufa e spaccia
Dal primo soldo in tasca
Si compra un pesce e la plancia
Il terzo che lo devasta
Il quarto di chili in pancia
Ahmed ha fatto viaggi, marcos ha fatto viaggi
Solo per far si che tu ti faccia viaggi
Ahmed non li conta li mette sulla bilancia
E svoggia il nuovo rolex con il braccio fuori dal cayman
Non ha più controllo e non controllo chi lo guarda
E passa dai controlli in piazza ai controlli della finanza
E ha avuto una seconda vita che gli si è chiusa in gabbia
Perché lo stato paga meno della mafia
Quante volte mi hanno detto sei uno zero
E in quel momento io ci ho creduto di piu'
Quante volte tocchi il fondo ma per davvero
E in quel momento l'unica forza sei tu
Io sono come marcos tu sei come marcos

Quella volta, per pensare ai soldi, ho perso i sogni
Restiamo poveri ma ricchi di ricordi
Tutto ciò che ho visto, lo scrivo, registro
Poi parlo con le donne, col muro, con Cristo
Classe novantaquattro dagli anni in cui
Ti ammazza lo stato e non è stato lui
Tua madre con Barbara D'Urso in TV
Tu cresci e ti chiedi se credergli più
Quindi faccio l'alba, musica bastarda
L'unica compagna che non si fa di bamba
Se aspettavo la politica, morivo di fame
Hanno corrotto tuo nonno ed illuso tuo padre
Non avevamo niente quando andavamo in centro
Ci portavamo sempre parte del quartiere dentro
Periferia bastarda, sei tutti i miei ricordi
Ti guarderò dai vetri neri mentre dormi

Un altro presidente non mi rappresenterà
Ora piove su di noi, non so più quello che voglio
Perché non avevo niente
Solo una moneta e un sogno

Mi ricordo anni fa, fra, senza futuro
Fatto duro, che fumavo un puro
Stavo all'angolo
Ora street superstar, prendo questi rapper qua
Frate, li butto a pietà come il Michelangelo
Tieni a mente che sei sempre solo
Fare il grano, hermano, è il mio ruolo
Il milione come Marco Polo
Come il gruppo dei tre babbi, frate, prendo il volo
Avevo una moneta e un sogno e adesso
Che c'ho molto più cash, faccio incubi spesso
Yeah, classe 1-9 ottanta
Cresciuto con lo sporco della panca sui panta
Ora verso rime in banca, fra, carta canta
Penso solo ai miei frati con la firma
Vesto solo i miei capi con la firma
Bacio la mia tipa G: Donna Imma

Lo stato ci promette cose che non manterrà

Seh, lasciami qui nella Paradise City
Dove l'erba è potente e il sesso è easy
Sui vagoni firmati con la vernice, le fighe
Le borse firmate con dentro il teaser
E tu con le catene d'oro finto, è nichel
Dischi d'oro fatti al quinto repack
Fabbrica di cioccolato, hai vinto il ticket
Io, leggenda come Wilson Pickett
Classe 1-9-7-2
Venuto su, negli Ottanta, con la para dell'HIV
E vedi tu, l'eroina ha ucciso più della P2
Ma io ricordo solo la TV
Dicevo: ""Chi se ne frega"", da solo su 'sto pianeta
Qui tutti sognano i soldi, io coi sogni farò moneta

Dopo che hai ascoltato questo pezzo ne usi solo il due

Yeah butto giù qualche rima, sono ispirato
Perché l'occhio della tigre a me non m'ha ancora lasciato
Ricordo i professori non capivano il talento
Ho fatto libri mondadori coniugando il sentimento
Andare a tempo? Non è una scelta, è una prerogativa
Dal cemento del campetto fino in cima
Da una moda del momento diventò stile di vita
Dal freestyle dentro al parchetto, dal platino in vetrina un'emozione suggestiva
Sono Signor Hunt e non pensare ai doppi sensi
Questi non sono i miei fan, questi sono i miei fratelli
Non parlarmi più di Hip Hop se lo fai mentre smascelli
Triste come chi fa le strofe e si fa fare i ritornelli
Gli skate, la break, i fake, le tag, il flow, lo slang,
Lo show, le jam, Signor Hunt is back
Ci sono giorni dove non ne puoi più

Cresceranno depressi come il tuo Ex
Perché chi nasce coi soldi non prova il rischio

Convivo alla grande con la mia parte ignorante
Che al ristorante non mi fa fare il tipo galante
Non ti puoi mascherare dietro un vestito elegante
Se sei ignorante dentro vivi nel tuo mondo apparte

And when we kiss that isn't thunder dear
It's only my poor heart you hear, and it's applause
",Because You're Mine,1998
Rocco Scotti,"In the still of the night
As I gaze out of my window
At the moon in it's flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1998
Rocco Scotti,"Laura is the face in the misty lights.
Footsteps that you hear down the hall.
The love that floats on a summer night,
That you can never quite recall.

And you see Laura on a train that is passing through.
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you,
That was Laura but she's only a dream.",Laura,1998
Roch Voisine,"Assise sur ta valise

La poussière qui s'irise 
Dans le sillage des camions 
Il passe sous ta chemise 
Comme un léger frisson 
C'est loin la terre promise 
Sas mirages et ses questions 
Un dernier mot glissé 
Sous la porte d'entrée 
Avec sous tes regrets 

Si tu t'en vas 
Demande à la poussière 
De recouvrir tes pas 
D'effacer tes repères 
Le jour où tu t'en vas 
Demande à la poussière 
Où trouver le mystère 
Pour se passer d'hier 
Ne pas douter de toi

Qui n'te laisse pas le choix 
Où tout est trop petit 
Où plus rien n'est fait pour toi

Et la morsure du soleil

La belle indifférence 
De chaque jour qui commence

D'effacer tes repères

Demande à la poussière

Et tu ne fermeras pas les yeux

Avec tout tes regrets...

De te garder du froid 
Qui fait les vrais déserts 
Le jour où tu t'en vas 
Demande à la poussière 
Le courage de ne pas 
Revenir en arrière 
Le jour où tu t'en vas 

Demande à la poussière

Savoir changer de voie

De recouvrir tes pas 
D'effacer tes repères 
Le jour où tu t'en vas",Demande a La Poussiere,1988

Roch Voisine,"She was a woman troubled like a river
Trees all around her
But I only ever came near enough
To hear her voice
On the outside

She was a woman inside a castle
Knights all around her
And I never found myself strong enough
To reach and touch
From the outside

And every time I tried to swim across
I thought I'd drown
And every time I tried to climb that wall
I thought I'd fall
On the outside

She was a woman frozen in a picture
Frozen there forever
With a smile that keeps me so warm inside
But still I hide
On the outside

She was a woman farther than forever
Nearer not together
And I only wish I was back in time
'Cause she'd be mine
On the outside

But every time I tried to find the love 
I left behind
But every time I tried to make her mine
Again I'd find myself

Your memory flickers like a flame
It echoes like a distant tune
Dances on the four walls of my room

Blowing time back to me
I can still see your face

And watched the stars on Half-Moon Bay

You left me on a frozen April dawn
You were the storm-in my sky

Feel you washing over me

Keep your heart here with mine
Life's a dream we are dreaming
Race the moon  catch the wind

Ride the night to the end
Seize the day  stand up for the light
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

Heroes rise  heroes fall
Rise again, win it all
In your heart, can't you feel the glory
Through our joy, through our pain

We can move worlds again
Take my hand, dance with me
I want to spend my lifetime loving you
If that is all in life I ever do

I will want nothing else to see me through
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
Though we know we will never come again
Where there is love, life begins

Over and over again
Save the night, save the day
Save the love, come what may

Another year over, a new one just begun.

And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.

A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.

And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.

And so happy Christmas for black and for white
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.

Roch Voisine,"It was the third of June, another sleepy, dusty Delta day
I was out choppin' cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet""
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
'n' Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge

'n' Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece-a apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now ya tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

'n' Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""

A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
'n' Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin' flowers up on Choctaw Ridge
And drop them into the muddy water off the Tallahatchie Bridge",Ode to Billy Joe,2008

As if they're made of cold, cold steel 
A simple kiss like a turnin' key 
A little click and the lock's on me 
Can't move my arms, can't lift my hands 
I won't admit to where I am 
But I know baby, I'm in chains I'm in chains 
I pretend I can always leave 
Free to go whenever I please 
But then the sound of my desperate calls 
Echo off these dungeon walls 
I've crossed the line from mad to sane 
A thousand times and back again 
I love you baby, I'm in chains I'm in chains 
I'm in chains I'm in chains 
Should have known passing through the gate 
That once inside I could not escape 
I never thought this could happen to me 
Never thought this is where I'd be

For the fire and the faith that was you and me

We'll be famous on T.V. 

Would it be my fault if I could turn you on? 
Would I be so bad if I could turn you on?

Turn you upside down, don't want to waste it

I love you I'd be inclined to slap you in the mouth

How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?

When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused
And I never know exactly where I am
Unpredictable as weather
She's as flighty as a feather
She's a darling! She's a demon! She's a lamb!

She'd out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest
She could throw a whirling dervish out of whirl
She is gentle! She is wild!
She's a riddle! She's a child!
She's a headache! She's an angel!
She's a girl!

How do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?
How do you find a word that means Maria?
A flibbertijibbet! 
A will-o'-the wisp!
A clown!

Many a thing you know you'd like to tell her
Many a thing she ought to understand
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

Oh, how do you solve a problem like Maria?
How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?",Maria,1995
Rochester Pops,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1995
Rochester Pops,"Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven

And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing (Swinging) cheek to cheek
Oh I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill (Boot) me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek

But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
(Come on and) Dance with me
I want my arms around you
That (Those) charm about you
Will carry me through

Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Rocío Banquells,"Han nacido en mi rancho, dos arbolitos
Dos arbolitos que, parecen gemelos
Y desde mi casita, los veo solitos
Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo

Nunca están separados, uno del otro
Porque así quiso Dios, que los dos nacieran
Y con sus mismas ramas, se hacen caricias
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran

Arbolito, arbolito, bajo tu sombra
Voy a esperar que el día, cansado muera
Y cuando estoy solito, mirando al cielo
Pido pa' que me mande una compañera

Cuando voy a las siembras y a los maizales
Entre los surcos riego, todo mi llanto
Solo, tengo de amigos, mis animales
A los que con tristeza, siempre les canto

Arbolito, arbolito, me siento solo
Quiero que me acompañes, hasta que muera

Con sus lindas bugambilias 
A mí las que me gustan 
Son las lila y amarrillas

Así se pone bonito 
Todito el campo y la sabana

Del ranchito tuyo y mío 
Qué bueno que la pintamos 
De blanco con amarillo

Lo que quieras por volver

Es más peligrosa 
Que un animal salvaje 
Debes tener cuidado hijito mío

Lo que le pasó, a un cuñado mío 
Dejó a su mujer 
Como deja el río 
El agua correr 
Por el sembradío

El ya estaba cansado 
De tantos celos de tanta intriga 
Y un día se fue a la mar 
Se metió a nadar 
Conoció a una amiga 
Que le hizo cantar 
Y olvidar su pena 
Y se enamoró de esa mujer buena 
Y así se salvó 
De esa cruel condena

Se fueron baile y baile 
Baile y que baile 
A San Juan pueblito 
Y ahí miro la mañana 
Y una gitana de ojos bonitos 
Que le dijo ven 
Por una moneda 
Te voy a decir lo que a ti te espera 
Vas hacer feliz

Donde celos no hay amor 
No se tengan desconfianza 
No se dejen engañar

Han nacido libres

La otra te pide que vuelvas 
Mas que pronto a su lado

Totalmente enamorado

Te dice que la perdones

Ni tampoco olvidadizo

Quién va a volver 
Ni loco que yo estuviera 
Que volver, ni que volver

Ay, no, no, no 
Quien va a volver 
Ni que en este mundo hubiera 
Nada más que esa mujer

Aquella es una testaruda 
Ignorante y prepotente 
Caprichosa y corajuda 
Mal pensada e imprudente

Esta en cambio es amorosa 
Intuitiva, inteligente 
Servicial y cariñosa 
Y además es obediente

Siento ganas de abrazarlo de preguntarle por qué
Pero una voz que me llama por mi nombre y su apellido
Me pone delante de él

Cuando él me mira a los ojos
Yo siento que aquel enojo ya no existe entre los dos
Porque el amor es más fuerte pero estamos frente a frente

De un señor llamado Juez que ignora lo que sentimos
Porque un día decidimos pedir la separación
Pero eso fue un mal momento, un tiro en los sentimientos
Que casi mató a los dos

No reconocer el llanto de dos que se quieren tanto

Rocío Dúrcal,"Fue en un pueblo con mar
Una noche después de un concierto
Tú reinabas detrás
De la barra del único bar que vimos abierto
""Cántame una canción
Al oído y te pongo un cubata""
""Con una condición
Que me dejes abierto el balcón de tus ojos de gata""
Loco por conocer

Los secretos de su dormitorio
Esa noche canté
Al piano del amanecer todo mi repertorio
Los clientes del bar
Uno a uno se fueron marchando
Tú saliste a cerrar
Yo me dije

""Cuidado, chaval, te estas enamorando""
Luego todo pasó
De repente, su dedo en mi espalda
Dibujo un corazón
Y mi mano le correspondió debajo de tu falda
Caminito al hostal
Nos besamos en cada farola
Era un pueblo con mar

Yo quería dormir contigo y tú no querías dormir sola
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna
Nos dijimos adiós
Ojalá que volvamos a vernos
El verano acabó
El otoño duró lo que tarda en llegar el invierno

Y a tu pueblo el azar
Otra vez el verano siguiente
Me llevó, y al final
Del concierto me puse a buscar tu cara entre la gente
Y no halle quien de ti
Me dijera ni media palabra
Parecía como si
Me quisiera gastar el destino una broma macabra

No había nadie detrás
De la barra del otro verano
Y en lugar de tu bar
Me encontré una sucursal del banco hispano americano
Tu memoria vengué
A pedradas contra los cristales
""Se que no lo soñé""
Protestaba mientras me esposaban los municipales

En mi declaración
Alegué que llevaba tres copas
Y empecé esta canción
En el cuarto donde aquella vez te quitaba la ropa
Y nos dieron las diez y las once, las doce y la una
Y las dos y las tres
Y desnudos al amanecer nos encontró la luna",Y Nos Dieron Las Diez,2007

Para cruzar los mares surcando los deseos 
Fui tan feliz en tus brazos, fui tan feliz en tu puerto 
Que el corazón quedó preso de tu cuerpo y de tu piel 

Como una ola tu amor llegó a mi vida 
Como una ola de fuego y de caricias 
De espuma blanca y rumor de caracolas 
Como una ola 

Y yo quedé prendida a tu tormenta 
Perdí el timón sin darme apenas cuenta 
Como una ola tu amor creció 
Como una ola 

Bajé del cielo una estrella en el hueco de mis manos 
Y la prendí a tu cuello cuando te dije te amo 
Pero al mirarte a los ojos vi una luz de desencanto 
Me avergoncé de mi estrella y llorando me dormí 

Como una ola tu amor llegó a mi vida 
Como una ola de fuerza desmedida 
Sentí en mis labios tus labios de amapola 
Como una ola 

Y me escapé contigo mar adentro 
Sin escuchar las voces en el viento

Rocío Jurado,"Unos dicen que es un loco melancólico
Que te asalta por la espalda y a traición
Otros dicen que es un médico fantástico
Porque suaviza los vaivenes de tu corazón

Hay quien dice que es un angelito cínico
Caprichoso, malcriado y juguetón
Yo prefiero imaginarlo suave y tímido
Un salvavidas más de mi imaginación

Nadie sabe dónde está
Nadie sabe dónde vive, su apellido ni su edad
Pero todos le llamamos por lo menos una vez
Una vez en nuestra vida

Amigo, amor
Si tú pudieras darte un vuelo por aquí
Y te quedaras un ratito junto a mí
Ten por seguro que me harías un favor

Amigo, amor
Donde te metes que hace tiempo que no sé
Qué bien suena el corazón cuando hace pie
Hace ya tiempo que no sé lo que es amor

Unos dicen que se viste de romántico
Otros dicen que se pinta de ladrón
Es simpático y cruel, es lento y rápido
El argumento favorito de cualquier conversación

Hay quien piensa es pañuelo para lágrimas
Hay quien dice que es leal pero es infiel
Sólo sé que te acompaña entre las sábanas
Cuando no tienes quién se muera por tu piel

Nadie sabe dónde está
Nadie sabe dónde vive, su apellido ni su edad
Pero todos le llamamos por lo menos una vez
Una vez en nuestra vida

Si tú pudieras darte un vuelo por aquí
Y te quedaras un ratito junto a mí

de tanto usarlo
de tanto loco abrazo
sin medidas
de darnos por completo
a cada paso
se nos quedo en las manos
un buen dia

Se nos rompió el amor
de tan grandioso
jamas pudo existir
tanta belleza
las cosas tan hermosas
duran poco

Jamas duró una flor
dos primaveras
me alimenté de ti
por mucho tiempo
nos devoramos vivos
como fieras

Jamas pensamos nunca en el invierno
pero el invierno llega
aunque no quiera
y una mañana gris
al abrazarnos
sentimos un crujido
frio y seco
cerramos nuestros ojos y pensamos

Se nos rompió el amor
de tanto usarlo.

Rocío Jurado,"Ahora que todo está olvidado
Te puedo ya contar de aquel amor
Tan grande que sentí
Fue inmenso y nunca me atreví
A confesarte nada y tuve que partir

Por cierto yo quise retenerte
Saber lo que pasaba
Pues, algo imaginaba de ese amor
Te fuiste sin comentarme nada
Y en mi sólo quedaba la duda y fue mi error

Quisiera que entendieras, por favor
Que nunca quise hacerle daño a nadie
Yo amaba y ese fue quizás como aprendí
Que siempre a quien amas no te ama

No debes de quejarte sin razón
Tú nunca confesaste ese cariño
Yo entiendo que nos faltó valor
De hablarnos cara a cara y sin mentirnos

Después de todo terminó
Aquel amor callado
Que tanto nos dañó

Después de todo terminó
Aquel amor callado
Que tanto nos dañó

El tiempo que estuve yo alejada
Calmó todas mis penas
Y al fin pude librar mi corazón
Hoy vuelvo sin miedo y sin rencor
Dejando en el olvido, los días de dolor

Ahora me toca a mí contarte
Decirte que sus besos
No fueron de verdad y como creí
Fue falso y mentiroso nada más
Por fin tu lo olvidaste ya puedes ser feliz

Quisiera que entendieras, por favor
Que nunca quise hacerle daño a nadie
Yo amaba y ese fue quizás como aprendí
Que siempre a quien amas no te ama

No debes de quejarte sin razón
Tú nunca confesaste ese cariño
Yo entiendo que nos faltó valor
De hablarnos cara a cara y sin mentirnos

Tire las redes al agua

Pa' que no me lastimar

A beber agua salada

Pregúntale por que
Que por que una madrugada
Me dejo y se fue

Por salaba, por salaba
Contra viento y marea mi barco va

Pescaba mi amor estrellas
En la oscuridad de la playa
Beso a beso, la marea
De mi orilla lo alejaba

Sácame de las agallas
Del callejón del amargo
Ayer la rosa cuidaba
Hoy la espina me clavo

Y si te lo encuentra
Pregúntale por que
Que por que una madrugada
Me dejo y se fue
Palabra de honor
Que esto no es una queja
Pero un poco el dolor
Que se esconde en tu amor
Me apretó bien las tuercas

Tú ya eras así
Y  yo ya estaba alerta
Corazón de metal
Que no entiende el amor
Si el no lleva las riendas

Palabra de honor
Que aún mi casa está abierta
Porque a tu corazón
Yo no tengo el valor

De cerrarle la puerta
Palabra de honor
Mi palabra de honor
Que esto no es una queja

Un día tu amor me atrapo
Y me pillo por sorpresa
Clavaste tus garras en mí
Como un ave de presa

Desperté entre tus brazos
Y sentí tus cadenas
Tú me dejabas vivir
Pero solo a tu manera

No me pidas perdón
Que ese no es tu sistema
Volveré junto a ti
Y lo hare sin rencor
Porque vale la pena

Palabra de honor
Que aún mi casa está abierta
Porque a tu corazón
Yo no tengo el valor

De cerrarle la puerta
Tengo yo la razón
Le coste el corazón
Y mi casa está abierta

Un día tu amor me atrapo
Y me pillo por sorpresa
Clavaste las garras en mí
Como un ave de presa

Desperté entre tus brazos
Y sentí tus cadenas
Tú me dejabas vivir
Pero solo a tu manera

Palabra de honor
Mi palabra de honor
Que esto no es una queja

Por salaba, por salaba
Por salaba, por salaba
Contra viento y marea mi barco va

Tiembla por naturales
Fíjate bien porque es un cuadro

Que este pintor pinta con arte
Y es de cartel esa muleta
Que al toro embebió y lo dominó

Clamor de dos orejas

Pero hoy te lo voy a decir 
Aunque pueda faltarme el valor 
Al hablarte a la cara 

Lo siento, mi amor
Pero ya me cansé de fingir 
Y pretendo acabar de una vez 
Para siempre esta farsa

Lo siento, mi amor 
Lo siento, mi amor 
Lo siento, mi amor 

Hace tiempo que no siento nada 
Al hacerlo contigo
Que mi cuerpo no tiembla de ganas 
Al verte encendido
Y tu cara y tu pecho y tus manos 
Parecen escarchas
Y tus besos, que ayer me excitaban 
No me dicen nada

Y es que existe otro amor 
Que lo tengo callado, callado 
Escondido y vibrando en mi alma 
Quiriendo gritarlo
Ya no puedo ocultarlo, no puedo callarlo
No puedo 
Y prefiero decirlo y gritarlo 
Aseguirte fingiendo

Rocío Jurado,"Me preguntan si lo quiero todavía
Si los años no ayudaron a olvidar
Si recuerdo su mirada su sonrisa
La figura de su cuerpo al caminar

Me preguntan si a mi vida no ha llegado
Otro amor para que ocupe su lugar
Todavía ese amor no lo he encontrado
Y es difícil si el que siento aún está

No es que yo viva de recuerdos
Conozco bien la realidad
Pero lo mío no fue un sueño
Yo fui feliz y de verdad

Yo lo quiero todavía
Hace parte de mi vida
Viene por momentos
Va en mi pensamiento

Y en las horas de tristeza y soledad
Yo siento que él está
Y siento que me da
Amor eterno

Yo lo quiero todavía
Hace parte de mi vida
Y por consecuencia
Lloro por su ausencia

Me preguntan hasta cuándo va a durar
Para decir verdad
Tengo que contestar
Amor eterno

",Amor Eterno,2005
Rocío Jurado,"Te marchabas, te ibas de mi lado
No podía creer que era el adiós
Que este sueño tan bonito terminara
Que yo me quedara sin tu amor

De repente las lágrimas llegaron
La tristeza no pude contener
Y ese frío tan grande que se siente, caló
Inundó todo mi ser

Era tarde, sentí tú despedida
Ya sabía que no ibas a volver
Y con rabia y amor al mismo
Tiempo te grité

Buena suerte
Que en adelante solo encuentres cosas buenas
Que no te toque una de cal y otra de arena
Que sea todo felicidad

Buena suerte
Aunque me quede sola y triste en el camino
Que Dios te ayude y sea bonito tu destino
Sé que no va a ser fácil
Trataré, trataré de olvidar

Te marchabas, te ibas de mi lado
Me rompías de un golpe el corazón
Arrojabas al viento tus promesas
Y matabas para siempre mi ilusión

Era tarde, sentí tú despedida
Ya sabía que no ibas a volver
Y con rabia y amor al mismo
Tiempo te grité

Noche de baile

Ya se respira ya esta en el aire

El moreno aparece
Cruza la puerta
Pisando firme
Las mujeres lo miran
Buscan la forma de seducirle

El moreno se ríe
Juega con todos
No busca a nadie
El moreno ha venido

Me dijo que esperara que iba a volver

Down come baby Billy, and up come an able mil.
Mama stayed at work, daddy stayed in jail.
That's a full deck, but you gotta play what your dealt.

Drove a Honda
Stayed talking back and get smart with her mama
The real grown type
She was always right
Couldn?t get along with Pops cause they stayed in a fight
If it ain?t skipping school going out with grown men
Better your man named Sam with a white Benz
He used to take her out and buy Shanda the world
And even told Shanda 
You my only girl
One night it was late, they kissing and hugging
Next thing you know they kissing and loving
Two days go by and Sam ain?t showed up
Now Shanda on the bathroom floor sick throwing up
Mamma found out and had Sam arrested
Now Shanda at the doctor?s cause she wanna get tested

And everything she wanted had a real high price

She all about the dollar, but let?s go way back
When Courtney was going with this hard working cat
A drug dealer came along and ?
Next thing you know she was taking it right
We part of the reason why she at where she at
Now her ex-man got a million dollar car jack
His pockets are fed but Courtney is still broke
Cause her old man got caught with a lil dope
She stuck with two kids and no child support

Lose the feeling and you head for cover
You never told me, why I had to go
Well, there's one thing baby that I want you to know
Too many nights I lie awake crying for your love
But you don't care my hearts about to break
Oh here it comes.

I feel heartache coming on, I feel heartache and it's coming on.

What is the reason that you kick me down
Well I feel like custard, at the little big horn
You shot your arrows straight through my heart, through my heart
And you left me in down for love and it's tearing me all apart
Took away all that I had, when you took away your love
Did you have to leave me all so glad
Oh here it comes.

I feel heartache coming on, I feel heartache and it's coming on

Rock Heroes,"It was 1989, my thoughts were short, my hair was long
Caught somewhere between a boy and man
She was seventeen and she was far from in-between
It was summertime in Northern Michigan

Splashing through the sand bar, talking by the campfire
It's the simple things in life like when and where
We didn't have no Internet but man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

And we were trying different things, we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

Catching Walleye from the dock
Watching the waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul
We'd blister in the sun, we couldn't wait for night to come
To hit that sand and play some rock 'n' roll

While we were trying different things
And we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer

Now nothing seems as strange as
When the leaves began to change
Or how we thought those days would never end
Sometimes I hear that song and I'll start to sing along
And think, man, I'd love to see that girl again
Man, I'd like to see that girl again

And we were trying different things and we were smoking funny things
Making love out by the lake to our favorite song
Sipping whiskey out the bottle, not thinking 'bout tomorrow
Singing 'Sweet Home Alabama' all summer long

We were trying different things and we were smoking funny things
