"Walter Chancellor, Jr.","Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.",O Little Town of Bethlehem,2000

There's not a lot of things that
That can excite me, ignite me
You're all that and then so

"Walter Chancellor, Jr.","Everytime I think of you, I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here, and you're miles away
And I'm wonderin' why you left
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinkin' about you, and it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what I might say

There's a message in the wire, and I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I'm trying hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain't missing you at all since you've been gone away
I ain't missing you, no matter what my friends say

And there's a message that I'm sending out, like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload

I ain't missing you, I ain't missing you, I can lie to myself

And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonight

Walter Clevenger,"Listen everybody let me tell you 'bout the rock 'n' roll 
Feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul 
She said come along with me, to a land of make believe 
She said rock 'n' roll is king

She loves that rock 'n' roll and she plays it all night long 
That's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone

Play for me play for me 
Oh let that song ring out

Oh let those guitars play 
Play for me play for me 
Oh let that song ring out

I'm a poor broken-hearted bachelor
Living out here all alone
I'm a poor broken-hearted bachelor
Living out here all alone
Ain't got a friend in this world
An all of my people gone

The nightmare 'rouse me at night
The blue ghost haunts me all night long
The nightmare 'rouse me at night
The blue ghost haunts me all night long
They worry me so in this haunted house
I wished I was dead an gone

So I be'lieve, I be'lieve
I will try to marry an settle down
I be'lieve, I be'lileve
I will try to marry an settle down
But I'm a poor broken-hearted bachelor
Can't find a good woman nowhere around

Mmm-mmm-hmm
Ever since my dear old mother been dead
Ever since, ever since
My dear old mother been dead
Rocks have been my pillow
And the jungles have been my bed

I'm gonna try
An do the best that I can do
Because I know, good people
That I haven't even got a friend.

Waiting on the weary shore
I'm just a woman who's only human
One you should feel sorry for

How can you ask me am I blue?
Why, wouldn't you be too?

Done fell through

She taught you a lesson, but you should've known
That all you can do is make it alone
It's so easy wishing, but so hard to find
A person to love for such a long time
But don't be discouraged, when your love is gone
Just take my advice, and make it alone
Love is never guaranteed
And sometimes never true
Love is just a place to be
When it's there for you
Now what's that you're saying? She left you to cry
You just can't believe her love was a lie
But don't be downhearted, your life is your own
Believe in yourself, and make it alone
Love is never guaranteed
And sometimes never true
Love is just a place to be

Damned if I will said Adam to Eve
What made you mess with that tree
Forbidden fruit from some snake in the grass
Just ain't my cup of tea
Then Eve turned to Adam and she said with a smile
I'm gonna make you believe
There will be tears in Paradise
And they'll be all about Eve

Damned if you do and damned if you don't
It's the original sin
How come the boy keeps chasing the girl
Until she catches him
Beats the devil out of me
Beats the devil out of me

What light from yonder window breaks said Romeo to Julliet
This family feud ain't our mistake and I'll love you truly yet
Two crazy kids back in old Italy they had to alter their plans
So Romi followed Julliet all the way to the promised land

Now when it comes down to you and me we come from a long line of lovers
Who managed to make some history right there in between the covers
If you can't always be my Queen and I ain't always a King
Keep in mind this is not our fault it's a chromosomal thing

Witness the way in which I swallowed your line
So easily convinced the very first time
It was my finest hour it was my pride
A sudden sense of power by taking your side

A choice as black as night and white as a dove
A prejudice too fair to fight the bias of love
The bias of love

True justice and true love both of them blind
Can't take the measure of you in my mind

",The Bias of Love,1999
Walter Egan,"By Andy West and Walter Egan

Helplessly my heart returns, to the fire that always burns
No matter how I try to tear myself away
I'm drawn to the flame

I know I've been burned before still I'm comin back for more
One word and I will fall into your arms again
Drawn to the flame
I'm drawn to the flame

The passion of our love ignites desire in my soul
And fire warms and fire lights but it burns out of control
And when it dies the morning feels so cold

Helplessly my heart returns funny how it never learns
I know that I should walk away but I remain
Drawn to the flameâ?¦

Going home many years since I've been gone
On my way dreamed a scene of yesterday
Days when we lived at home

Memories once these streets belonged to me
I was young and just begun

Back to the old neighborhood
Filled with the ghosts of the past
Good just to stand where I'd stood
Home at last

Home again to my long lost long time friend
In the hal;l voices call

When did it all slip away
How has it all gone so fast
Now there is only today
Home at last

Goin home many years have come and gone
Time has flown and no one's home

Goin' home

I've got a leaky ceiling rain keeps pouring on my head
This old house of mine's 'bout run out of time
I've got to find a better stead.

The winter winds whistle in my window
Boards keep creaking on the floor
This run-down old place's bout run out of space
Got boxes piled up to the door

I've been looking high I've been looking low
Been turning over every stone
I've been looking here I been looking there
Been searching for my happy home

I've been going round in circles looking for a for rent sign
I've been making circles in the classifieds
Reading 'til my eyes go blind
I'll tell you why I'm in such a hurry
I just got the news today
That baby of mine's gone and changed her mind
Now she's coming back to stay

I've been looking high I've been looking low
Been turning over every stone
I've been over here
I've been over there
Been looking for my happy home

Scrape me off this ole ceiling
The sky's the limit today
I've got a sneaky feeling
That things are gonna come my way

I've been looking up I've been looking down
Been turning over every stone
I've been looking in I've been looking out
Been searching for my happy home

Whatever happened to the dreams we used to keep
Those crazy precious moments now so bittersweet
Once I'd convinced myself I really knew it all
Way up on my high horse just riding for a fall
I used to feel so different
I used to feel immune

Back to the land of the living, I've been away for awhile
I couldn't see what was in me, the father or the child
I'm gonna need some forgiving I'm asking for a new trial
Back in the land of the living, no denial

However many roads I wandered down alone
Somehow I never seemed to find my way back home
Too many solitary nights surrounded me
Until I felt so different until I felt in tune

Chorus

Now I stand at your door my heart in my throat
Trying so hard to find the words I never spoke
I won't fell like I'm home 'til I'm in your arms again

Impatience has got a hold you see
Our conversations are feeling old to me
A change of heart now I feel already gone
Its time to start now no sense in holding on

I've got to go, let go let go let go
Let go let go let go

I've got my motor running I can't wait for no one
I just can't stay any longer I feel there's something wrong

I've got to go let go let go let go
Let go let go let go

There's no time to lie in bed today
I've got to get away get away
And just go, let go let go let go let go let go let go

I remember when others forget
Back before we learned the way to regret
Love could change the world
Twas all that you need
Now the loves been changed to hunger and greed
In a world of compromises Its hard to know the score
With no chance of winning you hope for a draw
When nobody dreams anymore

Nights were long and late with passion and schemes
More to celebrate well that's how it seemed
Sides were clearer then and easy to choose
With the world to win and nothing to lose
Now the choice between two evils is not a choice at all
No wonder we wonder just what life is for
When nobody dreams anymore

Solo

Once it was a revolution but now it's just a war
And even a rich man can't help being poor
When nobody reams any
It's nothing but dying that you're living for
When nobody dreams any nobody dreams any
Nobody dreams anymore

We pretend we don't care and start talking crazy
I say something you say something and it gets so confused
Maybe you think you're being used well I know I do too
Let's try it again to get it right again
This is too good to let go why don't you use me some more

Come on give it to me give me your love
I'll give you mine
We've had a rare strange love affair

I don't want to fight why waste precious time
I want to touch you tonight I want you to be mine
I need something you need something that you can call your own
I don't want to tie you down I just want to take you home
Just one more time again let's get it right again

It wasn't me who told you nothing's ever easy
It wasn't I who said you'd die to try to please me
It wasn't you who said to me that you did not care
It wasn't true that someday I would never be there

Just like the tide swells in the sea
I am in you you are in me

It was an April full moon pulling on a calm sea
It was beneath the pier you suddenly disarmed me
It was a moment meant to live on for forever
It was that magic instant when we came together

It's been a year too long
It's been a day too short
Now how can I be strong
I'm getting torn apart
It's getting tough to take it
Making a wreck of me
It's getting rough to make it
One break could set me free

Now don't you see one break is all I need
And I believe one break could set me free

Sometimes I wake up dreaming before it disappears
Sometimes I wake up screaming
Near vergin' on tears

Now should I walk the line
Or should I jump the fence
Is this the reign of reason
Or irrelevance
With each passing day
I grow a little numb
I was an inch away
The taste was on my tongue
With every brand new day I grow a little numb
I was an inch away the taste was on my tongue

I've been waiting so long I wonder where old Fred has gone

He always makes me wait always seems he's running late
I should be home in bed but here I am waitin for Fred
Just waiting for Fred

He's got no sense of time this old friend of mine
He's stuck through thick and thin and so I wait for him

It was a Sunday night I will never forget,
Driving down the street in my red Camaro,
As I pulled in to the seven eleven,
The locals eyed a stranger that they did not know.

Challenger he's the new contender,
Challenger and he better know
Challenger we don't want no trouble from
The Challenger in the red Camaro.

He made his move and he made his challenge,
""Anybody want to put his pink on the line?""
Behind the wheel slipped the local hero,
REady set go and their engines whined.

The air was tense from the screaming metal thunder,
The challenger's machine ate up the local hero's
But when the dust cleared instead of his pink slip,
I had the hero's baby in my red Camaro.

Challenger I'm the new contender,
Challenger forget about your baby,
Now she rides in my red Camaro...

The hearts about to break, the faces people make.

The sound of the hunter don't be his victim,
You open your door and then it's too late

The hidden persuaders appear everyday,
So clever and cool the way that they run,
Their sinister power hurts just like a gun.

Or can keep us from blowing away

In the rain in Tennessee Friday night remembering what used to be
Many miles and years ago once there was a place and time I used to know
But do we ever really know the life before our eyes

Seems like many lives I've had
Shared with friends and family some good some bad
Memories come visiting
Stirring up emotions deep inside of me
Thinking bout what used to be
And the rain in Tennessee

But if I try I close my eyes
And travel back against the tide
It makes me sad but still I'm glad
For all I've had

Guess I'll never get to see everything I ever wished for you and me
But we cannot command the fates
We must just be thankful for what's on our plates
As we wonder what awaits our life in Tennessee

In Tennessee In Tennessee
Its all we've got just you and me
Let's make the best and
Never rest until we just

Wake up to a sunny morn
When the storm and rainy clouds will all be gone
We will look into our eyes
And with the look we see there we will realise
In the rain we've been baptized here in Tennessee

Remember when we were new and time was our friend
Our pleasure knew no end
But somehow as we grew the years like a haze
Occlude the younger days

But when you look at me that way
All of the years just fall and fade
It could be yesterday

Doesn't it feel like ten years ago
Being together all alone
Seeing ourselves as we did then
Falling in love all over again.

Its funny time brings us pleasure
Time brings us pain
No sunshine without rain
Somewhere our plans stand abandoned
Stillborn in time and dreams get left behind

In a revival here today
Playing the parts that we once played

You had your time in the sunshine
Now you need smiles all the while
Rain crying teardrops for flowers' smiles
Rain wash away all the time that you've cried

Go trade your cloudy shade
Into a sky of blue
There are rainbows shining through all your raindrops
You know your lonely now is only for awhile
There'll be sunlight breaking through on your smile

Rain falling down are you crying now
Rain whispers songs to your frown
When lonely teardrops fill up your eyes
Rain wash away all the time that you've cried.




",Time and the Rain,2002
Walter Egan,"By Walter Egan and Ed Berghoff

I can't sleep for wanting you, but I don't miss my dreams,
This feeling is so brand new, don't know what I should do
Want to go to extremes.
I don't know what time it is, I don't know my name,
I don't know a thing about this, but I just can't resist,
Like a moth to the flame.

Wanting you makes me feel alive
All I know is wanting you,
Every time I close my eyes all there is is wanting you
Wanting you wanting you wanting you wanting you

I don't know what's wrong or right, or what hell I'll pay,
I'm playing with dynamite, is this love at first sight
Or a fool's holiday.
Alone in the dark in bed, I'm restless as sin,
The thoughts running through my head, all those things that you said,
Again and againâ?¦

Chorus

I fall for your grey green eyes, the smell of your hair,
My heart knows no compromise, it just does or it dies,
Like it just doesn't care.

Chorus




",Wanting You,2002
Walter Egan,"We take we give to share the life we live
Once two now one for all and all for one
But even love most true
Can take it's toll on you
One day the payment's due But when a heart's at stake
Lover's do chances take
And easy victims make

[Chorus]
And I've been told
True love's not sold
But now I know
You pay for love, you pay for love, you pay for love

First glance love starts
To fill our empty hearts
So good so strong
No way it could go wrong

But when a heart's at stake
Lover's do chances take
And easy victims make

[Chorus]

And the price is paid in tears
Invested hours turn into years
You wonder where it went
The love that's all been spent

When part we must
We keep each other's trust
The price is paid
To keep the vows we made

For every day of fear
Each night without you near
The cost of love so dear

I played me a waiting game

As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame

And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man.

May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free to take some tea with me.

Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again

And the sun still shines above
The happy world I found
Came tumbling down
When I lost your love

Now I've got nothing
To cling to

They're not very much company

It hurts so bad, cause when I see you, I start crying,
I've tried everything to stop, but there's no denying,
That falling in love with you, girl, is just like dying.

Oh, don't walk away,
How, how can I make you stay?
Don't turn away,
I can still hear you saying those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through.

Girl, don't you know we could work it out with talking?
You won't look around or slow down your walking,
I've given you everything with kiss to seal it,
You had to get your kicks out of trying to steal it.

Now, I'm standing here,
Strange, strange voices in my ears,
I feel the tears,
But, all I can hear are those words that never were true,
Just spoken to help nobody but you,
Words with lies inside,
But, small enough to hide till your playing was through, ahh.

Walter Jackson,"Hey lady, you, lady, cursin' at your life
You're a discontented mother and a rich inventive wife
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had a talked to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh I've been to Georgia and California, oh, anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady, don't just walk away
Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived a million lies

Oh I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things
That a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me

Hey, you know what paradise is? It's a lie. A fantasy we create about
People and places as we'd like them to be. But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding, and it's that man you fought with
This morning, the same one you're going to make love with tonight.
That's truth, that's love

Sometimes I've been to cryin' for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life and never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that cost too much to be free

Now you're stranded alone and the past is unknown

No, it isn't very easy when you're left on your own
No, it isn't very easy when each road you take
Is one more mistake, there's no one to break your fall

You should have been there when I was twenty
You never heard such applause
Now I'm twenty-five and hardly anyone knows I'm alive
But there's no use in lookin' back
Because they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
'Cause yesterday's over and I've got to live for today
I'm goin' to a place and nothing can stand in my way
Yesterday is over
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes
I know my way now, I'll never look back from this day on
Yesterday is over, can't you see it's over
And I begin livin' today
I mean to borrow one day from tomorrow
And I'm gonna spend it on sunshine and things that I love
I'm gonna reach out and touch every star above
Yesterday is over
No they don't give medals to yesterday's heroes

Des yeux rêveurs un peu fous
Aux lueurs étranges.
Comme bien des gars du Nord,
Dans ses cheveux un peu d'or,
Un sourire d'ange.
J'allais passer sans le voir
Mais quand il m'a dit bonsoir
D'une voix chantante,
J'ai compris que, ce soir-là,
Malgré la pluie et le froid,
Je serais contente.
Il avait un regard très doux.
Il venait de je ne sais où.

D'où viens-tu ? Quel est ton nom ?
Le navire est ma maison.
La mer mon village.
Mon nom, nul ne le saura.
Je suis simplement un gars
Ardent à l'ouvrage
Et si j'ai le coeur trop lourd,
Donne-moi donc un peu d'amour,
J'ai soif de caresses.
Et moi, fille au coeur blasé,
J'ai senti, sous ses baisers,
Une tendre ivresse.
Il avait un regard très doux
Il venait de je ne sais où.

Simplement, sans boniments,
J'aimais mon nouvel amant,
Mon époux d'une heure.
Comme bien des malheureux,
Il croyait voir dans mes yeux
La femme qu'on pleure
Et, follement, j'espérais
Qu'au matin, il me dirait
Suis-moi je t'emmène.
J'aurais dit oui, je le sens,
Mais il a fui, me laissant
Rivée à ma chaîne.
Il avait un regard très doux.
Il venait de je ne sais où.

J'ai rêvé de l'étranger
Et, le coeur tout dérangé
Par les cigarettes,
Par l'alcool et le cafard,
Son souvenir chaque soir
M'a tourné la tête
Mais on dit que, près du port,
On a repêché le corps
D'un gars de marine
Qui, par l'amour délaissé,
Ne trouva pour le bercer
Que la mer câline.

Smoking endo nothing less, oh yes I confess
Guess what's next, I'm squashing the plex, I'm in the Lex
Bought your girl a new dress, just to give me some sex
Cause I'm ripping up the mic, and I dress so fly
Some people they wonder why, that I stay so high
Cause I'm a O.G., I know you know me
You got some drank up in the glass, go on po' me

And we gone fire something up, with no time to play
And its me you see, on the call at three
Grab your sack out the car, come and smoke with me

We some trend setters, focus on the chedda
Paying dues in the game, its gots to get better
Watch the smoke just erupt, let the roof back
When we roll in the trunk
Roll em up fat, and squash the chit chat

I'ma get throwed, and let the game be
Twist one playa, the smoke is on me

Cause we rolling strolling hard, and you know its holding me
Getting high, just like the stars in the sky
Floating on cloud nine, when I pass you by
Cause we ride and slide, until the sun come up
And if you got something to do, then you shit out of luck
Cause this the episode, we just waiting to explode
And breaking the microphone, cause my game is cold
Go hard in the paint, when I bump the dank
Its gonna be a little bit better, when I mix the drank
Let's get it cracking, pimping and macking with no jacking
Keep the smoke going, and keep the cash stacking
For real, we smoke the best and feel right
Purple crushed, blue berry and a dash of flight
Its going down, and it ain't for free

I'd like to breach the castle wall of you

Walter Matthau,"With one more look at you
I could learn to tame the clouds and let the sun shine through
Leave a troubled past and I might start a new
I'll solve the mysteries if you're the prize, refresh these tired eyes

With one more look at you
I might overcome the anger, that I've learned to know
Find a peace of mind, I lost so long ago
Your gentle touch has made me strong again, and I'll belong again

For when you look at me
I'm everything and more than I had dreamed I'd be
My spirit feels a promise, I won't be alone
We'll love and live more, love and live forever

With one more look at you
I'd learn to change the stars and change our fortunes too
I'd have the constellations paint your portrait too
So all the world might share this wondrous sight
The world could end each night

With one more look at you

I want one more look at you
Are you watching me now? Watch closely now

Your eyes are like fingers
Touching my body, arousing me so
I'm riding the passion arising inside me
How high can I go?

You're comin' with me, I'm gonna show you how
And when it's scary
I won't look down
Are you watching me now? Watch closely now

I see the hunger arise in your eyes
And it's urging me, urging me, urging me on
Higher and harder and it's faster and farther
Than I've ever gone

Your pleasure is part of the secret of flight that I found
When I feel like an eagle, my soul has no place on the ground
Born out of madness, I'll double the danger with no net at all
If you don't look away I'm secure, in the fact that you won't let me fall

Watch closely now, are you watching me now?

I'm the master magician, who'll help you escape
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back, bring the last straw to me
I'll turn straw into gold

I break chains made of boredom that others have lived with for years
I leave good news on doorsteps and laughs where there used to be tears
I'm gonna need you later, when you're not around
But I can take it, yeah, I won't look down

Watch closely now, are you watching me now?
Watch me now, are you watching me now?
Are you watching me now",Finale,2018

Walter McNeil,"In questo girotondo d'anime
Chi si volta è perso e resta qua
Io so per certo amico
Mi son voltato anch'io

E per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
See'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
Se tu non ci sei più, se tu non ci sei più

E dimmi perché
In questo girotondo d' anime
Non see'è un posto
Per scrollarsi via di dosso

Quello che ci è stato detto
E quello che ormai si sa
E allora sai che see'è

see'è che see'è, see'è che prendo un treno
Che va a paradiso città
E vi saluto a tutti e salto su
Prendo il treno e non ci penso più

Un viaggio a senso solo senza ritorno
Se non in volo
Senza fermate nè confini
Solo orizzonti neanche troppo lontani

Io mi prenderò il mio posto
E tu seduta lì al mio fianco
Mi dirai destinazione paradiso

A beautiful melody
From some enchanted land.
Down deep in my heart, I hear it say,
Is this the day?

I alone have heard this lovely strain,
I alone have heard this glad refrain,
Must it be forever inside of me,
Why can't I let it go,
Why can't I let you know,
Why can't I let you know the song

Walter Rodell & His Orchestra,"I tried so hard, my dear, to show that you're my every dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
Why do you run and hide from life? To try it just ain't smart
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?

There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart

I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy

Although I'm quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad

I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
In the furry of her first affair

Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy

Walter Scarf Orchestra,"While I was walkin' down the beach one bright and sunny day

Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes
Oh, I discovered a (Boom-ba-boom), right before my eyes

I picked it up and ran to town as happy as a king
I took it to a guy I knew who'd buy most anything

""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), before I call a cop""

I turned around and got right out, a-runnin' for my life
And then I took it home with me to give it to my wife

""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and don't come back no more""
""Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and don't come back no more""

I wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet
A hobo who was lookin' for a handout on the street
He said he'd take most any old thing, he was a desperate man
But when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran
Oh, when I showed him the (Boom-ba-boom), he turned around and ran

I wandered on for many years a victim of my fate
Until one day I came upon St. Peter at the gate
And when I tried to take it inside he told me where to go
Get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and take it down below
Oh, get out of here with that (Boom-ba-boom), and take it down below

How could someone so young know of love so soon?

Should I ask her to come with me or forget and walk away?

She told me she was older, I knew she couldn't be

I sat her down and told her
I told her crystal clear
""I don't mind you getting high
But there's one thing you should fear""

""Your mind might think its flying, baby
On those little pills
But you ought to know it's dying, 'cause
Speed kills""

But Annie kept on speeding
Her health was getting poor
She saw things in the window
She heard things at the door

Her mind was like a grinding mill
Her lips were cracked and sore
Her skin was turning yellow
I just couldn't take it no more

She thought her mind was flying
On those little pills
She didn't it was going down fast, 'cause
Speed kills

Well I sat her down and told her
I told her one more time
""The whole wide human race has taken
Far too much methedrine""

She said I don't care what a Limey says
I've got to get it on
I'm not here to just see no man
Who come from across the pond

E o sol
Beija o barco e luz

E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

Tudo isso traz

Volta pra te encantar
Num sonho tao pequenho
Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Como é bonito gostar e querer ficar
Com alguém pra quem possa dizer
Olha quantas estrelas
Nascem pra te encontrar
Depois do céu azul
A noite vai chegar
E eu pra te amar",Cry Out Your Sadness,1966
Walter Wanderley,"Haja o que houver
Há sempre um homem, para uma mulher
E há de sempre haver para esquecer
Um falso amor e uma vontade de morrer
Seja como for há de vencer o grande amor
Que há de ser no coração
Como um perdão
Pra quem chorou",The Great Love [O Grande Amor],1966
Walter Wanderley,"Fancy girls out working honky tonk's a place these were a part of the good old days
When I used to swing on the south side of Chicago
Twenty first and Network was its beating heart the place with action first got it start
Back when jazz was king on the south side of Chicago
I still can hear those silver trumpets blowin' in little places filled with people glowin'
New Orleans was groovy Memphis light and gay
And who could put down New York's Broadway
But there was everything on the south side of Chicago
I still can hear those...
Yes there was everything on the south side of Chicago",On the South Side of Chicago,1967
Walter Wanderley,"Why don't you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?

Why don't you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who you hurt so?

I'm the one you want
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one you love
I'm the one you used to meet

Around the corner
Everyday
We would meet
And slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Why don't you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?
Why don't you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who you hurt so?

I'm the one you hurt
And I'm the one you need
I'm the one who cried
I'm the one you used to meet
But you are pretending you don't care
But the fire is still there
Now we are no longer too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Have you ever felt the need for something more
With every week comes scratching at your door
Have you ever stopped and wondered what it is you're searching for
Push your luck too far with me
But if you push it any further
You won't have any

Am I the same girl?
Am I the same girl?

Can't keep my wits about
When you won't look at me

Is there something I oughta know?

Well, there's just a trace
Hiding on your face
And I've learned it that way

Waltz for Debbie,"Give it your all girl, give it all ya got.
Take your chance at a second hand shot.
Say what you want girl,
Do what you do.
He's never gonna, gonna make it with you.

Pulling petals off a flower trying to get your way.
Keep pulling til' it says what you wanna say.
Girl you can pick a field full of daisies.
But he'd still be my baby.
I know you can hardly wait till I'm away from him.
Instinctively, I know what you're thinking.
You'll be giving him an open invitation.
But my baby won't be taken in.

You can pout your cherry lips.
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss.
You can flirt your pretty eyes.
He ain't got his hands tied.

No chains to unlock.
So free to do what he wants.
He's into what, he's got.
He loves me, he loves you not.
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you
He's into what he's got.
He loves me, he loves you not.

You're the kind of girl that is always up for do or dare.
Only want him just because he's there.
Always looking for a new ride.
The grass is greener on the other side.
You're the kind of girl who's not use to hearing no.
All your lovers try to take you where you wanna go.
It doesn't matter how hard you try, never gonna get with my guy.

No chains to unlock.
So free to do what he wants.
He's into what, he's got (and that's me).
He loves me, he loves you not.
No matter what you do, he is never gonna be with you
He's into what, he's got.
He loves me, he loves you not.

Doesn't matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you.

Give it your all girl, give it all ya got.

Say what you want girl, do what you do.
He's never gonna make it with you.

You can pout your cherry lips
Try to tempt him with a sweet kiss

No chains to unlock.
So free to do what he wants.
He's into what he's got.
He loves me, he loves you not.
No matter what you do, he's never gonna be with you.
He is into what, he's got
Take your best shot
He loves me, he loves you not.

No chains to unlock.
So free to do what he wants.
He's into what he's got, (and that's me)

Waltzer-McHenry Quartet,"When the day fades away into twilight
The moon is my light of love
In the night, I am quite a romancer
I find an answer above
To being me consolation, you're my inspiration
This is my imagination.

Time on my hands, you in my arms
Nothing but love in view, then you fall
Once and for all, I'll see my dreams come true
Moments to spare for someone you care for
Our love affair for two
With time on my hands and you in my arms
And love in my heart all for you.",Time on My Hands,1997
Wam Band,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

Wamdue Project,"Well, It's yours

What makes you journey into the night
And take flight on a pursuit of musical bliss?
Chasing beats through ghetto streets
To a dungeonous temple left by our soul descendants
In a quest for peace, energy and light.
If you were to find this temple, 
Do you have the knowledge to enter the temple?
Do you want it?
And if you had it, would you flaunt it?
Well It's yours!""

There is approaching light
A-flowing, soaring through your world
The fire burns within your heart
And now it's yours
If you feel it in yourself
I know the light goes through the stars

Acquiring entrance to the temple is hard but fair.
Trust in God-forsaken elements
Because the reward is well worth the journey.
Stay steadfast in your pursuit of the light.
The light is knowledge.
Do you want it?
And if you had it, would you flaunt it?
It's yours!""

Well, It's yours

You stay true to your quest.
So let the beauty that is the musical universe engulf
You.
Recharge your spirit.
Purify your mind.
Touch your soul.
And give you the eternal joy and happiness you truly
Deserve.
You now have the knowledge.
Do you want it?
And if you had it, would you flaunt it?
Well It's yours!""

Well, It's yours

Ah

There is approaching light
A-flowing, soaring through your world

What I could do

If you were in my shoes, you'd  do it, too

No theres no other start, my mind's ripped apart
My hearts gone dry, since the day you died

A given end to your dreams
A simple movement or rhyme
Could be the smallest of signs
We'll never know what they are or care
In it's escapable view
There's no escape so few in fear
Give in a changing value

To be given your sight
Hid in a long peaceful night
A nervous bride for your eyes
A fractured smile that soon dies
A love that's wrong from your life and soul
A savage mine had begun
Hello, farewell to your love and soul
Hello, farewell to your soul

Wanda Collins,"Now when I was a-growin' up I was a pip 
I growed me a mustache on my lip
It wasn't very sticky, mostly fuzz
Thought I'd give all the girls a buzz
I got real sweet on Nellie Wills 
I drove that country girl back in the hills
I asked her once if I could give her a peck
If'n you can beat me to the old hay stack

Well I beat her there and I hugged her tight 
I turned loose all of my dynamite
I guess my kiss was pretty lush 
She smiled real big and began to blush
It tickles, it tickles 
I like it but it sure feels funny, 
It's a ticklin' me

Oh I got me a name in the neighbourhood 
The girls all liked it, I knew they would
I let it grow for a month or two 
Just to see what I could do
There was a girl named Fanny Smith 
Told me she didn't like to kiss
I caught her off guard and I didn't miss
I didn't know it'd feel like this

Well her eyes bugged out
Her face turned white
She hugged me up with all her might
I swear it took her breath away 
She giggled and I heard her say
It tickles, it tickles
You sure are a lot of fun, 
It's a ticklin' me

Well I guess I pert'near run 'em wild 
They all went crazy over my style
They said I was the best around 
The kissinest man they'd ever found
The good ol' days are here again 
I used to do it and I still can
Said a widder that I know 
I guess you'll never get too old

Well I guess I got that ol' know-how 
You ought to see me in action now
My kiss has still got that ol' sting
The widder says I ain't lost a thing
It tickles, it tickles 
I feel just like I'm young again, 
It's a ticklin' me",It Tickles,1992

Well, baby's a chick with the peroxide hair
You can't say this babe's a square
She likes her music with a solid beat
And when she starts to bop, you better go to your seat
'Cause, ooh, baby's gone

Like I knew she would someday

Drives a pink Cadillac and never sings the blues
They dance to a jukebox all night long
One glance and you'll say these cats are real gone
But, ooh, baby loves him

And when Baby fell, well, she really fell

That made him mad, boy, hot dog, that made him mad
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again

Oh, late, last night, when I came in
He demanded to know just where I'd been

Instead of an answer, I laughed in his face

Wanda Jackson,"You just gotta walk on both sides of the line
You've thrilled at the thought of each stranger's arms you find
Everything that's yours to hold just can't satisfy your mind
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line
If you had me in a mansion filled with gold
If I lay at your feet my heart and my soul
You'd still crave the grapes on your next door neighbor's vine
'Cause you just gotta walk on both sides of the line

You just gotta walk...

Wanda Jackson,"Baby oh baby tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind
Let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter a flying
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind
Break my mind break my mind
You know I just can't stand to hear them big jet engines whine
Break my mind break my mind oh Lord
Cause if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind

Oh baby yeah baby let me take your suitcase off of them scales in time

Wanda Jackson,"What a beautiful thought I am thinking concerning the great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded on the pages of God's holy word
Desiring to lower her standards they watch every move that she makes
But they long to find fault with her teaching but really they find no mistakes

I am glad I have learned of her meekness I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing the face of my Savior's true look
When he comes descending from heaven on the cloud as he write in his word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet him on the wings of the great speckled bird",Great Speckled Bird,1985
Wanda Jackson,"I thought love was only true in fairy tales
Meant for someone else but not for me
Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love, and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
No not if I tried
 
I thought love was more or less a giving thing
Seems the more I gave the less I got
What's the use in tryin'
All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine I got rain
 
Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
I'm in love and I'm a believer
I couldn't leave her if I tried
Not if I tried

Love was out to get me
That's the way it seemed

And every day's the same since I met you
It's such a pretty world today knowing that you're mine

If I look close enough the sun will come shining through

You have driven him away forever jealous heart now I'm the lonely one

Now he hates the sight of all I stand for all because of you oh jealous heart
[ steel ]
Jealous heart why did I let you rule me when I knew the end would bring me pain
Now he's gone he's gone and found another and I'll never see my love again
Through the years his memory will haunt me even though we're many miles apart
It's so hard to know he'll never want me cause he heard your beating jealous heart

Where the rain came through what can you do
Tears from little sister cryin' cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go oh but she knows she'll get by
Cause she is livin' in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can and she can
It's a good thing you don't have a busfare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it on the snow on the ground a walking to town to find a job
Tryin' to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills to the bone boy you'd better go home where it's warm
And you can live in the love

Livin' on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit and the chills stay away

Just a no count sharecroppin' black man who'd steal anything that he can
And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James
Reuben James you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind
Faded shirt the wrinkled brow the calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James
Flora Gray the gossip of Madison County died with child
And although your skin was black you were the one who didn't turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name Reuben James

You said turn the other cheek there's a better world waitin' for the meek
In my head these words remain from Reuben James

To your lonely pine box came a preacher me and the rain
To sing one last refrain for Reuben James

With your money and your name
And hide myself in sorrows
While you play your cheatin' game

You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't understand
But if you love him you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him all be proud of him cause after all he's just a man

And something warm to come to when nights are cold and lonely

With a heavy load from the seeds he sowed
If you see your sister falling by the way just stop and say you're going the wrong way
You've got to try a little kindness just show a little kindness
Shine your light for everyone to see
And if you try a little kindness you'll overlook the blindness
Of the narrow minded people on the narrow minded streets
Don't walk around the down and out lend a helping hand instead of doubt
And the kindness that you show every day will help someone along their way

I'm always blue, feeling so blue
I wish, I had someone I knew
Just to help me tuck away my blues

Someone to scold me, someone to miss

Wanda Jackson,"From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
From the queen of flowing mountains to the south bells by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome, she's known quite well by all
She's the combination on the Wabash Cannonball

She came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she rolled into the station you could hear all the people say
There's a gal from Tennessee, she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Our eastern states're dandy, so all the people say
From New York to St Louis and Chicago by the way
From the hills of Minnesota where the rippling waters fall
No changes can be taken on the Wabash Cannonball

So here's to daddy Claxton, may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the ports throughout the land
His earthly race is over, the curtains 'round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball

So listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland through the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine, hear the lonesome hobos squall
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball
You're traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

So if that's the way you've wanted me to be
I'll change if it takes that to make you happy

Wanda Jackson,"Teardrops fell the night you said
I love you, dear and you were wed
I watched you while you held her hand
Sand I bowed my head and cried again

I cried again when I reached home
Then stared your picture all alone
I've thought of things that might have been
And I bowed my head and cried again

I took your letters from the shelf
And read aloud just to myself
But just before I reached the end
And I bowed my head and cried again

I've thought of nights so long ago
And all the love I wanted so
And then the fate had took a hand
And I bowed my head and cried again

You'd be glad to let him go
A guy that stays true is hard one to find
I've heard my old flame is now on your mind

But if you knew what I know
You'd be glad to let him go
Has he told you of the joys that we knew?
Or does he pretend he loves only you

'Cause if you knew what I know
You'd be glad to let him go
Someday you'll know his love isn't real
He'll come back to me and then how will you feel

'Cause he'll cheat on you like he cheated on me

You're telling everybody that it's over that our love affair was just a waste of time
Who think I thought I walk in fields of clover
When your sweet love was never really mine
I'm passing through the gate where the sun will never shine
Too much I know too late how could I be so blind
I try to forget you but I don't have that much time
I know I can't get over you before I lose my mind
How could I even hope to keep a mem'ry when at anytime the past will disappear
When that time comes if I could just remember
One moment of desire when you were here
I'm passing through the gate...

I've thought about leaving but I'd go right on grieving
Somewhere between the window and the phone

But I was lying I hope you're crying
And everytime she touches you you'll think of me
I said the best of luch to you to your new love
But I was lying no use denying
I'm not as good a loser as I thought I'd be
I hope our past is strong enough to cloud your vision
Till one day she'll even get to look like me
I hope my mem'ry crowd your mind within decision
And from force of habit you'll run straight to me
And when I said I'll see you soon let's together
I wasn't lying I hope you're crying

You've got a big automobile and a chauffeur at the wheel,
But you can't No you can't have my love.
You think all you have to do is call and I will run to you.
Well listen while I break the news, I'm not the gal that shines your shoes.

So with your money
Clothes, and cars,
You ain't the cat
You think you are.
And you can't,
No you can't have my love.

Well hello there sweetheart.
You ain't got no business out here in this cotton field,
And that beatsack skirt
And that hand-me-down shirt.
Now, why don't you listen to me, baby.
I'd dress you up in the finest silks and satins,
And you know I'd perfume you up right nice with
Powder and clothes.
Now you know,
I don't know why I even fool around with you anyway.
There's a brunette up in Tulsa
Who cries for me.
And there's that blonde
Down in Nashville, Tennessee,
And that redhead down in Dallas,
She really loves me.
Now what's the matter with you anyway gal?
Just because you're from Oklahoma,
With sand in your hair.
You know I'm a good mind just to drive off
And leave you standing there

So get that big long Cadillac,
Hit the road and don't come back.
Don't show me that roll of bills,
'Cause it won't lead me from these hills.

Writer Julia Ward Howe

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on. CHORUS: Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on. I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps; They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps, His day is marching on. I have read His fiery gospel writ in rows of burnished steel! ""As ye deal with my contemners, so with you My grace shall deal! Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,"" Since God is marching on. He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet! Our God is marching on. In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free! While God is marching on.

Don't pass through this world but once you'll get yours and I'll get mine
And I've got a philosophy I believe I'd rather go by
And if you'll just listen you may want to give it a try
Leave a lotta happy tracks as you go down life's road
Leave a lotta happy tracks everywhere you go
Leave a lotta happy tracks and keep this in mind
Others will have to follow in the path you leave behind
As you walk the tangle streets of life notice your fellow man
When he gets in trouble lend him a helping hand
Sow good seeds in your fields of life as you go along
Let others reap your happiness a long time after you're gone
Leave a lotta happy tracks...
Don't ever use a good friend for a personal game
To game wealth and lose one friend would only be in vain
Let your happy tracks be many leave 'em everywhere you go
Cause others will have to harvest each and every seed you sow

The market place is empty no more traffic in the streets
All the builders tools are silent no more time to harvest wheat
Busy housewives cease their labors in the courtroom no debate
Work on earth is all suspended as the King comes through the gate
Oh the King is coming the King is coming
I just heard the trumpets sounding and now his face I see
Oh the King is coming the King is coming praise God he's coming for me
Happy faces line the hallways those whose lives have been redeemed
Broken homes e has mended those from prison he has freed
Little children and the aged hand in hand stand all aglow
Who were crippled broken ruined dressed in garments white as snow
I can hear the chariots rumble I can see the marching throng
The flurry of God's trumpets spells the end of sin and wrong
Regal robes are now unfolding heaven's grandstand's all in place
Heaven's choir is now assembled start to sing Amazing Grace
Oh the King is coming the King is coming...
Oh the King is coming the King is coming...

When there in the dim light of the tavern

And two one man surprised looked upon two tear stained eyes
And saw his own sweet daughter's there a crying

Now it's only hand-me-downs and worn out shoes
It's because of you I know that I wear these ragged clothes

Just take those old records off the shelf
I'll sit and listen to 'em by myself
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll
Don't try to take me to a disco
You'll never even get me out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be late for the door
I like that old time rock 'n' roll
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll
Won't go to hear them play a tango
I'd rather hear some blues or funky soul
There's only one sure way to get me to go
Start playing old time rock 'n' roll
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul
I reminisce about the days of old
With that old time rock 'n' roll
Call me a relic, call me what you will
Say I'm old-fashioned, say I'm over the hill
Today's music ain't got the same soul
I like that old time rock 'n' roll
Still like that old time rock 'n' roll
That kind of music just soothes the soul

Go send for the doctor to heal up my

I want three young ladies to take me along
I want them to carry a bunch of wild roses
To put on my body as I pass along

One morning one morning in May

All clad in white linen cold as a clay

Of all the books and magazines not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered over it not a fingerprint was plain

Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

You can read your magazines, read of love and tragic things
But not one verse of scripture, not one verse do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
Dust on the Bible will doom your poor soul

Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

If you have a friend you'd like to help along life's way
Just tell him that the good book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust off the Bible, trade the wrong for the right

The words of all the prophets and the sayings of our Lord
Of all the other books you'll find there's none salvation holds

Que desliza sem parar
Sem intenção, nossa canção

Vai saindo desse mar
E o sol
Beija o barco e luz
Dias tão azuis

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol
E o barquinho a deslizar
E a vontade de cantar

Céu tão azul, ilhas do sul
E o barquinho, coração
Deslizando na canção

Tudo isso é paz
Tudo isso traz
Uma calma de verão
E então
O barquinho vai
E a tardinha cai

Wanda Sá,"Quando a noite vem
Vem a saudade
Do carinho seu
Olha meu amor
Chego a pensar
Que o nosso amor
Não morreu

Quando esta tristeza
Vem falar
Das coisas de você
Ouço a tua voz no ar
Vejo o teu olhar no céu
A chorar, como eu
Com saudade, também",Tristeza de Nós Dois,2004
Wanda Sá,"Só me lembro muito vagamente
Correndo você vinha, quando de repente
Seu sorriso que era muito branco me encontrou
Só me lembro que depois andamos 
Mil estrelas só nós dois contamos
E o vento soprou de manhã, mil canções
Só me lembro, muito vagamente
De tarde que morria, quando de repente
Eu sozinho, fiquei lhe esperando e chorei
Só me lembro muito vagamente
O quanto a gente amou e foi tão de repente
Que nem lembro se foi com você
Que eu perdi meu amor",Vagamente,2004
Wanda Sá,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss

E lindo fosse o dia, como um dia foi
E indo nesse lindo, feito para nós dois
Pisando nisso tudo que se fez canção

Ah!, se eu pudesse te mostrar as flores
Que contam suas cores para a manhã que nasce
Que cheiram no caminho quem falasse
As coisas mais bonitas para a manhã de sol

Ah!, se eu pudesse, no fim do caminho
Achar nosso barquinho e levá-lo ao mar
Ah!, se eu pudesse tanta poesia
Ah!, se eu pudesse, sempre, aquele dia

Ah!, se eu pudesse te encontrar serena
Eu juro, pegaria sua mão pequena
E juntos vendo o mar
Dizendo aquilo tudo, quase sem falar",Ah ! Se Eu Pudesse,

Desperta do teu sono
E vem, vem ouvir

Mas não tenha medo da vida
Que eu estarei com você

No amor, no sorriso, na flor
Então sonhou, sonhou
E perdeu a paz

Se transformam depressa demais
Quem, no coração
Abrigou a tristeza de ver
Tudo isto se perder

E, na solidão
Procurou um caminho e seguiu
Já descrente de um dia feliz
Quem chorou, chorou
E tanto que seu pranto já secou
Quem depois voltou
Ao amor, ao sorriso e à flor
Então tudo encontrou
Pois a própria dor
Revelou o caminho do amor
E a tristeza acabou",Meditação,2006
Wanda Sá,"Lá se vai mais um dia assim,
E a vontade que não tenha fim, este sol
É viver, ver chegar ao fim,

E olhar pra esse olhar perdido
Nesse mar azul
Uma onda nasceu, calma desceu sorrindo,
Lá vem vindo
Lá se vai mais um dia assim,
Nossa praia que não tem mais fim, acabou
Vai subindo uma lua assim,
E a camélia que flutua nua no céu",Ah! Se Ue Pudesse,2008

Working at your job all day
Sends the time spinning away
Watch tv from half past six
Cook, make love and pick up sticks
But you can hear the waves crash on the beach
At night

Books you read can sublimate
Music seems to dissipate
And maybe just a bottle of wine
And a couple of smokes and you'll be fine
But you still hear the waves crash on the beach
At night
You can feel the waves crash on the beach
At night
Your lover lies beside you fast asleep
The moonlight falls upon the tears you weep
And you can hear the waves crash on the beach
At night oh at night

So all you really need is love
Love to give, receive above
And then the waves will soothe your heart
Your one true love will never part
True love (is the answer to everything
True love is the answer true love is the thing)
True love (is the answer to everything
True love is the answer true love is the thing)
And we will lie together both asleep
The moonlight will provide the tears we weep
And as we breathe the waves crash on the beach
At night
And as we breathe the waves crash on the beach
At night

Put on your shoes
Get away from here
Far from the local blues
Let's go out tonight
Let's make our escape
From the city lights
And all the familiar shapes
We can drive all night
We can stop in a field
Hear the starlight
Traveling for millions of years

Sing a lullaby to the night (repeat)

We can rock and roll
We can dance all night long
To the stars above
And we won't be strong
We can walk away
To the rising dawn
As people go to work
Wondering why our clothes are torn

Sing a lullaby to the night (repeat)

We'll be driving through the mountains
In the cool and clearing air
With the sunlight on the ocean
And the diamonds in your hair
And as you're falling asleep
I will sing you a lullaby

Sing your lullaby (repeat)

We can find a place
For the sun and the rain
We can live a life
Like a hurricane
On a mountain top
Or right by the sea
As long as we're together
It don't matter to me
Let's go out tonight
Let's escape

Sing your lullaby (repeat)

As the perfumes of the evening
Mingle sweetly with the night
We'll lay ourselves down
In the light of the moon
And we'll hold each other tight
And as you're falling asleep
I will sing you a lullaby

Don't turn your face away

Someone's keeping everything I knew
Don't try to run away

Wang Chung,"We met as friends of friends while still at school
I was all you ever really knew
When we met it was like a dream
For all I knew we could not fail

But now I know of your betrayal
Living in the older part of town
I worked all hours I could to bring us 'round
Your career was alive for you

But deep inside I watched it fail
And now I know of your betrayal
Your betrayal
If only I could hold you close

But now I know how love grows frail
When I asked if you'd leave me
Or 'bout the boyfriends you'd had
You said you'd stay with me always

And that you'd never be bad
But I would notice a smile
That you would hold within
As if your vanity flirted

With your knowledge of sin
Now you're quiet and cold
Your eyes just stare into space
And if I ask you to talk

You just dissemble your face
And the smile that I hated
Is now a frown of denial
And that's how I know of your unspoken betrayal

Oh, that's how I know of your unspoken betrayal
Now I wish that I'd set you free
But I was terrified that I would fail
And now I know of your betrayal

Surrounded by machines
They take away his pity
And give him what he dreams
A stream of information
On a green letter screen
Makes him feel in touch with the world
And sure of what it means

At the speed of sound you don't see the ground
And in your sports car with the windows down
And the radio on and you don't stop talking

Well I'm doing things as I please
And then everything else goes it's own way
At the speed of life

A man lives in the city
Distracted by the news
From sitting down with the ones he loves
Or taking time to choose
And what of conversation?
And what is left when he dies?
Is there a diary of an honest man
To stand against the lies?

When love looks back at you

With a need to devour
All who fall
In her power
And love is a sweet thing
With a need to caress
Security, stability and happiness
I'm flying, flying from
Reality
Where two things can be true

Outside
This memory I'll keep of bitter crimson
Winter sunrise lost in the icy silence
Our warm breath fading in the air

I'm not sure why I tell you, still less what I mean
It's like a dream and maybe there's no cause
But in the end it's
What you can give to someone
How you can help to set them free

Big world is turning as we dream tonight
Big world we've got so out of tune with you
Now we have to put it right
Big world help us through
Get us through the night

This world is wounded now and we inflict
The pain
We have to change our lives and think again
'Cause in the end it's
All that we're sure we're made of
All that we know to set us free

Big world is turning as we dream tonight
Big world we've got so out of tune with you
Now we have to put it right

If we learn to treat her right
Then the big world is never gonna let us down

I think its that, that makes me quiver
Just to keep falling down

過ぎ去る昨日までを許して 今日は何処へ行こうか

情けない思いを燃やして

さらけ出して 轟かせて 驚かして

Hey ぬかるんだ ここが正念場
Hey 不可能を可能に変えて

誰も何も信じられなかった
殻にこもりスカしていた 後にも戻れなくて
絵に描いたような未来は真っ黒 真っ逆さま
何も手に入れてない 諦めた方が楽で
今に見てろよってもう言い飽きた

くだらない毎日がただ通り過ぎて
宛のない思い 溜まって捨てた
苦しくて 悔しくて でも最後はきっと
確かめてみたくて

駆け抜けて
追い続けた後ろ姿 目を逸らさず
はぐれないように手を伸ばした
遠く遠くよみがえる懐かしい声
あの日の笑ってる横顔
嘘も本当も溢れ出して掻き混ぜ

逃げ込んだ暗闇に弾かれ
戻らない日々をまた受け入れた
優しく強く 鮮やかに彩る 面影残して
ただ真っ直ぐ 陽はまたのぼり 胸を焦がした

あの頃がただ眩し過ぎて
やり場のない思い 黙っていれば
あたりまえの幸せなんて 最初からずっと
噛み締めてみたくて

駆け抜けて
追い続けた後ろ姿
目を逸らさず はぐれないように
手を伸ばした
遠く遠くよみがえる懐かしい声
今でも 数え切れない程
嘘も本当も溢れ出して掻き混ぜ

逃げ込んだ暗闇に弾かれ
戻らない日々をまた受け入れた
優しく強く 鮮やかに彩る 明日を信じて
ただ真っ直ぐ 息を切らし踏み出せば

いつだって どこにいたって
だれだって なにをしたって
その時はやってくるから
優しく強く 鮮やかに彩る 面影残して
ただ真っ直ぐ (ただ真っ直ぐ) だからもうすぐ
陽はまたのぼり 胸を焦がした

Hey, yeah
光る星を繋ぎ合わせ 夜を超え朝が来るまで
過ぎ去る昨日までを許して 今日は何処へ行こうか

Yay yay yay yay 足並みを揃え 眠らずに夢を見てる
人混みを掻き分け 思い描いて 朝から晩まで
誰もが口を揃え 無理だと言い聴かす
振り向かず駆け出せ 思い描いて 掴む幸せ

Wank,"I recognize suspicion
I see it in your eyes
I'm not the devil with the art of telling lies
I've got no more than a strong alibi
You're lacking evidence so I must deny
(Chorus)
And then the lightning comes
Somebody stole my heart
Now I can't explain
Where it is
I'm going down to the river,
Bathe in the water
It's a way to make a living
But will I be forgiven?
Down to the river,
Bathe in the water
It's a way to make a living
But will I be forgiven?
Forgiven
Tell me (tell me)
What's on your mind
You've got that look that says I'm leaving
I never wanted to hurt you this way
So now it's time I fade away

Down to the river
Bathe in the water
It's a way to make a living
But will I be forgiven?
",Forgiven,1996
Wank,"Well I used to kick the shit out of you until I kicked the shit
Delivering punch lines that you never get
Get a grip on yourself before you mess with me
You and me ain't the same as we used to be
Condescend me you cheat
It ain't news to me
You and me ain't the same as we used to be
You never loved me, no
You never loved me, yeah
Well time and time again I'm an animal of discontent
Hatred and rage and I never feel the consequence
Wrap it up and shove it
You say your fed up
Yeah well I'm fed up too and I've had enough
Try to stab in my back but you can't hurt me
You and me ain't the same as we used to be
You never loved no
You never loved me (2x)
Now I know so I won't walk down that same crooked road
Girl your a blackhearted bitch
Bet ya never knew
And you never will
I'm a son of a bitch yeah
I'm dressed to kill
I'm lookin for a new thing
Holding out for good things
Man I want everything yeah
Yeah
Well I used to kick the shit out of you until I kicked the shit
Delivering punch lines that you never get
Get a grip on yourself before you mess with me
Cause you and me ain't the same as we used to be
Condescend me you cheat it ain't news to me
You and me ain't the same as we used to be
You never loved me NOOO!
You never loved me (3x) yeah

In this harsh-ass dream
Cause who will be 'round
When your life is looking down?
Be true to yourself
Plants your roots in the ground

The ghetto is desolate
But don't be forgettin'
Money exchanges hands like Off Track Bettin'
Project heat will keep ya sweatin'
Release energy through pores
Battles for thesis that held the project wars
Bullets never pour
Snatch your life from menacin crack-whores
By standing just outside of the limits of the law
On the face of human waste
Standin' out like cold sores
It's what Black kids embrace
So fuck a Cold War
If the Berlin Wall falls
What you be fightin' for?
Cause devils come together to oppress me some more
It's clear fuck a tactic that's old like menopause
Yo I get down for mines
Stay out my way gettin' yours
MC's who was just fakin'
You should stop now because
Real guns in your mouth
Cause shit in your drawers
And besides, you got much more to live for
Is hip-hop worth dying for?
Are you sure?
Whenever I arrive
Niggaz know my steez
Au-revoir MC's
Hit the floor and freeze
All my sons waving guns in barbaric fashion
Yo they children don't listen
They just imitate they actions

How many men can testify to they treasure?
Is this the neverland, the promised land?
Sheep for slaughter
Frontin' sons but ya can't feed your daughters
What's your livin?
Playin' to push a man for ¿Sam?
Gettin' wired
And these are the days, the last plague
Watch the fire
Sensation relation the physical manifestation
Man's elation -- material accommodation
Facin this world
Conglomeratin' corporations
Deeper than the thesis
Observation of creation
Money makes a man rule a nation
After greed is lust
And soon to follow is distrust
This ghetto paranoia is the reason that you bust
Caught up in the cipher
Having negative thoughts
There's one less millionaire every single day
And you could be the next
This life is rougher than the sex
Sex, sex

Yo I wonder when I get the land cruiser and the lex
(No sweats)
Dodgin' users from the other sex
I wonder if my own people will be next
I need respect that don't come with no weekly check
I know ghetto millionaires
They got cold chillin stares
And drug-dealin airs
They make hairs stand up on the backs of necks of ¿mayors?
Who blow up fish markets and got various targets
They sweepin' shit under carpets
I move stealth through the chicken-heads
With talcum on they chests
Yo Malcom's gone
And the elders ain't impressed with my struggle
I try to make a profit and I'll flip it so it double
Being poor just ain't worth the trouble
Extension of my mansion 
Where I keep my stacks
Deep in the study where my nerve endings react
There ain't no stoppin me
My feelings and thoughts I have monopolies
Magnetic fields and fields of dreams is my property
Poor people who are stupid die quickly
I'm a millionaire that's carrying all my assets with me
I go past the physical world like Sufis
My people's was sold one-by-one like Lucy's
These niggaz got grams but no lands yo you losin me
Watch that first step, its a doozie

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest
in a big field of tall grass
I lay there in the sun and felt it caressing my face

And I fell asleep and dreamed
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie
And that I was the star of the movie
This really blew my mind, the fact that me,
an overfed, long-haired leaping gnome
should be the star of a Hollywood movie

But there I was, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones...

Out of the middle came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy
She said:

Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

[Spoken]
I thought to myself what could that mean
Am I going crazy or is this just a dream
Now, wait a minute
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
so it's all in my head
and then.. I heard her say one more time:

[Sung]
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl
Spill the wine and take that pearl, Spill the wine and take that pearl

[Spoken]
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine, in the other, a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said:

Then rose again and His blood washed away the stain of sin.
