John Parish,"And I remember everything
Sunrise on a blue horizon
You, your hand in mine
I remember the things you said

Said, ""I'll be a lady, wait through it all,
Be there to catch you, after the fall
Run through the red light, out of my hair
Run from the darkness into the dare

And I dream of running
And in the dream I, myself could run
And I feel the ground beneath my feet
And I move like music, 
You move me, like music

Head out of my way
Head out to red light
""Hold on"" the dream says
Head out of my life
You said ""I'd be there""

Now I'm treading very carefully
And I hope that I don't scream
And I hope that I don't fall
Off your bridge, crossing over
Sunny mountain, swollen riverfall

You said ""I'd be there""
You said ""I'd be there""
Through it all

Head out of my way
Head of to red light
""Hold on"" the dream says
Head out of my life

All over my way
Head out to red light
""Hold on"" the dream says
Head out of my life
You said ""I'd be there""",Rope Bridge Crossing,1996
John Parish,"Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Can I tell you something?
Can I tell you a story?
It's about me and Billy
'Cause I remember

I remember it all started when he bought that car
It was the first thing he'd ever owned apart from me
And the color was red
And the color was red and he drove me
He drove me out of my mind
I'm over it now
It was spring or summer sixty five I don't remember
Steaming and sweating and sticking against the wheel
And I could see the tendons stand out in the back of his neck
And he used to make me pray, wearing a mask like a death's head
When he put me there in the back seat, and he said

Jesus save me
Jesus save me

Inherited his father's hate that what he'd say
And he custom of destruct the pain of every escape but somehow
He could make joy come loose inside
I would feel really I would feel really and truly alive
And I would do anything for him
It just wasn't enough
It was never enough
He'd turn to me and say
He'd, he'd say ""even the son of god had to die, my darling""
And he wanted everything
He wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king
Each new moon
He used to make me pray
Every morning
Hidden in the backseat, such Jesus
He'd make me pray
And he'd in there when he wanted everything
He wanted the honey from the king
Say it
""Even the son of god had to die my darling""
Go on, say it!

Jesus save me
Jesus save me",Taut,1996
John Parish,"It starts at daylight
I see him
Before my sad eyes
I hear him breathing
Oh lover, need you to lead me
No never thought that you'd leave

That was my veil
That was my time
Once held secret
But now lies

No words can
Heal my heart
Inside I'm broken
Now it's done

Was she a pretty girl?
Does she have pretty hair?
Was she soft-spoken?
Was there a love there?

That was my veil
That was my time
Once held secret
But now lies

Give back my veil
Give back my time

John Parish,"I need your lie
Darling love lies

And if you gave it to me
I'd hold it in the palm of my hand
Like a good luck charm, or a vice
And I'd reach up like a child to receive it

There is no more said
There is no more real
I got sun on my back
I remember you

Take me inside
Your warm love lie

And if he took me
I'd hold him up to the light
Like a god, or a good luck charm, or a vice
And I'd open up like a child to believe it

There is no more real
Got sun on my back

John Parish,"Losing ground
Under my feet
There's a low rumbling
There's a crack in the street
It's just no good
It's just no good anymore
Everything I do
Has been done before

Yeah I found my voice
Yeah I got nothing to say
The whole thing started
Cause my mind has gone away
I used to get high
Now I just get lost
I used to bark at the moon
The first one I came across

Almost here
Almost gone

Almost here
Almost gone
Almost where
We belong

Better watch what you say

(He can't say it)
He's just an imperfect man
Trapped in an imperfect body
Ain't happy or sad, lonely or sorry

Mr. Slo-Blo, Mr. Yo-Yo
Mr. See which way is the wind gonna blow
Hangs from a wire, fingers on fire
Drifting higher and higher

He tried to be smart to catch out his own heart
Cruel to be kind as he cut out all the soft parts
But some days in little ways
Love seeps out in the things he says
And all he really wants is to feel grown up again",Shrunkenman,2000
John Parish,"Like boxers
Find nobility in violence
And no ability to see sense
Like boxers
Blinkered and bare breasted pugilism
How we all try to keep the fighter within
Like boxers 
Looked for safety in a clinch
And they were bruised but unflinching
Like boxers
Sweet anticipation of the landing of the first blow
And how much better is the devil you know
Like boxers

From tattered lip a little blood spurt
You always love the ones you hurt
Though they were hanging on the ropes
They weren't about to give up hope
Like boxers
Falling and counting

No Lolita on my knee

Your arms around my neck
It was more than fifteen years

Was I supposed to be surprised
You kissed me
Wiping chlorine from my eyes

Did you leave me
Or I leave you

Voted third most beautiful
Eleven hundred in our school
I had you number one
And how I remember you turning up
To trade me for a younger flame
Barely sixteen years to my name

Did you leave me
Or I leave you

Did I leave you or you leave me
She said, ""I scored two out of three
And was the third revenge for you""

I'm thinking as we're looking out to sea
How was the world before you
Who did I used to be

I fell from untouchable 
With a tremor in my heart
My love and fear came tumbling out
My defenses broke apart

the sun has burned my head again
As I sit and puzzle how
Before you I wanted for nothing

April, you coming
April how could I've
Worn inappropriate clothing?
April, all that careful stepping,
Rounding of my soul
And now your rain
April, I feel you leaving

I don't know what silence means
It could mean anything

April, won't you answer me?
These days just seem to crush me
Hatching, collapsing, tumbling down
April, what if I drown?
I drown?

April, I see you leaving

Did I want change?

Daniel, my only son
I, I even slept with you
To be here in your chair
Sitting in your favorite chair

When you snuck into the water

Yawning miles

Are gone
Washed away in water that took

With the days after a death?

Let's talk
Let the dirt fall

No kind hand is reaching out for me tonight
I slept facing the wall
I dreamt of buildings in pieces
You slept facing the wall
And you wanted less than I wanted

Passionless, Pointless.
Where does the passion go? I'm asking
There's no kindness in your hands
No reaching out for me tonight

You slept facing the wall
And you wanted less than I wanted
I slept facing the wall

I don't remember
How did we ever?

Hear me, do you hear the law?
All that rubbish inside your rotting mind
I am your guardian, I am your fairy
Get out of my way or...

This is true love that we are doing now
Even everywhere that I was before, all broken
Your face all mashed up

Caught him down in Soho, layin' 
Tracks, the knife in my back
His stealin' days are numbered, 
That's a fact
I stuck it to him face to face, 
But he just turned and laughed
Laughed his last, he's the past, ooh

[Chorus]

People dancing everywhere,
Never knowing, never care
Diggin' all that rock 'n roll, 
They don't care whose song he stole

Somebody stole my thunder, 
Left me to die in the wind and rain
Somebody stole my thunder again
I left him six feet under, 
The devil may care, it's the price he paid
He'll never steal my thunder again

Somebody stole my thunder, 
Left me to die in the wind and rain
Somebody stole my thunder again
I left him six feet under, 
Left him to die in the fallin' rain
Somebody stole my thunder again",Somebody Stole My Thunder,1984
John Parr,"There's a light at the edge of the darkness
A cool clear light, entices me there
And I know that I'm your slave,

Treat me like an animal,

So you can drop respectable
Just tell me everything you like, 
And then we'll see what I can do

You're so nice and polite
But when I get you home,

Don't chain me, uncage me, 
Just tame me, you know what I like babe

She's the devil's child

She drives men wild

Just like the spider
Hypnotizing the fly
She works them over
Then she drains them dry

You can't deny her
Even though you try

She's a bird of prey
And she's getting her revenge
By tearing out the hearts
Of all the sad and family men

She's gonna love ya to death
Beware, there's evil in the dark
Her lovers all play a part
In some bizarre duet
She's gonna love ya to death
You're just a man without a name
Mixing passion with her pain

You'll feel the panic in your breathing
Lying there your body bleeding
Drowning in your seat (ah ah)
She's gonna love ya to death

She hands around the bar
And dressed to kill
If her perfume don't get 'em

Her leather pants will
But if she takes you home
You'll never survive
When the lovin's over
She'll eat you alive

She has a hanger
To be satisfied
Don't try to tell me
That her nightmare is a dream
I've felt her body quicken
And I've heard her mournful screams

Take her in your arms
Even though you're terrified
If you're on the road to hell
You might as well enjoy the ride
(She's coming for you)

She will cut
Then she'll watch you bleed
She will take you
With the Devil's speed
You want to break outta here
You want to be free

She will claw you back
You're on the slide
She will heat you up
Then watch you fry
You'll never get outta here
You'll never be free

Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do

It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past

John Paul White,"It's like I'm sitting at a bus stop waiting for a train 
Exactly how I got here is hard to explain 
My heart's in the right place, what's left of it I guess 
My heart ain't the problem, it's my mind that's a total mess 
With these rickety old legs and watery eyes 
It's hard to believe that I could pass for anybody's prize 
Here's what I know about the gifts that God gave 
You can't take 'em with you when you go to the grave 

It ain't over yet, ask someone who ought to know 
Not so very long ago we were both hung out to dry 
It ain't over yet, you can mark my word 
I don't care what you think you heard, we're still learning how to fly 
It ain't over yet

For fools like me who were built for the chase 
Takes the right kind of woman to help you put it all in place 
It only happened once in my life, but man you should have seen
Her hair two shades of foxtail red, her eyes some far out sea blue green 
I got caught up making a name for myself, you know what that's about 
One day your ship comes rolling in and the next day it rolls right back out 
You can't take for granted none of this shit 
The higher up you fly boys, the harder you get hit 

It ain't over yet, I'll say this about that 
You can get up off the mat or you can lay there till you die 
It ain't over yet, here's the truth my friend 
You can't pack it in and we both know why 
It ain't over yet 

Silly boys blind to get there first 
Think of second chances as some kind of curse 
I've known you forever and ever it's true 
If you came by it easy, you wouldn't be you 
Make me laugh, you make me cry, you make me forget myself 

Back when down on my luck kept me up for days 
You were there with the right word to help me crawl out of the maze 
And when I almost convinced myself I was hipper than thou 
You stepped up with a warning shot fired sweet and low across the bow 
No you don't walk on water and your sarcasm stings 
But the way you move through this old world sure makes a case for angel wings 
I was halfway to the bottom when you threw me that line 
I quote you now verbatim, ""Get your head out of your own behind""

It ain't over yet, what you wanna bet 
One more cigarette ain't gonna send you to the grave

You're yodeling to your baby
You'll feel nice and warm
no matter how cold it may be

Take a look at little Jack and Jill
They ski down a hill that's a snowplow turn
And look there's a spill
There's a spill on the hill 
When you're down it's a thrill to go up again.

Ev'rybody ought to learn to ski for that is how we first met
We were that Jack and Jill that came down a hill,
When I looked at you my hearttook a spill
Took a spill on a hill
It's a thrill that I can't forget

It Happened In Sun Valley not so very long ago
There were sunbeams in the snow
and a twinkle in your eye
I remember oh so clearly
that you nearly passed me by

Then It Happened In Sun Valley
when you slipped and fell and so did I
Now ev'ry year we go back
and then we recall that fall and that moment
When we were there on a hill
So we both take a spill and we're Jack and Jill again.

John Payne,"Why do robins sing in December
Long before the Springtime is due?
And even though it's snowing, violets are growing
I know why and so do you
Why do breezes sigh every evening whispering your name as they do?
And why have I the feeling stars are on my ceiling?
I know why and so do you
When you smile at me I hear gypsy violins
When you dance with me, I'm in heaven when the music begins
I can see the sun when it's raining, hiding every cloud from my view
And why do I see rainbows when you're in my arms?
I know why and so do you

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time

Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

John Phillips,"I wanna speak to you motherfuckers for a minute
Yea thanks for the lighter
Anybody smoke here?
Aight, that's more for me you punk
Motherfuckers
Look, check it out, look

[verse 1]
Everybody, he was born to hustle
It's a very thin line between the boss
And the muscle
We foot soldiers
Face first in the trenches
Only time I'm on my back is fucking these
Hoes and weight bitches
Hell's kitchen, raw kitchen
Never crying and bitching and settling
For less
Metal in your chest, take a final breath
Revolutionary
It's x-man the mercenary
Carry a .44 desert eagle
Feeding the people even if it ain't legal
Low-riding in the regal or the cadillac
Money stacked probably give yo ass a
Heart attack
Purchased your last cd I want my money
Back
You see the battle ima see you in the
Street
Survival of the first to draw the heaters
And the cannons
I'm guaranteed to be the last man standing

[chorus 2x]
Crack a bottle for your hard time
It's dedicated to my soldiers on the
Front line
This one's for all of us
Thinking bout your casualties
Learn from mistakes, protect your family
Cause it's the year 2000

[verse 2]
Everybody wannabe king
Fuck everything
All this shit is bout to me mine
I hear it all the time
Live your life for the day
Easier to burn than papier-mache
Started with dre
Graduate to radioplay
I still ain't satisfied
Bout to blast off worldwide
Get in line check the politics
Ever wonder why only certain
Motherfuckers get rich
Ain't this a bitch
Barely can eat, barely can pee
I dedicate my life to the street
It's not for you if your stomach is weak
Relax with dead bodies covered with sheets
That's the only time I really find peace
Having violent stand-offs with the police
North hollywood beef
Grinding my teeth
Have you stuck and stunned in disbelief
New breed I'm the bad seed
Smoke your weed til my mothafucking eyes
Bleed
Dedicated to the niggas that despise us
So ain't nobody s'posed to be here
Besides us
Catch a flatline

[chorus 2x]

[verse 3]
I was one that never begged for nothing
Me and my homies build penitentiary
Huff-it
Running your mouth like a bitch cause you
All on my dick
What is he dogg pound now? is he still
With tha liks?
Is he rich? is xzibit a crip? this is
Business stay the fuck out of my family shit
A grown man, the back of my hand is what
You will see
If the x-fives make you believe
You check the sound scan I do the math
Me and my staff run a worldwide warpath
A bloodbath, make xzibit have a good laugh
It's going down, hit the ground like a
Plane crash
You lil fags ain't prepared for the x-man
Scared and desperate
Young and restless
There is no guest list
Move to the back of the line
Yo it's my time, prime time only where the
Beats and the rhyme shine

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

So what can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
 
You made me glad, I made you sad
I made you lonesome and blue
And who ever knew 
Who'd ever think that I would be crying to you
 
What can I say, dear, after I say I'm sorry?
What can I do to prove it to you, I'm sorry?
I didn't mean to ever be mean to you
If I didn't care I wouldn't feel like I do
I was all wrong but right or wrong I don't blame you

To the sunny side of the street

And that happy tune is your step

To feel the strength I want to,
I must hang on to your hand,

I pick myself up,
Dust myself off,
Start all over again.

Don't lose your confidence if you slip,
Be grateful for a pleasant trip,
And pick yourself up,
Dust yourself off,
Start all over again.

Till the battle of the day is won.
You may be sick and tired,
But you'll be a man, my son!

Who had to fall to rise again?

I've got a hunch I'm gonna lunchtime every springtime with you,
So let's unpack that smile, wisecracking style,
Batten down in Manhattan town and ransack a while,
Let's let our feelings fall as they may,
Make this hour, our someday,
We'll never leave the country, oh we'll just stay inside,
No need to worry, we've got a great place to hide,
Where we could turn off the phone, go it alone,
Then hijack your hatchback and get accident prone,
Baby in the meantime, nothing but serene time,
For no one but you in this lifetime would do,",A Lifetime or Two,2000
John Pizzarelli,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2000
John Pizzarelli,"Should I reveal exactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?
Should I recite beneath the pale moonlight?

Should I reveal 'xactly how I feel?
Should I confess I love you?

When lights are low

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The song that Crosby sings

Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free

Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

John Popper,"Well, I've guessed your name and I'm sure you know mine
I'd like to discuss our mutual friend
I can't help but feel that I left him behind
Does he still live with you or did his pain ever end?

I guess I don't deserve to know
If he ever let go
I guess I don't really need to see
If he wound up with you or did he ever break free

When we were both young, you took us in
And taught us to play survival games
He'd lost so much that you let him win
But I had a home so it just wasn't the same

I had the strength to look you in the eye
And say goodbye
I was lucky and I didn't have to play
Does he still stay with you or did he get away?

I used what I had and I escaped
I smelled something good and I followed its track
But all he could smell was the world that you shaped
It took all my strength so I just couldn't look back

I remember him calling after me, I keep that memory
The last thing he screamed aloud was
""Hey, don't you leave me alone""
Yeah, he might live with you but he called me his home

Yeah, I guessed your name and some day so will he
'Cause one of these ides he's gonna break free

Are sometimes so much to see

Furious long black hair

That insists on bliss

Passionate embrace
That look upon her face
And there's fire in her kiss

Subtle, sweet and swirling
The dance of giving eyes
That tell you to come closer
Though everybody tries

To drink her lips like nectar
On the mind of all that see
And I'm only here to tell you
Couldn't believe she was kissing me

Connection in the yearn

Abounds around us
Up to the same old game
To tame the aching beast without

There's nothing we can't do or take
Our appetite astounds us
Dawn, the only clock I rock
Until I tremble and pass out

And through the morning reverie
We slip away and go to sleep
But I lay restless and awake
Fearful only of the chance I didn't take

The comedy, I don't regret
But instead forget to mention
A thousand times of taste and touch
Slightly slated not to be

Mean to make a mockery
I imply my apt intention
The devil in the details wails
For one day want of breaking free

And through the morning reverie
We slip away and go to sleep

Fearful only of the chance I didn't take

All fires rage with the sun going down
The ashes fall by morning
Landing safely on the ground

All fires rage with the sun going down
The ashes fall by morning
Landing safely on the ground

Make no mistake, I mean to take
Every chance that comes my way
By every turn, I've left to burn
Still another will be sought

By that thing that rings the tuning fork
For the force of night and day
The sun shines as I slumber
To earn the evening I have wrought

Said the song just drove her insane
But it weren't just the music playing
It was me that she was trying to blame

On the hill where the angels sing

Looks just like a diamond ring

Well, I leaned on my left leg
In the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A June bug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second to long

And I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse

Out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof
Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes

So long babe, I got the flashback blues
Photographs show the laughs
Recorded in between the bad times
Happy sailors dancing on a sinking ship
Cloudy skies and dead fruit flies
Waving goodbye with tears in my eyes
Well, sure I made it but ya know it was as hell of a trip
Spent most of my youth
Out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof
Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
And ten times what it grieves you
That's how much more I hate to leave you now
So long babe, I got the flashback blues
Spent most of my youth
Out hobo cruising
And all I got for proof
Is rocks in my pockets and dirt in my shoes
So goodbye nonbeliever
Don't you know that I hate to leave here
So long babe, I got the flashback blues",Flashback Blues,1971
John Prine,"I got a friend in Fremont
He sells used cars, ya know
Well, he calls me up twice a year
Just ask me how'd it go
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
Actually everything is just about the same

I met a girl from Venus, and her insides were lined in gold
Well, she did what she did said ""How was it, kid?""
She was politely told
""Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
But actually everything is just about the same.""

Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen

Molly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods
And got pinned up against a log
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain
Cause actually all them dogs is just about the same

Moonlight makes me dizzy
Sunlight makes me clean
Your light is the sweetest thing
That this boy has ever seen

I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast
And up the sky and Arabian rabbi
Fed Quaker oats to a priest
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain
Cause actually all them gods is just about the same
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain
Cause actually everything is just about the same

I don't talk much I'm a quiet man

And running like crazy while you are alseep

Don't pin your blues on me
Just go ahead and do whatever you wish to

Tuesday asked me what was going on I said,
""Sunday's in the meadow and Friday's in the corn.""

Both of God's eyes are shining tonight

John Prine,"While digesting Reader's Digest in the back of a dirty book store
A plastic flag, with gum on the back fell out on the floor
Well, I picked it up and I ran outside, slapped it on my window shield
And if I could see old Betsy Ross I'd tell her how good I feel

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me
""If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free""
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead

But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore

Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said

""But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war""
""Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore""

John Prine,"While walking out, one evening
Not knowing where to go
Just to pass the time away
Before we held our show

I heard a little mission band
Playing with all their might
I gave my soul to Jesus
And left the show that night

The day will soon be over
And evening will begone
No more gems to be gathered
So let us all press on

When Jesus comes to claim us
And says it is enough
The diamonds will be shining
No longer in the rough

John Prine,"I come home from work this evening
There was a note in the frying pan
It said fix your own supper babe

And I miss the way she used to yell at me
The way she used to cuss and moan
And if I ever go out and get married again
I'll never leave my wife at home

Screamed, and I hollered and cried
And I commenced a carryin' on
Till I almost lost my mind

Come a knockin' at my door
I'm gonna pick up a rock and hit him on the head
And knock him down on the floor

John Prine,"I knew a girl who was almost a lady
She had a way with all the men in her life
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty
And she was born on the fourth of July

Well she lived in an aluminum house trailer
And she worked in a juke box saloon
And she spent all the money that I give her
Just to see the old man in the moon

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise

Well we'd go out on Saturday evenings
To the drive-in on Route 41
And it was there that I first suspected
That she was doin' what she'd already done

She said, ""Johnny won't you get me some popcorn""
And she knew I had to walk pretty far
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight
She hopped into a foreign sports car

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise

Well you know I could have beat up that fellow
But it was her that had hopped into his car
Many times I'd fought to protect her
But this time she was goin' too far

Now some folks they call me a coward
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night
But I'd rather have names thrown at me
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right

I used to sleep at the foot of old glory
And awake in the dawn's early light
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes
I was a victim of the great compromise

Now she writes all the fellows love letters
Saying ""Greetings, come and see me real soon""
And they go and line up in the barroom
And spend the night in that sick woman's room

But sometimes I get awful lonesome
And I wish she was my girl instead
But she won't let me live with her
And she makes me live in my head

They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years
To get those souvenirs

John Prine,"Robert was a sailor
For the best years of his life
His captain was his mother
And the ocean was his wife
Only fresh out of the cradle

And got blood on his high school ring

And it's hello California
Hello Dad and Mom
Ship ahoy

Is home from Vietnam
Don't you ask me any questions
'Bout the medals on my chest
Take the star out of the window
And let my conscience take a rest
Now he sailed across the ocean
To the old far eastern war
And it was foreign to his body
It was foreign to his shore
So he traded in the present
For the better times he'd seen
And made an oriental waitress
His own home comin' queen

And the sweat was floodin' her eyes
The catwalk squeaked
'Neath the bartender's feet
And the smoke was too heavy to rise

She sang of the love that I left her
And of the woman that she'll never be
Made me feel like the buck and a quarter
That I paid 'em to listen and see
I paid 'em to listen and see

'Neath the October sky
Work the day shift from seven to three
And the only relief that I receive
Is nearer my God to Thee

Leaves me standing both naked and bare
Makes me feel like the Sunday funnies
After everything's gone off the air
Everything's gone off the air
I picked through the ashes
Of the torch singer's song
And I ordered my money a round
For whiskey and pain
Both taste the same
During the time they go down

The more I drink, the less I feel blue
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool

If this date were to be our last, I'd never sit down this glass
It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you
You've left my heart a vacant lot, I'll fill it with another shot
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you

Looks like I had my fill, guess I better pay my bill

John Prine,"Jesus was a Capricorn
He ate organic food
He believed in love and peace
And never wore no shoes

Long hair, beard and sandals
And a funky bunch of friends
Reckon we'd just nail him up
If he came down again

'Cause everybody's gotta have somebody to look down on
Who they can feel better than at any time they please
Someone doin' somethin' dirty decent folks can frown on
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me

Hippies for their hair
Others laugh at straights who laugh at
Freaks who laugh at squares

Who hate the Blacks who hate the Klan
Most of us hate anything that

John Prine,"Sam Stone came home,
To the wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas.
And the time that he served,
Had shattered all his nerves,
And left a little shrapnel in his knees.
But the morhpine eased the pain,
And the grass grew round his brain,
And gave him all the confidence he lacked,
With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.
Little pitchers have big ears,
Don't stop to count the years,
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.

Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long.
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And soon he took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime.
And the gold roared through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains,
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,
While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.
Little pitchers have big ears,
Don't stop to count the years,
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.

Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon,
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.
Well, he played his last request,
While the room smelled just like death,
With an overdose hovering in the air.
But life had lost it's fun,
There was nothing to be done,
But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,
For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.

There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.
Little pitchers have big ears,
Don't stop to count the years,
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.",Sam Stone,1972
John Prine,"Last night I saw an accident
On the corner of Third and Green
Two cars collided and I got excited
Just being part of that scene
It was Mrs. Tom Walker and her beautiful daughter
Pamela, was driving the car
They got hit by a man in a lite blue sedan
Who had obviously been to a bar

[Chorus:]
They don't know how lucky they are
They could have run into that tree
Got struck by a bolt of lightning
And raped by a minority

It was a four way stop dilemma
We all arrived the same time
I yielded to the man to the right of me
And he yielded it right back to mine
Well, the yield went around and around and around
Till Pamela finally tried
Just then the man in the light blue sedan
Hit Pamela's passenger side

[Chorus:]

Pamela hit her head on the mirror
Mrs Walker got a bump on the knee
The man hit himself in the face and said
""Why does this happen to me?""
The neighbors came out
And they gathered about
Saying ""Hey! who hit who anyway?""
And the police arrived at a quarter to five
And pronounced all the victims ""Okay""

Rest upon my shoulder
Hide the pain
While the rain
Makes up my mind

From thinking this thing over
And it's been so long
Since I felt the warm sunshine

Just give me one good reason
And I promise I won't ask you any more
Just give me one extra season
So I can figure out the other four.

Makes me wonder why you left me
Night time
Makes me wonder what I said

Next time
Are the words I'd like to plan on
But, last time
Was the only thing you said.

John Prine,"I got kicked off Noah's Ark
I turn my cheek to unkind remarks
There was two of everything
But one of me
And when the rains came tumbling down
I held my breath and I stood my ground
And I watched that ship go sailing
Out to sea.

Take it back
Take it back
Oh no, you can't say that
All of my friends
Are not dead or in jail
Through rock and through stone
The black wind still moans
Sweet revenge
Sweet revenge
Without fail.

I caught an isle seat on a plane
And drove an English teacher half insane
Making up jokes about bicycle spokes
And red balloons
So I called up my local deejay
And he didn't have a lot to say
But the radio
Has learned all of my favourite tunes.

[Chorus]

The white meat is on the run
And the dark meat is far too done
And the milkman left me a note yesterday
Get out of this town by noon
You're coming on way too soon
And besides that
We never liked you any way.

Considering the weather, oh my how you've grown
From the men in the factories to the wild kangaroo
Like those birds of a feather, they're gathering together
And feeling exactly like you

They got mesmerized by lullabies and limbo danced in Pairs
Please lock that door, it don't make much sense
That common sense, don't make no sense no more

Just between you and me, it's like pulling
When you ought to be shoving
Like a nun with her head in the oven
Please don't tell me that this really wasn't nothing

One of these days, one of these nights
You'll take off your hat and they'll read you, your rights
You'll wanna get high every time you feel low
Hey, Queen Isabella stay away from that fella
He'll just get you into trouble, you know?

But they came here by boat and they came here by plane
They blistered their hands and they burned out their brain
All dreaming a dream, that'll never come true
Hey, don't give me no trouble, or I'll call up my double
We'll play piggy-in-the-middle with you

John Prine,"I wish, I hope, I wonder
Where you're at sometimes
Is your back against the wall?
Or just across the line
Have you been standing in the rain
Reciting nursery rhymes?
Trying to recall
Some long lost kind of peace of mind
Peace of mind
Try spending the night sometime
All alone in a frozen room
Afterneath you've lain
Your Saddle in the rain

I dreamed they locked God up
Down in my basement
And he waited there for me
To have this accident
So he could drink my wine
And eat me like a sacrament
And I just stood there like I do
Then I came and went
I came and went
Like a bird in a foreign sky
Couldn't even say good bye
Or come and share the pain
My Saddle's in the rain

I saw a friend who doesn't know
If I'm his friend just yet
His eyes and mouth were widely open
And his jaw was set
Like he'd fell off a cliff
And hadn't hit the bottom yet
I wish he wouldn't pull those things on me
Without a net
Without a net
I had him up to the house one time
And we was having a real good time
Then he went and lain
His Saddle in the rain

In a laundromat not too far
From the Alamo
Sits a girl who stole my records
Very long ago
And she wishes, wants and washes
Out those dirty clothes
As she shuts her eyes and dreams
About her one eyed Joe
One eyed Joe
Car parked on a dirty road
Heaven knows the load she pulled
Couldn't take the strain

With a two room roebuck sale

With t.v. dinners and ginger ale

The little money comin' worked out well

John Prine,"There was a time
When lonely men would wander
Through this land
Rolling aimlessly along
So many times
I've heard of their sad story
Written in the words
Of dead men's songs.

Down through the years
Many men have yearned
For freedom
Some found it
Only on the open road
So many tears of blood
Have fell around us
'cause you can't always do what you are told.

Please tell me where
Have all the hobos gone to
I see no fire burning down
By the rusty railroad track
Could it be that time
Has gone and left them
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack.

Last Sunday night
I wrote a letter
To my loved one
I signed my name
And knew I'd stayed away
Too long
There was a time
When my heart was free to wander
And I remember as I sing
This hobo song.

John Prine,"He stumbled through the alley with his long coat on
Nothing but a bottle in his hand
She sat in her apartment lonesome to the bone
Wondering what had happened to her man

[Chorus]
Love, love, love, love
Nobody ever understands
All the things that go,
Between a woman and a man.

When they'd walk down the sidewalk the street would shine
With the kind of love no human heart can fake
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake

[Chorus]

If I should live to a ripe old age
The only lesson I may ever learn
Is to not stand so close to the flame of love
Unless you are willing to get burned

Between a woman and a man.","Love, Love, Love",1986
John Prine,"If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares
There is still one smiling face the Gods would see
But she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me

What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave
And watch her love turn into sympathy
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave
Oh they'll never, never take her love from me

I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness
That we shared together in the use to be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress
But they'll never, never take her love from me

Well, I though I'd make her happy if I'd step aside
But I knew her love would never set me free
And even on the morning she became another's bride
I said they'll never, never take her love from me

No, they'll never, never take her love from me",They'll Never Take Her Love from Me,1986
John Prine,"Small town, bright lights, saturday night,
Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray

(spoken:)
Lydia
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.
She read romance magazines up in her room
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.

Chorus:
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby,
Like sunshine feeding daisies,
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.

Bunk beds, shaved heads, saturday night,
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:

(spoken:)
Donald
There were spaces between donald and whatever he said.
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.

[Repeat chorus:]
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.
Donald and lydia made love that night.

(spoken:)
Love
The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,
'cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

John Prine,"We had an apartment in the city
Me and Loretta liked living there
Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown
A life of their own left us alone
John and Linda live in Omaha
And Joe is somewhere on the road
We lost Davy in the Korean war
And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore

Chorus:
Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger
And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, ""Hello in there, hello""

Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
She sits and stares through the back door screen
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
We worked together at the factory
But what could I say if asks ""What's new?""
""Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do""

And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while

Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls
Tryin' to get away
From all the ears inside my walls

Everything I thought... what then?
Well I went to court
And the judge's name was Hoffman

Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality

Just to see where these feelings led
If I was the heart and you were the head?

Because you are the woman
And I am the man?'

Pretty ribbons of blue.

Man oh man,
I just love Christmas it's just so darn neat.
I kinda wish every day was Christmas,
Except Christmas eve and the Fourth of July.
We wouldn't want to miss out on the fireworks, would we?
When I was a kid, we used to get the Christmas catalog from Montgomery Wards in Chicago.
Sometimes we'd get it as early as late August.
It was the big book of wishes, hopes and desires.
My three brothers and I were allotted twenty-five bucks a piece, including tax.

So I'd make up a different Christmas list every night
From the first of September 'til the twenty-forth of December.
Matter of fact, let me present you with my Christmas credentials.
When I was three years old, at least that's what my mother told me,
I ate an entire ornament. I ate a big red one, I thought it was an apple.
They kinda freaked out and was gonna take me to the hospital
But they couldn't stop me from laughing so they just left me alone.
So I guess I still got that Christmas in me all the time, you know?

One year, I got a wooden Roly-Poly for Christmas,
You know the things you knock down and they bounce right back up.
They made 'em out of wood back then, that's how old I am.
Nowadays, they make 'em out of plastic.
My mom says, ""They just don't make 'em like that anymore.""
And I says, ""No ma, they don't"".

Then there was the year I came home only eave from the army,
From Germany to marry my high school sweetheart on the day after Christmas.
My little brother Billy, who was twelve at the time,
Had just gotten his first job so he was able to afford to buy some Christmas presents
For his brothers and his mom and dad out of his own pocket.
Billy had a job selling subscriptions for the Chicago Tribune.
He told me this guy named Rocky would pick him up in a station wagon,
Him and some other boys, and he'd take 'em out to some strange neighborhood
And drop 'em off and he gave them this whole spiel to give their potential customers.
Supposedly their little brother had won a free trip to our nation's capital Washington, D.C.,
But he couldn't go on the trip if his older brother wouldn't accompany him
So if you would please buy a subscription to the Chicago Tribune 
Then my little brother will be happy.
Wow, what a shyster! Some people'll do anything to get to the Whitehouse.

Then there was the year that my mom and dad gave me my first guitar.
Ah man it was gorgeous, I still got the thing. 
It was a like aqua blue. 
Kinda dark aqua blue with a cream colored heart.
Was a Silvertone from Montgomery Wards. 
The model was called Kentucky Blue 
And man when I saw that sitting under the tree I just couldn't wait.
First year so I didn't know how to play it,
I'd just stand in front of the mirror with a string 
Around my neck with that guitar and I'd try to look like Elvis.
Then my brother Dave taught me a couple of chords,
Now I'm here in your living room singing and talking to you.
It's funny how things work out.

So-a whyn't you go find a stranger and extend your hand to 'em.
If you see somebody looks like 
They ain't doin' quite as well as you, slip 'em a buck,
'specially if they don't ask for spare change.
Go buy your honey a cuckoo clock or a musical snow shaking water ball,
That when you wind it up it plays,
""I want you, I need you, I love ya with all my heart.""
'cause after all, hell man, it's Christmas.

Away in a manger no crib for a bed.
The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head.
The stars in the sky look down where he lay.
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the (1-2) hay.

I ain't hurtin' no one

There's three hundred men in the state of Tennessee
They're waiting to die, they won't never be free
I ain't hurtin' nobody
I ain't hurtin' no one

Six million seven hundred thousand and thirty-three lights on
You think someone could take the time to sit down
And listen to the words of my song

At the beach in Indiana I was nine years old
Heard Little Richard singing ""Tutti Frutti""
From the top of a telephone pole
I wasn't hurtin' nobody
I wasn't hurtin' no one

There's roosters laying chickens and chickens layin' eggs
Farm machinery eating people's arms and legs
I wasn't hurtin' nobody
I wasn't hurtin' no one

Perfectly crafted popular hit songs never use the wrong rhyme
You'd think that waitress could get my order
Right the first time

She's sitting on the back steps just shucking that corn
That gal's been grinning since the day she was born
She ain't hurtin' nobody
She ain't hurtin' no one

I used to live in Chicago where the cold wind blows
I delivered more junk mail than the junkyard would hold
I wasn't hurtin' nobody
I wasn't hurtin' no one

John Prine,"We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa wah oh wha oh

Many years ago along the Illinois-Wisconsin border
There was this Indian tribe
They found two babies in the woods, white babies
One of them was named Elizabeth
She was the fairer of the two
While the smaller and more fragile one was named Marie
Having never seen white girls before
And living on the two lakes known as the Twin Lakes
They named the larger and more beautiful Lake, Lake Elizabeth
And thus the smaller lake that was hidden from the highway
Became known forever as Lake Marie

We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa wah oh wha oh

Many years later I found myself talking to this girl
Who was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie
The wind was blowing especially through her hair
There was four Italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill
And they was sssizzlin'
Many years later we found ourselves in Canada
Trying to save our marriage, and perhaps catch a few fish
Whatever came first
That night she fell asleep in my arms
Humming the tune to 'Louie Louie'
Aah baby, we gotta go now

We were standing
Standing by peaceful waters
Standing by peaceful waters
Whoa wah oh wha oh
Whoa wah oh wha oh

The dogs were barking as the cars were parking
The loan sharks were sharking the narcs were narcing
Practically everyone was there
In the parking lot by the forest preserve
The police had found two bodies
Nay, naked bodies
Their faces had been horribly disfigured by some sharp object
I saw it on the news
The TV news
In a black and white video
You know what blood looks like in a black and white video?
Shadows, shadows that's what it looks like
All the love we shared between her and me was slammed
Slammed up against the banks of old Lake Marie, Marie

John Prine,"Jesus, the missing years

It was raining. It was cold
West Bethlehem was no place for a twelve year old
So he packed his bags and he headed out
To find out what the world's about
He went to France. He went to Spain
He found love. He found pain.
He found stores so he started to shop
But he had no money so he got in trouble with a cop
Kids in trouble with the cops
From Israel didn't have no home
So he cut his hair and moved to Rome
It was there he met his Irish bride
And they rented a flat on the lower east side of Rome...
Italy that is
Music publishers, book binders, Bible belters, Money Changers,
Spoon Benders and lots of pretty Italian chicks.

[Chorus]
Charley bought some popcorn
Billy bought a car
Someone almost bought the farm
But they didn't go that far
Things shut down at midnight
At least around here they do
Cause we all reside down the block
Inside at, 23 Skidoo.

Wine was flowing so were beers
So Jesus found his missing years
So He went to a dance and said ""This don't move me""
He hiked up his pants and he went to a movie
On his thirteenth birthday he saw ""Rebel without a Cause""
He went straight on home and invented Santa Claus
Who gave him a gift and he responded in kind
He gave the gift of love and went out of his mind
You see him and the wife wasn't getting along
So he took out his guitar and he wrote a song
Called ""The Dove of Love Fell Off the Perch""
But he couldn't get divorced in the Catholic Church
At least not back then anyhow
Jesus was a good guy he didn't need this shit
So he took a pill with a bag of peanuts and
A Coca-Cola and he swallowed it.
He discovered the Beatles
And he recorded with the Stones
Once He even opened up a three-way package
In Southern California for old George Jones

[Chorus]

The years went by like sweet little days
With babies crying pork chops and beaujolais
When he woke up he was seventeen
The world was angry. The world was mean.
Why the man down the street and the kid on the stoop
All agreed that life stank. All the world smelled like poop
Baby poop that is ..the worst kind
So he grew his hair long and thew away his comb
And headed back to Jerusalem to find Mom, Dad and home
But when he got there the cupboard was bare
Except for an old black man with a fishing rod
He said ""Whatcha gonna be when you grow up?""
Jesus said ""God""
Oh my God, what have I gotten myself into?
I'm a human corkscrew and all my wine is blood
They're gonna kill me Mama. They don't like me Bud.
So Jesus went to Heaven and he went there awful quick
All them people killed him and he wasn't even sick
So come and gather around me my contemporary peers
And I'll tell you all the story of
Jesus, the missing years

And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.

And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.

The fate of Floyd Collins, the lad we all knew well
His face was fair and handsome, his heart was true and brave

I'll tell you all my troubles in an awful dream I had
I dreamed I was a prisoner, my life I could not save
I cried ""oh, must I perish within this silent cave""

The rescue party labored, they worked both night and day
To move the mighty barrier that stood within their way
To rescue Floyd Collins, it was their battle cry
""We'll never, no we'll never, let Floyd Collins die""

But on that fateful morning, the sun rose in the sky
The workers still were busy, ""we'll save him by and by""

I said, well, I didn’t know
He said, “I turned 65 about 11 months ago”
I was sitting in Miami pouring blended whiskey down
When this old gray black gentleman was cleaning up the lounge

There wasn’t anyone around except this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watching ironsides on tv
Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
“Ever had a drink of watermelon wine?” he asked
He told me all about it, though I didn’t answer back
Ain’t but three things in this world that’s worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine

He said, women think about they-selves, when menfolk ain’t around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you’re down
He said, I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now its old dogs and children and watermelon wine

Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they’re still too young to hate

I'd like to do this next song especially for you. And for the King.""

Well
I walk up to the mike and and then I shake my hips
I take a deep breath and put a snare on my lips
See me on the street you wouldn't know my name
But imitating Elvis is my claim to fame
So when you put my imitation name in lights
There'll be imitation good rockin' tonight

'Cause I'm an an Elvis imitator and I just can't stop
Imitating Elvis from the bottom to the top
Imitate the way he talked, the way he smiled
I throw away my scarf and make the crowd go wild
This imitation Elvis may not be the King
But baby I'm the next best thing

Singing Viva Las Vegas and the G.I. Blues
Won't you Love Me Tender in my Blue Suede Shoes
Well let me be your teddy bear, if you must
Oh baby Please Surrender, 'cause I need your touch
Well if you feelin' lonely, need a place to dwell
Come on down to imitation heartbreak hotel

We're gonna rock (rock rock rock)
Ooooh we're gonna rock (rock rock rock)
Ooooh we're gonna rock (rock rock rock)
Ooooh we're gonna rock (rock rock rock)

Yeah my gold lamee cape and my sequined suit
Pompadou haircut and my high-heeled boots
Imitating Elvis is the only way
I can make it through my imitation day
I know this rocking music can't be denied
'Cause I was imitating him before he died

Well I'm an an Elvis imitator and I just can't stop
Imitating Elvis from the bottom to the top
I imitate the way he walked, the way he smiled
I throw away my scarf and make the crowd go wild
This imitation Elvis may not be the king

John Prine,"Oh, grandpa wore his suit to dinner
Nearly every day
No particular reason
He just dressed that way

Brown necktie and a matching vest
Both his wingtip shoes
He built a closet on our back porch
And put a penny in a burned-out fuse

Grandpa was a carpenter
He built houses, stores and banks
Chain-smoked Camel cigarettes
And hammered nails in planks
He was level on the level
And shaved even every door
And voted for Eisenhower 'cause Lincoln won the war

Well, he used to sing me ""Blood On The Saddle""
And rock me on his knee
And let me listen to the radio
Before we got T.V.

Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday
And he'd take me with him too!

Hearing aids in every pew

Now my grandma was a teacher
Went to school in Bowling Green
Traded in a milking cow
For a Singer sewing machine

Well, she called her husband ""Mister""
And walked real tall and proud
And used to buy me comic books
After grandpa died

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn

And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking

To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill

But empty pop bottles was all we would kill

Christmas days have come and gone
Broken toys and faded colours are all that's left to linger on

I can't forgive the way they robbed me of my childhood souvenirs

Memories, they can't be boughten
They can't be won at carnivals for free
Well it took me years to get those souvenirs
And I don't know how they slipped away from me

Broken hearts and dirty windows
Make life difficult to see
That's why last night and this morning
Always look the same to me
And I hate reading old love letters

John Raitt,"When I take you out, tonight, with me,
Honey, here's the way it's goin' to be:
You will set behind a team of snow white horses,
In the slickest gig you ever see!

Chicks and ducks and geese better scurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
Watch that fringe and see how it flutters
When I drive them high steppin' strutters.
Nosey pokes'll peek thru' their shutters and their eyes will pop!
The wheels are yeller, the upholstery's brown,
The dashboard's genuine leather,
With isinglass curtains y' can roll right down,
In case there's a change in the weather.
Two bright sidelight's winkin' and blinkin',
Ain't no finer rig I'm a-thinkin'
You can keep your rig if you're thinkin' 'at I'd care to swap
Fer that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

Would y' say the fringe was made a' silk?

Wouldn't have n' other kind but silk.

Has it really got a team of snow white horses?

One's like snow,
the others more like milk.

All the world'll fly in a flurry
When I take you out in the surrey,
When I take you out in the surrey with the fringe on top!
When we hit that road, hell fer leather,
Cats and dogs'll dance in the heather,
Birds and frogs'll sing all together and the toads will hop!
The wind'll whistle as we rattle along,
The cows'll moo in the clover,
The river will ripple out a whispered song,
And whisper it over and over:
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever?
Don't you wisht y'd go on forever and ud never stop
In that shiny, little surrey with the fringe on the top!

I can see the stars gettin' blurry,
When we ride back home in the surrey,
Ridin' slowly home in the surrey with the fringe on top!
I can feel the day gettin' older,
Feel a sleepy head near my shoulder,
Noddin', droopin' close to my shoulder, till it falls kerplop!
The sun is swimmin' on the rim of a hill;
The moon is takin' a header,
And jist as I'm thinkin' all the earth is still,
A lark'll wake up in the medder.
Hush, you bird, my baby's a-sleepin'!
Maybe got a dream worth a-keepin'
Whoa! you team, and just keep a-creepin' at a slow clip clop.
Don't you hurry with the surrey with the fringe on the top!",The Surrey with the Fringe on Top [*],1952

Through Killybegs, Kilkerry and Kildare?

How are things in Glocca Mora?
Is that willow tree still weeping there?
Does that lassie with the twinklin' eye
Come smilin' by and does she walk away,

Sad and dreamy there not to see me there?
So I ask each weepin' willow and each brook along the way,
And each lass that comes a-sighin' too ra lay

John Raitt,"I wonder as I wander out under the sky, 
How Jesus the Savior did come for to die. 
For poor on'ry people like you and like I
I wonder as I wander out under the sky. 

When Mary birthed Jesus 'twas in a cow's stall, 
With wise men and farmers and shepherds and all. 
But high from God's heaven a star's light did fall, 
And the promise of ages it then did recall. 

If Jesus had wanted for any wee thing, 
A star in the sky, or a bird on the wing, 
Or all of God's angels in heaven for to sing, 
He surely could have it, 'cause he was the King.",I Wonder as I Wander,1992
John Raitt,"By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon'.
where me and my true love were ever wont to gae
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.

[Chorus]
O ye'll tak' the high road and I'll tak the low road,
An' I'll be in Scotland afore ye;
But me and me true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks o' Loch Lomon'.

'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomon',
Where in purple hue the Hieland hills we view,
An' the moon comin' out in the gloamin'.

The wee birdies sing and the wild flow'rs spring,
And in sunshine the waters are sleepin';
But the broken heart it kens nae second spring,
Tho' the waefu' may cease frae their greetin'

John Raitt,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon
It's that old devil moon in your eyes

Just when I think
I'm free as a dove
Old devil moon
Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1992
John Raitt,"The story of Shadrack, Meshach and Abednego!

There was three children from the land of Israel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
They took a little trip to the land of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Nebudchanezzer was the king of Babylon
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
He took a lot of gold, and made an idol
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

And he told everybody 'when you hear the music of the trombone,?
And he told everybody 'when you hear the music of the clarinet,?
And he told everybody 'when you hear the music of the horn,
You must fall down and worship the idol!?
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

But the children of Israel would not bow down!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
I said you couldn't fool 'em with a golden idol!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

So the king put the children in the fiery furnace
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Heaped on coals and red-hot brimstone
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Eleven times hotter, hotter than it oughtta be!
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Burned up the soldiers that the king had put there
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

But the Lord sent an angel with the snow-white wings
Down in the middle of the furnace
Talkin' to the children 'bout the power of the Gospel
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

Well they couldn't burn a hair on the head of
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!
Laughin' and talkin' while the fire jumpin' round
Shadrack, Meshach, Abednego!

Old Nebudchanezzer called 'hey there!?
When he saw the power of the Lord
And they had a regal time in the house of Babylon
Shadrack! Meshach, Abednego!
Oh, Abednego!!",Shadrack,1992
John Raitt,"I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can!
I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his puddin-headed father ever had
I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornin's for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill!

Bill, my boy Bill
I will see that he is named after me, I will.
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill!
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around!
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

I don't give a hang what he does
As long as he does what he likes!
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes!
He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack.

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well.

Aha-ha-ha-ha!
He might be a champ of the heavyweights,
Or a feller that sells you glue,
Or President of the United States,
That'd be all right, too
His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President if he didn't wanna be!
Not Bill!

My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And as tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss him or toss him around!
No fat-bottomed, flabby-faced,
Pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully
Will boss him around.

And I'm hanged if he'll marry his boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette...

Hey, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!
I can see him when he's seventeen or so,
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him
Wait a minute!
Could it be?
What the hell!
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money!
You can have fun with a son
But you gotta be a father to a girl
She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair!
A kind o' sweet and petite
Little tin-type of her mother!
What a pair!

My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be!
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad
She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two or three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me!

I got to get ready before she comes!
I got to make certain that she
Won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot o' bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
In a fair hand dressed
In the best that money can buy!
I never knew how to get money,
But, I'll try, I'll try! I'll try!
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die!",Soliloquy,1992
John Raitt,"Soft breeze, whispering trees
The summer winds are sighing
The leaves are lullabying
Violins are all around you
I can hear the chords resound
Of sounding brass
That seems to say I've found
I've found you, I've found you.

Strange music in my ears
Only now as you spoke, did it start.
Strange music of the sphere
Could its lovely hum be coming from my heart?
You appear and I hear song sublime
Song that I'm incapable of.
So Dear, let me hold you near
While we treasure every measure,
So that time can never change
The strange, new music of love.

John Raitt,"There's many a man that rode a horse across the western plain
There's never been one like the Irishman
O'Sullivan was his name.

He never packed a shooting iron
The need he never felt
With two shillelaghs always hanging there
A'hanging on his belt.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

Har the shillelagh. 
You know we call it the Tipperary rifle. 
You never have to reload it.

This bronco-busting Irishman
From the heart of Erin's Isle
It was after living peaceful, like
He always wore a smile.
But when the smile was leaving him
In a fight he'd
Come unwound
Bad cess for any crossing him
They'd wind up on the ground.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

Why he was so strong was Sullivan, 
He could put his right hand in his own left pocket, 
And hold himself out at arm's length. 
No man could do that. 
It's O'Sullivan I'm talking about.
Oh, well he could.

At throwing the rope for branding calf
He was a mighty man
At throwing his two shillelaghs now
The fastest in the land.

T'would be a sad mistake me boys
To reach for a 44
Before you could get the hammer cocked
He'd have you on the floor.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

Did you know O'Sullivan played the Irish Harp? 
No. Oh, sure, and he did. 
He put 75 strings on his two shillelaghs,
He'd stretch them out 24 feet, and he had four leprechauns
Dancing on them to make the music. 
Oh, the wonder of it. 
Sure and he would charm the coyotes out of the hills

Across the range from morn 'til night
He rode for days and days
A'fixin' fences here and there
And a picking up the strays.

A cattle spread he really built
As big as Ireland
Where he could range a million head
And a shamrock be his brand.

O yippee ki yi oh, me bucko
B'gorrah an yippee ki yo
Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan
He'd give any man a go.

A bit of his lip, he back of his hand, 
And the toe of his shoe to boot. 
Oh, Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan.

Now if you're ever riding through the sagebrush wilderness,
And you suddenly come upon acres and acres of shamrock sprinkled with stardust, 
Well, you'll be after knowing,that you've just arrived 
at the O Sullivan spread, 
Known has the Lazy Leprachauns. 
Stop in, won't you? 
Sure, and they'll give you a belt of Bushmill's.",Two Shillelagh O'Sullivan,1992

John Raitt,"The game of ""just supposing"" is the sweetest game I know,
Our dreams are more romantic than the world we see.
And if the things we dream about don't happen to be so,
That's just an unimportant technicality

We could make believe I love you,
Only make believe that you love me.
Others find peace of mind in pretending,
Couldn't you? Couldn't I? Couldn't we
Make believe our lips are blending
In a phantom kiss, or two, or three?
Might as well make believe I love you,
For to tell the truth, I do.

Your pardon I pray, 'twas too much to say,
The words that betray my heart.
We only pretend, you do not offend,
In playing a lover's part.

Though the cold and brutal fact is you and I have never met,
We need not mind convention's P's and Q's,
If we put our thoughts in practice we can banish all regret
Imagining most anything we choose

We could make believe I love you,
Only make believe that you love me.
Others find peace of mind in pretending,
