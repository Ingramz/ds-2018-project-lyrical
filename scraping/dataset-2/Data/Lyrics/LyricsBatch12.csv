[DJ Premier scratches]
I'm comin' through
It's the voice you can't ignore
It's Afu

[Guru]
Hey yo, this is Gifted Unlimited, peace, Afu
You know we been doin' it for years, man
Show these fools how it's supposed to be done, baby

[Afu-Ra]
Uh, I spent time learnin' to kill
That's right, I'm stretching out with my tentacles
When I nourish my skills
The illest with that other shit, Perverted with this
Come and step inside the mother ship
I got the codes and manuals and microchip to flip the script
Parallel to my thoughts, tryin' to get
I keep it hooked up, but not the great white hope
Hey yo, Preemo, should I hit 'em with the rope of dope
Sea shells, sea shells by the sea shore
But now I'm slap, tap and a rap an' attack your jaw
Summertime, ladies at the bus stop
When I roll without the drop, they yellin'
'Shimmy shimmy, Coco Pop'
Ill with the slurs, what?
And I'm thick like yoghurt
Quick to quick to quick to bust a fast word
I know you like what you think what you like
But I stick out on a track and blind your third-eye sight

[Guru]
Why do you think that we should settle for less?
Now take a deep breath
No time to get rest when cats is testin' your vest
Kid you know who we are
Afu to the Gang to the Starr
We got props on every boulevard

[Afu-Ra]
I do it like this and that
Straight knowledge drippin' right out my hat
Like sex and candle wax
As a matter of a fact
I take it back, in the days
If you wack, in fact, you get the bozack
And the chickens, are thinkin' they finger-lickin'
Tryin' to get the party kicking
But really they should be stinking
Crack the asphalt, while doing lyrical somersaults
Slang slay your head, bang a boogie
I got a think-tank, that's lighting up with the blinks
Move and sway but I'm compared to mint
Some cats can't forget the spiritual and mental
Straight up, yo, I slap 'em with a miracle
Expressing everything, including the kitchen sink
Building on topics from aluminium and zinc
So while you fix your kicks, I do triple axels
Get in your bath or round the rink

[Guru]
Why do you think that we should settle for less?

[Afu-Ra]
When I spark it up, and you ingest my skills
I'm hanging down like I'm testicles
Romancing like Cassa', more steps than a dancer
Got a Pop Quiz? Yo, I help you with the answers
I'm Master Marvel, scribble the illest novel
80 more albums, I got more pages than the bible
Never allow my energy through Leviticus
As I rebirth my soul, glowing Genesis
Eyes tearing through the fog
Shout my brothers and sisters
Who studied the Qua'ran
From a path of hip-hop
Shall arm in a synagogue
Dinner china mushroom song
As the night prolongs
That means I'm 'bout to put it on
So abrasive, and persuasive
Thugs pulled out of my set, stop pace makers
Peace: computer-whizzes, graph-writers and breakers

I'm comin' through
I'm holding aura, it backs the voice you can't ignore
I'm comin' through
It's Afu, you know who, I'm comin' faster

[DJ Premier]
Yo, check this out
You know it's on the popper when I'm on the scene
That's right, it's me, DJ Premier
Representing Gang Starr and all the affiliations along with it
And right about now, you in tune to Life Force Radio
That's the way it goes down, and that's the way it's gonna be
Word up and we outta here, DJ Premier and I'm out

Daddy yo I'm hotter than Chinese chilly sauce mixed with musavie
I'm sick in the head invisible fleds
I'm shooting the stars I'm blacking the whites to blues

May peace and blessings be upon you
How you doing brother? Do, no

Look if I was in a position of giving us faith
(Listen)
Osama Bin Laden would have been shot in his face
(Missing)
Like every life he destroy in the World Trade
I ain't got no patients for the faggot less great

Couldn't wait to hit the wake with an O.G staff
Trained to shake'em, take'em and break'em in half
Using heavy caliber weapons for clearing the path

The same as we do in the ave nigga, look
(Look)
Is the legendary M.O.Piggidy back
Murdering tracks with Afu-Rigidy black

Yo ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo yo yo
Ayoyoyoyo ayoyoyoyo yo yo

I float like a butterfly, sting like like a bee
Muhammed Ali can't groove smooth as I be
High karate, enhanced thoughts with kimosabi
No mixing me up, I might rock all day
Gots to the rim, fight for my kin
Like the X-Men, my sense will be simile dressing and visually
Pounce my flows round the rings of Saturn
Gore-texxing, next section, jet-settin'
My key code kept alpha-numeric
Ready to set it, payin' the bills, you couldn't get it
The blemisher-finisher, finish too sinister
Or do you want the asiatic, acrobatic, chiropractic
Merit through the backflips
Supersonic, chronological, logical
We will inwobble you, ill specifics
Power flows through it, knowledge ready to rip shit

We get you open with the dangerous language ([RZA] Dangerous)
We keep you moving when we bang this, bang this ([RZA] Di-dangerous)
Straight shots to the head when we sang this
Drop bombs on this mic, nigga, bang this

[RZA]
It's the big double dancer, extravaganza
Zodiac: Cancer, who's the boss?
Tone dancer? No
Bob Digi son, I lodge fifty
Shots to your mouth, buck, and dodge swiftly
City crisis, I roll with po-lices
Ain't known to slap dick on all mighty ices
As I bathe in the jordan
Collect calls, from the commission of Gordon
Cult class when I play with the organ
Now I'm a free, black man like Morgan
Knock your head out the park as if I'm Joe Black
Walkin through the halls with bat showin no heart
Zig Zag put your ass in the shit bag
And steal the show from the thief with a black gag
You can run from the gun but you get tagged
And I'm back at my lab humming fat bags

One time in the place to be
I'm on the mic, and you know I'm straight rippin' it, G
Check, one two in your face you see
Afu-Ra transform to electricity
My esoterics lyrics, I said it, you're synthetic or sympathetic
Rock timbies in peetree dishes
Watch me set it, yo
Microscope and you transmit through the local news
Even though I spit to youths, got to spit the truth
I'm insane with the jingle
I'm biggin up my knowledge, the rhmyes, the beats, they mingle
I'm gettin busy with the lingo
Now you don't want it, they don't want it
Crack that ass like a Pringle
Peginistic with symbols and visuals
Adults flock like sheep need miracles
It's simple to see, that you holdin with the fairies
Thinking of a rap name, you're straight imaginary

Chorus:

y'all want some hip hop, then holler HELL YEAH
y'all want some hip hop, then scream HELL YEAH
Feel this hip hop, and yell HELL YEAH
y'all know we 'bout to bring it here, fake cats get up outta here

[Repeat Chorus]

Verse 1:
See whatcha like gimme the mic
I'm rippin and flippin and grippin it tight
Say whatcha like, don't play with me right?
I ride your chain from day to night
Head first with a verse
You see my excerpts got eskimos in igloos sweatin and seek in search
In self-worth, through the knowledge that all age enter the earth
Till the devils and his dogs I fool I'll be the fuckin curse
Spit fire more fire with my nigga Fire
I backflip blindfolded on a highwire
Then fall back on my team and dream of lividcism
I met Noah before the ark and started rhymin with him
If I wanted to flow with him reactin like a cataclysm
And shockwavin my rights into the system

[Chorus]

Verse 2:
Now set trippin and sweatin the aesthetics
The chick's beef hits your ass up like diabetics
I bet it gets, I wrestle it, second album be the predicate
No mismatches, no maxin or relaxin
Toast with the awesome two, break it like your fractions
Peep the equation, these Pythagorean thereom
I know the science for the metals and all the plenums
Until you hate it, young children have been mutilated
It looks good and some of y'all be desecratin
Incineratin wastin your state in the outer space
It's wicked right I hit it right slice doors with a butter knife
I'm makin moves on the mic like I was dice

y'all want some hip hop, then holler HELL YEAH
y'all want some hip hop, then scream HELL YEAH
Feel this hip hop, and yell HELL YEAH
y'all know we 'bout to bring it here, we transcend we outta here

[Chorus]

Verse 3:
Tippin you off bringin it forth, knowledge be the jump-off
Wax on wax off, liquid form-I turn to hot sauce
While some may want they salad tossed I can bust like Matatov
Now get your saddle off, quit bustin, no towelin off
Some pip squeaks in the game night ride like Hasslehoff
Stand back to your skin and feel my G-force
Tic tac toein I keep it flowin and flowin
No need for detonators my shit be mind blowin
Blind the sights likes of Ihmotep
Flippin the script ring the alarm like Ghengis Khan
Who rocks all takes all kick it like Win Chaw
Or ping pong crackin the mic, the dreaded King Kong

[Chorus]

y'all want some hip hop, then holler HELL YEAH
y'all want some hip hop, then scream HELL YEAH
Feel this hip hop, and yell HELL YEAH
y'all know we 'bout to bring it here, we transcend we outta here",Hip Hop,2002

Pure microphone magic
Carving up mc's, straight up torch their weak embellishments
Getting it
Put it on
Dirty download gigolo with the illest flow
Yeah
Perverted Monk high chief

[Afu-Ra]
Life Force moving swiftly
Pitch forks steady miss me
My renaissance, my brother's light eclipse me
My rough callous feet stomping on these city streets
Fuck that turn the other cheek
Unless you squeeze a peach
No parental advisory, so no need for the bleeps
No comin' in my crib unless you wipin' your feet
I hit the street, I feel good plus complete
A lotta hot rappers ain't nothing without their beat
Mark my name, on the clipboard, I gets raw
When I was sixteen, that's when I used to rip for it
Like Jiminy Cricket, hopping over the candle stick
Watchin' my ass, and yo I learnt quick
I'm nifty, shifty with my dirt, G
Doing my thing, put in work, ain't nothing hurt me
I bring it from front to back, white to black
Shoe to hat, use clues I'm doin? that

Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
You feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, you do your thing
Caress the mic like a baby to make your head bang

Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Carve my name in your brain, make your head bang

Monumental, thoughts flowing sequential
The quintessential mental, tapping into
My focus, take it round like a rental
And if I have to cut you with my gonzo
I'm like a warless sword, I'm digging into
Like you can joust defence
So many strokes and slashes let off
You ain't got not fingerprints
Carve you up with my Rambo, ammo
Looking like leather-face, trippin' on the dance floor
Too much hypocrisy, up in the market, be	
It ain't about talent, it's all about the currency
My magna opus, addicted plus the dopest
Maybe I'll write a line and fara canna quote this
They got status but can't work the apparatus
How could a project sell millions
Talking 'bout millions, when half their buyers ain't seen a thousand

Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Caress the mic like a baby to make your head bang

Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Carve my name in your brain, make your head bang

Times is kinda critical, that's why I gotta keep it lyrical
Simple and plain, 'cause I don't want to riddle you
I'm tryin' to black out, 'cause I'll blow your back out
Pullin' my axe out, do a M.O.P. mash out
With my dreads out, an' I ain't no type of boy scout
Mr Life Force, but you call me The Count
Got so many names, that I can't even count
Let's see: Paisley, 5th Thaing, Mr How, Dr Intergalactic
My other names is under the mattress
Now you can get your grades pissed on
After your body's been buried
From trying to get your diss on
Wax off, wax on
My calm is bringin' a storm, from the night until the early morn'
I got so many styles, forget the grape with wine
Life Force on the mic, an' 'bout to put it on
Takin' you ass away like I was Kogon

Rhyme skills the dopest, the lyrical style I spit is ferocious
Feel the beat in the streets and get close to this
So while I do my thing, do your thing
Caress the mic like a baby to make your head bang

'99 Style, know what I'm sayin?
Comin at cha, this how we do

Paraplegic, my fightin stance too strategic
No shadows on my kicks too much Chi horrific
To be specific, I'm comin threw with jiu-jitsu
Bone crushin bone breakin as I get into
Scorpion styles, with the speed of a cheetah
Hit your pressure points with light skills, I be
The blaster, Iron Palms is elemental
Combinations damagin nations in the mental
Cerebral cortex is obsolete
You'll die ten times if you try to test me
Taoist master, rhyme style disaster
Studied on the cliffs of mountains readin scrolls
Holdin it down, iron shirt chigung
Apprentice in the temple with Guang Jung Nim
I went through torture deadly styles I'm the author
Ingested metals, yeah they made me supernova
Triple spinnin kicks, side kicks, and hook kicks
They come much iller, so you must be Masta Killa

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin two styles on the mic with Masta Killa

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever
It's Afu, all the weak styles I sever
Combinin two styles on the mic with Masta Killa

The great ones have searched for the righteous data
To show and prove and master the separation of matter
And seein through death, never loose conscious of self
Shed a shell keep it movin factor
Sword swing it to the temple, mental state
Danger chamber, eighth yang slang, Wu-Tang
Train private soldiers in this rap game
Like that Shanghai chinky eyed chick from Bedstuy
Wang Chung from Lafayette, Stuyversant and Malcolm X
Fifty Seven Park, it might spark, it's the heart
One blood cell, featurin Masta Kill
After dark he goes, bust gone, trust none, touch one
Young chun, prodigal son, Killa Bees disease
Home grown, flown from over seas, city under siege
Ya eyes bleed, the weed got 'em red dread
Like spinnin roundhouse kicks to the head, he dead

It's Afu, change my style, change the weather
It's Afu, change your mind, just too clever

There's too many shades of grey, tryin' to stay, right
Peripheral vision, is seekin' out my sunlight
I know that love is love, and hate is hate

Yeah, I guess I'm stressing my case
There's only one thing I'm promised in life
That's my fate
Born to set the pace while I'm racin' the race
I know it's hard work, that's why I'm holdin' the ace

'cause right now, we now the struggle is ours
It's not too complicated, just combinations of pulling our resources
Of our sisters and our brothers
Who be a alike, that's a little insight
The strength be coming in numbers it's like dynamite

And are we really rich, at peace and settled?

I'm not a bad boy or a rude boy blood spiller
Notice how I touch the microphone like gorillas
Dressed in all white, sparking up my tire
It's Brooklyn dance y'all that have me in a trance y'all

I slid my way, right up in a jam
Skated on the dance floor like I was Peter Pan
Put style's together, I inspired Dapper Dan
Plus I'm down with the Wu-Tang Clan

No bodyguards, I'm just a dred rolling dolo
Looking for an empress and not a ho, yo
I made my way to the bar, the DJ shouted me out
To kick that Shogun slogan

I ordered Hennessey mixed with Captain Morgan's
And made my way right to the booth, to bust a flow son

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move and nobody get hurt

And all my big body medium and slim body Chaka queens
A hip hop nigga rocking in reggae scene
Arms out, skin out, synchronized as he rock to the beat
And can you stand the heat

And can you wind your waist without moving your feet
And if you don't like sweating, you should take a seat
Yeah, yeah, I mixed it out with my homey, Robbie Gandis
Pulling a cigar from Havana, like a don dada

While lil' ma's eyein' me up in the corner
I talk to bartender and order two corona's
I slid on over, the way she look made me sober
'cause I'm a smooth brother, yeah, I kept my composure
We danced all night to guess what the drama
It couldn't be a Brooklyn dance without no drama

Nobody move, nobody get hurt

Nobody move and nobody get hurt

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

One shot, two shot, rat-a-tat, tat-a-tat-tat
I grab the hand and we jetted out the spot
It was a beef between a Yankee boy and Jamerican
The whole crowd spread out in a hurry, shit

I held a taxi and hopped up in the backseat
He told the driver, 550 Jay Street
And by the way, I'm taking you with me
'cause I, I really really like the way you MC

Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, I didn't really know you like me
Now we both fixing on the party
Aiyo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo but you can parle with me

Mad, 'cause everybody only wanna use you
Physically and mentally abuse you
Misuse you and can't even console you

They only wanna get you dirty, treat you gully
Get ya bloody, uh-huh, it's not funny

I'm sorry for your mistreatments
Frankly, I know you been mistreated
Fake prophets, false off our favors of filthiness
It's silliness, with no love for the culture

Tryna get rich, yeah, it really makes me nautious
They're the reason, some women, they have abortions
Hip hop, you was my very first girlfriend
I focused to spit it right, my songs are an offerin'

Knowledge first, over beats, producers are samplin'
Myself and creations, on the line as I offer in
It's kinda sad that the toxins are smotherin'
Youth in the hood, poisoned by instant messages

Materialism, barbarianism, all types of isms
And schisms by tainted vision
I watched you grow from a seed into a forest
I watered you and watered you but your flowers are dyin'

Mad 'cause everybody only wanna use you
I admit I used you, but together
We have family, my album's in your name
I'm loving your music beautifully, I feel you slippin' away

Come here girl, uh-uh, can't have my love gone
It's like En Vogue, I guess I gotta 'Hold On'
I wanna drop it for the cause, I know you righteous
Spit something from the heart, help clean up the virus
Decapitate ferocious, peg leg rap pirates

They only flowing now, 'cause the dough flowing now
Who, what, when, why, where and how
I'm sorry baby, that you've been used and abused
And served like hell, some they say I'm a tattle tale
If that when I see wrong done to you, you know I got to tell
Tell, tell, tell, tell

I'm sorry, look what they've done to me

I let the vibrations, vernacular
Scoop up a chase for cakes like a spatula

Vision of going to heaven, nothing can stop this
Although I'm optimistic, balance it with being realistic
Is paradise is part of the plan or scribbled in some book and shit

It all goes down as rain drops on my neighborhood
Love my hood and motherfucker this ain't good
Crack heads selling dope to dope heads
On blocks that's rented by house niggaz

That's all getting rich off of the bloodshed
And as I experience, none the lesser
And it's high and it's high as I got off of the reefers
The balance levels of horror, yo, ain't never disappear

Mothers are crying in the ghetto

It's like we livin' in hell in the ghetto
I know, you know
Like that, like that, like that

I put the pedal to the metal, heavy metal in the ghetto
I ain't got to raise it, cause hell is the grimy ghetto
I guess that's the catalyst for so many fantasies
We can fantasize and happen to be surrounded by misery

The daughters and sisters, the little bitties
Princess inside ya beautiful
But mommy can't afford the sparkles and dresses
As a matter of fact, kids around here
Need to be walking with a vest on

'Cause the quietest streets around here, can be a war zone
And I'm in such disgust, 'cause the police
Instead of protectin' and serving, they serving us

They brutalizin' and battering, as a matter of fact
They play ghetto, officers, I see them laughing
Trynna pick up girls in uniform
Hanging out them college dorms, we need some inform
Why is he a ghetto? 'Cause society divided by nothing but money, hello

So many poverty stricken lives, the facts'll make ya heads explode
Cities and families, all over, global overload
From Brownsville to Russia, through Somalia, through Croatia

Lyrics are live, fight to survive, it's a horror ride
Demons coming for your hide but there's no where to run
Straight up, and there's no where to hide
Guess what, 'cause negative situation is winning by a landslide
And if you living this life, there's the worst schools
And the worst doctors, guess what? Society got ya

A walking fear factor, seven thirty, it's that simple
I've been exposed to a universe of negative fallout
The fact that I move on nothing, it makes me wanna ball out

Instead, I put vocals to the beats and get it popping
The harm glare right through the track, I feel like rocking
But back to the program, damn
My evil and is taking over like I'm sinking in some quicksand

From Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday and even on Saturday, it's like I'm trapped in a box

So I can't stop thinking about killing myself
So I do what I do, to do what I do, to break the rules
Only form of therapy is to spit it for you

Yo, I wanna spit it for my people so I can let 'em know

I never ripped it to show off that I'm nicest
My instinct, is in sync plus it's timeless
And the light I shine dog is ultraviolet
A night catch a sun tan man where my rhyme hits

My soul glow is unstoppable, unrockable
I'm light weight but I can put you in the hospital
Hittin' up the collective or individuals
I'm like an eighth covered in crystal, I'm gonna hit you

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me, do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

Oh, oh, so I'm the shit huh, now I'm Down like a Black Hawk
Everywhere I go, like I'm walking on the catwalk
I wax it and tax it, I'm doing the kungfu kick
Holding my dick like Michael Jackson

Yowser, yowser, yowser, the more you can bounce to count
That everybody feel the power, you know
I step on the stage, my mic like a light saber
Blast through the Seran Vega then I jump off the wall

As I take it to your face like Vega
Now who wanna contest the champion sound
With the crown from the underground ready to fuckin' put it down
Parallel or perpendicular, you couldn't get with the

Lyrical elixir, I be the victorious
And bless the mic so glorious
And go 'head and dust off your rust
I leave you stiff as a statue boy, standing in the dust

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now)
I never fake no moves, I just do my thing
(Do my thing, do my thing)

Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now
Do my thing, thing, do my thing
Do my thing, now watch me do my thing, now
Do my thing, thing, do my thing

Nobody's crying on for justice
And everyone is crying out for peace
Man can overstand please
A hungry man is a angry man
So the war will never cease
Malicious power struggle make de whole a dem a freeze
Hey you Mr. Sky Man, mister pharisees
Can you show some love and put your minds at ease
I no bow down to them fame, like a piece dem contain
And all you stand alone, in a de rain

All over the world, too much is too much
And I done been all over the globe
A-yo, you know enough is enough
Many families going to bed without a decent meal in they table
Babies crying with these soul of melodies
And they can't help themselves
They need the world to hear me
It's fucked up, the population's mind shackled up
By some are mesmerized by a fucking pimp cup
With the zillionaire big time ballers
Every where in the world, put five in the bum's cup
And I ain't trynna scapegoat the powers structure
Cause the powers structure's, heading for destruction
Matter of fact, yo it was built on destruction
I'm trynna look into the eyes of my brothers
Each one, teach one, we are all brothers
Get ya weight up, the situation ain't going nowhere
I can rhyme it til I'm blue in the face, so when the world cares

Everyday another innocent, end up dead
More wickedness, to all of them, spread out dead
In the ghetto, youth will shine
And I tell 'em them can't find no bread out there
People upset out there, well I teach another gangsta
Sure, we dead out there
Cause things them a do, we should reject out there
But instead out there, nobody never fling a stone
Now flat out, yet all dead

We praise a spiritual vibe, to bring a state of unity
Master playa haters out in the community
And global genocide's, Babylon's comodity
While selfishness, plays the mind of humanity
With media and propaganda, causing insanity
And self indulgence tastes sweeter than candy
We got women, plus the men hypnotized by vanity
Understand, one race, one family

You wanna pretend, but you go to be tough
Because the food that you eat, look like it not enough
And you want to be real, but you got to be rough
And the whole town repent, for a basket from a fruit
Rappin' in boots, but ya'll handcuffs
Working for this system, they got you by crutch
And go in your cocoon, and invite the rush
Don't step on your toe, when the hearing say hush

My life has been a struggle, my life has been unkind, forgot about my past pushed everything aside. The world I used to know was not the same not anymore, the first time I felt free was when I opened up this door to your mind suddenly I saw the things I searched for but could not find, in your eyes. Was I blind to realize you've always been there by my side? The pressure was released out of my head, the pressure pulled out by regret I don't neglect I run away! So now I'm facing up to a whole new life no longer more am I afraid for whatever comes within my way. From day to day I keep on going forwards through the pain. Hey can you hear me laughing standing naked in the rain. And I am cleaned from every single feeling that was locked inside my head; the raindrops wash them all away. I will make my own decisions, not to fake my time away again. I have kept some self-expression and I am still your friend to stay. ",Friends,1999

Which escaped your mouth of flies

Agathodaimon,"Where the wind blows over the mountaintops into the ancient sky 
And the flowers whither in the shadows of an autumn night 
Misty fog arises from the valleys and hides the face of the moon 
Underneath the ground lies a forgotten wisdom deep entombed 

As long as ravens ride the nights 
As long as the spirit of the earth takes seat between the spheres 
The path beyond was locked behind the gates of consciousness - the mirror of the soul 

Time is passing by the mist, is creeping through the deserted land 
And all the forests throw their leaves into the growing realm of sand 
A whispered cry which told the tale of earth is hurt from above 
It drowns the night into bright light and breeds a paradise beyond 
And the wind unveils the hidden treasure from the soil 
A sweet melancholy fills the plain with a lovely sound 
Unleashing the key to the gates of consciousness 

Take my hand I'll show you heaven 
And walk the path beyond with me 
Together we will stand the night and flee from the void",Paradise Beyond,2002
Agathodaimon,"One wish alone have I
In some calm land beside the sea to die

Upon its strand
That I forever sleep
The forest near, a heaven near
Stretched over the peaceful deep

That no one weeps my end
Nor for me grieves
But let the autumn lend
Tongues to the leaves

No candles shine
Nor tomb I need, instead
Let them for me a bed
Or twigs entwine

When brooklet ripples fall
With murmuring sound
And moon is found
Among the pine trees tall

While softly rings
The wind it's trembling chime
And over me the lime
In blossem flings

As I will then no more a wanderer be
Let them with fondness store my memory

And Lucifer the while
Above the pine, good comrade mine

Will on me gently smile?
In mournful mood
The sea sing sad refrain...
And I be earth again
In solitude

Kissed by a fraudulent snake
A soul eater, serpent's embrace

The sky and sun turned black
Nailed black as ebony
And there was no turning back

Looking back from now, a collection of strange days, for love

And at time I realized
Everything must surely end, some day

Darkness waiting in her gaze
She gave birth to a worm of lies

Quicksand of the past
Got no recipe. Muffins won't rise
And the margarine's goin' fast

Colors won't with the red door still in sight
I think of you
The sky caves in and my eyes are stabbed with light
Hurt me
Hate me
Help me
Who's gonna save me?
Walk a thousand paths and Babylon itches
With the shifting of the social scale
Like a castaway
Rabbit yells back and the register rings ""no sale.""

I'm still breathin' and my heartbeat's goin' fast
Not givin' in
Maybe I'll get lucky and I'll find
Inner peace at last

Back in the days when I burned out
I wondered to myself just why I never got it figured out
I'm a hero on a mission in a protoplasmic sphere
In another couple minutes I'll up and disappear
Naivete is the key to getting caught up
In a side of life that brings you up and tries to keep you down
In an effort to suppress the most ecclesiastical of beings in

the modern town
We used to be the ones who said:
No way, No way, I'm never gonna take that
No way, No way, I'm never gonna touch that
No way, No way, I'm never gonna do that
Finally one day you'll give in then you'll be a burnout waste of
(fucking) time.
My time is up, my mind is spun
Sitting without direction and I can't get nothing done.
With a zero facing upwards and imaginary friends
On a downward moving sidewalk on a street that never ends.
Got no time for thinking, no time for reasoning
I'm just a screaming siren in a world that has no sound.
My feeble mind is set on autopilot
With a socket wrench with which to pound me right into the ground.
Syncopated and serrated, go a ride-accelerated,
Got it right in front of me, right in front of me.
You know that I got it and you're never gonna take it away!

I've tried - but I just can't take any more abuse

let me tell you something

Feel it melt into my hands and
Let it burn - all night long

ever since the day it all began
Massive walls surrounding me - on every side
Now I hear a crash - they all come tumbling down
As memories collide - I'm living for that wild ride

could it be that I've forgotten what I came here for?
When I leave this world, I never will return
I know the only way for me to save my soul tonight
Is to light the midnight lamp and

Well you've got to be joking, if you say your thoughts
Have fallen into someone else's hands
And you've got to be crazy, if you think your life
Is just a mess of threats and tough demands

Well you just can't be that far away from what you want
To think that nothing's gonna get you there
'cause the truth is you were born with everything you need
No, you don't have to be a billionaire all you have to do is

Make up your mind and do what you want to do

If you're gonna do it, do it right!
In the end you're gonna see that it was worth your time
The results are gonna make you smile
There's really nothing to it, if you use your head
And concentrate for just a little while

All it takes is just a twist of your wild imagination
New ideas will come tumbling out
Can you feel the time slipping?
Don't keep the world waiting
Listen up, if you can hear me shout

Make up your mind and do what you want to do
",Make up Your Mind and Do What You Want to Do,1996

That there is never any room
For any doubt
I feel it in my heart, I shout it out

It's not because I've found the latest craze
It's just that I've got more to lose this time

you know that you can count on one thing
I would never let you down
As crazy as this world may seem
The thing that keeps it spinning 'round
Is always there
So close and yet so far

and you can believe it's true
A reason behind everything I do
A twist that makes it different every time
There are those who say ""it's all been done""
There's nothing stopping us
From having fun

And I will hold it in my hand before I die
You know there isn't any way that we can lose
And you don't have to be confused
By hollow words that never mean a thing

To everyone around you
You don't have to be the same
This is the song that begs to set you free
A sparkle in the night
When we come face to face
Don't close your eyes
Don't ever turn away

because the only way you'll ever know
Is if you ever really try
So find out for yourself

But when I'm feeling right, the music never stops
I'm breaking bones, but I can feel, no pain at all I know that

This is all I need this is all that I desire
I'll tell you this I'm coming right down to the wire again
This is all I need and this is all I need to know
I'll be lost until the music takes control

Than racing up and down these dead end streets
I've got to try out here it's do or die
And I'll be leaving nothing incomplete

Upon this earth is sacred
That he who sees it blur beneath his feet
Will always be one step ahead

I can see the only way that we can change
Our future is to brainwash and manipulate
The minds of those who draw the lines
That form the city scape's

What moves beyond these walls
Won't get far without abusing all the laws
I'll tell you why
We are unsafe at any speed

You're lost, now shut your eyes
Get ready for another big surprise
All at once you're blinded by the flashing lights
A blessing in disguise

Every time you stop to think
You waste another precious moment
And every time you draw another breath
You're one breath closer to the end

I wouldn't last a day without you

would it be too much to ask
If we could save a little time?
It's such a precious thing
That seems so hard to find

Let's hope that you and I won't change our minds
We'll twist and tangle as our destinies unwind

Agent Steel,"I hear a voice
It calls my name
It once was simple now the complications reign
I recognize
But I won't change
This coldness that you serve
Will only cause you pain

It isn't easy since I understand their ways
My hate endures, you waste your trust
We sit in silence and I turn my eyes away
I'd give anything for yesterday

I voice my anger
I voice our shame
We've poisoned all our lives
We've no one else to blame
We had our chance
To turn them away

Agent Steel,"Rot in cages we crouch naked
Waiting for the rest to land
Extended faith they betrayed our friendship
Imprisoned us by our own hand

Time for us to wake and rise up
May be too late but we must attack
Either that or we'll know forever
We're born cowards and we can't fight back

Prodded punctured probed and tested
Is this the way man was born to live?
Bred like cattle and raised for slaughter
Without a soul we've nothing more to give

[Chorus]
And the war begins from behind cages
Feed no more, rot, we're useless dead

The only way to win is to starve them
The way to win is to end our lives
Our sacrifice renders our flesh useless
Our death is life for the few outside

The future for these struggling rebels
Who gather armies for the final fight
Without strength our captors weaken
We do our best to do our best and die",Fighting Backwards,1999
Agent Steel,"The god sighed and silence was born
A tortured life is spared of vision
And it's painful when it's worn
The cloak of shame spares no protection

His world is made of steel
In his hands he bent the fire
To mold a thing so real
A burning world born of desire

[Chorus]
His hope was not enough
To fill an empty cup
He simply let it drain into the nowhere
There is no reckoning
There is no bargaining
In symbol rain will fall as he lays weeping

We stand below rinsed by the tears
Unlike rain they bring no healing
Rust corrodes the souls
Of children wrought to match his image
Abandoned with all of his cares 
No choice but to wait for the kindness of time
To erase us one and all
To flow like a river with no beginning

Head in hands and weary eyes
The failures scratch and carve the lines
Into the face of one
The lines into the face of none
He sees the world 
He sees his dreams
And nothing's ever as it seems
The promise was so real
Now all that's left is crumbled steel

No prayers are said in his name
Nobody knew that he ever existed
Alone he accepts all the blame
Plaintively wonders how dreams become twisted
And he waits for another to come
Another, a chance to revive from the nothing
The fabric to weave once again
To forge from the fire his vision of man",Into the Nowhere,1999
Agent Steel,"Something's wrong with the world
Something's wrong with the view from here
It's so hard to explain
The visions I see are rarely clear
Just below the lie I am sure of hides the real
Reality, we feed machines, with minds in need of worth

Contact made with the truth
Through lines of code on my computer screen
Binary diamonds of proof
Shining stars unlock doors made of dreams
Beyond required imagination hides the hive
Born from AI, we live the lie cocooned in lieu of life

With dreams we feed reality
Your fantasy a fallacy?
Imprisoned by your memory, a memory?

There's no promise of peace
There's no comfort and no guarantees
Once the system's been killed
We'll have no choice; we'll have to rebuild
And life won't be the pretty picture you recall
But it will be reality and you'll be free

With dreams we feed reality

Agent Steel,"Wake the dreamer

Restless vision

Know your master
You're not equal
Know your master

Revealed before time might destroy all the remnants
Predecessors
Creators of space and lords of dimension
Godless fathers

Full with old dirt
All are stifled
Earth's hand turns to fist

Il delirio fa parte del cuore
Un pianto bagna la bocca
É tanta la voglia di ritrovarti

Dove sei, la fantasia
La nostalgia, la mia mania

I miei occhi turbati
Dal sole, dal vento
Il tuo viso sereno m'incanta
Che mancanza mi fai

Ti voglio aver sempre con me
Oggi ho sentito davvero che
Non posso piu viver cosi
Per me tu sei sempre
Il primo amore

Dove sei io sempre qui
Innamorata ancora si

Cantare per non morire
Illudermi per non soffrire
Parole, colore della vita
Sempre sempre per te

Dove sei io sempre qui
Innamorato ancora si
Cantare per non morire
Illudermi per non soffrire
Parole, colore della vita
Sempre sempre per te

Felice é sognare con te
Speranza é nata
Per questo che
Il cielo é coperto di stelle
Ti guardo, ti voglio
Ti amo

Felice é sognare con te
Speranza é nata
Per questo che
Il cielo é coperto di stelle
Ti guardo, ti voglio
Ti amo martyrdom, torment of love
Delirium makes part of the heart
A cry bathes the mouth
And great is my wish to find you again.
Where are you, fantasy,
Nostalgia, my manias.

My eyes are delirious
From the sun, from the wind.
Your calm face, it bewitches me
The lack which you make.

I want to have you with me forever
Today I felt truly that
I could not live anymore this way
For me you are always
My first love

Where are you? I'll always be here.
Yes, still captivated.

To sing so I may not die
Deceiving myself so I may not suffer
Words, colors of life,
Always, always, for you.

Where are you? I'll always be here.
Yes, still captivated.

To sing so I may not die
Deceiving myself so I may not suffer

Hope is born
For that
The sky is covered with stars.
I watch you, I wish for you,
I love you.

I always knew we were meant to be lovers,
I always knew we were made for each other,
I always knew there was no one else
Could make me feel this way
But when you go away,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye.

The summer sun always shines when you're with me,
I feel it's warmth in the love that you give me,
I feel your touch and I know
That's where I always want to stay
But when you go away,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye,
The angels cry each time you say goodbye.

When we're apart, the rain it falls,
The wind it calls, for you my love,
Right from the start when our love was young
The rising sun, the only one was you my love.

I always knew we were meant to be lovers,
I always knew we were made for each other,
I always knew there was no one else

Business and pleasure
Keeping you up,
Hunting for treasure
You can't dig enough,
Growing but losing
Staying up late,
All the nightclubs are closing
But you've got a date.

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,
Business and pleasure
You can't mix, you can't switch,
Just a case of a face and a place, no disgrace
It's just a rhythm a syndrome
It's a feeling you crave,
Click track, Click track.

Move at your leisure
Make tracks leave no signs,
Like a fire in the desert
With winds from behind,
You're getting hot and live wired
Using down time,
All for business and pleasure
Time after time.

So you've hit the right spot
But you've still got the itch,

Scanning the screen,
You read it all over
And steal the scenes,
You're rougher than Crusoe
Bedded in leaves,
And you're looking for Friday
To answer your needs.

And I've worked on the traits I lacked.

And act.

Agnetha Fältskog,"When you're so far away
At the end of each day
Counting the moments till you fade away
Inside my soul
Under passion's control
Are feelings I can't find the words to explain
Just like the first time I'm helpless again

Wrap your arms around me
Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before
Wrap your arms around me
From the day you found me
You'll never be alone

With just your memory to hold
I've tried to be strong
Reaching out holding on
Alone in my bed
I cling to each word you said
Wanting you more every day we're apart
And each precious moment is safe in my heart

Let your love surround me
Make love to me now like never before

'Cause I couldn't take the heartache again

Wouldn't compromise, it's never the same

And you smiled at me
Knew I had to be with you
And suddenly, closer to me
(You're there, you're there).

You're there in the morning
And the hurt is slippin' away (slippin' away)
And though I laugh through teardrops
I can't face another day,

I want you to stay.

Agnetha Fältskog,"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned.
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came.
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away.
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came.
Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see.
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came.
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof
I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came.",The Day Before You Came,1998

I can see your face in all of my dreams.
Smiling, laughing, from the shadows
When I hear your voice I know what it means.
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try

Disillusion, disillusions all you left for me.
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down?
You're all I had, you're all I want,
Disillusion, disillusions now, that's all I have. 
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd?
Thinking, wondering, what you're doing
I can't stop myself from crying out loud.
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar
But then, they'd never shared our love

In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (see it all so clearly)

Answer me sincerely (answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?

But I know I don't possess you, so go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only.
I've watched you look away

Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through.

The love you gave me. nothing else can save me, S.O.S.
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone though I try how can I carry on?

I gave her all the reasons for being in despair 
She said that explanations won't get you anywhere. 
It's not a matter of virtue or the cause you defend 
It's only the moments of choice that count in the end. 

We get a bit of the good life, a piece of the cake 
And enough of the hard times to keep us awake. 
It takes the eyes of a woman, the heart of a child 
The soul of a gypsy, to cherish the wild, 
The eyes of a woman, the heart of a child 
The soul of a gypsy, to cherish the wild. 

She hit me in a weak spot, I knew that she was right 
She said, ``Can you imagine a day without a night? 
Good without the evil, is a cob without the corn 
It's with the aid of demons that angels can be born

Agnetha Fältskog,"I would bring you flowers in the morning
Wild roses as the sun begins to shine 
Sweet perfume in tiny jeweled caskets 
If I thought you'd ever change your mind 

I would take you where the music's sweetest
And feed you winter fruits and summer wine
Show you things you've only read in story books
If I thought you'd ever change your mind 

I would bring you happiness
Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
I would bring you summer rain and rainbow skies to make your garden grow
And in the winter snow my songs would keep you from the cold 

But what use of flowers in the morning
When the garden they should grow in is not mine
And what use is sunshine if I'm crying
And my falling tears are mingled with the wine 

I would bring you happiness
Wrapped up in a box and tied with a yellow bow
I would bring you rainbow skies
And summer rain to make your garden grow
And in the winter snow, my songs would keep you from the cold

Agnetha Fältskog,"For those who fancy colouring books
And lots of people do
Here's a new one for you

A most unusual colouring book
The kind you never see
Crayons ready, very well
Begin to colour me

These are the eyes
That watched him
As he walked away
Colour them grey

This is the heart
That thought
He would always be true
Colour it blue

These are the arms that held him
And loved him
Then lost him somehow
Oh, colour them empty now

These are the beads
I wore until she came between
Colour them green

This is the room that I sleep in
And walk in and weep in and hide in
That nobody sees
Oh, colour it lonely please

This is the man
Whose love I depended upon
Colour him gone

Past - well now let me tell you about the past
Past is filled with silent joys and broken toys
Laughing girls and teasing boys
Was I ever in love?
I called it love
I mean - it felt like love
There were moments when... 
Well, there were moments when... 

[Present]
Go out with you?
Why not?
Do I like to dance?
Of course
Take a walk along the beach tonight?
I'd love to
(But) Don't try to touch me
Don't try to touch me
Cause that will never happen again
Shall we dance?

[Instrumental]
[The Future]
Tomorrow - well... Tomorrow is a long way off 
Maybe someday I'll hold somebody's hand
Maybe somewhere someone will understand
You know - I used to sing: ""A tisket, a tasket, a green and yellow basket"" 
I'm all packed up and I'm on my way and I'm gonna fall in love
But at the moment it's doesn't look good
At the moment it will never happen again
I don't think it will ever happen again","Past, Present and Future",2004

But sometimes when I'm dreaming
And I dream a lot these days
I need someone who understands
Who leads me through the haze

That I fall in love for real
But I wake up screaming
Sometimes when I'm dreaming

And it's now
That I need a friend
I reach out for the phone

To give up the fight
I'm sailing away

Agnieszka Skrzypek,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2002

Until time itself became a chain

That's put to rest everything--I once felt inside
To never again be bound by united blood
A sense of purpose lost forever more
Is this the way I'll die? no!

You got a lot of nerve
They talkin alot. I heard
Only round yo homies, when I'm round you know, not a word
I'm a heathen who fight for what he believes in, and I don't have no plans on leaving till I get even
Salt and pepper, nigga I'm seasoned for any reason
The day you want something with Juve, come on and see him
My G ain't gon allow me to lose, I'm busting shots as soon as you make a move
Oooh, I'm not a fan of fools that's why I got attitude
Runnin your mouth to me, I'm a try to get at a dude
Don't even have a tool, what is you tryna prove
Gon head and choose ya [? ], cause I'm a shoot

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
N.O. on my fitted, I'm committed to my city
Anything I will commit it just to show that I'm committed
Commit it then get acquitted
Aye Gizzle let me get em, Gizzle let me get em
Eat em up and shit em (ha)
And ain't no explanation for this damn insanity
I'm a monster like I'm part of the Addams Family
And some say I am old, but I'm new to a few
And I'm blessed... achoo
I came to get me and I got you
And I'm so me and I'm not you
And even if you get married you could'nt do what I do
Now let me get high off my drug scandals
Life's a gamble...

Her two kids with their grinding teeth, in case
Someone would dare to touch it
For it's nice, for it's cool, for she's got to take it off.

Willing to make every man look grim
Compared to her beautiful hair

Allongés dans cette douche à damier, 
Un baiser aurait suffit à nous emporter

Les langues se délient, oh oui.

Un bustier noir volé au grand magasin
Le tourniquet de la cuvette en main 
Les doigts dans ma bouche, ton sein 
Collé contre ma nuque, oh oui

Attrapée juste avant de s'envoler
Par un garçon pêcheur trop bien attentionné,
Volant au gré des voix
Elle ne regarde plus vers moi.

La peur de m'aimer,
De passer à côté de sa liberté
Impossible d'ignorer les garçons acidulés. 
Mais que fait la jolie fleur tatouée ?


Ce soir dis-moi juste si tu m'aimes encore un peu

Mais vraiment quelle envie cette idée de rester ?
A la lecture de tes pensées, j’aurai dû décamper
A quoi bon mesurer quelle dose d'amour s'était évaporée ?

E diz a ela
Que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer
Chega de saudade, a realidade é que sem ela

Não há paz, não há beleza, é só tristeza
E a melancolia que não sai de mim
Não sai de mim, não sai
Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca

Dentro dos meus braços os abraços hão de ser milhões de abraços
Apertado assim, colado assim, calado assim

Agota Eisenberg,"When we met we still had innocence
And we did things 'cause they made sense
Without trying hard I made it final
And we conceived our children on backseat vinyl
Though we didn't have a lot
(But) one was quickly bought
Then we buit upon this ground something we thought was sound
But in reality was silence
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I only picked up your story knowing you were lying
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help yourself
When I look back now I plainly see
The misery I'm sure you don't agree
And all the products of those peaceful years
The broken plates and glasses and the shouting hurt my ears
Sometimes I wish I was asleep
And you were just another sheep
And when we finally fell apart
You were left holding the cart
Though you thought I'd said I'd push it
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
I keep dropping those hints but they never touched the ground
I'm useless to you now
You'll have to learn yourself to help yourself
I had never planned on this being so complicated
You had never planned on us being so separated
The spiteful words will heal with time
Eventually they rhyme
You can forget but not forgive the fact that I still live
And never wanted you to give... in
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
You weren't satisfied I was only superhuman
Don't ask me for advice
You'll have to learn to help...
I can't tell you why it all breaks down
And please don't ask me why I'm no longer around
Well I could only stand sitting here so long
You don't need my help
You'll have to learn to help yourself

All my friends wanna settle down
Honestly finding a good girl is harder now
Tell me how I can help 'em out
When
Most of the people in my life who married aren't together now
It's getting worse every day it seems
But being with the wrong one can devastate your dreams
I waited for marriage, I know, that's old school
She passed the sonny test that's an old move
Just remember we all started out local
It's real when the people who hate you don't even know you
But I've been finding clarity going to church
I feel my insecurities are making it worse
I feel like God knows what he's doing
I'm taking the first step in the right direction not saying reverse
Take a walk in my shoes
Life is beautiful get lost in the views

What if just tonight we were different people
Just like in the movies we used to see
And what if just tonight we could love each other
Making things the way they're supposed to be

If we could just step back, yea
Give it all we got
If we could just step back
We can love like God

So many summers have passed you still require all my attention
You know the way into my heart only one direction
I give you all my affection I know you yearn for
I yearn for it to its what we made for
My life's goal is to make you smile raise the kids to be great in the meanwhile
You encourage the flows I write why I put em out
I read a true friend sticks closer than a brother, but
When I met you you were different from the others
A story of real love still reppin' for my brothers
I know that you feel the same so I say it for the culture
If you have a good girl go and tell her that you love her
No significant other then call up and tell your mother
All the best always rooting for the movie ending
I groove off the vibrations that you be sending
Forever yours although I'm gone forever touring
Why I treasure me waking up to you every morning

What if just tonight we were different people
Just like in the movies we used to see
And what if just tonight we could love each other

You say I don't
Give enough
That I don't care for
All I've got

But I do
And I will

I don't want to see myself descend
Into the shadowside again
If you're letting go of me again
In the shadowside I'll end",Shadowside,
Ahanu,"I've built a bridge
All of my strength cannot cross over
I stand at the edge
The end of a road that I have followed
Sinking from the weight of my own world
Wanting the waves of Your ways to wash my feet

[Chorus]
Healing waters
Healing waters
Solace flows through the river of forgiveness to my soul
Oh, I need You
Healing waters

Pour over me water to clean all my intentions
Baptizing streams
I swim in the freedom of redemption
Floating on the sea of purity
Knowing I can dive in the love that rescues me

[Chorus]

Memories are raging high
Floods so deep they touch the sky
All the things I've done to You
All the parts of a life untrue
Healing comes from outstretched hands
Saving me from what I am
Carry me
Carry me",Healing Waters,2008
Ahanu,"Come on, Check it out, ya'll
(Come on, come on!) 

Check it out, the tribal dance 
Feel the force, this is your chance 
To get control and do the tribal dance 

People started dancing a long time ago 
The bass was fast, but then again it was slow
Soul, house, rhythm and blues 
It doesn't matter what music you choose
Strike up a dance, is your chance 
To come with me and do the tribal dance 
You've got to move it with a temperature
Into the rhythm that the fire burns
So get into it-- get into the trance
This is the rhythm of the tribal dance, the tribal dance

It started with a tribe who discovered the vibe
Who moved to the rhythm just the way they liked
You hear the treble, you hear the bass
The are-a-why, yeah is on the case
Feel the fire, feel the flame
Do your thing now, don't be ashamed
I have to go now, no offense
I've hooked you up into the tribal dance

Get into it 
Get into it
Get into the trance
You've got to do the tribal dance

Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 
Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 
Check it out (come on!) 
Take your chance! 

Tribal dance! Tribal dance, tribal dance! 
Yeah! Oh! Tribal dance! Tribal dance! 
You've got to move it with a temperature, 
Into the rhythm that the fire burns! 

So get into it, get into the trance
This is the rhythm of the tribal dance, the tribal dance",Tribal Dance,2008
Ahmad,"Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggaro
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin' along
Naggin' if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hood rat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was nineteen eighty-five
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin' the blues
That be always tryin' to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin' ""Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and want to scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playin' ding dong ditch, when that gets
old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin' Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sportin' BK's
and, all the girls had they Turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is eighty-seven
Eighty-eight that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In seventh grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscin' and tellin'
'Bout when girls was bellin' tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eatin' pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad 'cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes, had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces, 'cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin' all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

Well, it's the niggaro, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holdin'
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin'
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A.
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid

Sometimes I still sit there reminiscin'

Ahmad,"Heh whassup?
Here we go, here we go, here we go
One two for the money
or the show then three for the S-E
Hah hah, whassup?
It's Ahmad, my man Mau' made the track

Well it's the niggerole, pump one more time
The jeeps I rock will never stop playin for keeps
And got more soul than a ghost I have mostly EVERYBODY UP
The masses movin asses so let the beat hit
And it ain't gon' quit 'til you stop and say (no)
Cause I get more (ho!) than +Hip-Hop Hooray+
I rock steady, steady rocks don't want to box with God
Because I'm cool, givin props to the old school
And the West coast, who just toasted the return
of the funk with the fat beats for your trunk (so)
I walk and I stalk and I caulk(?) and I blast
Then I dip to the party, find me a honey and tag that ass
I saw a Puerto Rican freak who was all that
Tight pants for dancin, told her we gotta lambada
No restin yet black, cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)
Now can I party if I need to?  (Yeah you can party)
Can I party if it's essential and necessary
I'm addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)
So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)
Now can I party if I need to?  (Yeah you can party)
Can I party if it's essential and necessary
I'm addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)

It's the return of the incredible man
who stands firm and rips up fakes without a cape
I'm great, I paid dues, kid how dare you respect me not
I had to get a tetanus shot cause fools bit but
now I'm back on deck, ready to wreck
and swing at every pitch til I'm rich (whoo!)
And that's not long because I got a new song to sing
Throne the king cause all the fools just stepped loose (ooh)
Back to the party at hand, I want you movin and groovin
Workin that ass, havin a blast
I'm fast on the feel so pass the pill
to the kid that rocks, everybody jockin stop then
throw your hands up and wave 'em from left to right
If you like the niggarole say (HO!)
But you know, no restin yet, cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)

I'm addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)

Kick it what did I say? (Get up!) Think you better (get up!)
Part efficient in circumfrence and if you don't jump
touch the ceiling with the center of your palm, use your right arm
Everybody standin, should love my sound cause it's too down
or three, might be four, fifty-six, maybe one more
To blow, might I flow, can I go, I'm that one so
Bumrush the doors, keep the doors locked
All I need's a small flock of fans, hands move to the bam-boom
of the bass drum, when you hear the thump of the bass
Jump while you're actin dumb, yell where you come from
(West coast) with the new soul scenario
(Just fo') us to control your stereo
Ahmad I flip and rip kids and crews to shreds
Mau' will lay a beat down like the Feds
I guess all should say yes y'all cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)

Whassup?  That's Ahmad and the Joneses
We on this mic, for the ninety-three, to the ninety-four
and more",Can I Party?,1994
Ahmad,"Don't let the Jones' get you down

(Get you down)
(Don't let the Jone's get you down)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Thinkin well it's the niggaroe back with my crew
Now what you want to do
The Jones', we on this, mic
So we'll fight to the finish
But I don't need spinach for me to do this
Pride in givin niggas pop-eyes, I'm large as buddhist
Rappers want to be down, cause they think that I'm better than
They, but I'll be OK-Solo like the Letterman
Use my common sense to boom-shalaklak-boom
Then lock the room, get busy as I get busy
Sayin ""Don't let the Jones' get you...""
But I'll hit you where it hurts, made you relapse in curves
When I throw verbs and nouns, any sound that I spit up
I have battle rappers usin they clappers because they don't want to get up
They all want to be like me, and so they re-write
Them wack-ass raps that they make and try to fake
So I break bones and holler ""Jones' forever""
Cleverest shit around
But don't ever let us get you down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, everybody says, ""'Mad, what are the Jones'?""
Well, let's see, it's a posse, true, and it's a crew
But not really, so what I'm gonna do
Is combine em all and find a title that'll fit
We're a group of money makers from the west that be runnin shit
Fly like a discus, don't miss this, cause it's me, and
I win fights with more mic energy than a pre-amp
They listen to Ahmad and the Jones' in here rock 
And roll with soul, then want to copy like a Xerox
Cause I mic-check and never once sound like Das at all
>From a superman crew, so I do the impossible
Droppin y'all wack crews like missiles, then I whistle
Kendal'll bring the 808 until the party say, ""the great
'Mad is the king of the ring,"" because I bring
Funk that shakes the ground
But don't ever let us get you down

I think it's cause we on this mic
We're the Jones', so)
Don't let the Jones' get you down

Kick it, I'm back, never can lose, I'm the man when I want to
Might gruff on rappers get ran like Jackie Joyner
The Jones' everybody want to be us, they be jockin
Cause we rockin the boat and in control like a remote
So I pack a 38-page rap book, put your gun away
And yell 'truce!' before I have to get loose and run away
With the title I've already won, don't mean to brag
Kendal blew up like a rocket, and I get down like a sag
I nag rappers that don't follow my lead, and if they need
Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag
The Jones' for life, throw up a J if they ever say
Who's runnin this town
But don't ever let us get you down

Oops, I guess I should stop singin and start bringin the funk
The niggaro sings a rap and have you clappin 
I gets busy, cause I never fall, I excel 
Never takin no shorts, so here's my tall tale
Once upon the clock 
It was hard growing up with no pops
But moms did the supernatural, very
Extra-ordinary 
Person that she is
She finished college, three kids at home cryin
But never got fed up, and kept her head up
'I shoot for the sky' is what she said, it
Got embedded
In my skull 
That's how I got soul 
To reach ya through your speaker
My mother alone helped me to be me
So that's my role model, not an idiot on tv
Used to do it like this
And like that, and like this
But since she never let me join a gang 
I couldn't g thang
So for all her prayers at night under the church steeple
I give thanks to my mother, one of those very extra-ordinary people

Now dig it, 2-(4)-6-8
I guess that I appreciate
And consider that niggas who work hard is the superstars
(Ordinary) people with families, that have kids
Should be put on a pedestal, not average
Treatment for our mother and fathers, and if you ask me
I'll say: you put your family first, before an athlete
But everybody want to be somebody special, who
Can grab a microphone, or put a ball through a hoop
And it's okay to like Mike
Even I would, if I drank Gatorade
But I'm too busy funkin your trunk with all this 808
To worry about that, I'm worried bout this 
If you agree, then pump your fist
If you're proud (Say it loud!)
To show you're pissed
Off at the news and media, because they swear
That all black people are menaces and holler and cheer
But since there's so many others that want justice, I know we will 
Start respectin others as brothers and come together, all of the
Ordinary people

Ordinary people make the world turn
I learned that if you work hard in life 
Then it counts the way the balls bounce
I wrote this to give a message, I'll be glad if it 
Switches your goal from bein a gangsta to a graduate
And if you listened close to what I said, you learned a lesson, and
Heard that all the average Jones' are no greater, or no lesser than
Stars, cause all we all are is equal
So shut off your tv set, and show respect to some of the

Bout to tell y'all about the Palladium
Me and my boys, the Joneses crew in the house
Kick it

Yo it's the end of the day and it's Friday (hey)
Ahmad how bout a show to the stadium (what) you know what the Palladium
(It's cool) We can't get faded, oh that's right you don't drink
but there's a better incentive, it won't cost, you know the hoe swing
Well I said guess I guess
It's better to flex than be at home watchin ""Chips""
I'd rather watch chicks
I flipped, looked to the right of me, tons of honies
One was a Playboy bunny, but I left her
Hugh Hefner's no joke, he's too heavy for my kind
I play blind and went out lookin for my type
That's right, my type, a cute fine girl named Sabrina
Coolin at the bar with her friend Tina
Way I was dressed, they thought I was ballin like Bobby Bonilla
Bought a pina colada and got another
Reached in my pants pocket, (??) riches (?) on paper
Saw a cutie 'cross the room, went on another caper
I approached her, she started havin fits
It was the pits - cause this chick thought she was the shit
My homey Kay said let's go
Ahmad ain't even fadin it y'all, cause it's cool at the Palladium

[Chorus]
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 3X}
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium.. word

[Ahmad]
Yo it's Friday the Palladium (whattup) what a great show
Kids chillin like nerds couldn't get in so they sittin on curbs
Cars rollin by deep, you couldn't miss 'em
Tempers start stowin so brothers start throwin fists at fights
I seen night lights hit skulls and glove boxers
Rock stars in limos stretch, smokin cess
I walk in and see brothers and broads causin havoc
Havoc and mayhem both straight from the West coast
Most of the dancers are housers
Some a few freaks freakin, guys playin to get laid this weekend
Speak of the devil, better put in my bid
But first get rid of this chick, she's on my testicles
Cause Ahmad is the God, I don't test no hoes
I just maintained and step in the vestibule
Be reminiscent of disses
I'm throwin body blows to weak rappers and tossin 'em to the fishes
Then callin Mrs., Bla Bla Blah
Mrs. So-and-So, your kid was blowin smoke so I choked him
Uhh, I'm just givin my respects, leave my condolences
Like when I'm bowlin, I'm bowlin strikes, I never miss
yikes - I gotta go cause they flowin I think it's my day
So chill and let's groove at the Palladium Friday

[Chorus]

[Ahmad]
Kick it yo I'm still cool at the Palladium show
Yellin out yo's with my bros and steady clockin the hoes
But now it's two o'clock I'm ready to split
Ready to get in my Chevy to get home and start hittin it hard w/ Betty
Smith or Johnson, fuck it it don't matter
Just want to climb inside a bladder like a ladder cut the chit chatter
Cause I'm smooth, never obnoxious, chillin
That's why ya never live to hear me rushin while I'm bustin
Got honies if you got dividends or in a Benz, and I got both
So now you see me, taggin asses like graffiti
And on the next day I'll be rested, exhausted
Because I was naughty, but damn, that was a hell of a party

At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 11X}

Not really into baseball, but I'm an all-american

You can jump and do the same

Follow me, get wreck
I make you bounce like a check
Mic-check, 1-2
Stand and watch me run through
A crew real easy, but that's only if I want to
Murder if I want it, stand and watch me flaunt this shit

Is it a lie that I must be a ruffneck
And wear a frown just to be down?
I kinda don't agree with bein (tough)
But you gotta be (rough)
It's either you claimin your hood, or you're not a gee
Forget about respect, I refuse to be the next guy
Fitted for a casket, either with it, or get blasted
I choose to gangbang, they give me a chrome-plated trigger
Say, ""If you got any heart, go rob that Mini-Mart, nigga""
Now look what I done did, damn, I had to be the big man
They're lookin at me shifty, better shut up 'fore I get slammed
Man, I'm not a thief, good grief, and I don't want to act hard
But then they said if I didn't do it, they was gonna gat, far
As I could see (I was gonna be)
The next new member of the crew, cause it's 8 of them and 1 of me
I don't want to do it, but I will 
Cause I still want folks to think that I'm hard and tough
Cause you gotta be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)

Well, it's the niggero, again, right back in where I left off
Still tryin to make a decision, I might go to prison if I don't step off
But if I don't rob this store, then I'm not sure
If I'm gonna be considered as a gee
And you gotta be (rough)
Cuffs are temporary, homies are for life
So I grab the deuce-deuce and go inside
I decide to prove in the Mini-Mart, ""Don't nobody move
Start fillin up the paper sack with loot, or I might shoot""
But things didn't go as planned, cause this man had his own gun
We're standin toe to toe, eye to eye, so I figured why not 
Pull the trigger? Put this nigga on the ground
It'll show that I had poise, then my boy'll know I'm down
But I didn't do it quick enough, or he thought of it first
Cause he blasted to the chest, and now I'm restin yellin, ""Nurse!""
And holdin on to life, or at least tryin to hold on
In a jailward wearin cuffs
Cause I had to be (rough)
Cause you gotta be (tough)

On and on, until you're up to no good

And still doin what you shouldn't

So stall that gang shit, stand up
Quit standin in handcuffs

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse One:]

I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin along
Naggin if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Why'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggaz singin the blues
That be always tryin to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and want to scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungaloes
Then switch to playin ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers 'cause they bell wearin Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sportin BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminesce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

[Chorus]

(and everybody say)               (I remember way back when)

[Verse Two:]

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminescin and tellin
Bout when girls was bellin tight courderoys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eatin pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad 'cause when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes, had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces, 'cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminesce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Well, it's the niggaole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holdin
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A.
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit there reminescin

Ahmad Jamal,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Ahmad Jamal,"I get no kick from champagne,
Mere alcohol,
Doesn't thrill me at all,
So tell me, why should it be true,
That I get a kick out of you.

Some get a kick from cocaine,
I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

I get a kick every time I see you,
Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,
You obviously don't adore me.

Some get a kick in a plane,
Flying too high,
With some gal in the sky,
Is my idea of nothing to do,
But I get a kick out of you.
I get a kick, out of you.",I Get a Kick Out of You,1955

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.
I can see we're in harmony,
Looks like we both agree

And I like it, how about you?",How About You?,1956

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

Ahmad Jamal,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

Tryin' to find myself a way to pay my dues

My suburban friends don't know my bag of blues
I'm up in the morning on the corner so siditty

That you'd hardly know it's me
And late in the evening when I'm mellow
There's my fellow with the world for me to see
It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before
I look for my man who held my hand

But now I know that he'll be coming back no more
I'm telling you 'bout this bag of blues
Paid a whole lotta dues baby
Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues
Mister don't you see I'm paying dues
Gonna change me some shoes baby

And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news

We're gonna cool it now and listen to the rhythm

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1981
Ahmad Jamal,"Old man sunshine listen you
Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare
Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

Two can be as bad as one, its the loneliest number since the number one

One is the loneliest number even worst then two

Ahmad Jamal,"A time for summer skies
For hummingbirds and butterflies
For tender words that harmonize with love

A time for climbing hills
For leaning out of windowsills
Admiring daffodils above

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

As time goes drifting by
The willow bends and so do I
But all my friends whatever skies above
I know a time for spring
A time for fall
But best of all
A time for love

A time for holding hands together
A time for rainbow coloured weather
A time of make believe that we've been dreaming of

Ahmad Jamal,"I remember the time
Before you were mine
And I was dying to be with you
Now you've gone away
And I'm in this place
But your memory hasn't moved
The shadow you cast just grows larger than life
How can the past cut two hearts like a knife?

[Chorus]
I can't walk away
But how can I stay?
Any way I step I lose
My back's to the wall
I stumble and fall
Trying to live my life without you.

You weren't a saint
So what are these chains
You hold on both of us
You give it your best
But you can't forget
And my love's not strong enough
To put out a fire that someone else lit
Or walk in the footprints that never will fit.

[Chorus: x2]

Ahmad Jamal,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call

Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Music we make with our lips when we kiss

The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses

But I miss you most of all my darling

Ahmad Jamal Trio,"I go through the strangest kind of changes
Tryin' to find myself a way to pay my dues
And would you believe it I'm so urban
My suburban friends don't know my bag of blues
I'm up in the morning on the corner so siditty

That you'd hardly know it's me
And late in the evening when I'm mellow
There's my fellow with the world for me to see
It's a world full of cocktails at nine
And dinners and wine very late shows
And where the crowd goes

I'm a girl with a world of her owna queen on her throne
Till everything's gone and then
I wake up to find that I'm a stranger
In a world where I have never before
I look for my man who held my hand

But now I know that he'll be coming back no more
I'm telling you 'bout this bag of blues
Paid a whole lotta dues baby
Gonna change my way of livin' talkin' bags of blues
Mister don't you see I'm paying dues
Gonna change me some shoes baby

Walkin' in a daze to my apartment where I'll grab another wink
And doze on the sofa 'til eleven then get up and pour myself another drink
While back at the party I'll be hardy while I'm waitin' for some better news
But now in the meantime I'll just sit right here and cool it
We're gonna cool it now and listen to the rhythm

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Ahmad Jamal Trio,"I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do
The outlook was decidedly blue

But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

A foggy day, in London town
Had me low, had me down
I viewed the morning, with much alarm
British Museum, had lost its charm

How long I wondered,
Could this thing last
But the age of miracles, hadn't past
For suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London town,
The sun was shining everywhere

Ahmad Jamal Trio,"When a girl meets boy
Life can be a joy
But the note they end on
Will depend on 
Little pleasures they will share
So let us compare

I like New York in June, how about you?
I like a Gershwin tune, how about you?
I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?
I'm mad about good books, can't get my fill,
And Franklin Roosevelt's looks give me a thrill.
Holding hands at the movie show,
When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,
How about you?

I like Jack Benny's jokes.
To a degree.
I love the common folks.
That includes me.
I like to window shop on 5th Avenue.
I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,
How about you?
I love to dream of fame, maybe I'll shine.
I'd love to see your name right beside mine.

Looks like we both agree

I wish I knew you place no one above me
Did I mistake this for a real romance?
I wish I knew, but only you can answer.

Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

You and you glance make this romance
Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

Love came, planning to stay

And through these moments apart memories live in my heart

I'm sure that if,
I took even one sniff,
It would bore me terrifically,too,
Yet I get a kick out of you.

Standing there before me,
I get a kick though it's clear to see,

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

touch the ceiling with the center of your palm, use your right arm
Everybody standin, should love my sound cause it's too down
or three, might be four, fifty-six, maybe one more
To blow, might I flow, can I go, I'm that one so
Bumrush the doors, keep the doors locked
All I need's a small flock of fans, hands move to the bam-boom
of the bass drum, when you hear the thump of the bass
Jump while you're actin dumb, yell where you come from
(West coast) with the new soul scenario
(Just fo') us to control your stereo
Ahmad I flip and rip kids and crews to shreds
Mau' will lay a beat down like the Feds
I guess all should say yes y'all cause here I am
Askin the question - can I party if I need to jam?

So can I party if I want to?  (Yeah you can party)
Now can I party if I need to?  (Yeah you can party)
Can I party if it's essential and necessary
I'm addicted, I gotta have it, then I gotta have it (Say what?)

[ VERSE 1 ]
Thinkin well it's the niggaroe back with my crew
Now what you want to do
The Jones', we on this, mic
So we'll fight to the finish
But I don't need spinach for me to do this
Pride in givin niggas pop-eyes, I'm large as buddhist
Rappers want to be down, cause they think that I'm better than
They, but I'll be OK-Solo like the Letterman
Use my common sense to boom-shalaklak-boom
Then lock the room, get busy as I get busy
Sayin ""Don't let the Jones' get you...""
But I'll hit you where it hurts, made you relapse in curves
When I throw verbs and nouns, any sound that I spit up
I have battle rappers usin they clappers because they don't want to get up
They all want to be like me, and so they re-write
Them wack-ass raps that they make and try to fake
So I break bones and holler ""Jones' forever""
Cleverest shit around
But don't ever let us get you down

[ VERSE 2 ]
Well, everybody says, ""'Mad, what are the Jones'?""
Well, let's see, it's a posse, true, and it's a crew
But not really, so what I'm gonna do
Is combine em all and find a title that'll fit
We're a group of money makers from the west that be runnin shit
Fly like a discus, don't miss this, cause it's me, and
I win fights with more mic energy than a pre-amp
They listen to Ahmad and the Jones' in here rock 
And roll with soul, then want to copy like a Xerox
Cause I mic-check and never once sound like Das at all
>From a superman crew, so I do the impossible
Droppin y'all wack crews like missiles, then I whistle
Kendal'll bring the 808 until the party say, ""the great
'Mad is the king of the ring,"" because I bring
Funk that shakes the ground
But don't ever let us get you down

(And everybody want to be like us
I think it's cause we on this mic
We're the Jones', so)
Don't let the Jones' get you down

[ VERSE 3 ]
Kick it, I'm back, never can lose, I'm the man when I want to
Might gruff on rappers get ran like Jackie Joyner
The Jones' everybody want to be us, they be jockin
Cause we rockin the boat and in control like a remote
So I pack a 38-page rap book, put your gun away
And yell 'truce!' before I have to get loose and run away
With the title I've already won, don't mean to brag
Kendal blew up like a rocket, and I get down like a sag
I nag rappers that don't follow my lead, and if they need
Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag
The Jones' for life, throw up a J if they ever say
Who's runnin this town
But don't ever let us get you down

Oops, I guess I should stop singin and start bringin the funk
The niggaro sings a rap and have you clappin 
I gets busy, cause I never fall, I excel 
Never takin no shorts, so here's my tall tale
Once upon the clock 
It was hard growing up with no pops
But moms did the supernatural, very
Extra-ordinary 
Person that she is
She finished college, three kids at home cryin
But never got fed up, and kept her head up
'I shoot for the sky' is what she said, it
Got embedded
In my skull 
That's how I got soul 
To reach ya through your speaker
My mother alone helped me to be me
So that's my role model, not an idiot on tv
Used to do it like this
And like that, and like this
But since she never let me join a gang 
I couldn't g thang
So for all her prayers at night under the church steeple
I give thanks to my mother, one of those very extra-ordinary people

Now dig it, 2-(4)-6-8
I guess that I appreciate
And consider that niggas who work hard is the superstars
(Ordinary) people with families, that have kids
Should be put on a pedestal, not average
Treatment for our mother and fathers, and if you ask me
I'll say: you put your family first, before an athlete
But everybody want to be somebody special, who
Can grab a microphone, or put a ball through a hoop
And it's okay to like Mike
Even I would, if I drank Gatorade
But I'm too busy funkin your trunk with all this 808
To worry about that, I'm worried bout this 
If you agree, then pump your fist
If you're proud (Say it loud!)
To show you're pissed
Off at the news and media, because they swear
That all black people are menaces and holler and cheer
But since there's so many others that want justice, I know we will 
Start respectin others as brothers and come together, all of the
Ordinary people

Ordinary people make the world turn
I learned that if you work hard in life 
Then it counts the way the balls bounce
I wrote this to give a message, I'll be glad if it 
Switches your goal from bein a gangsta to a graduate
And if you listened close to what I said, you learned a lesson, and
Heard that all the average Jones' are no greater, or no lesser than
Stars, cause all we all are is equal
So shut off your tv set, and show respect to some of the

Bout to tell y'all about the Palladium
Me and my boys, the Joneses crew in the house

Yo it's the end of the day and it's Friday (hey)
Ahmad how bout a show to the stadium (what) you know what the Palladium
(It's cool) We can't get faded, oh that's right you don't drink
but there's a better incentive, it won't cost, you know the hoe swing
Well I said guess I guess
It's better to flex than be at home watchin ""Chips""
I'd rather watch chicks
I flipped, looked to the right of me, tons of honies
One was a Playboy bunny, but I left her
Hugh Hefner's no joke, he's too heavy for my kind
I play blind and went out lookin for my type
That's right, my type, a cute fine girl named Sabrina
Coolin at the bar with her friend Tina
Way I was dressed, they thought I was ballin like Bobby Bonilla
Bought a pina colada and got another
Reached in my pants pocket, (??) riches (?) on paper
Saw a cutie 'cross the room, went on another caper
I approached her, she started havin fits
It was the pits - cause this chick thought she was the shit
My homey Kay said let's go
Ahmad ain't even fadin it y'all, cause it's cool at the Palladium

[Chorus]
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 3X}
At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium.. word

[Ahmad]
Yo it's Friday the Palladium (whattup) what a great show
Kids chillin like nerds couldn't get in so they sittin on curbs
Cars rollin by deep, you couldn't miss 'em
Tempers start stowin so brothers start throwin fists at fights
I seen night lights hit skulls and glove boxers
Rock stars in limos stretch, smokin cess
I walk in and see brothers and broads causin havoc
Havoc and mayhem both straight from the West coast
Most of the dancers are housers
Some a few freaks freakin, guys playin to get laid this weekend
Speak of the devil, better put in my bid
But first get rid of this chick, she's on my testicles
Cause Ahmad is the God, I don't test no hoes
I just maintained and step in the vestibule
Be reminiscent of disses
I'm throwin body blows to weak rappers and tossin 'em to the fishes
Then callin Mrs., Bla Bla Blah
Mrs. So-and-So, your kid was blowin smoke so I choked him
Uhh, I'm just givin my respects, leave my condolences
Like when I'm bowlin, I'm bowlin strikes, I never miss
yikes - I gotta go cause they flowin I think it's my day
So chill and let's groove at the Palladium Friday

[Chorus]

[Ahmad]
Kick it yo I'm still cool at the Palladium show
Yellin out yo's with my bros and steady clockin the hoes
But now it's two o'clock I'm ready to split
Ready to get in my Chevy to get home and start hittin it hard w/ Betty
Smith or Johnson, fuck it it don't matter
Just want to climb inside a bladder like a ladder cut the chit chatter
Cause I'm smooth, never obnoxious, chillin
That's why ya never live to hear me rushin while I'm bustin
Got honies if you got dividends or in a Benz, and I got both
So now you see me, taggin asses like graffiti
And on the next day I'll be rested, exhausted
Because I was naughty, but damn, that was a hell of a party

At the Palladium, yo it's a great show
At the Palladium is where everybody goes {repeat both lines 11X}

Follow me, get wreck
I make you bounce like a check
Mic-check, 1-2
Stand and watch me run through
A crew real easy, but that's only if I want to
Murder if I want it, stand and watch me flaunt this shit
I'm like the mafia, I keep on makin hits

And won't stop

Is it a lie that I must be a ruffneck
And wear a frown just to be down?
I kinda don't agree with bein (tough)
But you gotta be (rough)
It's either you claimin your hood, or you're not a gee
Forget about respect, I refuse to be the next guy
Fitted for a casket, either with it, or get blasted
I choose to gangbang, they give me a chrome-plated trigger
Say, ""If you got any heart, go rob that Mini-Mart, nigga""
Now look what I done did, damn, I had to be the big man
They're lookin at me shifty, better shut up 'fore I get slammed
Man, I'm not a thief, good grief, and I don't want to act hard
But then they said if I didn't do it, they was gonna gat, far
As I could see (I was gonna be)
The next new member of the crew, cause it's 8 of them and 1 of me
I don't want to do it, but I will

If I'm gonna be considered as a gee
And you gotta be (rough)

So I grab the deuce-deuce and go inside
I decide to prove in the Mini-Mart, ""Don't nobody move
Start fillin up the paper sack with loot, or I might shoot""
But things didn't go as planned, cause this man had his own gun
We're standin toe to toe, eye to eye, so I figured why not 
Pull the trigger? Put this nigga on the ground
It'll show that I had poise, then my boy'll know I'm down
But I didn't do it quick enough, or he thought of it first
Cause he blasted to the chest, and now I'm restin yellin, ""Nurse!""
And holdin on to life, or at least tryin to hold on
In a jailward wearin cuffs

I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little gigolo
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go taggin along
Naggin if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singin the blues
That be always tryin to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black, his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungaloes
Then switch to playin ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearin Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sportin BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminesce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school wish it'd blown up
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminescin and tellin
Bout when girls was bellin tight courderoys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eatin pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cuz when J.J. Fad hit
Supersonic it was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or, to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies, had poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes, had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces, cuz it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days, and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishin all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminesce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holdin
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbin
You steady bobbin your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went, from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but

Said she workin on a flick and
Could my click do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris
At Elysee Montmartre

And when cats be poppin game I don't hear what they sayin boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweatin on stage think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listenin to your homies they be leavin you blind

Yeah, so what you sayin I can trust you?

Gee, if I could only
Have my two front teeth
Then I could wish you

Ahora,"Yo sé que soy una desilusión
Yo sé que voy y por camino estoy
Y hoy así a mi ahí a mi me gusta así

A donde voy mejor no preguntes
Con quién estoy mejor no averigües
Así a mi ahí a mi me gusta así

Yo soy feliz también por la nariz
Yo soy así y también me gusta ahí
Y voy y estoy ahí disfruto el porvenir

No me mires si después no me queres
No preguntes si no lo queres saber
A mi así ahí a mi me gusta así

Hay chicos hay chicas y hay un souvenir
Con chicos con chicas yo me diverti

No preguntes si yo soy o no soy que
Eso ya fue no me vengas a joder
A mi asi ahí a mi me gusta asi

Ahuanta,"How could you lie to me
After all we've been through?
It's just so sad to see me in love with you.
I gave you all of me,
But still it wasn't enough for you.
Is this how love's supposed to be?
Now I'm trying to get over you.

[Chorus]
You ain't missin' me.
You won't pick up the phone and call.
You don't love me
Like you used to.
Tell me what is going on.
You got me standing here alone.
You don't know me
Like you used to.

Remember what you said
When you stepped up on the scene?
You got into my head,
Had me stressin' like a fiend
No, I just can't forget
How you put that thing on me.
I wish we never met;
This way I won't be lonely.

[Chorus]

You don't know me,
Know me like you used to.
You don't know me.

Schon immer Stacheldrähte zwischen uns
Es gab schon immer Lügen und Intrigen
Schon immer Zweifel und Ernüchterung
Es gab schon immer gute Argumente
Dafür, dass Schreckliches passiert
Aber immer, wenn ich an dich denke
Spricht so viel dafür

Dass das mit uns, das mit uns, das mit uns
Nur aus Liebe geschieht
Und es das mit uns, das mit uns, das mit uns

Schon immer einen, der Geschichte schreibt
Schon immer haben Menschen ihre Ängste
Und immer Träume einer besseren Zeit
Schon immer gab es jene, die aus Steinen
Keine Mauern sondern Brücken bauen
Verliert sich im Großen wieder mal das Kleine
Brauch ich dich nur anzuschauen

Für den, den ich ihnen verdank'

Ja, ja, ja, ich weiß, dass die großen Worte
Nur zwischen den Sätzen stehen
Momentaufnahmen
Scheinen die besten Szenen zu sein
Ich schreibe schöne Dinge
Wenn es scheiße geht
Muss ich mir eingestehen
Wir bauen uns auf, bauen uns zu
Bauen den Mist so hoch
Dass jeder ihn sehen kann
Manchmal nur
Dass ich irgendetwas erzählen kann
Klingt verrückt, aber nebenan
Machen sie das auch, also demnach
Gibt es keinen, der es nicht verstehen kann
Alle gehen nach
Gehen zu Grunde dran zu weit zu gehen
Halt die Welt an, weil sie sich ohne uns
Sowieso nicht weiterdreht
Muss mir eingestehen
Ich schreibe so so schöne Dinge
Wenn es scheiße geht
Doch was schreib ich dir, wenn es klar geht
Du bist so – ach, keine Ahnung –
Wie du da stehst
Dieser Ort, diese Zeit
Sie verlieren Relevanz
Wenn ich dich nur anseh', yeah

Weil das mit uns, das mit uns, das mit uns
Nur aus Liebe geschieht
Und deshalb denk ich, denk ich
Und deshalb denk ich, denk ich
Und es das mit uns, das mit uns, das mit uns

Uh
The streets of my city be gritty
Young niggaz pack plenty, and ain't never show no pity
Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion
Luxury cars, and this money got my full attention
School teachers and the preachers don't know what to teach us
They don't get a second look without them ghetto features
Created so the non pigmentated rated
Pornographic caught they children learn the words and say it
Save the monsters, but don't nobody know the lord
Status depends on the baddest shit you can afford
And look at me I'm in the middle of the confusion
Crime in my blood and I need a transfusion
Take it how you want to take it
I gotta twist and break it
Make it shine to distinguish from the ones who fake it
and if it comes out raw, and uncontrollable
Money's foldable, fuck a hip-hop quoteable
Nobody felt what I was feeling when I wrote this shit
Broke this shit, but that ain't new so I can cope with this
Hope it get better for those who don't get a chance
To advance, and dig the shit I be saying
You know what might make what I say a little clearer
If mothafuckers judge the one they see in the mirror

Watch me do my thang; I got these hos open
I'm ridin' presidential like the shit that I'm smokin'
Water wit' the work, Patron on my shirt
And a zip ain't shit; I need a quarter p of Purp
Gon' break it down, pass it all around
I can serve Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown
Them dope boys in this bitch, like let me buy that
Broke niggas in this bitch, like let me try that
I need a beat in the bitch; let me call Polow
Mr. Tennakey, I still get 'em for the low though
Shawty, light up the dro; I ain't ready to go
Can't ban me from the radio or fuck up my show, you know

Haters tryin' to ban a nigga mayne (It's okay!)
I bounce back; watch me do my thang (It's okay!)

Got the whole club leanin' wit' it, and body rockin'
Drunk drivin' in my Cut, dawg; I got my truck parked
Seventy Two Tennessee Titan, like what up y'all?
I'm home, boy, holla at ya homeboy
Better come quick; once I get it then it's gone, boy
First come, first serve; fuck what ya heard
I'm piecin' out my pack till I come up on a bird
Blow the smoke out my nose, pimpin' on these hos
They know me at the bank, love me at the jewelry stores
I play it how it goes; the butterfly doors
On them old school vogues with the chrome on the toes
These fuck niggas know that I will let it go

Dos arbolitos que, parecen gemelos
Y desde mi casita, los veo solitos
Bajo el amparo santo y la luz del cielo

Nunca están separados, uno del otro
Porque así quiso Dios, que los dos nacieran
Y con sus mismas ramas, se hacen caricias
Como si fueran novios que se quisieran

Arbolito, arbolito, bajo tu sombra
Voy a esperar que el día, cansado muera
Y cuando estoy solito, mirando al cielo
Pido pa' que me mande una compañera

Cuando voy a las siembras y a los maizales
Entre los surcos riego, todo mi llanto
Solo, tengo de amigos, mis animales
A los que con tristeza, siempre les canto

Arbolito, arbolito, me siento solo
Quiero que me acompañes, hasta que muera

Without touching the ground.
This ghost and vacant eyes deceive thee, they've come to take me without words and silence.
With a hand now crushing hope this late kiss,

You've come to make this my last night home.
I promised everything.
The necklace and those things you made will go with me everwhere I go.
Well, it's not the end.

I won't pretend it's impossible to fix what can't be broke.
I'm breathless and disconnected.
Take me home, so far away from here.
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year.

Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for you.
Now I've seen the world through eyes of bitter hate and lies and now I can't stand what I have become.

Was there something I missed?
Can you replay this kiss?
And the ghost sought by my side.
I'm breathless and disconnected.

Take me home, so far away from here.
Take me slow, I can't stand one more year.

I will return for youTake me home, so far away from here.

Take me slow, I can't stand one more year.
Take my breath away, wake me up today, 
I will return for you.
I won't forget those times we spent,

Cutting our silhouette,
Waking up nights again.
I am afraid because I'm open and undone.
I won't (I wont) forget (forget) those things you said,

A stab to the heart and head, 
Killing without an end.

The black eyes filled with the love
She wrote, 'I'm not insane, I'm sorry, I have to go'
And these walls are painted red
She put a bullet in her head

?Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye?
That's all she said

So what's killing you, is it the demon inside?
My God, you're turning blue, a suffocating lie
You're all I've got, you're all I've got
You're all I've got, you're all I've got

To complicate the dead

We're almost home
To see the silence break

I will fall

I will wait for this moment

To see the pain exists
In a world of lies

And everything

Fails a violent death

Visit me in hell tonight
And say
""if love exists, I will fall""

Became a witness to the suffering
Skinned alive, even took their soul
Close my eyes

By the moonlit darkness legend grows
Torture only child's play
Sworn to pledge and gather peasant slaves
Close my eyes

Hey, I wanna live forever
I'm in love with the dark horizon
In the moonlight I will bathe

She placed her hand on the heart and swore
Every last one of them
Will bring me youth, beauty, bliss galore
Close my eyes

And the basin was filled every night she dined
In the den of iniquity
And my sorrow filled reverie
Close my eyes

Hey, I wanna live forever
I'm in love with the dark horizon
I'm in love with madness

Hey, I wanna to live forever
I'm in love with the dark horizon
In the moonlight I will bathe

Death comes for us all, I won't wait

She bathed in blood that much you know
Of the demon Countess Bathory
Through these cemetery gates we go
With my eyes closed

Elizabeth, she will not bathe, will not bathe alone
Elizabeth, cannot save your soul
Elizabeth, will not bathe, will not bathe alone

This is the last time that 
I'll ever get to see your face alive,
They found you covered up in blood, 
Covered head to toe in blood 
And I know that everyday's a new day
And my dreams will never die,
They found you covered up in blood,
Covered head to toe in blood

She said live young and leave a wake of beauty, 
It's all I ever could have asked 
Should have asked from you, 
And I won't forget to write you 
When I get there soon

but the waves can wash
those troubles away

Should I give it all to you?

they say a smile is all I need
They all call you a bad boy,
but I know you'd
turn the tides for me

I run with you waiting for
what tomorrow brings
Oh, Delicious Way
That we take in this brave
(new world)
Can't wait run straight
into the sweet sky

Now my hand reaches to you,
I look into your eyes
and see the
Sparkle of love in your gaze,
glows like the summer
sunset waves
And the smell of your skin,
that sexy smell of beach and tan
Brings me close to you baby,
like the tide brings us in,
carry us away

melts into the horizon

Will come

There's still one thing inside,
That I cannot tell you

When can I ever start?

I'll say I love you
It will shine on through,
My love will shine out true
But give a little time,
I'm looking for a sign
You know I'm waiting
For my chance
So quiet now,
Winds whisper true to me
I feel a need,
To scream aloud
These things I feel
Celebrate this love
I can't reveal,
I can't show you
So here we are,
Together once again
You seem to walk
This little distance
From my side
Your face it seems so sad
I wonder what you hide,
I wanna be close to you
Secret of my heart,
Can you understand those parts
Hidden far away,
In a place I run to,
Doesn't everyone?
In my heart I know,
I must let our love grow
Why I can't say,
I know that I must find a way
To call out for my chance
Can I tell the truth?
No words come to my mind
They escape from my lips
To the clouds above

I can't hide anymore
'Cause I love you
I will be with you
Wherever you are
Can you feel my heart?

My heart began to feel
This love inside
Suddenly I found you,
Ever since can't get you
Off my mind
Since I realized these feelings,
I spend hours
Staring at the skies
In this new world I'm reborn,
I hope it never disappears
So the stormy waves
That circle around us
Never drown our love
Dream on sky high in these
Dreams our love will fly
Stay by my side
This feeling of our's has
Only begun now
Holding you my heart
Feels lifted to the clouds
Stay by my side
I can, because you see
Right to my soul babe
I'm no longer alone now,
I have your love to live for
Take me to your dream,
I will walk with you

Can you stay, don't ever leave,
Stay until dawn
Shines our love clear
It may feel a little too fast,
Hold my hand,
There is nothing to fear
And the sparks of love
From your eyes
Brings your heart closer to mine
Warmth of my hand in yours
I hope it will never disappear
So the love we share together
Won't be washed away by time
Dream on sky high our hopes
Will come true if we try
Stay by my side
Does the light of my love
Shine in you baby?
Even all of those times
I cried into your arms?
Stay by my side you can,
Because I know
You'll be there for me
""No need to cry,"" you tell me,
""I'll do it all for you
So take me to your dream,""
I'll share it with you

We walk into eternity
Stay by my side

Kadut hiljenevät aamun myötä
Valvoo kuu ja tahdon sinut unohtaa
Ei uni tule vaikka käsken
Huomasin sen vasta äsken
Soittaa tuuli yöllä biisin hiljaisen
Pois lähdit mukanasi liikaa
Vain seinät ikävääni huutaa
Odota, miksi karkuun juoksit niin varoen
Heräsin tähän kylmään aamuun, nyt palelen
Odota, miksi karkuun juoksit niin varoen
Heräsin tähän kylmään aamuun, nyt palelen
Sinä vielä junalaiturilla
Piiritit mut pikku suudelmilla
Toivon sun vielä joskus luoksein palaavan
Jäi välillemme liian monta

Ei saa ne meitä ikuisesti erottaa

Gonna ride this out,
My little black heart, breaks apart,
With your big mouth.

I'm useless, lazy, perverted,
And you hate me.

And everything, everything's my fault.

Went to the doctor, and I asked her,
To make this stop. (whoa)
Got medication, a new addiction,
Fucking thanks a lot.

I had to relapse, I'm bad at rehabs
It ruins everything. (whoa)

You can't blame me,

And everything, and everything's my fault.

And I'm a death threat haven't slept yet,
Baby why the wake up call
I'm the bad boy tell the tabloids
Everything's my fault.

Whoa whoa whoa yeah, write it write it,
Whoa Whoa whoa everything's my fault,

Aimee Fischer,"A-Tisket A-Tasket
A green and yellow basket
I bought a basket for my mommie
On the way I dropped it
I dropped it, I dropped it
Yes on the way I dropped it
A little girlie picked it up
And took it to the market
She was truckin' on down the 
Avenue without a single thing to do
She was peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground
A-Tisket A-Tasket
She took my yellow basket 
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I shall die
(Was it red?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it brown?)
No, no, no, no
(Was it blue)
No, no, no, no
Just a little yellow basket

But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Aimee Joy Weimer,"Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Aimee Mann,"Out in the faraway nearby
Can your hear my call
Out in the faraway nearby
I'm breaking down the walls
Till you're here to stay
Out from the faraway

Hot looks, cold words,
Don't know what it is you heard
But I didn't mean it,
If I said something wrong
Short nights, long dreams
Something happens in between
Then a weird feeling,
Like you're here but still you're gone
...Oo, heart beats
   Like a knock on the door
   But it sounds so faraway

In the faraway nearby
Can your hear me call
Out in the faraway nearby
I'm breaking down the walls
Till you're here to stay
Out from the faraway

Big whisper, small scream
But it's not like what it seems
Locked up in the open
Don't know which way to go
Deserts, oceans
Leaving footprints in the sand
Hoping that you'll see them
And wishing you'd follow
...And walk with me hand in hand, ya-ha
   And talk with me you got a plan, ah-ha
   And hold me, and hold me
   Don't stop...in the faraway nearby
   Can you here me call",The Faraway Nearby,1986
Aimee Mann,"I turn my back to the wind
To catch my breath,
Before I start off again
Driven on,
Without a moment to spend
To pass an evening
With a drink and a friend 

I let my skin get too thin
I'd like to pause,
No matter what I pretend
Like some pilgrim
Who learns to transcend
Learns to live
As if each step was the end 

Time stand still
I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
Time stands still
See more of the people
And the places that surround me now 

Time stands still

Freeze this moment
A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Experience slips away 
Experience slips away 

Time stands still

I turn my face to the sun
Close my eyes,
Let my defenses down
All those wounds
That I can't get unwound 

I let my past go too fast
No time to pause
If I could slow it all down
Like some captain,
Whose ship runs aground
I can wait until the tide comes around 

Time stand still
I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
Time stands still
See more of the people
And the places that surround me now

Freeze this moment
A little bit longer
Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

Make each impression
A little bit stronger
Freeze this motion
A little bit longer

The innocence slips away
The innocence slips away

Time stands still
Time stands still

I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
See more of the people
And the places that surround me now

Time stands still

Summer's going fast
Nights growing colder
Children growing up
Old friends growing older

Make each sensation
A little bit stronger

I will make you indispensable

Love you in spite of them
But now I'm happy if I
Never lose sight of them

Annex myself from you

Kept you waiting there too long my love
All that time without a word
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget
I'd regret

[Chorus:]
The special love I had for you
My baby blue

All those days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know
I would show

What can I do?
What can I say?
Except I want you by my side
How can I show you?
Show me a way
Don't you know the times I've tried

Guess that's all I have to say
Except the feeling just grows stronger every day
Just one thing before I go
Take good care baby, and let me know
Let it grow

I'm gonna change my life
Until it's just as tiny or

I dreamt that the world was flat
And all the colors bled away

You're half out of your wits
And though your wristwatch always works
Your necktie never fits

Now its so hard to pick the receiver up
And when I call, I never noticed you could be so small
The answer was under your nose
But the question never arose

I know it don't make a difference to you
But oh, it sure made a difference to me

When the head and heart of it finally elope

It wasn't me that you

I ought to have gotten it gone
I ought to have gotten it

You'll wake up

And she's got the river down which I sold her'

And Ray, what can I say
You don't know me and it's just wishful thinking
To keep myself from sinking
And hence, no evidence
To support any theory I have handy
That you could understand me

lost through indecision
With one of recognition
If so, then here I go

For the plans you're making, all the time you're taking 
Greet the next one with good cheer 
Won't you dear, as you ring the chime 
Just because its Christmastime 
And on the tree all the ornaments glow 
Tinsel will cover where the branches don't grow 
There's lights on all the houses 
Spouses with their spouses 
Children playing in the snow 
One in the swing and one upon the horse 
Keeping on tracks another matter of course 
That's the great divisor you are now the wiser 
Maybe just a bit less so 
Touch and go til you stop on a dime 
All alone at Christmastime 

Its Christmas again, December is here

Aimee Mann,"At least you know
You were taken by a pro
I know just how you feel
She talked a perfect game
Deflecting all the blame
You took the jack
And changed the flat
And got behind the wheel,
Now you're
Driving sideways
Taken in by the scenery
As you're propelled along
And your companion
Will not help you to navigate
For fear she may be wrong

And you will say
That you're making headway
And put it in overdrive
But you're mistaking speed
For getting what you need
And never even noticing
You never do arrive
'Cause you're
Driving sideways
If you roll down the window you'll see
You're where you don't belong
And your companion
Will not help you to navigate
For fear she may be wrong

And you're powered by
The hopeful lie
That it's just around the bend
And when this, by default
Comes screeching to a halt
Let's hope that you
Know what to do
To start it up again

Driving sideways

When it's done, we'll deny it was love

Will be there with its telescope eye

Watching over silverlake

Like it was doomed and hopeless as a suicide pact
