Pharoahe Monch,"OK
Yeah
Ugh

Call me the hitman
It's kind of hard ain't it?
With most fear becoming the game
We became it
So I painted the masterpiece in this container
Is gotta lithograph so it was glass so frame it
Say it again
The hitman
The hitman
Say it

Some people say I'm extreme broadcast to beams
Live to the means
Screaming as Jimmmy Ivy
Corrupt as Don King
Boxed into the ghetto
To be the champion of bling
Industry is the arena the internet is the ring
You trained the artist from queens
Swing me at the fiends?
Def Jam supreme team the same thing
Except more it's more critical now
It's digital Cocaine
The goal is to control every individual brain
Like Cadillacs for contracts in the sixties
The contract 3-60
The trick?
Switch to degrees of 3 6s
You see who receives the riches
Which is the reason why they is only a few moguls
Clover the pioneer left in a chokehold
Enough to make the individual 
Watching these old folks get fucked for their vocals
Say it again
The hitman 
The hitman 

Call me the hitman
It's kind of hard ain't it?
With most fear becoming the game
We became it
So I painted the masterpiece in this container
Is gotta lithograph so it was glass so frame it
Say it again
The hitman
The hitman
Say it

If you are not performing felatio for radio rotation
What's the ratio for radio play at your station?
If you are not paying to play your record is dead
Puts a whole new spin on Radiohead
They gotta 1000 plays a week
We selling the same units
They put their best rep up
The couldn't stand next to it
People wanna relate they wanna connect to it
Here's a lyrical check
Is this enough for you to flex to it
Huh?
Or do you need more clues
Should I be more black
Would that change your view?
Should I dye my hair blonde should my eyes be blue
Just a couple more questions I mustered up for you
These are 11 inch shoes you can't fill those
I make headlines like corduroy pillows
And probably get banned from television and marketing
Targeted by music industry the politic provocative

Call me the hitman
It's kind of hard ain't it?
With most fear becoming the game
We became it
So I painted the masterpiece in this container
Is gotta lithograph so it was glass so frame it
Say it again
The hitman
The hitman
Say it
Say it
The hitman

It's kinda hard
Let's release sex tapes so we can become stars
Nude photographs of titties and asses
Impress the masses
I thought she was supposed to be so passive
Now you just another ass in the air with an asterisk
Cell phone songs, you'll never be a classic
They call that remastering?
What does it have to be so drastic?
Chemical skin pill makes it sound more plastic
Follow the program man
Stick to the classics
They want Slap stick
Before it all goes tisk-tasket
This might take a few you listen
Before you grasp it
With the hit",The Hitman,2011
Pharoahe Monch,"[Chorus]
I'm too high to get over, too low to get under
(Let my people go)
I'll make you feel so good you don't need to wonder
(Let my people go)
I'll take away the storm cloud, the rain and thunder
(Let my people go)
(Yeah, somebody say)
(Let my people go)
(Huh, somebody say)
(Let my people go)

Spit miraculously, sip draculas blood exsist for centuries
The body chemistry mends wounds, heals injuries
My ministry leaves the industry in a tail spin
Huh,I push the envelope like US mailmen
Huh, we need a leader who is not mischievious
Devious, from satan's grip to lead us
Won't retract the facts then act facesious
In fact the racks are packed with facts that teach us
Reach us, easily leave MC's speechless
Read from the palm of the non-believers
Some of them wonderin how they become underachievers
One of the best the perinial key note speaker
I got it, You want it, come get it so i'll flaunt it
And I will show you away
So let my people go today

[Chorus]

There trying so sell lies to the people huh
Knowing it's hard times for the people huh
I'll knock your ass unconcious
Put it up on Youtube,then film the sequel so it's free for the people huh
Go on ahead and download it I'ma teach you how
P is a prophet, a pastor, a preacher
With undisputable logic for blasting through your speaker now
I'm tyng to learn your monk ass, I'm trying to reach you now
But still your like who's this dude
Return to fix, shape the game like Rubics cube
Chick seems brolic now ruthless too
Spit the gospel on wax, what he chooses to do
Damn
Open your eyes man you've been bamboozled
By the usual plans hit up the middle like Stan Musial
If y'all are telling me todays music is suitable and appealing
Then I'm telling you the feelings are not mutual

[Chorus]

Young children before you pass on up
Who wants to see the crack of your ass and see your butt
You need to let it off, the people go
Past the collection plates and give me all of my dough
And if your wondering whats under my robe
An old rusty ass .38 snub nose
And just because your thinking my shit don't work
That's a (Gunshot)
Go on and try robbing my church

Pharoahe Monch,"In my heart and in my mind

I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

Look man, do not get my block pissed, we'll blast your brain
Two hundred thousand dollar whips and chains
Crooked cops, Crips, crack cocaine
2Pac, Chris, I'm still feelin' the pain
Seven year old girl, shot and slain?
What does it all mean? We go insane
In the struggle, the stress make him asthmatic
We're I'm from, we do not eat organic (talk about it)
You see my mama can not afford Whole Foods
She break fast for the bread, call it soul food
Where I come from ? let it breathe
Where I come from, no one runs when funds run low in lump sums
We chose to dump dumb dumb but live dunn dunn
We livin hum drum in the slums
Where scum conceal stun guns
The words mum for fun son
Conundrums, ain't pretty!
In this cess pool called New York Shitty
I call it that cause it smell like shit!
Walk around hunchbacked or you might get hit (talk about it)
I knew a nigga sold crack to his moms
That same motherfucker sold crack to his kid
Lookin like three hundred comin back from his bid
Like ""Pharoahe, let's get this money for real""

In my heart and in my mind
I'm gon' win, in due time
Show me the way, give me a sign
And I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

He said ""Pharoahe, let's get this money up""
What the fuck, what you need me to holla at Steve Rifkin?
Hit him, ""Escape from New York"" like Snake Plissken
I told you from the gate that you needed more marketing
And these major labels are not listenin'
Stood in a B boy stace, teeth glistenin'
From the gold in his mouth, the summer breeze was whistlin'
I contemplated my retort, eyes fixed in
On a crucifix around his neck, I guess he was Christian
Just then, the police siren had pitched in
To the soundtrack of the hood, so I spoke with conviction
Spoke as if I was 6'10"" with thick skin
Put a little bass in my voice like pitchmen
Cause where I come from
Where I come from, we all come from
Sky, moon, the stars, the Earth and Sun
Multiple skin tones, your blood is one
The pen is the ammo to my automatic gun
Bring to fruition what I write to get me out of the slums
And I'm a shine, sh-sh-shine, shine, shine
Shine like the Sun, the world is mine
Each line of speech designed to transcend time
And reach, the unborn to transform your mind
And I'm a shine, shine

In my heart and in my mind
I'm gon' win, in due time
Show me the way, give me a sign
And I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine
I'm gon' shine, I'm gon' shine

Now New York if ya in the house and ya turnin' it out
Without a doubt, know what I'm talkin' about
Just scream and shout and everybody say
Sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

Now Detroit with the funky beats, gettin' wild in the street
See the mark of the beast, say fuck the police
What up X?
Shine, sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

Chi-town with the funky sound, soul by the pound
Just get on down with the w-w-woo! w-w-whoa!
Say sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

West coast, side with the most
Holdin your toast, ya brag, ya boast
What the ?, what the whoa!
Everybody say, sh-sh-sh-shine, shine, shine

Pharoahe Monch,"Please do not run too fast
Stay off of the leaves
Do not play in the grass
And climb the trees
You can’t breathe
Let alone you get stung by bees
Lord Jesus, you're chest just might freeze up
13 months old with a lung disease
It almost took my life twice
Brought me to my knees
A system not designed for you to achieve
Release ? not every line will teach you to seize
But I roll to the top of my class like Cream
I'm like the Lakers in the 80's
So worthy I'm Kareem
Not on TV but my sweet 16s
Married the mic I love supreme
Exorcism I have for the American Dream
I am still standing
I am still here

[Chorus]
Still standing
I am standing
Standing
Still standing
I am standing
Standing

I have no dead body to grave
Never been ? double my expectancy
Stills standing like the pledge ?
My heart disintegrated in a million pieces
Listen this is life ?
Best speak multiple languages for unspeakable reason
? many places I have never been
? reach for the stars

[Chorus]",Still Standing,2011
Pharoahe Monch,"[Chorus]
We are renegades. This means W.A.R.
16s bust to break unjust laws
Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause
Renegades, never slaves, this means war
100% uncut raw
Fuck limited freedom, nigga we want more
The machine is corrupted down to the core
Rebel army, muthafucka!
This means war

I got a middle finger for mass media mute the news
'Cause when the gun draws received a million views
Which gives me the right to break the rules
Say fuck the radio if the people can't pick and choose
While BET gets screwed by Viacom
The new revolutionary is shyaman
It's not brush fire rap, it's five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions, mysticism call me Mr. Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
'Cause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated, the water got lead in it
Population control, make the babies sick
All these 5G chips, are you for 86?
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And we are on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime

[Chorus]

Alhamdulillah's a spiritual calling
My alternate and we are still mourning
It's not a documentary about global warming
This is lunar explosions of global warning
So when the moon leaves you can't tell night from morning
Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans
It's not your average rap recording
this is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons
While the American dream remains dead and dormant
My stimuli's supplied by my endorphins
The mind's eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
It's not The Doors, man
I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins
With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executive's rooms where they walking on all fours man
Canines standing upright amongst you
Hated by swine, spreading the H1N1 flu
On some rabies shit, are you for 86?
Population control, make the babies sick
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And I am on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime

Created a mask that allowed me to breathe

I dreamed of candy-coated cars and panties that go with bra's
Hurricanes named Sandy, I'm floating on Noah's ark, what?
Police'll bleed blue cause he staying true to the uniform
Dennis Rodman in North Korea looking for unicorns (that's ridiculous)

For ever lasting fame I will maim those who change the gun laws
Cause post traumatic stress disorder, ask any vet I've worked with
My purpose catching bodies like safety nets at the circus

Ooh, listen to the way I slay your crew
Damage, damage, damage, damage

Nigga I will twist your liver like Oliver (TWIST)
Scratch your name off my calendar
See that was me thru a silencer
What you just heard was a .44 caliber
Now you can fill in the blanks
I will pillage your town
Killing them with Dillinger rounds
Nigga fill in the clip cause I'm willing to flip
See I'm sort of certified, I'm fortified live
You would be mortified if I would put on screen what I've seen
Horrified holy Bibles, rivals, vital organs
Little bitty baby bodies, bridal gowns coffins
Morphine, gang bang, gangrene, slauson, swap meet
Meet greet, pop I don't sleep, I don't stop
I love hate, hate cops
That's why I laugh when you pull it
I'm motivated and crass
I'm so elated when I see them on the news (you fuckin' pigs!)
They flying the flag half mass
See there's no need for conversation
When we're discussing the bullet's point of view

After dark we get sparked up and pull triggers
You gotta speak orangutang slang or pull capers

See in the jungle we often rumble for loot
Some of us just stumble around high off the booze, shoot
You get shot, shit
Play humble like last year when the cheetahs tried to catch my uncle
When you come through, you could get bumped too
If you don't got at least 4 to 5 gorillas amongst you
The bigger tree hit 'em shocked and amazed
41 shots hot, take you out in the blaze
And if not, they ship your ass to the Bronx in a cage
Into the island where you spend your time counting the days

They make a killing and build new lands in the jungle

You don't wanna invest your life in a cess pool

You need to take your monkey ass off to school
And learn about Botswana, Sudan and Ghana
Mozambique and speak of pride and honor
I understand sometimes we all feel fenced in
But utilize your mind to define dimensions
Just then I lost the little monkey's attention
As he stared into the distance focusing on squinting at a
Beautiful gazelle that was grazing in the grass with
Muscular legs and a rhinoceros ass
But in the least case scenario I did try to tell him
Hit him with some signs that was a little compelling

An hourglass without sand
Suspended within space and time
I walk a thin line
Amongst the masses all alone
A furnished house with no one home
I see through walls that’s hard to climb
I’m losing my mind

No medicaid, no medication
Thinking you're better off dead
Instead should have been dedicated to education
I spin, the cylinder on my revolver
I spin, the cylinder
Would someone explain who’d leave a dick in charge of a bush
Of a colon I’m screwed, saw more war than Warsaw Poland, viewed
An infant’s insides, outside of his body
Inside of a place of worship, ungodly
Out cries tears “Dear God, where are we?”
That’s what I scream towards the skyline but probably
No one can hear a word of what I was saying
Insurgents surged in the temple where I was praying
Now flashbacks wake me abruptly when police pass by
Lights flash, if i could only put the past on a flash drive I’d
For peace of mind, install an external drive
So I’d be more driven internally to survive I’m

My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health
It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth
Void, I defected, employed self annoyed
Went independent, enjoyed stealth
Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac
The rent’s cheaper in the ghetto but you can’t go back
So I, suspend the cylinder on my revolver
Then, maybe let it draw blood like Chupacabra
And dissolve into the abyss, without evolving
Instead of revolving around the habitual problem solver
Research like, George Washington Carver
But no answer so my mantra is to deal with it in and chart then
Part, instead of being incredibly defiant
Peddle through revenue issues I’ll do it for medical science
It’s better to be level-headed than to regret it and pious
Settling for life without sun-shine, never vibrant, I’m

When I drink away the pain I guzzle
My life is like a complicated mathematical puzzle, for real
Seen death twice, it's ugly motherfucker man
But you conversate with him when you suffering
He said, ""Let go of the pain, you'll never rock the mic again
Your choice slug to the brain or 20 Vicodin
I kinda likened it to Ortho Tri-cyclen
Disturbing the natural cycles of life and it's trifling
Fuck what you heard, less money more problems
4 years removed from the game with no alblum
I put the gun to my brain, but first I wrote a note to explain
Put the Luger in my head, and these are the words that I said

Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms were sure to fall
And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all
Like broken limbs of trees that's lost its leaves to Winter's wind
Spring will come again
Live

When your cerebral ceases to administer silence
And the only faith you have left is a CD
From a singer who had a son with Christopher Wallace
Tomorrow is never
Hope is abolished
Mind and soul have little to no unity
Life threw a brick through my window of opportunity
My immune system lacked diplomatic immunity
When asthma attacks the black community
Where do you go from there?
Long walk, short pier
Thought I knew all it was just to know of the ledge
Till I glanced down at all ten toes on the ledge
Before I heard what sounded to me like a pledge
Emerged from the darkness, and this is what it said
Do not despair, breathe, fight
For there is more life to live, believe
More insight to share, retrieve
Was the dead at the illustrious
Exhale, hold, inhale, receive and live

Sure as kingdoms rise the same kingdoms were sure to fall
And wash away like memories, as if they weren't there at all

Mega, reality, tera, giga
Grand Theft Auto, modern day Mickey and Mallory Small
But I'm sick enough to walk into an art gallery and piss on a Picasso
Crack statues, rub my balls on her face, shit on it, and throw it at you
So when the beat intensifies
I become emotionally desensitized
Like, once I slapped a rapper with mace
Then I spit acid in his face, after he rinsed his eyes, no wait
I actually grew five times my size grabbed
Ma$e by the thigh and slapped a rapper with him
Now that's practicing sacrilegious activism
Attack is for battle, and practical rap with wisdom
Actually, it's pragmatic capitalism for actors

Philanthropic
Cause I'm trying to see man united without referencing UK soccer teams
My philosophy prophecy, the opposite of Mephistopheles I incited isosceles
Sent to Earth to warn of environmental atrocities, and nobody can copy me
Stop, it's not possible but probable that it's only philosophical mockery, strange
Change copper to gold, switch properties, bang!
Stay on top of the globe, flip monopolies, aim
Take stock in the soul, spit properly

That extended clip on my hip sits awkwardly
I'm diabolical, follicle triggers that I cock and squeeze

My psychiatrist waive the doctor fees
When I wave the pistol and say listen quick, watchin' me so I can breathe

Of drugs for performance enhancement
And it's tough taking so many chances
But I've been a bad seed from the womb, they call me ovary cancer
And I got an ugly heart, although I'm totally handsome

It's been a long time since I put Kelis out
I made a VA put it on a honey gran B-side
Pen for the O, glass for the beach house
And you can see me getting head in the house of B-south
Ex-time a man can say they feel a man again
Ask to me do I want to send again so woman hood
They's growing me on watching hills girls 
Don't scratch my lou and 
I deep dog yo, all day a man and when a man
I touch your girls can yelled again
She said she feel for live so she can breathe
But don't smoke but girl I keep bump man's weed
I chains closes same hoes and Chapman goes
Gotta pull on my chains low cause man a thing goes
My house no they can't see their look vacancy
But drink is my home of my niggas my ADT
See my too dog nears and they do like knees
And you've never seen a diamond like this
I don't visit Jacob my stuff is male enough
So what you think you tell enough
Man my long is enough so he can Beverly nears

Why y'all cats know the abstract nigga with the attitude
Pass the booze, and let's build on it
I'm rolling in a Cadillac with the grill fronted
I ain't even smoke no mo' but I feel blunted
Yo I'm toking on the freedom
Stepping to the A.M., cats be taking in the P.M.
Tell the players I'm the G.M.
Told my team let me get my plays straight, I'ma feed them
They need me like I need them
See the streets is bleeding
Had to meet with my mind on how I could divined
Stay on my climb
I'm grinding, 'til I get blue balls
Everyday, same shit new star
Don't make me act like where I come from because he grew tall
There's a place that to run from it if you neutral
Hustlers and vogues, customers and smokes
I kiss the sky feeling high off the stuff that I wrote

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high

I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go into a thrift shop
Connect, get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gonna get that kick-a-box
Make sure that bitch knock
If you gonna get that glock don't be scared to big shot
Hip Hop is changing, why y'all want me to stay the same?
Sorta like Barkley on how I see the game
I recognize game like a scout
Hey yo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I ain't about that
Messing with no other man's women
Because of jealousy then a man go under
Understand a man and his mental
Listening to Joan Mitchell
With the fan and the window
Can it be so simple then?
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberland's
I want a Rover, but I'm thinking long range
I ain't switch over, I just made my own lane

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high
I got the right to feel high

Like a pimp to a hoe I connect to the track
I feel it in my neck and my back
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to the light
I'm trying to do better
I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweaking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I train days to rip emcees, I'm peaking
But I still gotta get that cheese
You on some monkey ball damn chimpanzees
Mobbing through the Chi-Town to feel the breeze yo

I want to ride in my car, smoke my shit
Keep my head high, let the chrome spin

The crack-head rappers better just say no
Before I turn stupid and back the heat slow
Lay and wait for niggas in the back street yo
Weak flow, take your shit like I'm coming to Repo

Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side

Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit

Even Eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name

Recognized the underworld since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw Crocket & Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big when they televised that raw
My mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down the stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Called the 'roin made me colder
I see the villains' impact, now that I'm older
Ignorant fool, views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money, keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session they handed out the rules
So I grab a tape and related to life's cruels
The meaning?
Pusha T's more than the semen
Not just a rap name, more so like a damn shame
Nothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap, and I ain't lost my past
S*** could get hairy, I could lose my-self in a flash
N****s'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that ""Mask""

I even went by the book at first
Until I realized 9 to 5 wouldn't quench my thirst, so I
Start my mission, leave my residence
Mama knew that I child like me had better sense
But something had to give, that's real I had to live
I chefed that soft white and pumped from her crib
Scouts honor started with my grandmama
Who distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds, I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate surrounding the street
If I was you, I'd be trynna get down with me
But no, see these n****s know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak many times back to back
And still feel belittled sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown a** rappers who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it however they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's no longer your favorite
Hey, I one of the greats, I can't lie
I mean great to the point I'm concerned I might die

Fuck the money and the white sand and shit
When it's said and done you gunna understand this shit

Your man talking about Hummers and little cars
That only fit in his little house little garage
His lifestyle is just a little mirage
He the type of cat that never had a menage

Backrub, you know a little massage
Tight shit you get when you Head Nigga in charge
I'm in the Rolls listening to the bars

I held my own, ever since I held that zone

Now I put it in verses, it was worth it

So then we tried - I'm siging it slow
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes - and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear ya ass up (tear ya ass up)

Trying to be the best girlfriend you could be
But still you sneak and look at me, and girl I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gon' call and ask how it was

Suppose you know to call me 'Lo
But you can call me The Soul Machine
Watch â?? Hey yeah â?? See what I mean?

Four million flavors of the southern soul flower
But the power that you get from the heart of a human being
Only the mind is mechanic the dynamic happens
When the divine starts to intervene

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
But ""Come save me,"" said this last fiend
'Cause the beginning and the ending and the misassumption
Will make 'em move something in between

Trying to catch joy in other's jar
And yes by far I'm so much further than they are

[Chorus]
Turn the radio on, let the music play
If I could I'd dance my life away
And if you can't seem to find any words to say
Make a joy-ful noise, fifth around it's another day

When you see me you would know that you saw me
Because he always got on his game and his good shoes
Difficult to stop creating can't wait
But they came to see God then great tell 'em the good news

Isn't it ironic how it feels so good?
But I was only just singing the blues
I wouldn't open my mouth about it at all
If I thought that I was only just singing the fool

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Maybe 'Lo you should lighten up
I really would if I could

But I really don't think that anybody shell out enough
And I really think true wealth is home and happiness and health
A little cash and you'll need nothing else
And as far as me being good, I can't help myself
Hey

So when you really really need you some soul
I mean dead serious damn near bout to die bout some
Don't be too proud to turn your radio way up loud
Close your eyes and have fun

I used to feel like God was gonna call me too soon
The reason why I had to have my son
And every time I've ever opened my mouth and said something
Bout living was to earn my ones

Have mercy if I seem to be heavy
I don't mean to be heavy
Wait I'm almost done
And God can truly work a miracle â?? Look at me

Isn't it obvious that I'm one?
And I sing because I'm happy
And I sing because I'm free (I'm free)
And this my own little thing yes I agree

But don't you want your kids to grow up to be just like me?

I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Bo$$ Dogg, yeah I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hanging out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much you thought I was a D-J
""Two!"" ""one!"" ""yep, three!"" 
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See I specialize in making all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live!
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a living room full of fine dime brizzles
Waiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the Shizzle
G's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo

I'm a Bad Boy, with a lotta ho's
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real Bo$$
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun so you want to pop back?
AK47 now n****, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you I'm only here to twist you
Pistol whip you, dip you then flip you
Then dance to this motherf***ing music we crip to

You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me trust me
(You ain't seen bouncin' back)

I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than batman and robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling they business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
I know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep your chin up
'Cause sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

You keep bumping me against the wall

No matter what happened that's only once it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then it's shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble we didn't want learn or
Sometimes we be getting in trouble we ain't gon' see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take 'em in stride and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody said fool you better keep on rapping
Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happin'
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life will be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

You keep bumping me against the wall

You heard about me, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you changed ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complainin' and forgot what you was cryin' bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And real as ever so I hope you proud of me

Oh you got a gun so you want to pop back?

Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
You're family's crying, now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you

Uh! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Uh! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
It's my world! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Ya heard?! (hah! hah! hah! hah-hah!)
Real Talk pha-real, ask my nigga Pharrell, ya heard?! Haha!

[Verse - Fabolous]
You see I do's what I choose on shiny twenty-two's
Be's what I please in brand new Bentleys
That's right stupid! Soon as they couped it, I went and scooped it
Now I'm on the move, on the move
Running the City, something like Diddy
At 150, wit the gun and the cd (wow!)
Niggaz who be hunting for biddies
Never seen nothing this pretty, and they lying if they say they do
They bring the playa through like they bring the mayor through
They know the way I do is what the AK'll do
Listen here we can disappear for a day or two
Bet you come back smiling like Mase, see'mon!
Like Case say 'Touch Me, Tease Me'
But the Top Dawg tell her it must be easy
I'm in the white cut E-Veezy
Ashton Cuts be freezy, it must be easy!

[Chorus - Pharrell Williams]
See I ain't keep going tit for tat your ass ma
If your ass ain't talking right
Well you can stop acting boughie, asking for sushi
If fucking ain't your plans tonight, ya hear me?!
See I ain't keep going tit for tat your ass ma
If your ass ain't talking right
You can go back to being groupie in your Dapper Dan Gucci
If fucking ain't your plans tonight, ya hear me?!

[Fabolous] Girl move it like! Girl move it like!
Girl move it like! Girl move it like.

[Verse - Fabolous]
You see I bop to the beat of the streets since I was born
Move like they would in the hood until I'm gone
The girls know my paper denim, keep paper in em
As soon as they change the shapes I'm in em
The BAPEs they send em wit snake skin in em
To the kid in the city wit the scrapers in em
(Nowww!) I move to left like.. then I move to the right like
They follow the need to follow my lead
Do the do then swallow my seed, like
You can leave the spot you cramped in
Live in the Hamptons like a champion
Refuse to choose the, use the loser
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter
If you want to do the kick it then go wit a punter

[Chorus]
[Verse - Fabolous]
You see the white's so bright it's hard to be polite
The yellow's so mellow I have to act ghetto
Hello, my name is - fuck that! I'm famous
why'all ain't the same as, F-a to the be	
I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?
Like - get me on or get me gone
It's at least 22's that they sit me on
I'm in the Ice Cream shoes, nice gleam too
Crack the button up so the ice beam through
You could wake up wit regrets, or wake up in a jet
Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl

I see you smiling shorty, I see it in your eyes

I'm so VIP, and Notorious for doing it B.I.G. girl
You ain't gotta see ID, I'm a rich young man
Clean button up wit the rich young pairs
Out of you young ladies, which one can - do it to the beat y'all
Young niggaz get funny, just to get a name
So you know I came with the heat y'all!
You know I got a little money, got a little fame
But you know I came from the streets y'all
If you want to act funny, I can do the same
And when Pharrell let the beat fall
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all

Roll another one, let's get high y'all

From the high heels to low cuts
To the dude in the fast car wit the slow strut girl
They want to catch J. Jackson
But the money's longer than a stretch Maybach Benz
They say I'm fly enough to do better
But pimp enough to not give a fuck
They say I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck
Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back
I get my young man on, then the young man gone
Let's get money again, and even if you ain't
I'll make you feel twenty again, so!
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
For the young sexy and fly y'all
Take another shot, let's get high y'all

I'm too young to be sprung
And you can tell I'm too blessed to be stressed

She got angel eyes, wit the baby face
(But she's a freak though)
I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my name
(But she's a freak though)
They keep talking about you
Because they, can't keep up with your pace
You're my, super freak! super freak!
You're my, super freak!

[T.I.]
My momma taught me, everything fine ain't the finest
And everything that shine ain't a diamond
They say that change come wit time and I'm finding
That most bitches take your kindness for blindness
Yeah it feel good laying her beside you
Digging deep, ol' nine up beside you
But we can't kick out in public, gotta hide you
Cause all my partners in the hood done tried you
It's true that you can't turn a hoe into a house wife
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
They say that you a freak I'm thinking that they bout right
Because that pussy's so good and your mouth tight
A pretty face, slim waist, and her stout nice
Juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
She super sexy, got a nigga thinking bout a wife
Wearing all white, being wit her for life

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
The main thing making niggas judge you
Is the same thing that make me want to love you
From the smell of ya hair, I want to hug you
To the way you yell ""give it to me"" when I fuck you
Plus you ain't tripping off a nigga cause he thugging
That's why I'm twice as happy as relationships that wasn't
But my partner say you tricking with his cousin
But nevermind, I don't listen they be bugging
They find it hard to understand how could T.I.P. love
This girl, when her man is out at strip clubs
Maybe cause T.I.P. girls leaving wit girls
And in the morning they'll be waking up with six girls
They don't know we more like homies when we pick girls
Why you worried bout it, he ain't gotta make you his girl
Fuck what he think about you, I think you the shit girl
Make me want to bring another kid in the world

[Chorus]

[T.I.]
Now I been told every nigga in the streets know
She ain't nothing but a freak ho
But when I look in her pretty eyes, I don't see it though
Now she done showed me some shit that I ain't seen before
But what we do behind closed doors is for me to know
All in all I've decided I'm a keep her though
I'm a fucking grown man, what I'm creeping for?
Just try me 'bout her folk, that's what I'm toting heaters for
I'd die by that for her a real good reason though
That's how I feel, let my partners and my momma know
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
I disrespect, she is selfish, she don't hide it
Though she may have been a tad misguided
All she need is a little affection, a lot of direction
A nigga wit a constant erection
And I done wasted plenty time contemplating second guessing
Procrastinating, I want to buy a ring and pop the question

[Verse - Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo! Met this bitch by the name of Subie
She was a bad bitch, she had a big ol' booty
She got me setting up when I went to the projects
Bad ass bitch she was the one to holla at
Had another bitch by the name of Pricilla
You know that bad bitch, she taste like vanilla
In my car looking good like that
Getting money, making records, down with rap
Saying to myself, no one can defeat me
I got my dick out, see'mon bitch beat me!
Let that shit out, go down your throat
Nigga like me, never miss a note
If rain I got coats so I can't get soaked
Make a nigga know I take's that dough
Get high like Supa Fly
I'm the best, that's the shit now I don't know why
[Chorus]
[Verse - Pusha T]
Bitch please! Come live out your fantasies
Dollars and diamonds, like on my Ice Creams
1K jeans wit belt and white tee
I sling white balls give fiends a pipe dream
Well in this scene in my british queen
The ignition's on the left but yes it's the right theme
Engine full of horses, chariots the king
The be	's in the middle like it's tittie fucking the wings
Pornographic, the voice so drastic
Without a +Reasonable Doubt+ I'm +classic+
Cake-aholic the same way - that Dame Dash is
But I bakes my cakes, bag 'em up in plastic (UHH!)
Halloween 'em up, trick yeah I treat 'em up
Lou' Vuitton a toe, watch how the hoes eat 'em up
Ma I said I'm finger licking good, ah yes we Re
As if invisible Juice, you niggaz can't see me!

If you ain't sweating there's something wrong, girl!

If you ain't sweating there's something wrong, girl!

If you ain't sweating there's something wrong, girl!

If you ain't sweating there's something wrong, girl!

[Verse - Malice]
She so fine, all she need now is a baller
Who better fit the bill? I myself, I'm a starter
In the game, you could tell by the charter
G4, Lear, or the Yacht in the harbor
Mama come to papa, don't it feel at home here?
All the comforts of it, you ain't got a care
Don't love me wit your heart, love me from a far
Now sit, look pretty like you came wit the car
Diamonds in the ear lobe, wrapped in the mink
Condo chillin, I be tickle pink
Not worrying bout the next bitch or what people think
If I say they don't exist, POOF the extinct
Mama - no! we don't need the drama
All we need is south beach, puffing on Habanas
You just strike a match girl, do your man a honors
Next week Cali, we up in Las Palmas

Like it don't cost shit, that's why I'm Tha Boss bitch
Got a million worth of cars, bought a million dollar house
From making words rhyme out my million dollar mouth

You can see the watch gloss when you see Tha Boss walk
I keep my lips closed cause it cost when I talk
I'm so flashy, rims so glassy
Pull the dropper out, we gon show them boys nasty

Hood rats harrass me, I don't want the drama
They wanna get put up so they could be me baby mama
But I'm a chill, I'd rather work wood wheel
And throw them vogues and grills on candy automobiles

I'm still tipping on vogues, closing candy blue doors
From the old caddy coupe to the new blue Rolls
I'm from the hood living good, so I'm pimping
I ain't got my plaque in yet, but I'm already platinum

You ain't saying shit, you're weak and prom too
I'm making money making beats, and plus I pop too
Playa chill, don't get ya body chopped & screwed
Have ya sucking through a straw just to opt for food

About face and walk our way on too
Let the ladies in here do what they gon do
Seem like my wrist been dipped in diamond fondue
It's not just me, my man got one too

I got my mind on cash and my grind on smash
Nowadays I gotta count my money by the bags
I done ran through the rags, now I get to see riches
Went from having rats to the superstar bitches

Used to never leave out them Northside blocks
Now I'm going to parties in Miami on yachts
And the grind don't stop, everytime you hear me rapping
Without the plaque in, I'm still already platinum

It feels so good ma, ma to be platinum

The kind of girl, you'd walk the whole world for
Put her on your back and just carry

Untouchable, she's got her own force field
Sooner or later someone will get at her
If I don't someone else will

Scientists say that she's the second sunshine
And now my life is sweeter than berries
I guess if we have sex our love will turn to wine

If I turn my back then someone will get at her

Picture this ice and how it glitter for y'all
Now don't you feel claustrophobic when that chick is involved?

We fuss but we take it one day at a time

Open my mind and words come out

But the hustle quicker so they cop a fo' on the split
Now they got enough money where they can go get a brick
It's on, ain't nothin' gon' stop us now
Gotta look at 24's while they watch us now
Spinners rollin' up the block while they pump out noise
But they always get into it with the jump out boys
And why? Take a look at all the people that got dubs
You ain't legitimate, you out here servin' them rocks up
I know you want the radio and screens to pop up

But the moment so loud when a dead man hug you
He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin' your arms
You gon' be lowered in your arms
Cryin' to open the jar, and to add injury to insult
You're smokin' your life away
Look at me, big car big house big jewels
All that came out my backpack
You ain't gon' do it, it ain't gon' work, you ain't gon' prove it
Even though that hurt, I just skated past that
Look, everybody got dreams about Ki's
Chains full of ice with S after the V's
Horse on the hood, a grill full with the B's
Dangling your feet in San Turin-y breeze

Soundtrack what's poppin' baby
Ya'll ain't know
I go by the name of
Lupe Fiasco
Representin' that 1st & 15
Yea
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grindin' (ya know what I'm saying)
Legally and Illegally
Ha
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
So, check it out

First got it when he was six
Didn't know any tricks
Matter fact
First time he got on it he slipped
Landed on his hip and bust his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp
Like this
Now we can end the story right here 
But shorty didn't quit it was something in the air
Yea
He said it was somethin' so appealing
He couldn't fight the feelin'
Somethin' about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it
Couldn't understand it
Brand it, since his first kickflip he landed
Uh
Labeled a misfit, abandoned
Ca-kunk, ca-kunk, kunk
His neighbors couldn't stand it, so
He was banished to the park
Started in the morning wouldn't stop till after dark
Yea
When he said it's getting late in here
So ""I'm sorry young man there's no skating here""

[Chorus]
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
And the way he roll just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So we Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Kick, Push Coast
So come and skate with me, just a rebel looking for a place to be
So let's Kick, and Push, and Coast

Push down with the right, lift up with the left
Push down with both feet man, now land that shit fresh
We used to ride around just doin' that
With some used Airwalks and Billabong on my back
Happily because my mom couldn't afford it
When it came to Black validity, I guess they felt shorted
Identity crisis, they scrunched they facial
How we both black and our kid is biracial?
Okay, let me simplify the story yo
I was black but white in the middle like an Oreo
I skateboarded past all the shit I coulda been
I know my dead homies wish they was much gooder then
I mean gooder then, not cuz I'm better than
See, Airs got hooder man, blood got wetter than
I was just tryna bring it home and set a trend
But they would just yawn like it's Late Night for Letterman
I'm tryna tell 'em, it ain't no chance it's a fad
But they look at my Sadplant like a plant that was sad
These niggas count more grants than my dad
From all the cocaine in the grams of a bag
Skateboard P stand for skateboard past
All the bullshit that the devil's plans had
It grew up happy man, that plant wasn't sad
So I put it in Vanity Fair and the Zoo York ad
And I cooked it up to a crystallized dream
Take a puff, don't that taste like ice cream?
My record come out, the store calls your girl
Hate it or love it, I warthog the world
Yezzur

So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, and the way he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So he kick, push, kick, push, kick, push, kick, push
Coast, so come and skate with me
Just a rebel, looking for a place to be
So let's kick, and push, and coast

[Chorus]

Yea uh, yea, yea
Before he knew he had a crew
That weren't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB Dunks
They would Push, till they couldn't skate no more
Office building, Lobbies weren't safe no more
And it wasn't like they weren't getting chased no more
Just the freedom is better than breathing they said (they said)
And they escape route, they used to escape out
When things got crazy they needed to break out (they'd head)
To any place with stairs, any good grinds the world was theirs, uh
And they four wheels would take them there
Till the cops came and said ""There's no skating here""

Clear the streets out
Come on with it, ha-ha, Star Trak

Niggas is haters, I'm doin' deals like the majors
Ice Cream sneakers, I signed my first skater
So you can pay three and buy yourself some Bapestas
Bulletproof under t-shirts because they hate us
Do like Snoop say step your game up
Double-decker boat nigga, Meditterane up
D-Class action cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberace fingers, niggas hit Lorraine up
Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin' off the plane, both us laughin'
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Italian heart throbs could not get rid of me
Up in Donatella's crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, give me that Enzo
I know what your thinkin' yeah me too
Okay everybody meet Mr. Me Too

Been two years, like I was paddy wagon cruisin'
The streets was yours, you're dunce cappin' and kazooin'
I was just assumin' you'd keep the coke movin'
But I got one question, fuck y'all been doin'?
Pyrex stirs turned into Cavalli furs
The full length cat, when I wave, the kitty purs
All my niggas caked up, sellin' gray and beige dust
Had that money right or end up in the trunk taped up
We don't chase and duck, we only raise the bucks
Peel money rolls 'til our thumbs get the paper cuts
Chill retardo, South Beach Gallardo
Teals started up, go brr like it's Nardo
Women, if you love me, please let me know
Tie rags around your neck and learn the sets we throw
These are the days of our lives and I'm sorry to the fans
But the crackers weren't playin' fair at Jive

I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay we get it, yeap yeah you too

I know, I know, yeap yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

I know what you thinkin' why I call you Me Too?
Cause everythin' I say, I got you sayin' me too
I say I got a Benz, so you said me too
You hangin' out the window so they can see you
But you ain't hangin' out the window
When you in that G2 or that G3 or G4 like we do
Star Trak, Clipse, Malice, come on

Wanna know the time? Better clock us
Niggas bite the style from the shoes to the watches
We cloud hoppers, tailored suits like we mobsters
Break down keys into dimes and sell them like Gobstoppers
Who gon' stop us
Not a goddamn one of you
Mean with the Re-Up, nigga we street tumblers
Ivory white, yeah that's the same color
Of the Azure nigga, best believe it's the Mulliner
Take no prisoners, rap niggas are whisperers
Choke on your own spit just as soon as you mention us
Champagne corks, kicks by Louis sports and
Keep my hoes in Pucc' and Charles Jourdan
Cop it, chrome it, touch-screen component
Mink on the floor, make you hot, don't it?
You don't wanna know what the fuck I spent on it
Tomorrow ain't promised so we live for the moment

I understand, 'cause people need things
And they will take it from you
And take you from your seedlings

I still walk the most humblest walk
And one day, they may even catch up with me, man

But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with
Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness...
[cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap 
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted 
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums
Look, oo you see me ma
They wish they could be me ma
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia 
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed
'cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under
'cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer

My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what).
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it comes out in a line so let it
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out

Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back
That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that? 
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps
So many niggas will rise
So many them niggas try
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive
Devine intervention this is
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this

Jesus will arange it, but Jesus won't change it
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it
You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??, 
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous
'cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless
Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop
Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine
Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame

Yessur! aha 
New Skateboard P 
Hey! 
Let's go get 'em 
Uh-huh 
Yo, hola 

[Verse 1] 
Mearle maire, club muchacho 
Asorted flavours, in they solatos 
Inspire young minds, stacked by Nato's 
With the right determination of a patho 
Running 'cross the water with bricks at his poncho 
Face like a shoot when it's bussin' my glock hold 
Vanity stings, 'til I die when the holy father hands me my wings 
When I was young yo the teacher gave me stanity dreams 
Giving me music like drugs and they handed me things, they shoot it up 
See me on the TV, the cuties they wanna fuck 
Both presidential and plus, they hoop it up 
Got more hits in his zip, who want enough 
I can go back in time, you be Judge Eato 
With my men and ?? I know you thinkin' Neato 
Givin' peace to minutes, something like your T-Vo 
But it's 3 hundred thousand more with no remote 
Take it in the rain, I used to live with Tito 
But he clowned me and told me that my money's free-doughs 
Now the Enzo doors go up like a Dilo 
Reon, same song some from my man Nigo 
SLR, when the doors go up it's like a fresh elle jar 
Nigga we boss, he shall not get hot, he too frost 
Yessur... 

[Bridge] 
My nigga close your eyes, 
Just picture you're self just holdin' pies 
Impliment a plan and and you'll surely rise 
Just promised by the man that controls the skies 
Don't you see, I know that shit's so ill 
Better yet, dawg, just tell me how you feel 
...How you feel dawg? 

[Chorus] 
We just picture thinking, dreaming, scheming, breathing, reading, all in the late night 
Shaking, boiling, lacing, bacon, shaking, shaping, gotta get this cake right 
As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch you take flight 
...My nigga how does it feel? 
Ha ha! Yessur! 

[Verse 2] 
Nigga you don't know me 
I'm part Howard Hues, part horny, part holy 
First trip on the ramp is the rock and rolly 
Keep one on my staff with a new pro-chromy 
If they priest need the mention that I've been biten 
But a force be the chocolate where critics are written 
He dresses insane where his music admire 
Ask anyone from Vouge and Esquire And Vanity Fair you like can of the year 
But you should guess who's in insanity chair 
Now it ain't about what I want 
Still thumbing through my life like a drug-star porn 
It's one thing to say you did it 
It's one thing to lie about your didgits 
It's one thing to say that you live it 
It's another for you fuckers to admit it 
But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's off of our nature 
I drive a Casper, s'cuse me Cassper, wanted meet me at my house, I got space like NASA 
And it'll make me happy buy yourself a Sattle 
Unlike my sister Stacy when she lost her papa 
I been there, gettin stroke and nothing to trap-uh 
John could do, when surrounded with true 
A man dies, baby born, as far as Peru 
It's a simple proof between us and imposters 
We hop in the air, and don't care what it costs us 
Now I'm with NERD with a pit full of Martians 
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers 
Zapping at niggas, with classing and figure 
The cash and class whippers 
The thrashing mag ripper 
Go 'head and say it (you a rappin' ass nigga) 
Yessur!

Say P, man the other day, boy I'm at the club, mane with this broad or whatever. I walk in, I see her
talkin' to some dude or whatever uknowhaimsayin. So I-I holler at her, I say 'Aye man, check this out

[Veres 1: Pharrell]
Before you say it's cheaper to keep her
We consider and read her
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater
So put your Porche up, (uh)
Get your divorce up, (uh)
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up
Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners
So keep it player dawg,
Don't make me say it, naw
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all

[Chorus]
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane
I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh,
uh-uh-uh (haa), uh-uh-uh (yea), uh-uh-uh

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along
Because I'm only 25, and still going live
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive
The Doubble R 760, or the 645, I'm
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain
Money aint never been a thang
You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang)
Rocks the nicest, never seen nuthin' like this
I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless
Baby girl you might just
Get the shatter shine
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine
But you can't be a hater, mane
You gotta keep it playa, mane

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm
Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (whaa)
Not the ice, my beat is worth more
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us
I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi
I think and relay it
I blink and PJ it
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and Ebay it
And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me
Got one in Virigina 'nother one in Miami

No drug to drinkin what you want 
No seriously what you thinkin sense the yukon 
Never puffed a jay you ask lou shaun 
Back when he pushed babes like it was like coupons 
With a house full of dames like it was moulon

Make em say 'wat we on??

Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons 
Wen it rains it pours

And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy 
I guess he played games 
There's only diamond dice here

I know niggas are like there's no returning when I
Bought that white five-fifth
So white that the coke heads just might try sniff
I ordered the phantom coupe, that's smoke pipe grey
And the interior was like crack white beige
At least that's what it looked like when it was on that page
I combed the whole brochure and it did not say, oh well
Life's a bitch but not too extreme
Life's got a fat ass, Trust me I'ma fuck full steam
I make the world cream and scream, while I'm gettin my cream
I'm coming to America call me Prince Akeem, yes sir
It's kinda weird, 'cause this I dream
Kinda prophetic ya get it 'cause this I seen
These type of visions, since I's teen
I told my teacher what I saw, she said I missed byzine
Laughed with the class with the slightest clue
You be buying my shit, and I be rappin to you, but you can do it too

[Chorus]

I know you heard the story about the dude with the attitude
Pharrell he don't even know you but he mad at you
He got robbed and it seems he has a huge
He's frustrated and that it all he has is you
So, things propel and things excel
The next the a bing comes out the barrell
And my man they accused him of sittin tight up in jail
Ironic he close my man luke can hear him yell
I ain't do it but somebody dropped him flat
I felt the wind from it, that was God cocking back
I got a call from Virginia grandma went back
The line was fluctuated but it just now went flat
See her body went down and her soul went up
She sent angels around me so evil could not touch
I don't lie no more and I'm haunted when I fuck
Wealthy niggaz with a conscience, yeah you know what's up
The wires across, and it's breeding a plague
The conscience is hungry, and it's eating away
Trying to make sense of it, but it's speedy in vain
Up all night with the books and you read till the day
But still ya house of diddy 'cause you got a little paper
Push a cat in the corner, trust me it's the nature
Never underestimate the-things you do
Read your verse too, inhale the ""oo"", and go

Mama help I fell in love with a young girl

(thats true, so true)
(you're the only girl I love to)

My heart was soaken and I broken in a young world

(so true, so true, listen)

I wasn't tryin to lead her on
See I didn't wanna be alone
But when she smiles she braught me home
So I braught her home,
Its not that the fealin of love is gone
Can't expect a kind little girl to be grown
I can't give a fuck what so and so says
Crushes hurt both ways

What on earth, what I'm suppose to do
What on earth, what I'm suppose to do

Somebody tell me what I'm suppose to do

Mama help I fell in love with a young girl!

The single girls are out tonight
But you have one word, my heart, one life
And I'm not lookin around
So why you lookin down

I fucked up a long time ago
See I should have never let you know
See I couldnt give a fuck what tabloids say

[T.I.]
I was born into poverty raised in the sewerage
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
And even when my days weren't the bluest
I never ran from adversity, instead I ran to it
Fear ain't in the heart of me I learned just do it
You get courage in your fears right after you go through it
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22s
That ain't bad for a nigga who ain't even finish school huh?
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beats to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on things
Several solitaires and they all in one chain
Used to see me in the mall I'm the same
And brains from a couple broads on the plane

[Chorus]

[Common]
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and B goin' try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Easy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
They ain't see how the hood and heaven were connected
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
Couldn't see how my mind won't be the lame
Ahead of my time I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change

I put on gasoline drawers I stood in the fire
With enough heat to set the hood on fire
Man you niggas think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
And wish a nigga would come try us
We was cool with the killers, best friends with the lifers
Quick to up and scrap with niggas who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
But like that pimping time flash by you
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reefer ain't bias
You ain't got to tell and distant the liars
Gave the jail hell and shot birds at the hearse
Lived through worse and reversed the curse

But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind

My whole hood is to my left, and they ain't giving a fuck
So feel free to get lose and get carried away
So by tomorrow you forgot what you was sayin' today
But don't forget about this feeling that I'm making you get
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat

Ya want to, but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you somethin' to bump to, hey!
Luda, I'm at the top of my game
You want my hands from the bottom to the top of your frame
And I just wanna take a lil' ride on your curves
And get erotic, giving your body just what it deserves and
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius, Yup!

Get up, and I stay harder than a cinder block, man, hey!

Do anything to protect Carolyn's son and these mills

Hung the cat up by its tail;
And your third fiance didn't show;

Where everybody knows your name,
And they're always glad you came;
You want to be where you can see,
Our troubles are all the same; 
You want to be where everybody knows your name.

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead; 
The morning's looking bright; 
And your shrink ran off to Europe, 
And didn't even write; 
And your husband wants to be a girl; 

Be glad there's one place in the world 
Where everybody knows your name, 
And they're always glad you came; 
You want to go where people know, 
People are all the same;

I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhyming stuff we was in concert

And I'm getting it, I'm getting it
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it
I'm getting it, straight getting it
Get get get it boy
(Don't waste you time,
Fighting the life stay your course,
And you'll understand)
Get it boy

Push (push) money over broads, you got it, fuck Bush
Chef (chef), guess what I cooked
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took
Feds, they like wack rappers,
Tried as they may, couldn't get me on the hook
D.A. wanna indict me
Cause fish scales in my veins like a pisces
The pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
Turn one into two like a Siamese
Twin when it end, I'm a stand as a man
Never dying or admiring these
Last of a dying breed, so let the champagne pop
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block

And I'm getting it, I'm getting it
I ain't talking about it, I'm living it
I'm getting it, straight getting it
Get get get it boy

Fighting the life stay your course,
And you'll understand)

That's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them twenty's real well
Now we coastin', me, two chicks and toastin'
I turn up the volume watch the bass get 'em open
Soft-spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was movin' bodies before we hit the party
'Fore the DJ started cuttin',
(*Scratches*) ""I was already fuckin'...""

Lose the face, you two's was great

How many chicks can you fit in that ride

Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be, in the back tipsy
We gets in for free ea'eday wit' me
Two steppin', you see each crew reppin'
Slippin' on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweatin'
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do somethin' to me
Come this way and prove somethin' to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm totin'
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

When they say, ""Last call,"" that don't mean the night's ova
That means it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, ass pushin' a choker
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir!""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What is it the ""Whip Appeal"", or my Babyface?

[Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leanin'
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleamin'
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in
She know from the beginning
She added to list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinnin' and my head spinnin'
Mine from juice and gin-in, hers from neck and chinin'
I'm a winner, man

It's the way you,
It's the way you make me feel
(Special girl, you're so special, special)
Baby just don't change, you're so real
(so special girl you're so special, special)
Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
Girl you know you are special
I bet you were born in the sky.
Show me that I'm special, tell me boy
Girl, you know you are special, girl
The hottest in my mind

I know you, and you know me
And this is the place that you really wan' be
Lets make it crack-a-lack I make it look easy
Life can be a carnival and I'm a be your reason
Kiss me slowly,
Perform quiet storm til I get you nicely
I'm puttin' out the blunt cause I see
I see that I need you more in my life
Than I need a bag of weed.
Now I compare you to a bird
When she fly by
I wanna rock you back to sleep
Like beddy-bye-bye.
Bounce in the 'lac
With your hand on my leg
Throw your bags in the back
I'm a show you where it's at
No telling if we might come back
You like that?
I figured out a way to catch a flight right back
See I ain't never flown for fees
Come spend a weekend overseas in Greece with me
Please believe

[Chorus]

You know, if you're through with me
Then I'm through with you
But you're the one who fell in love
And said that love was true
But you ain't never fake on me
And you think that you gon find
Another G like me?
Dem nigga's ain't gon' play
They gon' just hump
They ain't gon do it yo way
I can't hate and say what they gon' do
All I know is that I'm true
And know that you my baby boo
Let's take a chance, Go to France
On a 3 day cruse
Walk with your man in the sand like ooh,
It's our little rondez-vous
Whoopty-whoop
Big snoopy and ooh
I picture this love affair of ours
To last a lifetime just like flowers
Take a quic flick the get dressed
We'll head to Brazil,
I'll show you how it feel
When you're rollin' with the real
How it feel?

[Chorus]

We can make it, let's just stay together
Come together, don't go
Let's just have some fun and be together
Forever, for life!

Now that we're living our life especially
I say that you're my pick
And every day we'll dress alike and always stay slick
To me, I see you as a gift
Incredible it's edible
My ice cream, have a lick
I catch you when you fall like leaves
And be the one that you need
Come be my number one, please?
See I ain't never blow no cheese
And done no songs like these
I love the air that you breathe
You know why? (Why-Why?)

It sounds like a song we fuckin to the beat
I put ma rat-tat-tat in her boom boom pow
Then she put her tit-tit-tit all up in my mouth
I told you before I dont luv them ho's
But she got that good good can't let 'r go

Pull your lunch break lemme hit it real quick

Pharrell Williams,"Yeah three in the morning on the Westside highway, top down baby,
Fuck y'all
The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well

This a special dedication, (thank y'all)
I wanna thank you for the fuel,
No really thank you

(y'all better hear this shit)
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said,
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head,
Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids,
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class,
I teach his ass,
Even betters what my uncle did,

I pop my demo tape in, start to beat my head,
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beating his,
He might as well say beat it kid, he's on the list,
Its like I'm searching for kicks like a sneaker head,
He goin' keep pushing me until I reach the ledge,
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell em all to eat a dick,
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread,
Spread spread spread

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it

yeah yeah yeah

I had to lace up my boots even harder,
Father is too far away to father,
Further-more are the kids either smoke reefer,
Or either move white, there's few writers in my cipher,
So they made lighter, my type a dreams seem dumb
They said wise up, how many guys a
you see making it from here,
The world don't like us,
is that not clear, alright, but
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gonna be off a what everybody isn't,
They don't listen,
just whispering behind my back,
No vision, lack of ambition,
So wack

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,
Then you could conceive it

Had a couple of meetings no offers yet,
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices,
Back to the drawing board ducking officers,
It's all good cause the streets is A and R'in this,
So with or without any of y'all involvement,
We coming for all of this, respect my conglomerate,
I went from pauper to the President,
Cause every deal I ever made set precedent,
Niggas probably thought I'd fall without old buddy,
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money,
Dear teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker,
I'm balling outta control, can you hear my sneakers,
Fuck y'all

The motivation for me is them telling me what I could not be,
Oh well, (hey, hey)
I'm so ambitious, (hey)
I might hit two sisters,
Hey I'm on a mission
No matter what the conditions,
Forget personal issues
When you been what I been through,
Hey if you believe it,

Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try

Yeah yo, listen, I done played with the snakes in the grass
Paid for my mistakes I made in the past
Everybody ate when I came wit the cash
At least I tried to ride the wave till it crashed

Same wood on the gun handle is on the dash
All the hoods that son ran through is on smash
They can't identify you wit a mask
And the Bible will tell you nothin' is gonna last

The name of da game's survival
If you make it alive when you ride through, they make it arrival
My boo is gon' ride, you know I am gon' ride, too
Make an M everyday, I am gon' try to, let's go

Yeah yo, I tried to tell niggas I'm willin' to blast for it
I only try to give it to niggas that ask for it
Got them things on the scale, I'm still weighin' 'em
Thought my dues was paid, I'm still payin' 'em

Couple Elanor's and the Goose I am still payin' 'em
Semi's and the fulli's know that the truth stay wit 'em
Wolves and gorillas is loose so don't play with 'em
Somethin's holdin' 'em back, nothin' that you could say to 'em

Popped champagne wit Biggie at the Palladium
Put that good hawk work in with the titaniums
Shit switch around when them heats get fired
And ya peeps just died but I least he tried, let's go

Everyday, somethin' in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try

Yeah, watch the game get tooken over
I am still on the same side of the fence, I am just lookin' over
A solider from the gravel to the grass
To the obstacles in life I traveled in the past

Whether I'm holdin' a mic or holdin' a Mac
It's like an invisible force is holdin' me back
But I ain't lettin' go of my pride
After I get the dough I slide, better know I tried, let's go

Everyday, somethin' in my way, I try
Shit ain't goin' right, I try to see the light, I try
It's like my eyes got a cover on 'em
And somethin' holdin' me back
A better man, better level, better know, I try

Here come another day up on me
Put the pressure on me, here we go again, ah
I try to do what's right when life is so wrong
I want a better way, I see a better day
'Nuff wit the people said, I want a better me
God knows that I try but time won't wait for me

Used to have this white bitch she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit I don't know
Like that Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano I mean Pharrell'll know
The hair shop bitch from D.C. hey P let 'em know! (Yeah that bitch was hot)
Yeah yeah but it was time to go
Them hoes come in eenie, meanie, miny-moe! Yugch!

Mami you miss me don't you?
Haters wish you could hit me don't you?
Heh, You should call me uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand
That new C-L fly
Outside of Popeye's eating chicken and fries
Yeah come holla at ya uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand

Why wouldn't I be? Look at shorty
Damn! Mami good down to the cuticles
I'm Cam! What's your name Beautiful
Like man! I could get used to you
Or the ram! if you knew what I used to do
But call me Uncle yeah Uncle Cam
I tax 'em. (Like who?) Like Uncle Sam
From the jungle fam where niggas bundle gram
From below you tumble get merked on the humble
And the gat on the belt on the hip
And I keep a Pharrell with the Clipse
Drive a hard bargain (bargain), I'm Harlem's only Gagarin
Car foreign, the other man stood-stood stutter-fied
I know ya moms well, tell ya mother Hi.
I'm the other guy that got ya mother high
Coke like a caterpillar I make butter-fly (Mami you miss me don't you?)

Haters wish you could hit me don't you?
Heh, You should call me uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand
That new C-L fly
Outside of Popeye's eating chicken and fries
Yeah come holla at ya uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand

Goddamn the boy's back
For pushing a mountain of snow caps to avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars stepping on blow doing the toe-tap
The dope return like I had it on Lo-Jack
It made its way home like a road map I fathered this
If I mislead any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like Saturday Night Fever
I kept in the crib it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper.
Way deeper than rap money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late all I can tell 'em is repent unh! (Mami you miss me don't you?)

Haters wish you could hit me don't you?
Heh, You should call me uncle
I understand I'm back by popular demand

Pharrell Williams,"I'm only in the company of Kings
I made a power move and it's everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Standing on the shoulders of twenty thousand fiends
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F B I R S D E A
One letter short but still motherfuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try and crack the code
Combination lock to the kilos that I hold
Leopard print Louboutin's, prowlin' the concrete
Roller balls come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of them top floors
Thirty five large took it right out the top draw
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock draw

[Chorus]
It's like rain, spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing but we is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear, hocus pocus
Ring, ring the nigga wanna sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring the nigga wanna sing
Unless he is an insomniac and dying to dream

You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to them o's
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Look I'm all grown up and I dun blown up
Nigga ain't much changed, in fact, things are the same
I'm the definition of shooter, gun of choice the Ruger
You'll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I'm filthy
Drop Phantom is milky
White on white, twenty four inch blades I'm skatin'
Red eye smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan 
Niggas surprised, fifty back on fire
Fifty back running round this bitch strapped
Hit man for hire

[Chorus]

I sit with the liars, duct tape and tires
Been lost their soul
They just waiting on the fire
Innocent faces with a shit load of priors
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep sea dive for the fish scale
Tryna find a better price, man that ship sailed
Take a record head back if that shit fail
Drop weight like an anchor than you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine double scream when I turn the key over
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steam roller
Bitches double team when I have my sleep overs
Yeah, Re-Up gang with the G-Unit
This is Taylor made drug dealer fiend music
Test it on ya tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it

One of the tougher ginger bread men out the cutter,
Skin ain't Huck Finn but I ain't Nigger Jim mother fucker
I'm more like clubber from the upper cut of the gutter
Never can't tell I won't bow down to the bull like Calculta
That ain't what I'm rapping for, I'd rather be a matador
So tar, tar, rev and roar
I know that sounds fucked up like a raptor/rap tour?

These things get turned into things that I sing
Things stringed together with similes in between
Then ming with the thing
Since little green marines I
Been, mean, jing ming, ring, ling, string, bean, dream, team, bling, bling, 3, rings, ring, ling

Expect my roar if you reject my whim, errect my law, respect my pim
I bring the pain, Method Men, I bring the pain

Lil Homie, stay focused, got shit to do!

They say what don't break a nigga make a nigga
I woke up out my dream, said I gotta get it
This whole city full of thieves, gotta watch my pivot
Cause on the block, niggas never seen good living
Only lived in jail cells or prison
Drive bys, little homies hit the store for liquor
I gotta steer my life different, where to begin with?
Mama told me go back to school, I said I'm finished
There's only one way a nigga gonna learn:
You gotta take risks and do things the hard way
Stole the hall pass, now I'm running through the hallways
Only thing in my memory from those days
You couldn't save a nigga, even on a Sunday
Monday, new day, shit still the same
Gotta switch the rhythm up like Kwame
When things changed, watch people do the same
As I hear a voice sing:

Lil Homie, everybody tryna get with you
Lil Homie, stay focused, got shit to do!

Big boy grown, can't leave the streets alone
Wanna be a king, but you're too young for the throne
Why you riding in the car that you can't afford?
Can't move forward in the 4-door chrome
All that cheap talk I never did
My walk is Billie Jean, my shoes are never slip
Notice how close he is, gold his goals that approachin' him
They can't stop the win losing's not an option
First place locked in, get my trophy ready bitch
Turn your back on me only gon' leave you ?
Fuck that bullshit I got common sense
I'm ready for my limelight put my mic in hand
They'll dissolve when the money's gone
So motherfucka don't appear when the money's home
Lil' homie done grew into a big dog
If you barking in my way you gettin' chewed on

Lil Homie, everybody tryna get with you
Lil Homie, stay focused, got shit to do!

See your friends walking up and down your block
Ain't got a penny-nenny-nenny-nenny
Just picture yourself sittin' there on top
A nigga straight winnin-in-in-in-in-in-in

Nigga straight winnin', you see how I did it
Bottom to the top take 'em back to the beginnin'
All my niggas winnin', you see how we did it
Dreamt it now we live it
Now we all winnin', me and my

I can beat the world, with you behind me

To find you didn’t take that long
You’re like a note, that’s in there hiding
Subtle but special girl you make the song

And the way you fix your hair and two-step that’s insane, (you know it)
And every time you smile at me ooh girl you’re in my brain, (you know it)
But this is your world so I guess that would be OK, (you know it)
When you dance in front of me like that I can’t debate, (you know it)

Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning
If the flight is private, we probably should board it
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show

And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go

All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid

It did though, friends killed over small bills
I still go, hard spitting bars for them folk

Ooh I had a naughty thought today baby
Every time I close my eyes
Ooh get a glimpse of this candy paint
Don't slip off when it drip off on top of ya right
Let me see in here, flippin' off and toss the bed
I know everything you want
I'mma show you how I stroke (stroke it)
Bringing work up on top of me
I'mma let let you be the boss of me
I know everything you want
Give me that daddy long stroke

I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out, turn that cherry out
I can't wait 'til I get home so you can tear that cherry out, turn that cherry out

Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential

You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas giving orders now
The gold presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches, they keep coming
Bilie Jean thumping
I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning
I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something
I could ship her something, you know that December coming

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

They see me leaning in some new shit
Now it's gold presidentials for the cruise ship
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish
I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffing my pockets, you niggas starving
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold presidential Venus when I change the game

So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now

Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers until the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat wet wet

Say you got to hang up but the man won't let go
Oh, my nigga say it ain't so
Now we speaking on some niggas that he say he ain't know
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Hearing whispers, ""it ain't adding up""
Giving you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough

I never thought I'd had have to question ""Were you man enough?""
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Telling all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5

Sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me; can't you hear it in my tone?
So then sorry nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!

Tryna act normal but the writing is on the wall
It's like I hear you smiling when you heard they hit the wall

Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like your honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightning then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak saying

Sorry nigga, heh, I'm tryna come home

How many niggas you knew snitching you ain't killed, nigga?
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
Every move we ever made is getting stared at
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that setting in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing
Once he told me that

That’s the nigga mama hard
Her baby stretched out on the boulevard

Supposedly I help chicks, help them with groceries
Supposedly I still break, gripping my rosary
Still shoot ya block up then make you notice me

Fuckin' gheard the guy hurt, I don’t even care much

Pharrell Williams,"Hello?
Hi, this is Bridget, should I come over later?
I'm sorry, I don't know a Bridget
Well that's not what you said when you hugged me last night!
Ha! you think we're an item just because I gave you a hug?
Trick, you better think again

We are not gentlemen
Yo, I'll hug a girl like it don't mean nothin'
Then turn around and start huggin' her cousin
I don't love 'em, end of the fuckin' discussion
Got 'em tucked between my wings like thanksgiving stuffing

She wanna hug from behind I did it
Then her friend jump in, I'm wit' it
I hug 'em tighter than a tube top
After that, it's just a matter of time
Before the other shoe drop

I get more hugs than Oprah selling drugs
And the drug was pure x no, Mary Jo sex
Just hugs

Don't get mad, girl, we get mad girls
And we're hugging all over the world
So don't catch feelings, it ain't love
We're just the kings of giving out hugs
And if you wanna settle down, you know you got us all wrong
So we on to the next one, no disrespect, hon
But you can't hug a rolling stone

You can't hug a rolling stone cause it'll crush you
Begging me to hug you again? that's when I shush you
On an airplane, at a Knicks game
Feel the same damn thing when I hug them
Which is nothing
Can't trust them, lose all respect when I hug them

Now guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With a fat hug for your sweater and your blouse
Hugged so many ladies, arms shaky and shit
Because I'm the Wilt Chamberlain of the upper-body grip

Cause I get more hugs than a batch of puppy pugs
Sitting on a fluffy rug, getting tickled touched and rubbed
(Oh shit!)
Real talk, like you chatting with a fisherman
Wrap these chicks up like a motherfucking swisher, man

This ain't love girl, because this hug world
Is just a big game of thrones
We be king of the castle, got arms like a lasso
But you can't hug a rolling stone

I been hugging on your mama
Especially when your daddy's gone
Wearing his pajamas
I know you thinking that is wrong
I don't care what some does
I'm concentrating on her back
I just wanna hug your mama in her Subaru hatchback
Put her in a figure-4, yes I'm a hug gigolo
Now she tells her Tupperware friends to let their sisters know

That I give more hugs than atlas had shrugs
(Brush my head on her shoulder)
While your man mean mugs (We get hugs)

We had fun, girl, but don't get sprung, girl
Just because I hugged you raw
We can do a group thing, bring Sarah and suan
And we can have a hug-a-trois
So quit trying to own my hugs
I gave you these arms on loan
So come give me a hug
The waistline and above
When push comes to shove
You can't hug a rolling stone

Hug yo' bad p, bitches",Hugs,2013
Pharrell Williams,"I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves, shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that cellular convo's getting left in the wrong
Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts (fuck)
I love you

(Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good)

The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest
Can make me the saddest
Look Alice
Let's get lost in your wonder-er-land fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathing
And you'll see the meaning of stalking
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seeing with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evening
Make sure you never meet again like god damn vegans
Cause when I hear your name I can not stop cheesing
I love you so much that my heart stops beating when you're leaving
And I'm grieving and my heart starts bleeding
Life without you has no god damn meaning
Sorry I'm passive aggressive for no god damn reason
It's that my mood change like these god damn seasons
I'll fall for you, but I love you

I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah

The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it tonight
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling girl let's try to catch it
The sky is falling bitch let's try to catch it tonight, come on

Come on baby
Even though I hate you
I still love you
I love you
And Salem I know
I'm passive aggressive (I'm sorry, fuck)
(Come here)
I like when we hold hands
(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (fuck)
And if I see that nigga (if I see him)
I just might kill him (look)
(Look I wanna strangle you, till you stop breathing)
Love, love, love

Just because you got more than a nigga
Motherfucker Kamikaze you, they rather die then see you live fly
Crabs in a barrel, in ghetto America
Man, we just lucky that we make it out
See so much potential, lost some reputation, you would think eventually we will get it
They say you got it, they don't even want it
It just hurt so much for them to see you with it
What I know 'bout Satan, he patiently wait
To rob and steal and kill off greatness in the making
What we put together never let ‘em take it
Goddamn shawty you were 'pose to make it

You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
Lighters up, lighters up
Lighters up, lighters up
Lighters up, lighters up
Lighters up, lighters up
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
Lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up

You know when I met you, sitting in the car
Buck head in the mall, you was something special
He was just a young nigga,
Still he never got excited,
It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga with a eye patch, swingin' hard
Reppin' role tide Alabama
You can tell he was kickin' too much flavour on a country nigga made 'em wanna kill him
Still to see him smiling shawty, he be chillin'
Nigga wish him dead, he ain't even feel it
At your video, I could feel the ?
We was at the club, nigga couldn't get it in, they was stuck outside
Start to look at you, and as you should you looked like ""fuck I 'posed to do?""
Asked you 'bout it then, said ""ay brah you cool?""
You said ""I ain't worry 'bout the lil dude""
Get they feelings hurt, got a attitude,
They'll come around in a year or two
Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family
Said ""I get you rich"" you said ""you want a Grammy""
Showed you how to mix the Actavis
Candy, doin' 160 with me, he ain't panic
Called me yesterday, I say ""lil bro what's happening?
Working with Pharell, chillin' in Miami""
All you said was ""run it, book the flight I'm coming
'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something""
I just said ""ok"" I hung up the phone
Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone

You was suppose to make it
You was suppose to make it
You was suppose to make it
You was suppose to make it

Devil's business, my brother gone
Supposed to be a living legend
Hating nigga sent you home
But when we see that guy, we gon' treat him like the sky
On the 4th of July
And light him up

Lighters up, lighters up
Lighters up, lighters up
Lighters up, lighters up
Lighters up, lighters up
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it

I was really more on some ""fuck the word"" shit so let's see
(Fuck these niggas man, real talk)
I'm a man of respect, man of the people
I stand up to God, to the man of no equal
Man of respect, man of the people
I stand up to God, to the man of no equal

Ain't no breaking me down, bitch I'm breaking the banks
And ain't no holding me down, even if you holding the shanks
I'm controlling the time, nigga thinking some things
Got the heart of a lion, and I'm as strong as a tank
Sittin' on my thrown and my crown, can't separate me from that
I'm king of all us fate, God say be patient for that
Man all I got is my gangster, better not go playing with that
Anything get taken from us, my folk, we takin' in back
Bet we go take us some lives 'fore we go take it to law
Boy I got fire in my eye, look at me see gauges go off
Watch how you come at your fate, nigga better be saving your thoughts
Boy all you got is a cape, I make the nation go off
And nigga who put fear in your heart, respect me
Take a act of God 'fore a nigga check me
Hundred P's and Q's what a nigga best be
Who you got your money on? Bet me, let's see
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirring it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

I stay silent with red even if I'm standing with blue
Whether you're requested or not, bet my demand'll get through
They may be killer to you, hey they my family dude
And anybody could get it, but especially you
These nigga pressin' me, testin' me, what you suggestin' we do?
And wait a second, push your pawn, to play chess with these dude
Yeah we could jump 'em and check em, by sprayin' techs at these fools
Make it to trial, you don't win, indirectly you lose
You bad, makin' that move, your best move
Or end up in the pen like the next dude
Remeber, there's very few like you they let through
They even fewer, they don't want it, now they get through
To get to the level you on, hard to do homes
More nigga do a lot of right, right before they do wrong
And you gone, out of there, nigga see you later
'Less you beat 'em a year later, Boosie tell 'em
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirring it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Remember me I'm so there
Don't make us have to go there
Turn and sing it

Get T.I. in the shack, handshake it with 5
Still politicin' with 6, this probably as real as it gets
And bitch I would never be hit with by intellectual weaponry
Ain't no one gon' disrespect me, or compromise my integrity
Say what my pedigree? Silent, guess you talkin' bout I shot it
Bitch you never been to war like I ain't never been to college, c'mon
Fuck what you tellin' me, done lied chill with it
I know folk from where you from, spent months in jail with 'em
Said in court you took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda
Let them sucka niggas rob you, they ain't kill you but they shoulda
And a robbery for me is like a suicide mission
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence, I swear
You and me ain't even fit to compare
I ain't make it all these years on no wing and a prayer
Starin' a bigger nigga out while he standing right there
Got a problem I'ma handle it right there
Who the people want

When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirring it, let it bubble

Atl, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles' Disco, Daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple 'til he walked out with a bag
And we got back in the car
What you wanna be he asked?
When you grow up big head?
I just wanna be like you
Ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shared a couple laughs, couple summer pass
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out
For that reason 10 years he won't be around

I'm the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch
Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID
Introduce me to the crack game
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir

Section eight, me and Ma lived in the trap

Livin' on my own, peddlin'
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed
Tokin' too, cost my first felony
That's one of many, that were to follow
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Told a child I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time
Wake up, 10 years of your life passed
When you get your cake up
Don't it seem like that
When the Feds on your ass passin' out

Nodding my head just moving
My girlfriend dragged me to this place
Staring at the crowd like we do
I saw this guy through the people
And that’s when I saw your face
But you came over to me
As sweet as can be
And grabbed my left hand
Started stepping
What else did I need to know
I said yes if you wanted to go
'Cause you are heaven
But you left me here

So I gotta see that boy again
'Cause I wanna feel that joy again
I remember leaning on his shoulder
Something and Cola
What he ordered
That’s why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again

Listen to me

My girlfriend says introduce her
But I ain’t gonna lie, I wanna lose her
You’re so nice you want to pay
Ooh you have a way with females
I didn’t get your number or email
What the hell was in my brain
'Cause I know that you believe
But I couldn’t let you see that I was stressing
I lost breath and
Then you grabbed your Mercedes keys
But you paused before you leave
And I just stood there
Like I didn’t have a care

So I gotta see that boy again
'Cause I gotta feel that joy again
I remember leaning on his shoulder
Something and Cola
What he ordered
That’s why I, I am on this floor again
I wanna see that boy again

Listen to me

It’s like the part in a movie
That get away
Oh no, not the person you want
The person you want is losing
So you pray
But the circumstances, changes course
Which is entirely up to the boss
But remember
Just because it’s written don’t mean you can’t play
Your hand to change your fate

So I wanna see that boy again
'Cause I wanna feel that joy again

Take me away from all the drama man, I miss the old days
With all of these backstabbers I feel like The O'Jays
I wanna open up my parachute but it's cold playing this 
Role when you never been the type to role play
There's something about this game and it fucks with you mentally
Like football players leaving the league with traumatic brain injuries
And eventually, you'll never be the same as you were
Then you look back at your life and everything is a blur
Like did I really turn twenty-three and see a mill before twenty-four?
Did I really blow it all like a hand grenade in the middle of a civil war?
Am I still down with the same niggas that I came in with?
Do they value my friendship?
Or do they just love the attention?
Not to mention my girlfriends, what went wrong?
Did they do me too right?
Am I the same as the snakes? Is the past coming back to bite?
Did I waste too many days? Did I fight too many nights?
Will they love me when I die? Will I ever learn to fly?

I got so many issues, I should be my own publisher
The beat is my therapist, Skateboard, paint the picture
A portrait of the artist formerly known as Vic
I read the signs I was close to overdose like Prince
Picking pill pieces up out of the bathroom sink
Like an armored truck ridin' the rink
I'd probably be a vegetable if not for medical attention
My self destructive habits have me itching like Tyrone Biggums
In the cyclone of my own addiction
The voices in my head keep talking, I don't wanna listen
""You'll never be good enough, nigga, you never was
Nobody fucking needs you, you should just jump off the bridge
You hurt everyone around you, you impossible to love
I don't want you to live, I wish you were fucking dead
I wish you were never born, we would all be better for it
I don't love you, I don't like you, like a fucking metaphor
Fuck everyone song you ever done, you lie to everyone
And ask them to tell the truth when that's something you never done
You a fucking embarrassment, how dare you win
Nigga, you let the devil in
You're still a drug addict, you're nothing without your medicine
Go and run to your sedatives, you can't run forever, Vic""

Me from my mission, my life 
I can't go on
I know what I've done
Just let this be gone
Don't care if I won
I'm just not like you guys
I can't live this with this scar
Let this be gone
Let this be done

You will be back

Now I'm alone
You were my home,

Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
Feels like a midget is hanging from my neckless

Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks-ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong

Tell ya little friend he can quit mean mugging

We gon' rush the back door and break em in

That's why they spilling drinks all over ya dress
But Louie Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over ya chest

Get us out so someone can gun us down

Do it now cause 'tomorrow' ain't promised 'today'

While you on the grind
Getting yours
Hell yeah! I'm getting mine

Grandma on the threeway
She say, If you do right 
Baby boy I promise you live 
A long life
I can't argue
I try hard to
Not blast niggas
I walk past niggas

On Snoop Dogg
To get some shut eye
What I do to him I can't speak
You know the episode
And the code on the street
I keep it all the scriffin' y'all
But real street for y'all
Cause you never know
When you're gonna go, no

You never know where this road's gonna take you

You got to hold on
Cause you never know, where
This life's gonna lead you

From the killing 
The robbing
The squabbing
And jacking
Car jacks to kidnaps
What? Niggas be acting a fool
Trying to set me up at the park
But I'm cool
Act a fool
My daddy said throw them thangs
And stay strong
My momma got sick
So I'ma keep it strong
As long as I got my feet in the game
And make this beats
And bring heat to the game
Fuck the fame
I got a little boy to see through
And him without me 
Is like me without you
Keep it true
And stay down for your grips
Homies and licks staying tight

Which man are blasted for
Never know which man to kill
Just to settle the score
It wasn't long ago
I had this partner of mine
Knew him just a short time
But he's stuck in my mind
My nigga lived perfect
Said the streets wasn't worth it
If you don't die rich in the game
Then what's the purpose for this struggle?
We stay piece to puzzle 
Invest half the wealth
And pray to god it double
We just in this
Trying to get rich at the interest
Keep it pimping
Stay with niggas that's relentless
Smoke dough
Just because I say so
Money pronto
And niggas never would know 
They never know nigga

Cause you never know, where

You better show that, nigga where the safe is at while you still safe

Jet black seat pushed back in a Diablo, die slow

Cover my mic 'cause it's priceless
Ice this

Rolex piece, watch and Jeep

Trainin' my beasts how to feast
Where the broke eat

Approach yo block wit guns
Cops will come
Spread the bread in lumps son
My nigga John, John

He had his head on tight
Hit the pipe
Now he tweaked, high as a kite

Knew damn deep he didn't care

Feed it up soon as I get up, I got to roll a phat spliff up
Smoke 'til it burn my finger tips an lips up
Drinkin' liquor 'til I get the hic ups
Fuck bad bitches then we switch up
Fuck bad bitches then we switch up

Watch me shine in my nine, nine custom design
Niggas sniffin' lines sayin' boss committed a crime
I robbed the bomb shelter, shipped the goods off the delta
Task asks if Phats the man wit no replica

No replica put the tech to ya
Smiff-N-Wesson ya
Here's the lesson to be learned
Don't test the young Hugh Heffener

4 point 6 snatchin' up yo bitch
An when it comes to mics I wreck this shit
Collectin' chips disrespect yo click
I come wit real shit

To be rappin' and stars Mo Town

Still were often told, seek and ye shall find
So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need

Phelon,"Yo, and peace be with you you know what I'm sayin'?
It's the Phelon talkin' to all those between the bible and the guns.
I ain't one to judge you know what I'm sayin'?
I just call it like I see it.
And this is the way I be seeing it where I'm living.

Now I was born a convict so I had to learn quick
You fight for your shit or you live like the vic
I'm locked in a cell with the bars unseen 
With the true and living God understand what I mean?

Love don't love nobody but I got love for mine so I go the whole 9
The mind is a terrible thing to waste 
Don't give a fuck about life because I never had a taste
Sunshine sometimes flowers never bloom

Play with my pistol as I sit in my room
Love to my moms and my pops 
Anything in my way then I cock and it drops

[Chorus: x4]
Word to God, word to God, word to God 
Pray for your soul and that's word to God 

Rocks bring cops niggas glocks bust shots 
And from Watts to new lots knots are made in spots
Gettin' G's flippin' keys keep a semiautomatic 
Get the money nobody move no need for panic

Never judge a book by the cover
'Cause I''m the other brother word to mother 
I'm sought by the hunter
Raised in the projects cashing checks using techs 

Get respect with a razor to the neck
Money increase when bodies decease
Release by police rollin' deep and play for keeps
Pistol and guns bring funds for the wicked ones

Not being a bum chum living by dumb dumb
Mind never shallow, pride never swallow
Live by the hollow, lead never follow
Peace to my niggas on the east with a full clip
Love for my niggas on the west bloods crips

[Chorus]

Gold in the ghetto is the capsules 
Seems they sell the crack to majority black and Hispanic
Tinted is the youth that I rap to my beat that they snap to
Officials are left in a panic

Infrared can find me hiding under a tree a car or even in a ditch
But you can't stop pounds of cocaine from entering the country
Now ain't this a bitch
Just say no is easy when your living in the White House

But here on my street to just to say yes means simply
Of the good life you want to take a little piece
Now the war on drugs ain't drug war
Don't break laws for a very different cause

One side sell and the other side buy
Both sides lie and induce genocide
Products move with the military force
Many many many many many lives are lost that's a little cost

Millions to be made in the drug trade people gettin' paid
Powder the people really crave
Uncle Sam says take another hit 
Transport the product with his planes and his ships

'Cause there's no coke fields in the neighborhood
No coke fields in the hood
Down here cocaine sells so good 
If we could grow it you know that we would

Then I get a pistol fistful of crystal
Provide to the public just like Al Capone
Not a criminal just running business
Dealer of death and many die by one little stone

[Chorus: x10]",Word to God,1995
Phenomena,"It seems that we're the last to know
Try no let our feelings show
Fell so strange, always in a spin
Falling out and falling in

Let's take it now, even fools can win
Open your heart and let love in

Surrender
You can't win
Surrender
Give in
Surrender
Don't run awy
Surrender
Love's gonna get you

Love's an island in your heart
Two loves but two worlds apart
You hide behind your masquerade
Never give yourself just walk away

Surrender
You can't win
Surrender
Give in
Surrender
Don't run awy
Surrender
Love's gonna get you",Surrender,1987
Phénomène Bizness,"J'me sens libre quand je t'écris quelques bribes de ma vie
Rapidement dispersées par le bruit de ma ville
J'ai appris que tout ce qui brille vaut pas le prix d'un ami
Force à toi si la son-pri te l'a pris, on est ensemble
J'me sens libre quand je t'écris quelques bribes de ma vie
Rapidement dispersés par le bruit de ma ville
J'ai appris que tout ce qui brille vaut pas le prix d'un ami
Force à toi si la son-pri te l'a pris

Mon équipe c'est le moteur, sans elle j'aurais aucun kilométrage
L'important c'est d'marquer le but pas de savoir qui le mettra
J'ai pas besoin d'objets clinquants mec, mon bagage est mince
Et même si y'a pas qu'un chemin, y'en a qu'un quand même
Dehors les neus-je galèrent alors ça tter-fri des lamelles
Les politiciens courent toujours mais pour ça les flics te ramènent
Garde ta conscience pour toi, ça t'évite de la perdre
La nuit j'prends d'la hauteur comme le satellite de la terre
Envie d'casser la démarche quand je téma le retroviseur
16 balais et j'cassais des barres j'voulais démarrer l'proviseur
Comment rester calme? Problèmes inextricables
Mental inexplicable comme une ex qui câble
Eh la directrice, ferme tes fesses j'veux pas d'tes conseils, ma chiennasse
Pour un môme agité comme moi faire le con c'est machinal
J'étais qu'un gosse marginal j'faisais mes courses au marché noir
Et quand maman s'en rendait compte c'était le cauchemar chez moi
Entre chiens de la casse et requins, combien de mecs sincères?
Aucun flic quand ça sent l'gaz et retiens l'flow du 75015

J'me sens libre quand je t'écris quelques bribes de ma vie
Rapidement dispersées par le bruit de ma ville

Yo, de toute façon on va tous caner, ouais, ouais l'ami
Et quand on va cramer on dira tous ""Ouais c'est l'Diable qui nous l'a mise""
Vision décalée, le vice s'invite sans rien déclarer
Tu trouveras des caméramans filmant des camés en camise
J'essaye de sauter le pas la vie me tire par les genoux
En vrai j'ai plus tendance à être attiré par mes jnouns
La femme et les ruses, l'homme et les mots
Pour vous ils sont beaux mais ils sont tous faux de la nuque à l'anus
Nique, j'ai quelques vrais le reste qui sont ils?
Passent le salam le regard froid et puis se killent
Bref, j'vais là ou la vie m'mène bref j'pleure avec des fous rires
J'mène une vie de merde, j'raconte mes emmerdes avec le sourire
J'refuse l'invitation car électrique est la chaise
La vie, la mort, j'ai l'cul entre deux Père Lachaise
Seulement nos actes diront si nous sommes validés
J'suis mal parti un peu comme Johnny j'm'y fais à l'idée

J'ai appris qu'la vie fait pas d'cadeau
J'efface mes traces avant le crash sur l'asphalte
Nourri de merde mais je suis pas scato
Noyée sous la paperasse j'vois la daronne devenir paro
Les frères disparaissent et sans tour de passe-passe
Mon équipe t'épate, y'a pas qu'les noich' qui vont faire un tabac
Seine zoo, Saïga on tabasse
Bien plus hard que Tabatha Cash
T'es comme cette gov' sur Paname, négro t'as pas ta place
Bercé par le bruit des sirènes
La symphonie des balles résonne dans ta ville
Les tympans percés comme la citerne
Assistés par nos cités, Vitry c'est trop deuspi
Confrontant nos idées
On casse des têtes pour s'montrer qu'on est ouverts d'esprit
Ouais, imagine ma tête en poster dans la chambre de c'flic

Ma ville est douce comme ces quelques notes
Mais cette caisse claire me rappelle à quelle point elle peut être brutale
Pense à tout c'bonheur qu'elle te donne
Et qu'elle te reprend avec un bruit d'balle
Sois prudent les gens n'ont plus d'âme
Je ne viens pas d'la rue moi tu sais j'y dors pas
Mais quand une chienne aboie je sais qu'elle ne mord pas
Je n'ai que des cauchemars et la nuit je dors mal
Car mon pote est mort là comme si c'était normal
Mon pote est mort là sans même me dire ""Au revoir""
Il y a des milliers d'autres âmes tuées pour de l'or noir
Et des milliers d'enfants tenaillés par le manque
Comment veux tu que les parents parlementent
Tellement de haine tu comprends pas poto regarde le monde
Y'aurait peut-être moins d'attentats sans tous ces bombardements
Des gouvernements veulent la guerre mais pas l'peuple
Alors j'me demande pourquoi les balles pleuvent

Pheonix,"Gotta get on my job
Take it back to the warehouse
Plot back in

A late night escape, hit me on the script
On the hip, gotta dip
Hollering, calling me out like a Girl Scout
Better go ahead and sell your cookies later
Fuck up out my face, rookie
Took me on a trip away
Chopping trees, eating grits with runny eggs
I'm always tripping on the beggars working the same corner
Trying to vamp me with the creases in your clothes
Sticking cuffs up in my face, don't act
Fumbling, pretty scared like tailbacks they flow
Knees and elbows got drug in the parking lot
So jellybeans (where ya at?) come clean
Come on in, sit down, relax and catch your wind
Some pretend but this man don't bend
Limping like Willy, turning bunks face down
On the military campground
And I'm out, nigga

Yeah, all this goddam grinding ain't shit
(Ho hustling) Cause I ain't got nathan to show
Except small quantities of blow
And enough flow to keep my lil boy belly full
But when that little bit run out
Pray your card don't get pulled
Should my path ever be crossed
On my family-feeding missions
Missing persons lives lost, inside edition
Kissing ass on nine-to-fives ain't gon keep me alive
Had to do without a lot still I seem to survive
Tried that straight path with the bow lean
Better with this new world, fitting in
Like a buzzard in a bed of swirl
Pearl handle on this firearm
Partner stay calm, now pass me your bomb
I thought your moms
Had told you about them niggas in the slums
(East Point, smoke something)

I wish you were me and I was you
Maybe then you would see what I go through
Each and every day, making up thangs to say, to speak
Uplifting words from my soul to keep
And my niggas that fantasize how wide the ride get
The concert, never the need to rob or car jack
The fact is to keep a cool head and chill
And get your Bible, it says thou shalt not kill
We do it anyway, and focus on short-lived enjoyment
And blame it on the white folks cause they supporting it

Uh, seeker no sleeper
I walk the streets, God keep me safe
Evil's raped this planet, damn it
I can't stand it, come travel to South West Atlant-ic
With me, there will be no stops in the bluff
A motherfucker sniffs his snuff
Sometimes it's tough to cope
Came a long way, and with so far to cover
Let me drank with why'all Gs
Moether Nature's seeds keep your eyes open
The seven seas rumbling, bullets they coming
Uh, the devil's shot it, human beings robotic
I'm got my chrome, man
When niggas start disappearing about cloning
Sometimes I feel weak
Mentally I'm one of the firest niggas in the street
With this rap shit I paid my dues
I never thought that I was better than you
Uh, niggas want to die you'll get your wish
Goodbye, you outta here, never coming back
Niggas dying with their straps, uh
I can't adapt, I want a free life
I'm in the dark throw me a light
Blaze ?em high, let's expand
Rule the land, invest with a vest
If you catch a slug to the chest

So much sin each of us has slept in

Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'ma stick around with Russ' and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)

No squealing, remember that it's all in your head

Phi-Life Cypher,"[Life]
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B.
'Cause this one's for your radios or whether you receive me

Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya

We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls,
We've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol

See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver

And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies,
I guess the kids don't live or die

[Si Phili]
'Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
so people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi

We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course

'Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me 'cause my voice is clearer than crystal

The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin',
makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
to rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

[2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate

[Life Si Phili]
Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star,
whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far,
you'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire

See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs
'cause Gorllaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars
We rap stars with supernatural spars
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours

So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down
'Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound

On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
It's like that when we write raps
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

Phi-Life Cypher,"I'm vexed and perplexed like Malcolm X
On stage with chains around their necks
From the thread of the governments evil flex
I'm taking steps against the kind of lies they try to bring me
As a ? soldier with ?
Daily papers they're just propaganda scriptures from the government
It's not the daily news, it's the daily satanical supplement
Cause they don't deal with holy testaments just war and pestilence
Can I get a witness I don't need one in fact there's too much evidence
Spying on the people lying evil little devils
They're recruiting demon soldiers while they execute our rebels
CCTV cameras set up on no man's borders
They're not for law and order, they're Lucifer's camcorders
Politicians they're not concord borders they're using flying saucers
Decide to take to the sky or travel underwater
Chameleon type reptilians moving they're tongues like geckos
And they're trying to turn our ghettos into over sized death rows
You want heroin there's tons of that, guns and crack
But who's got the funds and cash the same people who supply guns to Iraq
They're pimping the public like rent boys prostitutes and hookers
Bringing strain to the brain as you remain in this giant pressure cooker
Behind your back trying to took your promise the world and overlook us
Spreading the evil love of Beelzebub, these human race butchers
Mankind destroyers, life I'm chasing those Freemasons
Chasing 'em back to the place of birth to reverse all of their creations
Scientists give us fabrication of mathematical equations
But the square root of my truth will cause the devil devastation

Well listen I'm more than vexed
I live in a time where I can't afford to flex
The police are stopping and searching just like some illegal border checks
You better beware we're living inside of lucifers era
My cypher's been scientifically sent back in time to prepare ya
So start stoning the Babylonians to show you're controlling then
Cause this Babylon been fueling my anger just like petroleum
I'm scolding them with the hard rhymes from a scarred mind
From living amongst the hard times
Where people just working through all of the serpentine
The devils disciple that stifle our plans for freedom
If wee keep conforming to all these laws set by the demons
They're thinking they're intellects
By plugging the whole world with the internet
If they thinking they got me they're information be incorrect
I'm using my third eye to guide I through the wilderness
Cause the system in Babylon's bad and there's enough people that's skilled in this
I'm vexed with the devils descendents with paganist pendants
For having the lack of faith and a disregard for repentance
My lyrical sentence is longer than people that's charged for child sex
Cause all the disordered leaders are into having a wild flex
I'm vexed with the government sects for giving this minimum wage
And working this nine 'til five bringing heat to my simmering rage
I spit this lyrical wisdom to charge down the Babylon systems
The rebellious Rastafarian that's flinging his fist to the system

Listen Atti if the devil tries to take Selassie
Put some you lose more blood than the face of Arturo Gati
I'm a raw rhyming anti smoking idol keeping it tribal
While reading pages of the bible to gain vision as a disciple
Studying at rasta night school while using my tongue as a rifle
Sniping you worse than the bible cause life I'm all about survival
I spitting my violent recitals so bright that they melt your eyeballs
Turning the Anti-Christ suicidal wrestle the devil like Shawn Michaels
The clash of the titans will over crush the devil and take his title
Phi-Life will remain his messengers cause a rasta revival
No time to idle the rastas are rising black we come to wipe out crack
Paint the Whitehouse black and speak real fast to the children
Expose our government foes who know the truth will never be told
They teach the people the root of all evil while they're stashing all of the gold
Attacking their souls and spirits until your life is finished
Phi-Life I spit the righteous lyrics
Chained the minds of the cynics held the blind endemic
Cause when I talk my vocal is blessed with holy powers
Making the devils cower while shaking the foundations of the Babylon tower
I terminate them like T2 when I spit my scriptures in Hebrew
A politicians not an honest man like a hologram he be see-through
Trying to deceive you lead you up the path so that they can feed you
Phi-Life I'm a friend of races representing the rasta nation
So when we flex on a rhythm we draw on the powers of the law of exorcism
Inject the rhythm of the holy serum purify all the fat cats
Who experiment on innocent lives of people like they were monkeys or lab rats

My sound tear the transponders out of your pounds
And explode Babylon satellites that scanning down to the ground
With the type of coast to reveal we're living under a microscope
My cipher be strangling Babylonians with the tightest rope
I'm fringing the violence you can fuck with living with silence
Cause before long they be forcing us into buying a breathing license
I'm dissing authority with my forces of purity
I piss in the parliament and I fart on the face of conformity
I never fill in the government census they cunningly sent us
It's asking me information like what I ate for my breakfast
Cause we the Messiah that's bringing more fire to the empire
With the type of tribal recitals that's setting Satan on fire
We're culling the paganist shaman the Phi-Life Cypher will slay them
Reveal the seventh seal to start the freemason complaining
With positive action infiltrates into paganist factions
I smashing your PlayStation and all these tools of distraction
With adequate satisfaction I smashing Babylon's walls
To stop all the gat cat bureaucrats from giving it all",Ghetto Rebels,2002

Set your mind at ease baby

Though I want it X'ed in my unconditional love

Still honey I'm not afraid to call you friend
Take a look and I know you'll see the possibilities

If you be my buddy I will toast
That we're like Ethel Merts and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mines and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' less Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby

Miss Crabtree I hope that you're not mad at me
Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the

Q to her tip

On the A side and sometimes the flip
(Gotta gotta flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Oh let loose the juice)

So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Phil Baker,"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows, it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby, one more time again, now

Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain now
Na na na. Na na na na na na na na na na. Na na na na na na na na

In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Two heavenly hermits we will be in truth
When we're alone.

We'll see life's mad pattern
As we view old Manhattan
Then we can thank our lucky stars
That we're living as we are.

In our little penthouse we'll always contrive
To keep love and romance forever alive
In view of the Hudson just over the drive,

Dans tes yeux et sur ton cœur
Pour pouvoir enfin te dire
Que de te voir c'est mon bohneur

L'absence habite dans ma maison
Où flottent encore toutes ces odeurs
Que tu laissais par déraison
Traîner partout comme des rumeurs

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi
Quand avec lui du corps à corps
Fais-tu l'amour à haute voix

Est-ce qu'il t'écris de belles chansons
Avec un morceau de son cœur
Comme moi est-ce qu'il demande pardon
Lorsqu'il a fait couler tes pleurs

Tu m'avais dit avant d'partir
Surtout ne m'oublie pas trop vite
J'tai vu t'éloigner sans rien dire
Comme un bêtise qu'on prémédite

Il y a encore le téléphone
Où quelquefois je peux appeler
Mais ta voix dans le microphone
Est juste là pour m'faire pleurer

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi
Quand avec lui du corps à corps
Fais-tu l'amour à haute voix

Est-ce qu'il t'écris de belles chansons
Avec un morceau de son cœur
Comme moi est-ce qu'il demande pardon
Lorsqu'il a fait couler tes pleurs

Je tourne en rond j'ai mal partout
J'entends tes pas dans l'escalier
C'est seulement le voisin du d'sous
Il faut que j'arrête d'y penser

Il y a toujours les mêmes images
De tes velours sur ce grand lit
Tous ces cadeaux comme des mirages
Que tu offres maintenant à lui

Avec qui tu vis avec qui tu dors
Est-il aussi gentil que moi
Quand avec lui du corps à corps
Fais-tu l'amour à haute voix

Phil Barney,"C'était le mois de février
Ton ventre était bien rond
C'est vrai qu'on l'attendait
On voulait l'appeler Jason

Ce matin là, il faisait froid
J'avais rendez-vous au studio
Et tout en soufflant sur mes doigts
J'disais l'petit sera un verseau

Avoir un seul enfant de toi
Ça faisait longtemps que j'attendais
Le voir grandir auprès de toi
C'est le cadeau dont je rêvais
Qu'il ait ton sourire, ton regard
Quand tu te lèves le matin
Avec l'amour et tout l'espoir
Que j'ai quand tu me tiens la main

Et puis on m'a téléphoné
Et moi bien sûr, j'ai tout quitté
Les chœurs, les cuivres et la rythmique
J'devenais papa, c'était magique

Puis le taxi m'a déposé
Devant la porte de la clinique
Et comme un fou je suis monté
Garçon ou fille c'était critique

Avoir un seul enfant de toi
Ça faisait longtemps que j'attendais
Le voir grandir auprès de toi
C'est le cadeau dont je rêvais
Qu'il ait ton sourire, ton regard
Quand tu te lèves le matin
Avec l'amour et tout l'espoir
Que j'ai quand tu me tiens la main

On m'a tendu un paquet d'langes
Dans lequel petit homme dormait
Puis on m'a dit, d'une voix étrange
Que c'était tout ce qui m' restait

Tout le monde était très gentil
Et moi je ne comprenais pas
Que dans son cœur y' avait la vie
Et qu' dans le tien, il faisait froid

Ça fait dix ans qu' t'as fais le vide
Dix ans qu'tu n'es plus là
C'est le p'tit homme qui compte mes rides
Il dit qu'il t'aime à travers moi

Personne depuis n'a pris ta place
L'enfant est là et j' l'aime pour deux
Ton image est bien trop vivace
Et c'est bien celle que j'aime le mieux

Phil Barney,"Tous ces matins sans oiseaux
Toutes ces images ces photos
Me font encore pleurer sur ta peau

Qu'est ce tu crois
Qu' j'ai pu t'oublier un jour
Entre Manille et Cherbourg
Tu crois ça, n'y crois pas

J' t'ai dans la tête tatouée comme la folie
Mais côté coeur j'ai toujours été fantaisie

Et le souvenir que j'ai de toi
C'est d' l' amour fou qui bat, qui bat
Comme la musique de Carlos Mandelli

Et le souvenir que j'ai de toi
C'est d' l'amour fou tu l' croirais pas
C'est romantique comme Bahia sous la pluie

J' prends l' bateau dans deux heures
Madagascar en skipper
Il m' faudrait plusieurs tours du monde
Pour qu' j'oublie

Que j' me r' gardais dans tes yeux
Que j' dormais dans tes cheveux
Drôle de jeu, drôle de vie

J' t'ai dans la tête comme
Une folle symphonie
Mais dans ma tête
J'y pense et puis jamais j'oublie

Et le souvenir que j'ai de toi
C'est d' l' amour fou qui bat, qui bat
Comme la musique de Carlos Mandelli

Phil Baugh,"Side by side we'll roll along sweetheart you and I
And to you I'll sing this song as the years go passing by
I'm maybe good or I'm maybe bad but you never frown
I couldn't find a sweeter pal if I'd search the whole world around

Blue eyed Elaine you're the sweetest thing and I love you so
And you'll always be the same no matter where we go
We'll travel here we'll travel there and we'll never part
You'll always be my blue eyed Elaine and I'll be your sweetheart

When skies are grey and things go wrong we'll never fret nor sigh
But we'll just keep traveling on without head held up high
And when I gaze into your eyes your heart and soul are plain
And you know the reason why I love you blue eyed Elaine

Phil Beer,"Have you seen the old man in the closed down market
Picking up the papers with his worn out shoes
In his eyes you see no pride and hanging loosely at his side
Yesterdays paper, telling yesterdays news
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old dear who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home, in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

And in the all night cafe at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
And each tea lasts an hour and he wanders home alone
So how can you tell me that you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind

Have you seen the old man outside the seaman's mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
And in the winter city, the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero, and a World that doesn't care
So how can you tell me that you're lonely
And say for you that the sun don't shine
Let me take you by the hand and lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something to make you change your mind",Streets of London,2004

Phil Boroff,"Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds	
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.

Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.

Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.

I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down cause she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.

Early next morning about a half past nine
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court

Into the court room my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about.

In about five minutes in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree	
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be",Cocaine,2007

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
An' the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

In the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chaineded an' cheated by pursuit
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flared
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",Chimes of Freedom,1996

Singing ""Praise him, praise him"" 
""We heed not flatterers,"" he cried
""By our command, waters retreat
Show my power, halt at my feet"" 
But the cause was lost, now cold winds blow

Far from the north, overcast ranks advance 
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn
The waves surround the sinking throne 
Singing ""Crown him, crown him"" 
""Those who love our majesty, 
Show themselves!"", all bent their knee

But he forced a smile even though his hopes 
Lay dashed where offerings fell
Where they fell

""Nothing can my peace destroy
As long as none smile""

The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand
And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?

I've been so far from here
Far from your warm arms
It's good to feel you again
It's been a long long time
Hasn't it? 

I know a farmer who looks after the farm
With water clear, he cares for all his harvest
I know a fireman who looks after the fire

You, can't you see he's fooled you all
Yes, he's here again
Can't you see he's fooled you all?
Share his peace, sign the lease
He's a supersonic scientist
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary man
Look, look into my mouth he cries
And all the children lost down many paths
I bet my life you'll walk inside 
Hand in hand
Gland in gland 
With a spoonful of miracle
He's the guaranteed eternal sanctuary
We will rock you, rock you little snake
We will keep you snug and warm

Wearing feelings on our faces while our faces took a rest
We walked across the fields to see the children of the West
But we saw a host of dark skinned warriors standing still below the ground

Waiting for battle

The fight's begun, they've been released
Killing foe for peace, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
And they've given me a wonderful potion
'Cause I cannot contain my emotion
And even though I'm feeling good
Something tells me I'd better activate my prayer capsule

Today's a day to celebrate, the foe have met their fate
The order for rejoicing and dancing has come from our warlord

Wandering in the chaos the battle has left
We climb up the mountain of human flesh
To a plateau of green grass, and green trees full of life
A young figure sits still by a pool
He's been stamped ""Human Bacon"" by some butchery tool
He is you

Social Security took care of this lad
We watch in reverence, as Narcissus is turned to a flower
A flower? 

If you go down to Willow Farm
To look for butterflies, flutterbyes, gutterflies
Open your eyes, it's full of surprise
Everyone lies like the fox on the rocks
And the musical box
Oh, there's Mum and Dad, and good and bad
And everyone's happy to be here

There's Winston Churchill dressed in drag
He used to be a British flag, plastic bag, what a drag
The frog was a prince
The prince was a brick, the brick was an egg, the egg was a bird 
(Fly away you sweet little thing, they're hard on your tail) 
Hadn't you heard? (they're going to change you into a human being!) 
Yes, we're happy as fish and gorgeous as geese
And wonderfully clean in the morning

We've got everything, we're growing everything
We've got some in, we've got some out 
We've got some wild things floating about 
Everyone, we're changing everyone
You name them all, we've had them here
And the real stars are still to appear
(All change!) 

Feel your body melt
Mum to mud to mad to dad 
Dad diddley office, Dad diddley office
You're all full of ball
Dad to dam to dumb to mum 
Mum diddley washing, Mum diddley washing
You're all full of ball

Let me hear your lies, we're living this up to the eyes
Ooh, aah, na-na-na 
Momma I want you now

And as you listen to my voice
To look for hidden doors, tidy floors, more applause
You've been here all the time
Like it or not, like what you got
You're under the soil (the soil, the soil)
Yes, deep in the soil (the soil, the soil, the soil!)
So we'll end with a whistle and end with a bang 
And all of us fit in our places

With the guards of Magog, swarming around
The Pied Piper takes his children underground
Dragons coming out of the sea
Shimmering silver head of wisdom looking at me
He brings down the fire from the skies
You can tell he's doing well by the look in human eyes
Better not compromise, it won't be easy

666 is no longer alone
He's getting out the marrow in your backbone
And the seven trumpets blowing sweet rock and roll
Gonna blow right down inside your soul
Pythagoras with the looking glass reflects the full moon
In blood, he's writing the lyrics of a brand-new tune

And it's hey babe, with your guardian eyes so blue
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true?
I've been so far from here, far from your loving arms
Now I'm back again
And babe, it's gonna work out fine

Can't you feel our souls ignite?
Shedding ever-changing colours
In the darkness of the fading night
Like the river joins the ocean
As the germ in a seed grows 
We have finally been freed to get back home

There's an angel standing in the sun
And he's crying with a loud voice
""This is the supper of the mighty one""

Phil Collins,"A carved oak table, 
Tells a tale 
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold, 
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room to arbors cool. 

A time of valor, and legends born 
A time when honor meant much more to a man than life 
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong 
Through lance and sword. 

Why, why can we never be sure till we die 
Or have killed for an answer, 
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe 
That no race has been grander 
It seems because through time and space 
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore. 

A dusty table 
Musty smells 
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor 
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey 
That scars the panes. 
Gone the carving, 
And those who left their mark, 
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway 
And the weak must die according to nature's law 
As old as they.

Has life again destroyed life, 
Do they play elsewhere, do they know 
More than their childhood games? 
Maybe the lizard's shed its tail, 
This is the end of man's long union with Earth.

Phil Collins,"Mad Man Moon
Was it summer when the river ran dry, 
Or was it just another dam. 
When the evil of a snowflake in June 
Could still be a source of relief. 
O how I love you, I once cried long ago, 
But I was the one who decided to go. 
To search beyond the final crest, 
Though I'd heard it said just birds could dwell so high. 

So I pretended to have wings for my arms 
And took off in the air. 
I flew to places which the clouds never see, 
Too close to the deserts of sand, 
Where a thousand mirages, the shepherds of lies 
Forced me to land and take a disguise. 
I would welcome a horse's kick to send me back 
If I could find a horse not made of sand. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain? 
That must have been another of your dreams, 
A dream of mad man moon. 

Hey man, 
I'm the sand man. 
And boy have I news for you; 
They're gonna throw you in gaol 
And you know they can't fail 
'cause sand is thicker than blood. 
But a prison in sand 
Is a haven in hell, 
For a gaol can give you a goal 
[and a] goal can find you a role 
On a muddy pitch in Newcastle, 
Where it rains so much 
You can't wait for a touch 
Of sun and sand, sun and sand... 

Within the valley of shadowless death 
They pray for thunderclouds and rain, 
But to the multitude who stand in the rain 
Heaven is where the sun shines. 
The grass will be greener till the stems turn to brown 
And thoughts will fly higher till the earth brings them down. 
Forever caught in desert lands one has to learn 
To disbelieve the sea. 

If this desert's all there'll ever be 
Then tell me what becomes of me. 
A fall of rain?

For an hour a man may change
For an hour her face looks strange

Marching to the promised land
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand
Pulls you down on your knees
While you're down a pool appears
The face in the water looks up
And she shakes her head as if to say
That it's the last time you'll look like today

Sail away, away

Sail away, sail away

Is sinking fast, that happens you know

He'd left and let nobody know. 
Gone were the towers he had known from a child, 
Alone with the dream of a life 
He traveled the wide open road, 
The blinkered arcade, 
In search of another to share in his life. 
Nowhere. 
Everyone looked so strange to him. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried 

And wept as they led him away to a cage 
Beast that can talk, read the sign. 
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame 
And questioned his story again. 
But soon they grew bored of their prey 
Beast that can talk? 
More like a freak or publicity stunt. 
Oh 
No. 

They've got no horns and they've got no tail 
They don't even know of our existence. 
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold 
That lies in the deep distance, he cried

There, beyond the bounds of you weak imagination 
Lie the noble towers of my city, bright and gold. 
Let me take you there, show you a living story 
Let me show you others such as me

And his crazy description of home. 
After many days journey we came to a peak 
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out. 
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw 
A spire of gold - no, a trick of the eye that's all,

But she don't know it's her body, not her mind

And she's got a heart must be made of stone 
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone 
She says 
""Who said I would, tell me, who said I would 
Who said I would, who said I would?""
Who said I would?
Who said I would?

Phil Collins,"We said goodbye to a dear old friend
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad
It's the only way
We said hello as we turned the key
A new roof over our heads
Gave a smile
It's the only way
Only way

Turn your head
And don't look back
Set your sails for a new horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there oh

Well it really don't matter much where you are
'Cause home is in your heart
It's a feeling that you wake with one day
Some people keep running all their life
And still find they haven't gone too far
They don't see it's the feeling inside
The feeling inside oh

Turn your head and don't look back
Just set your sails for a new horizon
Don't turn around don't look down
Oh there's life across the tracks
And you know it's really not surprising
It gets better when you get there

We said hello as we turned the key
A new roof over our heads

Phil Collins,"You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives

Well, I held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger

Well, you have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day I might (I might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Separate lives",Separate Lives (Love Theme from White Nights),1985
Phil Collins,"You use me to get you anything you wanted.
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby,
And your other friend can get you what you want now.
If I go through those same things again,
I'll be worse off than I started.

[Chorus:]
Girl, you're such a bad influence
And you've got ways to make me do what you want.
Girl, you're such a bad influence,
I've got to stay away.

I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,
And it's you pretty baby,
I've just got to stay away from.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad that we parted.

[Chorus]

Somebody please, you've got to help me break away.
You know I don't like this lonely feeling.
It wasn't meant to be this way.
I won't go through those same things again,
I'm so glad we parted.

You're such a bad influence,
And I have got to stay away.

Phil Collins,"All along, had to talk about it,
Like a two-edged sword, he touched you and it stabs me
All along, knew you were a phony girl,
Sit behind the mask where you control your world

Yesterday he had you in his arms
When I'm holding you, I feel his bitter charms
I can't judge what you do to me
Camoflage the truth, indulge your fantasy

Who do you love?  Is it me now, is it him babe?  I don't know
Who do you love?  Is it me babe, is it him now?  I don't know

There is nothing in your eyes that's the way you cry
All is grand, all is bright  You're just studying my mind
There is nothing in your eyes that's the way you cry
All is grand, all is bright  You're just studying my mind

Was I invited to your masquerade?
Well the party's over so now take off your face
You say you love, but it's hard to see
When you're in his arms, throwing rocks at me

I walk around suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
The truth is news, I have longed to trace
So take off the mask so I can see your face

Who do you love?  Is it me baby, is it him now?  I don't know
Who do you love?  Is it me babe, is it him baby?  I don't know
Who do you love?  Is it me babe, is it him now?  I don't know
Who do you love?  Is it me now, is it him baby?  I don't know

Who do you love?  Is it me baby, is it him now?  I don't know

Phil Collins,"I saw you in a dream, it hit me like a bright light
Flashing on a screen, visions of my whole life.
I used to chase the moment of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire.

[Chorus:]
It was just a, nothing but a grand illusion.
Heart was quicker than the eye.
Nothing but a grand illusion,
Legend in my own mind.

I held you in my arms till the other side of midnight.
Kept you in my mind, you got me through some long nights.
Standing on the threshold of desire,
Caught between the madness and the fire.

[Chorus]

It was all a grand illusion.
Hand was quicker than the eye.
Nothing but a grand illusion,
Legends in our own minds.

I used to chase the moments of desire
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire.

It was just a, nothing but a, it was all a grand illusion.
Nothing but a grand illusion.
It was all a grand illusion,
Legend in my own mind.

It was just a grand illusion.
Nothing but a grand illusion.
It was just a grand illusion,
Legend in our own mind.",Grand Illusion,1986
Phil Collins,"Deep down in the dead of night I call out your name.
It seems now that nothing is right, there's nothing but pain.
If only I'd told you I love you, now all I can do is

[Chorus:]
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling.
I don't feel right on this sad night.
Lord, I've got thistles growing in my pillow.

If you could believe in me, then I could be strong,
And then we could set our love free and right all these wrongs.
You'll know when I touch you how much you still mean to me, baby.

[Chorus]

Hold on, hold on.

Just give me one more chance.
Please give me one more chance.
Don't tell me our romance is through.

Hold on, hold on to the feeling.
You've got to hold on, hold on to the feeling.
Hold on, hold on to the feeling.",Hold On,1986
Phil Collins,"Holy Mother, where are you?
Tonight I feel broken in two.
I've seen the stars fall from the sky.
Holy mother, can't keep from crying.

Oh I need your help this time,
Get me through this lonely night.
Tell me please which way to turn
To find myself again.

Holy mother, hear my prayer,
Somehow I know you're still there.
Send me please some peace of mind;
Take away this pain.

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you.

Holy mother, hear my cry,
I've cursed your name a thousand times.
I've felt the anger running through my soul;
All I need is a hand to hold.

Oh I feel the end has come,
No longer my legs will run.
You know I would rather be
In your arms tonight.

When my hands no longer play,
My voice is still, I fade away.
Holy mother, then I'll be
Lying in, safe within your arms.",Holy Mother,1986
Phil Collins,"I was ready to take a chance,
I found myself a new romance.
Then you call that same old night,
Always change my mind.

Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.

[Chorus:]
Just when I thought it was over, you come back
And I'm hung up on your love again.
Just when I thought I was free, you come back.
Now I'm hung up on your love again.

Just as I was doing good,
You come back, just to prove you could.
Things will always be the same,
With me the victim of the game.

Oh no, not again.
Oh no, not again.


[Chorus: x4]",Hung Up on Your Love,1986
Phil Collins,"Don't change your mind,
I ain't got the time to sit and wonder.
I'm doing fine.
If you decide to leave, I won't go under.

You know I've come this far without you
It won't be too hard to be alone.
I've got choices all around me,
So I won't be spending too much time at home.

[Chorus:]
Girl, I'm gonna miss you.
I'm gonna miss you, baby.
I can't forgive you,
Still I'm gonna miss you, baby.

No, don't say a word.
I already heard that you don't love me.
In your state of mind,
I don't need to hear your side of the story.

Your friends all said we had a future
And I don't think I really want to know.
My friends keep telling me to lose you
And how glad they'll be when you decide to go.

[Chorus]

I broke my back to make you happy.
Sometime, somehow, someone's got to care.
If you think you're better off without me,
Just remember, it's a dirty world out there.

[Chorus]

I'm gonna miss the ground you walk on,
Gonna miss the air you breathe.
I'm just not quite happy, baby,
'bout your crazy plans to leave.",Miss You,1986
Phil Collins,"[Chorus:]
If I don't take a chance,
If I don't make a move,
If I don't go looking for new romance,
How will I ever find my groove?

If I don't play around,
How am I gonna have my fun?
If I tried to settle down,
Would I be fooling anyone?

I'm out on a limb above a sea of bliss;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.

And I feel so free today.
You know I feel so free today.
That's right, I feel so free, no matter where I go,
But I feel so free today.

If I don't make mistakes,
If I don't play the fool,
If I have to worry 'bout the heart I break,
How am I ever gonna learn the rules?

I'm looking for danger inside the sweetest smile;
I don't know why I feel this way.
I only know I love it.
