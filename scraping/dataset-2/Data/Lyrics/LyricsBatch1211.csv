Tommy Hill,"I'd like to be the picture on your mantel 
I'd like to be the window in your door
I'd like to be the feather on your pillow 
I'd even like to be the carpet on your floor
I'd like to be the star outside your window 
That lucky chair that holds you every night
The puppy pop you warm up every morning 
I'd even like to be the apple that you bite
And if you need someone to talk with 
I'd like to be the little voice inside
And if you'll ever have a heartache 
I want to be the tear you hide
I'd like to the be the record on your phonograph 
The melody that action night and day
And when you're old enough to want to marry
I'd like to be the one who steals your heart away

And if you need someone to talk with...",I'd Like to Be [#],1987

And sing one of favourite sacred songs
Tonight I've chosen one that's long been a favourite of mine
And I hope it's one of your favourites
Softly and Tenderly

Softly and tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portal
He's watching and waiting
Waitin' for you and for me

Come home...
Come ho-ome
He who are wary
Come ho-ome
Ernestly, tenderly
Jesus is calling
Calling, oh sinner
Come home

Tommy Hill,"All around the water tank waitin' for a train
A thousand miles away from home sleepin' in the rain
I walked up to a brakeman just to give him a line of talk
He said if you've got money I'll see that you don't walk
I haven't got a nickel not a penny can I show
Get off get off you railroad bum he slammed the boxcar door

Well he put me off in Texas a state I dearly love
The wide open spaces all around me the moon and stars up above
Nobody seems to want me or lend me a helping hand
I'm on my way from Frisco goin' back to Dixie Land
My pocketbook is empty my heart is full of pain
I'm a thousand miles away from home waitin' for a train",Waiting for a Train [#],1987
Tommy Hill,"When god dips his pen of love in my heart
And writes my soul a message, he wants me to know
His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
When god dips his love in my heart

Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry
It sets my sinful soul on fire
When god dips his love in my heart

Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
I go to god in prayer, I can always find him there
He whispers sweet peace to my soul

Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
Well, it makes me laugh, it makes me cry
It sets my sinful soul on fire, alleluia
When god dips his love in my heart

Well, I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul
How he brought salvation when he made me whole

When god dips his love in my heart",When God Dips His Love in My Heart [#],1987
Tommy Hill,"Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone
And I'll bid her my last farewell

I fell in love with a pretty little thing
I thought that wedding bells would ring
She was as sweet as sweet could be
'Till I found out what she did to me

Railroad, steamboat, river and canal
Yonder comes a sucker, and he's got my gal
And she's gone, gone, gone
And she's gone, gone, gone

She whispered, Mother, please tell him no
Though he may think that I am true
There're plenty more who think so too

And she's gone, gone, gone

Some other sucker will have to pay
And when he finds that she is gone
I guess I'll hear him sing this song

Tommy Hill,"Far across the blue waters
Lives an old German's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
But I can't forget her
'Cause I miss my pretty Fraulein
 
Fraulein, Fraulein
Look up toward the heavens each night
When the stars seem to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein
 
When my memories wander
Away over yonder
To the sweetheart that I left behind
In a moment of glory
A face comes before me
The face of my pretty Fraulein

Walk down by the river
Pretend that your hand's holding mine
By the same stars above you
I swear that I love you

Tommy Körberg,"This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
Nothing I say will convince him this isn't a trick.
A drink on a clear moonlit night, I relax, she smiles
There's something unpleasant going on

So with immaculate timing, I'm left to carry the can
Embarrassed, outnumbered, marooned

Now she can't be working for them, I mean us
She seems so very straightforward but where is he?
He has to come back, he wanted this meeting, well, didn't he?
Maybe he's scared, just as scared as he was in the game

Oh, I just couldn't care less
He can go right ahead, go and wreck his career
I know I've done my best
Well, at least she's a good looking spy

What if my Russian friend thinks that my plans
Are more of an intimate kind?
If I don't say something and soon
He'll go nobody's on nobody's side

Listen, I hate to break up the mood
Get to the point, begin the begin
Haven't you noticed we're a protagonist short
In this idyllic, well produced scene?

All I can say is moments ago
He was right here ready and waiting
Never mind him, I haven't missed him so far

Maybe it won't do any harm
To struggle on without his charm?
Funny how all at once I feel
That he can go jump off the mountain I won't care

This is the one situation I wanted most to avoid
My dear opponent, I really can't imagine why
So I am not dangerous then? What a shame
Oh, you're not dangerous, who could think that of you?

You, you are so strange
Why can't you be what you ought to be?
You should be scheming
Intriguing, too clever by half

I have to hand it to you for you've managed
To make me forget why I ever agreed to this farce
I don't know why I can't think of anything I would rather do
Than be wasting my time on mountains with you

Nu surrar bin, och fåglar sjunger överallt
Nu stryker vinden genom trädens höga kronor
men i min trädgård är det visset, mörkt och kallt
Här är det risigt och förvuxet, fult och snårigt
och lika hopplöst trist och grått som i mitt bröst
Därute doftar det av sommarns alla dofter
Där är det sommar, men härinne är det høst

Jag levde lycklig här med dig och mina katter
ett liv i synd och utan omsorg att bli frälst
Försonad med min karaktär, för jag har aldrig
förmått at säga nej till någonting som helst
Och aldrig nekat mig det ena eller andra
och levat livet, tills jag krossades en dag
Det börja med att du bedrog mig med en anna
en som du sa mar mycket finare än jag

Vårt gräl tog veckor, ropen blandades med gråten
och jag blev grundligt jämförd med din fina vän
tills du bekände att han givit dig på båten
Då blev det dödstyst här i trädgården igen!
Ifrån den stunden var den mannen dubbelt hatad
Han hade lekt med dig, med oss et litet slag
Och jag, jag kände det som även jag var ratad
Jag ville slåss, och gick mot mitt livs nederlag

Jag hade hammaren beredd under kavajen
när han kom ut i sidenscarf och sa: God dag
Kom in och slå dig ner en stund, så får vi prata
Jag bare stammade, nu minns jag inte vad
Och jag blev bjuden på cognac och på cigarrer
och kunde inte få mig till att säga nej
Och när vi skildes var vi bästisar och bundis
och jag tog saker som du glömt med hem till dig

Jag går omkring i mitt Pompeji, bland ruiner
jag trampar runt i resterna utav vårt liv
Men du skall aldrig ge mig pikar om sekiner
och aldrig skall du bli en annans tidsfördriv
Nej, åt det gamla skall vi binda vackra kransar
och ta vårt liv och mina katter som de är
Och trots all kärleks brist och trasighet och fransar
Dig skall jag älska livet ut, dig har jag kär!",Trubbel,2007

Mi dai del negro, dell’immigrato Il tuo pensiero è un po’ limitato
Il mondo è cambiato, non è complicato
“Afroitaliano” per te è un rompicapo
Non sanno chi siamo in questo Stato
Mi vuoi lontano, ho letto il tuo stato
Chi non ci vuole vede solo il colore
La nostra nazione sta scritta nel cuore

Sono Afroitaliano, Afroitaliano
Sono Afroitaliano, Afroitaliano

Questi che ne sanno di file in questura
Delle mille facce della mia cultura
È la melanina ciò che li cattura
Io non ho dei dubbi sulla mia natura
Quando io rappo è in italiano
E anche se parto resto un italiano
La prima volta che ho detto “ti amo”, ti giuro, l’ho fatto in italiano
Gli 883, la Dogo Gang
I cartoni sul 6 con Cristina D'Avena
La scena rap, chi era giù con me
Quando tutta sta gente non mi conosceva
Fanculo i razzisti, quelli della Lega
Ogni 2 Giugno su quella bandiera
Mando una foto ai parenti in Nigeria
Mangiando una fetta di pizza per cena

Sono Afroitaliano, Afroitaliano
Sono Afroitaliano, Afroitaliano

Ma lei si sente più africano o si sente più italiano?
Afroitaliano, perché sono stufo di sentirmi dire cosa sono o cosa non sono
Sono troppo africano per essere solo italiano e troppo italiano per essere solo africano
Afroitaliano, perché il mondo è cambiato

Sono Afroitaliano, Afroitaliano
Sono Afroitaliano, Afroitaliano",#Afroitaliano,2017
Tommy Kuti,"Dove il Presidente ha più gioielli del Papa
Ma c'è chi dorme per strada
Gente che emigra in disparate regioni
Per disperate ragioni
Dici ""arrivo alle 3"", però il treno non passa
E il tuo capo s’incazza
Un lavoro non basta
Sogno un cambiamento, ma la legge non passa
""Non c'è futuro"", lo dice ogni TG
Non sei nessuno se non passi in TV
C'è chi è finito dentro per due grammi di weed
Però se ti rapino esco dopo due G
Ti lamenti quando vedi volti nuovi
Ma se ne vanno tutti e restiamo in pochi
I terremoti, la terra dei fuochi
Tutti alla moda e in fissa per i televoti

Io sono al verde, vado in bianco, ho il conto in rosso
Resto o scappo? Io ti lascio ogni ricordo
La bella Italia
Sono al verde da tanto ormai
Vado in bianco, but I'm alright
Spesso parto, ma poi ritorno
La bella Italia, la bella Italia
La bella Italia, la bella Italia

C'è chi odia il tricolore e tutto ciò che rappresenta
Chi invece è nato altrove ed italiano lo è per scelta
C'è chi usa la testa, c'è chi studia e inventa
Mentre vengon tolti tutti i fondi alla ricerca
Hit estive con tre parole
Quasi sempre sole, cuore e amore
Le veline, le bionde e le more
Quasi sempre con un calciatore
Le spiagge, il Colosseo, Giulietta e Romeo
I dipinti di Giotto e le teorie di Galileo
Balotelli e la doppietta all’Europeo
I paesaggi che ci invidia il mondo intero
Dante Alighieri, i beni UNESCO
Vip e ministri tra seni di escort
L’odio è represso, il dissenso è inespresso
Di prima mattina tutti in fila per l’espresso

Io sono al verde, vado in bianco, ho il conto in rosso
Resto o scappo? Io ti lascio ogni ricordo

Ogni singolo rapper che dice che scopa la tua fidanzata
Stai con la paghetta di mamma, però sei di strada
'Sta tipa è una troia, ma tu ci hai provato e non te l'ha data
Razzista che dice ""'sti negri mandiamoli a casa""
Poi viene beccato appartato con la nigeriana
Figli di sbirri confusi che gridano A.C.A.B
Fai l'impegnato, ma non sei Saviano e nessuno ti caga

Primo rapper nero di 'sto cazzo di stivale
I miei colleghi ora vanno a comandare
Gli rubo il lavoro perché già lo fanno male
Faccio rap senza parlare di spaccio
Suona fresh, ma ogni pezzo ha il suo messaggio
Anche gli hater che mi chiedon come faccio
E i familiari che mi vedon come pazzo
L'Italia è guidata da vecchi, Letterman Show
Per questo che la radio non trasmette l'hip-hop (stronzo)
Ho uno stile mio, guarda, non seguo le mode da mo'
Il mio flow rimbambisce la gente, Pokémon Go
Mi son giocato tutto come Baldini
Sogno l'assegno SIAE della Nannini
Ai concerti tutti quanti fanno ""ooh"", ma non sono bambini
Col cappello e con gli occhiali, porto macello nei locali
Temo nobody, mi sfidi, scompari
Sono l'uomo nero però don't panic
Don't panic!

Aspettano il disco di Tommy
E quelli che mi odiano
Aspettano anche loro il disco di Tommy
Però sapete cosa, non so se siete pronti
Però una cosa che, di cui potete essere certi
È che leggo tutte le vostre conversazioni del cazzo eh
Tutti pettegoli: “Tommy non lo merita“
Rappano come se avessero un handicap
Cattivo sul beat tipo sbirro in America
Rompo le casse, Crash Bandicoot
Questo è il nuovo singolo che non passa in radio
Rapisco Linus così me lo passa in radio
L'italiano medio non capisce il mio linguaggio
Guarda Capatonda e prova a fare il macho
È l'era dei rapper tronisti, c'è chi ha cominciato coi lifting
Mi immagino Biggie che piange dal cielo e dice: ""What is this?!""
Preferisco i purini ai puristi, ma 'sti nuovi artisti son tristi
Non chiudon le rime e hanno pure il coraggio di fare dei dischi
Scrivo il cazzo che mi pare, loro alla cazzo di cane
Becco sempre un rapper in ogni cazzo di talent
Fare il rapper lol, sport nazionale
Grazie al cazzo che Diprè vuole rappare
Prendo e non chiedo, voglio stare longevo
La mia ascesa è un'impresa come quella del Chievo
Io sono online anche se mi scollego
Sono super sciallo finché non mi dici negro

Le multinazionali europee hanno confiscato le terre""

Al quinto piano di un palazzo popolare
Dentro a un monolocale vive Hassan
È un clandestino, gira per le strade
Lotta col destino mentre è solo in 'sta città
Il suo sogno era di fare il calciatore
Infatti è per quello che è che partito da Dakar
Arrivato capì che l’unica opzione
Per quelli come lui, è la criminalità
A fare gli onesti si muore di stenti
La vita è una merda senza I documenti
Si apposta ai parcheggi, smercia quegli etti
Alla fine del mese manda I soldi ai parenti
Di ciò che fa lui non va fiero
Ora è tardi per tornare indietro
Chiama a casa e non può essere sincero
La sua coscienza è sporca proprio come il suo dinero

La city, gli eccessi, la malinconia
Gente che arriva, gente che va via
Stretta è la foglia, larga è la via
Dite la vostra che ho detto la mia

Oh Hassan, cerchi la tua libertà
Tra I vicoli di 'sta città, dove sarà, dove sarà?
Oh Hassan, cerchi la tua libertà
Tra I vicoli di 'sta città, dove sarà, dove sarà?

È fermo in coda, posa come un monumento
Sogna una vita nuova ottenendo un documento
Ogni giorno passa in collocamento
Ma con 'sta crisi è una perdita di tempo
E nella city è una di quelle notti
Hassan è in giro a fare il suo mestiere
Ha due palline, becca due bambocci
Mentre fa l’affare salta fuori il borghese
Scappa dai poliziotti, ha la fame negli occhi
Corre e pensa all'ironia
Uomini onesti, affari loschi
Il destino a volte gioca di follia
Chi odia gli immigrati ciò che han visto non lo sa
Siete fortunati a viver con mamma e papà
Dite no all'immigrazione, ma poi la verità
Se foste nati altrove scappereste come Hassan

La city, gli eccessi, la malinconia
Gente che arriva, gente che va via
Stretta è la foglia, larga è la via
Dite la vostra che ho detto la mia

Oh Hassan, cerchi la tua libertà
Tra I vicoli di 'sta città, dove sarà, dove sarà?

Ai loro contadini gli prendiamo la loro terra

La casa è piena, invece il frigo è vuoto
Andare a scuola e sentirsi fuori luogo
I cugini in ogni angolo del globo
Ogni anno un trasloco, crescere con poco
Condividi quel poco che hai
Il profumo di jollof rice
Arrivo con l’african time
Gli amici l’han capito, è una vita ormai
E la mia nonna che parla solo yoruba
""Non fare l'italiano che sei nato ad Abeokuta""
Rispetta chi più grande, non uscir la notte
Non rispondi ai tuoi perché sai che son botte
Tornare giù per rimanere all'infinito
Sentirmi come se non fossi mai partito
È fratello ogni amico, lei sta in quello che scrivo

Colazioni la domenica con uova e yam
Andare in chiesa obbligati da mamma e papà
Il pastore con la predica, quella vita frenetica
Feste in cui veniva ogni africano della mia città
Il vino che sgorga, il cibo è una bomba
Balli Awilo Logomba, finché il vicino è alla porta
Prendi un brutto voto ed è guerra in famiglia
I tuoi che minacciano: ""We'll send you to Nigeria""
Gli anziani li chiami sempre ""zio"" o ""zia""
Saluto gente che non sa chi io sia
Mamma guarda ancora Nollywood
Poi papà per cena vuole sempre il suo fufu
Le telefonate coi parenti che son giù
Anche in mezzo ai guai dici sempre: ""Life is good""

Tommy Makem,"It was down the glen one Easter morn, to a city fair rode I
There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew

'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew

The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew",The Foggy Dew,
Tommy Makem,"One pleasant evening in the month of June
As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

And if I get drunk, well the money's me own
And them that don't like me, they can leave me alone
I'll tune me fiddle and I'll rosin me bow
And I'll be welcome wherever I go",A  Jug of Punch,
Tommy Makem,"As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced my pistol and I then produced my rapier
Saying ""Stand and deliver"" for he were a bold deceiver

[Chorus]
Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

[Chorus]

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

[Chorus]

There's some take delight in the carriages a rolling
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
but I take delight in the juice of the barley
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

[Chorus]

And if anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenney
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

And carelessly bade her ""Good day""",The Cobbler [*],1961
Tommy Makem,"There was Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me
And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled
The peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five
At us they made a dive for us all to march away
We paid for all the mate that we ate, stood a trait
And went home to ruminate on the spree that day",Johnny McEldoo [*],1961
Tommy Makem,"I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley 

'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley"" 

While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley 

But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow
And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow
As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley",The Wind That Shakes the Barley [*],1961
Tommy Makem,"Maybe someday, I'll go back again to Ireland
If only my dear wife would pass away
She nearly has my heart broke with all her naggin'
She's got a mouth as big as galway bay

See her drinkin' 16 pints of Pat's blue ribbon
And then she can walk home without a sway
If the sea were beer instead of salty water
She would live and die in galway bay

See her drinkin 16 pints at pat joe murphys
When the barman says ""I think its time to go""
She doesn't try to speak to him in gaelic
But a language that the clergy do not know

On her back she has tatooed a map of Ireland
And when she takes her bath on Saturday
She rubs the sunlight soap around by Claddaugh
Just to watch the suds roll down on Galway Bay",Galway Bay,1964
Tommy Makem,"Come all you young rebels, 
And list' while I sing.
For the love of one's country is a terrible thing.
It banishes fear with the the speed of a flame
And it makes us all part of the patriot game.

My name is O'Hanlon, 
And I'm just gone sixteen, 
My home is in Monohan, 
Where I was weened,
I've learned all my life through, 
When England to blame, 
And so I'm a part of the patriot game.

It's barely two years since I wondered away, 
With the local battalion of the bold I-R-A, 
I've read of our heroes and I've wanted the same, 
To play out my part in the patriot game.

This Ireland of ours has for long been half free, 
Six counties are under John Bull's tyranny, 
So I gave up my boyhood to drill and to train, 
To play my own part in the patriot game.

And now as I lie here, 
My body all holes, 
I think of those treasures, 
Who bargained and sold, 
I wish that my rifle had given the same, 
To those quislings who sold out the patriot game.",Patriot Game,1964
Tommy Makem,"He was stranded in a tiny town on Fair Prince Edward's Island
Waiting for a ship to come and find him
A one horse place, a friendly face
Some coffee and a tiny trace of fiddling in the distance far behind him
A dime across the counter there, a shy hello, a brand new friend
And a walk along the street in wintry weather
A yellow light, and open door
A welcome friend there's room for more
And then they're standing there inside together
He said, ""I've heard that tune before somewhere 
But I can't remember when
Was it on some other friendly shore, or did I hear it on the wind?
Was it written on the sky above, think I heard it from someone I loved
I never heard a sound so sweet since then""

And now his feet begin to tap, a little boy says, ""I'll take your hat""
And he's caught up in the magic of her smile
Leap, the heart inside him went, and off across the floor he sent
His clumsy body graceful as a child
He said, ""There's magic in the fiddler's arm, and there's magic in this town
There's magic in the dancers' feet and the way they put them down 
People smiling everywhere, boots and ribbons, locks of hair
And laughter and old blue suits and Easter gowns

The sailor's gone, the room is bare, the old piano's sitting there
Someone's hat's left hanging on the rack
Empty chairs and the wooden floor, that feels the touch of shoes no more
A waiting for the dancers to come back
The fiddle's in the closet of some daughter of the town
The strings are broke, the bow is gone, and the cover's buttoned down
But sometimes on December nights, when the air is cold and the wind is right
There's a melody that passes through the town",Ballad of St. Anne's Reel,1986
Tommy Makem,"Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler

With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-day
With me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy

All it takes is a rake and a hoe,
And a piece of fertile ground.

Inch by inch, row by row,

Someone warm them from below,
'Till the rain comes tumblin' down.

Man is made of dreams and bones,
Feel the need to grow my own,
'Cause the time is close at hand.

Find my way in Nature's chain,

Temper them with prayer and song,

I'll tell me Ma when I go home, 
The boys won't leave the girls alone
They pull my hair, they stole my comb 
But that's all right till I get home
 
She is handsome, she is pretty, she is the belle of Belfast City
She is a-courtin' one, two, three, please won't you tell me who is she?
Albert Mooney says he loves her, all the boys are fightin' for her
They knock on the door, they ring on the bell, say ""Oh my true love are you well?""
Out she comes as white as snow, rings on her fingers, bells on her toes
Oul Johnny Murray says she'll die if she doesn't get the fellow with the rovin' eye

Tommy Makem,"In the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and six,
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand City Hall in New York
We'd an elegant craft, it was rigged 'fore and aft
And how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrells of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrells of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrells of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock
And nearly tumbled over
Turned nine times around then the poor old dog was drowned

Who march with faces drawn,
From farmstead and from fishers' cot, 
Along the banks of Ban;
They come with vengeance in their eyes. 
Too late! Too late are they,

So smiling, proud and young.
About the hemp-rope on his neck, 
The golden ringlets clung;
There's ne'er a tear in his blue eyes, 
Fearless and brave are they,
As young Roddy McCorley goes to die 
On the bridge of Toome today.

When last this narrow street he trod, 
His shining pike in hand
Behind him marched, in grim array, 
A earnest stalwart band.
To Antrim town! To Antrim town, 
He led them to the fray,
But young Roddy McCorley goes to die 
On the bridge of Toome today.

There's never a one of all your dead 
More bravely died in fray
Than he who marches to his fate 
In Toomebridge town today; ray

Tommy Makem,"There was a wild colonial boy, Jack Duggan was his name
He was born and raised in Ireland in a place called Castlemaine
He was his father's only son, his mother's pride and joy
And dearly did his parents love the wild colonial boy

At the early age of sixteen years, he left his native home
And to Australia's sunny shore he was inclined to roam
He robbed the rich, he helped the poor, he shot James McAvoy
A terror to Australia was the wild colonial boy

One morning on the prairie as Jack he rode along
A listening to the mockingbird a singing a cheerful song
Out stepped a band of troopers, Kelly, Davis and Fitzroy
They all set out to capture him, the wild colonial boy

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the wild colonial boy",The Wild Colonial Boy,1990
Tommy Makem,"While in  the merry month of May from me home I started,
Left the girls of Tuam so sad and broken hearted,
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother,
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother,
Then off to reap the corn, leave where I was born,
Cut a stout black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins;
Bought a pair of brogues rattling o'er the bogs
And fright'ning all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary,
Started by daylight next morning blithe and early,
Took a drop of pure to keep me heartfrom sinking;
Thats a Paddy's cure whenever he's on drinking.
See the lassies smile, laughing all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
Asked me was I hired, wages I required,
I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be soon deprived a view of that fine city.
So then I took a stroll, all among the quality;
Me bundle it was stole, all in a neat locality.
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring for the rogue, they said me Connaught brogue
Wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

From there I got away, me spirits never falling,
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing.
The Captain at me roared, said that no room had he;
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy.
Down among the pigs, played some hearty rigs,
Danced some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling;
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead,
Or better for instead on the rocky road to Dublin.

One, two, three four, five,
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
all the way to Dublin, Whack follol de rah !

Well the boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed,
Called meself a fool, I could no longer stand it.
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing;
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing.
""Hurrah me soul"" says I, me Shillelagh I let fly.
Some Galway boys were nigh and saw I was a hobble in,
With a load ""hurray !"" joined in the affray.
We quitely cleared the way for the rocky road to Dublin.

I like a little drink 
To raise up me voice and sing

The landlord's daughters fair
And every night when 
They'd turn out the light 
I would tiptoe up the stair...singin'

Two for the early dew
Three for the man who will stand his round

To go and fight the foe 
And I thought no more

The Morning Glory was her name
And we'd all fall down 
When the rum went 'round, 
Then get up and start again

I bore once more for 
My native shore, 
Farewell to the raging seas
And the Cross Keys Inn, 
It was beckonin',

There were three little girls 
And a bouncing boy, 
And they all looked just like me...

The love that I have chosen was to my heart's content.
The salt sea shall be frozen before that I repent.
Repent it I shall never until the day I die
But the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and I.
The very night we got married and lay upon our bed
A pressgang came to my bedside and stood at my bedhead
Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,
To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in *
Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree
Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament
Is there ne'er a lad in our town can give your heart content?
There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me
For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me
*or (It's a wild inhabitation for my true love to be in)
There shall no mantle cross my back, no comb go through my hair
No firelight nor candlelight shall ease my heart's despair
And I will never married be until the day I die
For the lowlands of Holland have parted my love and me

And cruel was my mother, this dreadful crime to see
Cruel was my own true love to change his mind for gold
Cruel was that winter's night that pierced my heart with cold""

Oh, the taller that the palm tree grows, the sweeter is the bark
And the fairer that a young man speaks, the falser is his heart
He will kiss you and embrace you, 'till he thinks he has you won
Then he'll go away and leave you all for some other one

So come all you pretty fair maids, a warning take by me
And never try to build your nest on top of any tree
For the roots, they will all wither, and the branches all decay
And the beauties of a false young man, must all soon fade away
",The Month of January,1994
Tommy Makem,"""Oh, Mrs. McGrath,"" the sergeant said
""Would you like to make a soldier out of your son Ted
With a scarlett coat and a big cocked hat
Oh, Mrs. McGrath, wouldn't you like that?""

[Chorus]
With your too-ri-a, fol-di-diddle-da, too-ri, oor-ri, oor-ri-a
With your too-ri-a, fol-di-diddle-da, too-ri, oor-ri, oor-ri-a

Now, Mrs. McGrath lived on the sea shore
For the space of seven long years or more
She spied a ship coming into the bay
""Here's my son Teddy, wisha clear the way""

[Chorus]

""Oh captain dear, where have you been
Or have you been sailing on the Mediterranean
Have you any tidings of my son Ted
Is the poor boy living or is he dead?""

[Chorus]

Then up came Ted without any legs
And in their place, he had two wooden pegs
She kissed him a dozen times or two
""Holy Moses, it isn't you""

[Chorus]

""Now were you drunk or were you blind
When you left your two fine legs behind
Or was it walking upon the say
Wore your two fine legs from the knees away?""

[Chorus]

""No, I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind
When I left my two fine legs behind
A big cannon ball on the fifth of May
Tore my two fine legs from the knees away""

[Chorus]

""Oh, Teddy my boy,"" the widow cried
""Your two fine legs were your mammy's pride
Stumps of a tree wouldn't do at all
Why didn't you run from the big cannon ball?""

[Chorus]

""All foreign wars I do proclaim
Between Don John and the King of Spain
I'd rather have my Teddy as he used to be
Than the King of France and his whole navy""

[Chorus]",Mrs. McGrath,1994

(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

",Boulavogue,1994
Tommy Makem,"There was Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me
And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled
The peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five
At us they made a dive for us all to march away
We paid for all the mate that we ate, stood a trait
And went home to ruminate on the spree that day",Johnny McEldoo,1994
Tommy Makem,"The minstrel boy to the war is gone
In the ranks of death you'll find him
His father's sword he hath girded on
And his wild harp slung behind him
""Land of Song!"" cried the warrior bard
(Should) ""Tho' all the world betrays thee
One sword, at least, thy rights shall guard
One faithful harp shall praise thee!""
The Minstrel fell! But the foreman's steel
Could not bring that proud soul under
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again
For he tore its chords asunder
And said ""No chains shall sully thee
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!
Thy songs were made for the pure and free
They shall never sound in slavery!",The Minstrel Boy,1994
Tommy Makem,"I've been a moonshiner for many a year 
And I've spent all me money on whiskey and beer
I'll go to some hollow and I'll set up my still
And I'll make you a gallon for a ten shilling bill

[Chorus:]

I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, 
I'm a long way from home
And if you don't like me 
You can leave me alone
I'll eat when I'm hungry 
And I'll drink when I'm dry
And if moonshine don't kill me 
I'll live till I die

I'll go to some hollow in this country
Ten gallons of wash and I'll go on a spree
No woman to follow and the world is all mine
I love none so well as I love the moonshine

Moonshine dear moonshine oh how I love thee
You killed my poor father but dare you kill me
Bless all moonshiners and bless all moonshine
For their breath smells as sweet as the dew on the vine",The Moonshiner,1994
Tommy Makem,"Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all",The Parting Glass,1994

Guns and pikes are dangerous toys.

They made poor England weep her fill,

And won't Mother England be surprised?",Whack Fol the Diddle,1994
Tommy Makem,"I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love
The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly
While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley 

'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley"" 

While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley 

But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow
And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow
As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early
With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley",The Wind That Shakes the Barley,1994
Tommy Makem,"In the year of our Lord, eighteen hundred and six,
We set sail from the Coal Quay of Cork
We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks
For the grand City Hall in New York
We'd an elegant craft, it was rigged 'fore and aft
And how the trade winds drove her
She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover

There was Barney Magee from the banks of the Lee
There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrells of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrells of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrells of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock
And nearly tumbled over
Turned nine times around then the poor old dog was drowned

Tommy Makem,"As I roved out on a May morning
On a May morning right early
I met my love upon the way
Oh, Lord but she was early

And she sang lilt-a-doodle, lilt-a-doodle, lilt-a-doodle-dee,-
And she hi-di-lan-di-dee, and she hi-di-lan-di-dee and she lan- day

Her boots were black and her stockings white
And her buckles shone like silver
She had a dark and a rolling eye
And her ear-rings tipped her shoulder

""What age are you my bonny wee lass
What age are you my honey?""
Right modestly she answered me
""I'll be seventeen on Sunday""

Where do you live my honey?""
""In a wee house up on the top of the hill
And I live there with my mammy""

When the moon was shining clearly
Would you arise and let me in
And your mammy not to hear you?""

When the moon was shining clearly

Will you marry me now or never?
Will you marry me now my soldier lad

And scorn not the strains of his old, withered hands
But remember his fingers, they once could move sharper
To raise up the memory of his dear native land

At a fair or a wake, I could twist my shillelagh
Or trip through a jig with my brogues bound with straw
And all the pretty colleens around me assembled
Loved their bold Phelim Brady, the bard of Armagh

Oh, how I long to muse on the days of my boyhood
But four score and three years have flitted since then
But they bring sweet reflections, as every young joy should
For, the merry hearted boys makes the best of old men

And when sergeant death, in his cold arms shall embrace me
And lull me to sleep with sweet Erin go bragh
By the side of my Kathleen, my young wife then place me

A butcher boy, I loved right well
He courted me, my life away
But now with me, he will not stay

I wish I was a maid again
A maid again I ne'er will be

I wish my baby it was born
And smiling on its daddy's knee
And me poor girl to be dead and gone

She went upstairs to go to bed
And calling to her mother said
""Give me a chair 'til I sit down
And a pen and ink 'til I write down""

And at every line cried ""Willie dear
Oh, what a foolish girl was I
To be led astray by a butcher boy""

He went upstairs and the door he broke
He found her hanging from a rope
He took his knife and he cut her down
And in her pocket, these words he found

And in the middle, a turtle dove

For three score or more in this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffey down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
Of all the trade's that's going, sure begging is the best
For when a man is tired, he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
Only cut around the corner with his old rig-a-doo

I slept in the barn, down at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who did I waken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""boo
Aarah, don't be afraid mam it's only Johnny Dhu""

I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
""Good morning little flaxy-haired girl"" I did say
""Good morning little beggarman, a how do you do
With your rags and you tags and you old rig-a-doo""
I'll buy a pair of leggings, a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I'll fetch by and by
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll colour them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the road with my pack on my back
Over the fields with my great heavy sack
With holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o and old Johnny Dhu
I must be going to bed for it's getting late at night

As I was sitting with my glass and spoon
A small bird sat on an ivy bunch
And the song he sang was ""The Jug Of Punch""

What more diversion can a man desire
Than to sit him down by a snug turf fire?
Upon his knee a pretty wench
And on the table a jug of punch

Let the doctors come with all their art
They'll make no impression upon my heart
Even the cripple forgets his hunch
When he's snuggled 'side a jug of punch

Bold, brave and undaunted was young Brennan on the moor

He met the mayor of Cashiell a mile outside of town
The mayor he knew his features and he said, Young man, said he
Your name is Willie Brennan, you must come along with me
Now Brennan's wife had gone to town provisions for to buy
And when she saw her Willie she commenced to weep and cry
Said, Hand to me that tenpenny, as soon as Willie spoke
She handed him a blunderbuss from underneath her cloak
Now with this loaded blunderbuss - the truth I will unfold -
He made the mayor to tremble and he robbed him of his gold
One hundred pounds was offered for his apprehension there
So he, with horse and saddle to the mountains did repair
Now Brennan being an outlaw upon the mountains high
With cavalry and infantry to take him they did try
He laughed at them with scorn until at last 'twas said
By a false-hearted woman he was cruelly betrayed
They hanged Brennan at the crossroads, in chains he hung and dried

Tommy Makem,"Oh, me name is Dick Darby, I'm a cobbler
I served my time at ould camp
Some call me an old agitator
But now I'm resolved to repent

With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-doe
With me ing-twing of an ing-thing of an i-day
With me roo-boo-boo roo-boo-boo randy
And me lab stone keeps beating away

Now, my father was hung for sheep stealing
My mother was burned for a witch
My sister's a dandy house-keeper
And I'm a mechanical switch

It's forty long years I have traveled
All by the contents of me pack
Me hammers, me awls and me pinchers
I carry them all on me back

Oh, my wife she is humpy, she's lumpy
Me wife she's the devil, she's cracked
And no matter what I may do with her
Her tongue, it goes clickety-clack

A little before it was day
I dipped her three times in the river
And carelessly bade her ""Good day""",Cobbler's Song,2011
Tommy Mara,"""Romance is a game for fools""
I used to say
A game I thought I'd never play
""Romance is a game for fools""
I said and grinned
Then you passed by
And here am I
Throwing caution to the wind

Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you, my love, my heart above my head.
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me, then I don't care

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Fools rush in where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
When we met, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Fools rush in where wise men never, never, never go
Eh, but wise men never fall in love, so how are they to know?
Ah, when we met, girl, I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in

Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in
Just open up your heart because I-I-I-I-I-I-I am coming in
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in!",Fools Rush In,1998
Tommy Mara,"I remember other days how I used to weep 
Over things you said to me; I couldn't even sleep
You forgot your promises, every single vow
All you did was laugh at me, but things are different now
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be
Now I found two eyes just a little bit bluer
I found a heart just a little bit truer
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
 
How can I forget the hours that I worried through
Wondering the live long day just what next thing to do?
In those days you never thought anything of me
But the slave that was all yours and now at last is free
 
I cried for you; now it's your turn to cry over me
Every road has a turning
That's one thing you're learning
I cried for you; what a fool I used to be

I found a heart just a little bit truer

Tommy Marth,"The emotion it was, electric
And the stars, they all aligned
I knew I had to make my, decision
But I never made the time
No, I never made the time

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

Exoneration lost his, eraser
But my forgiver found the sun
And there are twisted days that I take comfort
Cause I'm not the only one
No, I'm not the only one

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

There is a majesty at my doorstep
There is a little boy in her arms
Now we'll parade around without game plans
Obligations, or alarm

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer
Riding my decision home

In the dark, for a while now
I can't stay, so far
I can't stay, much longer

Tommy Marth,"It's getting close to sundown over the Sierra
Stranded on the freeway burning with desire
She was on the sidewalk looking for a night light
We talked about the real things
And drove into the fire
Headlights on the highway
The desert wind is howling
Rattlesnakes and romance
Is filling with the rain
Candy apple red dress
Bleeding when she kissed me
Heaven in a rag top
Take away my pain

[Chorus]
When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride
Move across the night
Like a separate wind

Pulled up to a motel
""Vacancy"" was buzzing
Pink and dirty neon
Settle on the hood
Wrap your arms around me
Come a little closer
Stumble in the twilight
And fell onto the floor
Loving Mona Lisa
Dreaming of the free world
Lipstick on the nightstand
And demons at the door

[Chorus]

When your hopes and dreams
Lose the will to go
Joyride
Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win

There's something in the distance
A glorious existence
A simple celebration
A place you've never been before
Tell me that you wanna go

Reaching for the light
Knowing we can't win

When your chips are down
When your highs are low
Joyride

All your hopes and dreams
All you need to know

Tommy Marth,"Console me in my darkest hour
Could this be that the truth is always gray
Caress me in your velvet chair
Conceal me from the ghost you cast away

I'm in no hurry, you go run
And tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill their heads with rumors of impending doom
It must be true

Console me in my darkest hour
And tell me that you'll always hear my cries
I wonder what you got conspired
I'm sure it was the consolation prize

I'm in no hurry, you go run
And tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill the night with stories, the legend grows
Of how you got lost

But you made your way back home
You sold your soul, like a Roman vagabond yeah

I heard you found a wishing well
In the city
Console me in my darkest hour (in my darkest hour)
And you throw me down

I'm in no hurry, you go run
And tell your friends I'm losing touch
Fill your crown with rumors
Impending doom, it must be true

But you made your way back home
You sold your soul, like a Roman vagabond

And all that now you got lost, but you made your way back home
You went and sold your soul, an allegiance dead and gone

Tommy Martin,"On the first day on January,
Eighteen ninety-two,
They opened Ellis island and they let
The people through.
And the first to cross the threshold
Of that isle of hope and tears,
Was Annie Moore from Ireland
Who was all of fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

In a little bag she carried
All her past and history,
And her dreams for the future
In the land of liberty.
And courage is the passport
When your old world disappears
But there's no future in the past
When you're fifteen years

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.
That isle of hunger, isle of pain,
Isle you'll never see again
But the isle of home is always on your mind.

When they closed down Ellis Island
In nineteen forty-three,
Seventeen million people
Had come there for sanctuary.
And in springtime when I came here
And I stepped onto it's piers,
I thought of how it must have been
When you're fifteen years.

Isle of hope, isle of tears,
Isle of freedom, isle of fears,
But it's not the isle you left behind.

I rode through the valley with the princess by my side
The Duke and the Duchess was there to meet me with a smile

Alice was there in a Wonderland
Staring far away
The three blind mice was there with me
To tell the Teddybear the tale

Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!
Blue moon!

Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1987

my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue

Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

We dreamed of tomorrow
Now he is gone

In the water blue
I see his hair

Jag gömde mig I fantasin
Så rädd för vad do kunde bli
Men var gång som jag ljög för mig
Så såg jag sanningen I dig
Nu står do här idag med allt jag någonsin velat ha
Och hjärtat slår ett slag för var förlorad dag

Säg att do inom dig bär bara kärlekens röst
Och jag ska öppna min dörr och ge dig varje dag igen

Todo lo que te enseñe puedes gozarlo ha su lado
Pero no pienses en mi es un punto ya pasado why olvidado

Llorando de alegría why no de miedo

Todo lo que te enseñe puedes gozarlo ha su lado

So far away from you

And you were on my mind
I said to myself if you were only here
We'd have the best of time

I love London, you would too
There's nothing in the world
That can lift you up
Like a London night can do

I love London, you would too
There's something in the air
That I'd love to share
A London night with you

A special place in another world
A place you'd want to be
On a summer night or on any night
A place you've got to see

On a London night at the stroke of midnight
I could hear old Big Ben chime
If only you could be here too

That can lift you up

It's so strange how time slips away

Did it fade away and die

When I dream of you

And I've been seeing the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream of you

[Chorus]
When I dream of you like dreamers do
I get this way all night and day
When I dream of you like dreamers do
I get this way when I dream of you

When I think of how you made me feel
At time when love was real
And you were mine
I start missing all the times we spent
The words we say, how I never dreamt
I'd get this way when I dream of you

I remember looking in your eyes
I loved that most, those were the times
Heaven never seemed so close
Tears start falling when I dream of you
Can't help but miss the love I knew
When I dream of you",When I Dream of You,1989
Tommy Page,"I never thought I'd ever need someone
As much as I need you
You brighten my day in every way, you make
My life feel so brand new
And every time I think about the way
You make me feel inside
I get a great feeling, the kinda great feeling
You get when you're full of pride
And it all happened at one moment in time
When I realized the greatest gift was mine and

You, you're the best thing that ever happened to me
It's definitely you
I want you to forever stay with me, don't go away
You've made it real easy to see that
You're the best thing that ever happened to me

In my life there are many things that
Bring me up and bring me down
And if I looked all over the world
I don't think I could ever have found
Someone who makes my life worth living
Makes the rainy day seem bright
This is the strongest feeling I've felt
'Cause in my heart, I know it is right
And if you ever left me now
Don't know how I'd go on
I'd do anything that I can somehow
To keep this going on strong
",You're the Best Thing (That Ever Happened to Me),1989
Tommy Page,"I fall to pieces when I hear your name
Well my concentration somehow isn't the same
I think about you from the moment I rise
I see visions of you when I close my eyes
No baby I
I can't see living my life without you next to me

Oh girl, I can't get you outta my mind
Can't get you outta my mind
Hey girl, I think about you all of the time
And I can't get you outta my mind

Sometimes I wish that we could run away
So we could be together every night and day
I'd love to spend my whole life through
On a tropical island all alone with you
Oh we were meant to be in each others arms for eternity

Oh girl, I can't get you outta my mind
Can't get you outta my mind
Hey girl, I think about you all of the time
I can't get you outta my mind

You know that I will love you forever
Wherever you are no matter how far
I'll hold you close inside my heart

Can't get you outta my mind

Tommy Page,"I never thought I'd ever get this way
About anyone I'd ever met before
It's been so long since you left that day
You said that you were looking for something more
And as time goes on, I found someone new
But she can't compare
To the love I found in you

[Chorus]
And I, I still believe in you and me
And all the times we once shared
I, I know our love was meant to be
I still believe in you and me

I guess I should have shared with you
All the feelings, I've kept inside
I try to convince myself we're through
But in my eyes it shows, I just can't hide
Well how could you let, something beautiful die
I'll take you to heaven
If you'd just give me one more try

Cause the memory's been worth
All the pain and the hurt
But these jaded thoughts can see
That I still believe in you and me
I know we can make it
If you'd just give me one more try",I Still Believe in You and Me,1991

Now is the time, we say goodbye
I see a tear drop falling from your eye
I hear them call, It's time to go
Oh girl I know I'm gonna miss you so

[Chorus]
No matter where I go
No matter what I do
Deep down in my heart I'll still be close to you
'Cause when the night is long
Still I'll keep holding on
Knowing that you're thinking of me too
I'll never forget you

You stepped away, into the night
The pain inside it cuts me like a knife
We'll meet again, 'cause it's meant to be
Each road you choose will lead you back to me",I'll Never Forget You,1991

It feels like heaven above, so madly in love
You're making me feel brand new
I'm madly in love with you
Warm winds blow and the stars are out
It's the perfect night to tell you about
All the feelings your love has to bring
You're my everything
Every time I'm with you, I'm in ecstasy
'Cause the moments that I share with you
Feel like heaven to me
And lonely times, fade away
As long as you're here to stay",Madly in Love,1991

When I'm down

You come around
Your spirit it helps me to make it through
All the lonely experienecs life has to bring
When you're by me side
I can face anything

Come on, come on, come on, shine on me

I thank God above for giving me your love",My Shining Star,1991
Tommy Page,"No use pretending things could still be right
There's really nothing more to say
I'll get along without your kiss goodnight
Just close the door and walk away

Never gonna fall in love again
I don't want to start with someone new
Cause I couldn't bear to see it end
Just like me and you
No, I never want to feel the pain
Of remembering how it used to be
Never gonna fall in love again

I watch you walk away and I think about the yesterday
We shared but I hold on to the only
Part of you that's there
It's memories, I'm holding on to

I'll be, under the rainbow
I'll stay, under the rainbow

Under the rainbow, I'll be waiting for you
My friends keep telling me that you're never coming
Back again and
They say that you have found another
Where the rainbow ends

But I don't believe, what they're saying is true
So under the rainbow, I keep waiting for you
And even if it's gonna take forever
I'll wait as long as I have to
My dream's for us to be back together
So under the rainbow, under the rainbow, under the rainbow
I'll be waiting for you

I feel you touch me in the night
But that don't mean that I mean something
In your life, baby

I want it to be my face that you see
When you go to sleep at night

Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles

How lovely it was.

Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,

Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,

Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

With alertness when is the fucking sun coming up.

But sun involved shouldn't be much different

An entire existence revolving around what we can't acknowledge.

To find reason, to find comfort.
An unspoken religion in being the all-dominant

We have a short ticket and a lot of it is in hiding
So lets take in what we can for now.

Hide what ""others"" can't understand.

Overachiever that commands attention. 
Brute force of hysterical reasoning's
There will always be a Marfa.

Yet we can't be content with the fact that our brains will never know.

A never ending journey, a technological drawback.

Considered in the experiment of an entire species understanding.

The lady on the hill creates a glorious departure from her everyday life.
Constant swelling of the ankles...A pleasant cry for help...
She began to unfold her story.
A grieving widow mothered this headless wonder.

A perfect crime, that soon lived on. A different life it had to develop...
Gripped by every limb it could hold, the lifeless ideas it grew onto its own.
A much needed surrender.
Trees soon started to grow from what seemed like a lifeless neck...

From a monster to a beauty in quick months...
Its life seemed to be on its way to a rare freedom.
It decided it should take advantage of this idea.

To outdo even the grandest occupant of the town...

Torn to its last life...
How hadn't it noticed a drastic change in the surroundings...
It didn't think anything could go this wrong.

Happiness if constant happiness was all that was given out.

I hear him (her) say.
He (she) says I'm (we're) not ready

Too young so he (she) tells me
He (she) says we'll have to wait.
Why wait till it may be too late?

Can't he (she) realize he (she) drive me wild
Is he (she) made of stone?
Must he (she) always treat me (act just) like a child?

Won't he (she) ever own up
I'm (we're) grown up?

Oh, me and my baby are Goin' Steady,
We ain't married but we're gettin' ready

Now that I've found her I'm gonna keep her;
Finders keepers, losers weepers,
She's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
Well, I've been honky tonkin' 'round
Nearly all my life, 
But now I've got a steady babe 
And I'm gonna make her my wife.
All you Rovin' Ramblers can leave her alone!
Don't even try to date her on the phone!
'Cause she's my baby, she's Goin' Steady with me.
 
Well, now, sweet baby, that we're Goin' Steady,
I'll pull up and ask your daddy 
What he thinks, if you and I are wed.
'Cause I love you and you love me,
We're both as happy as we can be, 
And I hope your daddy will let you go steady with me.
We'll get the ring, then be on our way
To see the preacher man,
And when I say: ""I do, sweetheart!""
I'll slip the ring on your lovin' hand

I'll be yours and you'll be mine,

I got no daddy's smile.

Or sue me when I cry,

I wish that I could die.

Where all blinds can see.

Guess you'll be glad to know 
That I've learned to laugh and smile 
Getting over you was slow 
They say old lovers can be good friends 
But I never thought I'd really see you 
I'd really see you again 

[Chorus] 
I go crazy 
When I look in your eyes 
I still go crazy 
No my heart just can't hide 
That old feeling inside 
Way deep down inside 
Oh baby 
You know when I look in your eyes 
I go crazy 

You say he satisfies you mind 
Tells you all of his dreams 
I know how music that means to you 
I realize that I was blind 
Just when I thought I was over you 
I see your face and it 
Just ain't true 
No it just ain't true

Was three years ago

Now he was down to relyin'
On medicare

Long legged shadows, Mississippi sunset
She was standing like a candle that hadn't been burned yet
The wind was blowing clouds like ashes
Had my hand in my pocket, reaching for my matches
I can see those cotton sheets a dancin'
On her mama's clothesline in my head
From my lips a lucky strike was danglin'
The day was dying in a sea of red

Then came the night warm and dark
Draggin' it's chains across our hearts
The moon was full, the grass was wet
Making us scream, making us sweat
Holding on tight, it was wrong, it was right
Then came the night

There was a time when love was a flower
Now it's a vine that climbing up the tower
And the river just rolls past the garden
Where love won't grow and the ground is hardened
I can hear the ringing mission bell
Telling of the innocence that's dying
A sound that I remember oh so well

Then came the night warm and dark
Draggin' it's chains across our hearts
The moon was full, the grass was wet
Making us scream, making us sweat
Making us cling, making us claw
Making us rise, making us fall
Holding on tight, it was wrong, it was right
Then came the night
Breath on breath, skin on skin
Can't go back there again
Holding on tight, it was wrong, it was right
Then came the night


",Then Came the Night,2002
Tommy Shane Steiner,"There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, ""will work for food""
You know the man
You see him every morning
The one you never give your money to
You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel

There's a man
There's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming from the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony
You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
Come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye

What if she's sent here from heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel
Most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes

Maybe she's an angel
Sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test
You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace

You're not gonna believe this story.  
Picture this: I'm standing in the world's longest line at Starbucks.  
I'm half asleep, I have no make-up on and this guy I've never seen before
taps me on the shoulder.  I turn around and he says:

Did you know there's 35 Starbucks and 3 million people in Atlanta, 
The odds of you and me being in the very same line are staggering.  
Is it coincidence, or is there a power bigger than you and me
That made us both crave a three dollar cup of coffee

How lame is that?  And that's not the end of it.  Before I could say
anything, he goes:

He started singing!  This total stranger is standing there singing
To me in line!  I was so embarrassed.  I'm thinking who is this freak!

I know what you're thinking
You're thinking man this guy's a total freak
You think the case I'm making for destiny is a little weak
Well your shirt is yellow, my shirt is blue, my favorite color's green
Pretty amazing if you know what I mean

Well no, I don't know what that means!  What does that mean?

What a great story to tell our kids

Tommy Sims,"What I wanna say now is a message for the people
Who have storms in your life, we gotta work it out
Let me say it once now then again for those who need it
In these troubled times, let's try to work it out

Anybody ask you tell 'em you don't need a reason
To believe me now, we're gonna work it out
And if you want me then I'll tell them
Like you told me a hundred thousand times we can work it out

Maybe you know how it feels
Maybe sometimes it all comes down to what is real
It ain't always what it seems
Still it's better to believe than to have seen

Let me get you say now with as much as you can feel it
In your own design, we can work it out
Don't you be afraid, child, ain't no reason to conceal it
This is your good time, let's try to work it out
If the spirit moves ya, let it lose ya in the groove of what you know is right

Do you know what I mean?
Is it something you just can't receive?
And it's not what it seems
Still it's better to believe than to have seen

Do you know what I mean?
When I say it comes down to what is real
Maybe it's not what it seems, oh yeah

Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe
Still it's better, still it's better
Still it's better, better to believe

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Tommy Taylor,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow
For I'll remember April and you

Angels composed it for us to dance to.
Our waltz is moonlight trembling with kisses,
Each note a heartbeat throbbing with love.

Our love is Springtime filled with a promise,
Never to fade with the dawn,
And though you are gone
Our waltz will play on.

Tommy Tee,"I live a simple life, I take a day at a time
I spend my mornings with God before I hit the grind
The subtleties of darkness never cease to amaze
As a physical world creates a spiritual haze 

Blinded by distractions
Lost in matterless affairs
Reaching through the darkness
Trusting You will meet me there

Day by day, day by day
Day by day, day by day
Oh dear Lord, three things I pray [one, two, three]
To see thee more clearly [day by day]
To love thee more dearly [day by day]
To follow thee more nearly [I got to take it]
Day by day 

You cruise around the corner
You watch your back 

You sweep your feet down alley streets
Sometimes you creep, I never see you coming
Monday, man you're on my back
Like a knapsack strapped with my heavy burden 

No, You cannot condemn me
I won't buy your bag of goods
You've got nothing for me anyway
That's why I pray 

[Chorus] 

These three things
I do pray
Day by day 

Day by day, by day, by day

As you walk
Day by day
Go to God and pray,
""I'm gonna go Your way""

See thee more clearly [every day]
Love thee more dearly [oooh, oh yeah]
Follow thee more nearly [I'm gonna go your way]

Mientras ve un partido en la television

Why has pagado tu mitad

Why nadie lo hare como yo.

Esta tan fria desde que no estas aqui
Como olvidar, tus labios
Si mi espejo esta marcado de carmin.

Para esta confesión
Ya sé que el tiempo
No me ha dado la razón

Sé que ya
No hay vuelta atrás
Sé que dices
Que te vas

Dame un segundo
Aunque sea por la mitad
Me das un minuto
No te pido nada más

Dame la oportunidad
De pausar aquí la historia
Nuestro encuentro así
No puede terminar

Amor, dame esta noche
Quiero darte cada roce
Una razón para volverlo a intentar

Amor, dame esta noche
Que no ves que necesito
Tu calor

Ya sé que es tarde
Ya quizás será mejor
Que te suelte la mano
Porque puede ser peor

Si después de tanto amar
Se termina aquí la historia
Nuestro cuento se merece otro final

Amor, dame esta noche
Quiero darte cada rose
Una razón para volverlo a intentar

Amor, dame esta noche
Que no vez que necesito
Tu calor, oh no

Ya no lo pienses más
Y quédate esta noche
Solo esta vez y ya
Perdona mis errores

Una mañana mientras duermas
Quiero perderme en tu belleza

Quiero darte cada roce

No queda ni para un café
La nevera está de adorno

Y la tele ni se ve
Y para colmo cuando busco mi correo
No contesta el internet

Que pasaría si olvidara en un hotel
La inspiración
Y para pagar la hipoteca

Solo tengo esta canción
De seguro en la calle quedaria
Sin saber a dónde ir

Que más da
Si mi cama hoy es de cartón
Estaré pensando en ti

Si alguna vez se apaga el sol
Y no va la calefacción
Ttan solo yo le pido a Dios
Que tu estés en mi habitación

Si se inventaran otra guerra
Para ver quién puede más
Escaparia al fin del mundo

Por no tener que matar
Y si me encuentran y me meten entre rejas
Y no tengo a dónde ir

Que más da
Si hoy mi cama es de metal
Seguiré pensando en ti

Si alguna vez se apaga el sol
Y no va la calefacción
Tan solo yo le pido a Dios
Que tu estés en mi habitación

Si el mundo volviera a empezar
Fueras mi Eva y yo tu Adán
Seguro me iba yo a encargar
De que volvieras a pecar

Quedó enterrado en mi corazón

Que fue mucho pa' su corazón

Que allí nació, por amor

Lejos, en algún lugar
Bajo el brillo de una gran ciudad
Una chica sufre de corazón roto

Ella lo ama sin final
Hace tiempo que él no siente igual
Ya no queda más remedio que llorar

Ya no queda más remedio que aguantar
Y disparar

Por amor se clavan cruces en la arena
Por amor, por amor a una bandera
Unos vienen y otros van
Unos nacen y otros mueren por igual

Más que nuestra musa es nuestra excusa
A veces se le alaba
Y si conviene se le culpa

Unos ríen y otros lloran por igual
