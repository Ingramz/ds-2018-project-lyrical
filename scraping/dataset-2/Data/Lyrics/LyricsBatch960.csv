RPWL,"On a distant shore, miles from land
Stands the ebony totem in ebony sand
A dream in a mist of grey...
On a far distant shore...
The pebble that stood alone
And driftwood lies half buried
Warm shallow waters sweep shells
So the cockles shine...
A bare winding carcase, stark
Shimmers as flies scoop up meat, an empty way...
Dry tears...
Crisp black squeaks tore reeds
Make a circle of grey in a summer way, around man
So don't ground...
I'm trying
I'm trying to find you!
To find you
I'm living, I'm giving,
To find you, To find you,
I'm living, I'm living,
I'm trying, I'm giving",Opel,2003
RPWL,"Day on my pillow
Gazing at the skyline
Happy that my soul can rest for a while

Not a single decision
To give you direction
'Cause that wouldn't be my style

Who made the colour of the rainbow
'Cause if I did, I would have done much better
There'd be no one suffering from anything
But I am only sitting at my window
Come again another day

Day on my pillow
Outside is a hurry
Wondering if they have peace in their mind

Heading to nowhere
Where no one is waiting
Hope that they'll seek what I have found

Who made the colour of the rainbow
Cause if I did, I would have done much better
There'd be no one
Suffering from anything
But I am only sitting at my window",Day on My Pillow,2005
RPWL,"I thought as a child
I'd feel like an eagle
Rain on the windscreen
I'm captured in technical solitude

[Chorus]
Fly, the higher I am
The closer I'll be to the hole in the sky
And all the words unspoken you told me
Soon they'll fade away

Riding on top of the clouds
Up into the gleaming gold of an afternoon
I set my controls for the heart of the sun
To reach for the stratosphere

[Chorus]

Time's never been on our side
The haze between death or alive
Revealing the secrets of life
I'll fly to the grievous light",Hole in the Sky,2005
RPWL,"A little piece of something
Falling gently down down down
No one understands you like I do

I'd rather be beside you
Everything we know so well
Tell me what you feel now
Show me what you think of it

It's not about us anymore
It's all about the reasons 
That we think we're fighting for
It's not about hate 
It's not about pain we always feel
I know we have our problems 
But we're not the only ones
It's not about you it's not about me
It's not about anger 
It's more about the loneliness we feel

How can I begin to 
Ask for some forgiveness
For all that we have taken
There's nothing left now

Just a little piece of something
Falling gently down down down
No one understands you no no
Like I do
There's nothing left now

It's not about us anymore
It's all about the reasons 
That we think we're fighting for
It's not about hate 
It's not about pain we always feel
I know we have our problems 
But we're not the only ones
It's not about you it's not about me
It's not about anger 
It's more about the loneliness we feel

It's not about us
It's not about hate
It's more about the loneliness we feel, can you feel it
It's not about anger
It's not about wanting
I know we have our problems
But we're not the only ones, we're not the only ones
It's not about you, it's not about me...",Not About Us,2005
RPWL,"Again I'm standing in the rain
Braindead from a working day
A cold wind on this Monday afternoon

This place still holds the magic
Even though I did the best I could
All those years ago are running 'round my brain

3 lights shine through the darkness
To unlock the great wide spirit of my life
3 lights: the same old feeling comes again
And takes me home

No delay expected
So I wait, let life pause for a while
I see three lights in the distance, drawing near

Yesterday you came to pick me up
And take me far away
But today you come again to take me home

Three lights shine through the darkness
To unlock the great wide spirit of your life
Three lights: the same old feeling comes again
And takes me home

In the veil of darkness
The time is right to go
Leave the empty platform far behind
Looking for your light

As I'm rushing through the night",3 Lights,2005
RPWL,"Beams of light are slashing through the night
Much too late to find our way
It's dark

I can't recall the day before the end was near
Together now to sail away

We're bound to reach the end
A restless life
With endless needs
I'm sure we are what we believe

We're bound to reach the end
The final goal
Within our reach
At last we all unite

Only a few are blessed with fearlessness
Seeking the guidance of their heart
And find love with

All the strength inside they rise into the air
It's not the end, it's a new start
Again

We're bound to reach the end

So many can't find what they were looking for
Scared of being all alone

Lost in a maze of faulted reason couldn't find their place
No chance to find their way back home

We're bound to reach the end
I lay my hopes
Upon your dreams
We're bound to reach the end
Together now",Bound to Reach the End,2005
RPWL,"Leading me through all the way back home
Breaking with the self I was before
Now that times have changed
My memories are old, much too old

Sitting here, watching the river flow
If only you and I could say hello
Listening to the sound of silence
But you don't hear it anymore

You should have told me that it got too rough
I gave you everything but maybe everything was not enough

All I have seen, I can't tell you anymore
All I have been, so many things that we don't know
Caught in the tide of time
If only one last wish was left
Everyone should reap what he has sown

The flowing water takes my soul away
A last farewell with nothing more to say
But behind the rippling waves I will
Become part of the river once again

So it's time for me to go back on my own
My new self joins the unity and keeps the river flow
This is not the right time
Our path will cross and we will meet again

You should have told me that it got too rough
You asked for everything but maybe everything was not enough

All I have seen

All divine and multicoloured in many different ways
Enthralled to see the other side
I'm aware of all the beauty, from now on

All life reflected in the water, full of light
Moving gently far away
All this light will still surround me, from now on

All divine and multicoloured in many different ways
Enthralled to see the other side
I'm aware of all the beauty, from now

On all life reflected in the water, full of light
Moving gently far away",Everything Was Not Enough,2005
RPWL,"If the world is one big plan
Why must we lose our innocence
Why have we lost our paradise?
Paralysed. nothing to give

The chestnut vender in the rain
Haven't seen him since I moved away
Please tell me what I'm doing here
These strangers do not speak to me

All the things I tried to do
I never thought it was too late
So in this silence say a prayer
For the one who went away

Roses, are covering your face
And with my mind I'm calling out for you
But all that's left are
Roses, covering your face
And with my mind I'm calling out for you
But you cannot hear me

The rising spirit of the new
I can look through the windows of their minds
Why should we care about the means
Our last goal is to reach the end

All the things I tried to do
I never thought it was too late
So in this silence say a prayer
For the one who went away

Roses, are covering your face
And with my mind I'm calling out for
You but all that's left are
Roses, covering your face
And with my mind I'm calling out for you
But you cannot hear me

You said don't tell me we can take our time
So I hope that we will meet again
Sheltered in your faith you made me understand
But now what's left is hidden under ...",Roses,2005
RPWL,"The new born moon seems like a cradle, shining on the desert sand
Scent of sandalwood and jasmine, a goddess with a silver skin
I am painting all your flowers, I'm the shadow of your dream
Who changed your opium to money shiva calls your name,
Why don't you sleep?

You're not worth a passing glance, I'm the picture in your mind
Who can feel the wind blows gently sparkling dust over the land
A stone is not a stone until I tell you what it's supposed to be
Who changed your opium to money shiva calls again,
Why don't you sleep?

And all our dreams are rushing to the river
The river that has always flowed
When maya comes and sets our hearts on fire
Our dreams will show the way back home

Lighter than a tuft of feathers, dancing with the rays of light
Digging oceans with my fingers, patterns carved into the sky
The creation of the earth is in my sight which no one's seen before
Sparkles of awakening knowledge shiva calls your name,
Why don't you sleep?

And all our dreams are rushing to the river
The river that has always flowed
When maya comes and sets our hearts on fire

Frightened and weeping
I read my name on a tombstone in a graveyard I don't know
In another dimension sitting with a pale face
On the hill of the dead!
The clouds all painted pink
Me wrapped in white cotton, nobody can see me at all
The letters of my name, iridescent and melting in the sun

Unsatisfied and restless, seeking in wrong places
Wading through a sea of my desires
When I burned away my bonds
I knew that I could not remain the same!
I left a fragment of my soul
Knotted in a tree top as a present for the endless universe
My form is full of light
As I'm going to the woods to find myself again

All the good, all the bad
All the pleasure, all the pain
All the yearnings of the brave,
All the sun and all the rain

All the beauty, all the dirt
All the love and all the hate
All the laughing, all lamenting, the acceptance of our fate
All illusions that we have,
All our secret fairytales,
Are doomed to slow decay; are flowing down the stream.

So come and kiss my silver skin while I paint pictures in your mind",Sleep,2005
RPWL,"Out in the land I heard some people say
There is no other way than to settle scores of age old grievance
Lost all belief in honesty and sowing seeds of want and greed
I am on my knees

Come and take me to a world full of kindness
I can feel something is going to happen to me
It can happen to me

Om jai, deva - all the love we have will take us higher

Om jai, deva - I believe that we will start the fire

It's our way to take no time,
Never read between the lines of a holy verse we don't understand
We close our eyes so on it goes a weapon for the fallen souls
I am on my knees

Come and take me to a world full of kindness
I can feel something is going to happen to me
It can happen to me

Om jai, deva - all the love we have will take us higher
Om jai, deva - I believe that we will start the fire

Love the guide
Love the cure

RPWL,"Calm the people
Tell them life's better than a hundred years ago

Feed them with hope in a war of all
Against all but don't let them know

How can I show you the path to a land
That blossoms in your inside
Frees you from all your compulsion and fears
To discover the beauty of your life

How far can we go?
How far can we go?

Walking on wasted land
But we have to go on
Walking on wasted land
But the show must go on

The news is ok
The system is working, let's watch a tv show

War is a game
Our life's a balance sheet
Your money tells you what's right and wrong

Cutting the truth into shreds and completing
A puzzle where no one's to blame
Living for our desires and needs
But nobody's winning this game

How far can we go?
How far can we go?

Walking on wasted land
But we have to go on
Walking on wasted land",Wasted Land,2005
RPWL,"This strange peace in my heart
A warmth which I can feel
Like a bud starting to bloom
I know what I could be

The spirit of this place
Is at one with my mind
Nature shows it's grace
In the hazy morning light

You got me under your wing
In everything I do
You make me want to sing
More and more

Speaking without words
Hearing with my mind
Feeling without a touch
This grace will never die

World through my eyes
I know that you can see
What I see all the world is in disguise

The further I can see
The sooner I arrive
The deeper I can breathe
The more I am alive

So easily misled
The sightless turn away
As leaves fall from the tree
The cycle starts again

World through my eyes
I know that you can see what I see",World Through My Eyes,2005
RPWL,"It's bleak in November
Back on the street where the city doesn't laugh anymore
A last dance of the wind with the waste
Of a vanished and misplaced reality

The things that we strived for
Were only the things that we already had
The question was: how to stop
When our desires had been satisfied

Out in the streets and over seas
We'll all join the last dance which starts at dawn

When new stars are born
Don't break the silence
Never look back what is left
What has been before

When new stars are born
A new day is dawning
Don't be afraid of what is gone
Or fear what's still to come

The streets are deserted
Laid bare with space to take a deep breath
We dance alone while waiting for the changes to begin
But can never reach the place where it began

Now a new sun is rising
Hope I can do what ought to be done
Break with the past to follow my heart
To reach for the last and final goal

Out in the streets and over seas
We'll all join the last dance which starts at dawn

When new stars are born 

This side, this world
One voice, one self
One road, one last mile",New Stars Are Born,2005
RPWL,"Grey stars loose their light before I turned
The present to the past
Screaming children make me wonder
Where all expressions laid
A preacher's fairy-tale that makes me cry
Before I say ""good-bye""
To the lonely Kings and Queens
With their lonely eyes

Remember all the time when life
Was only china in our hands
And all the sunflakes in our hearts
They turned to tears of endless seas
Today's no longer real, the time has changed
The sun will rise again
Like the lonely Kings and Queens
I'll off my fears away…

When the Master calls,
Don't be afraid to say ""Farewell""
Close your petrified eyes 

Now you're on your own,
Tonight I cannot help you anymore
Never wake and makes me wonder
Questions holding me laid
The preacher's fairy-tale that made me
Cry before I say ""good-bye""?
Like the lonely Kings and Queens,
With their lonely eyes

And when the Master calls,
Don't be afraid to say ""Farewell""",Farewell,2010

Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Head in a cloud

And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Not a real one, just a dream
A wonderful vision of us as a team
Can you imagine how I feel now
Love is real now, it's ideal
You're just what I wanted
And now it's nice to live
Paradise to live

Know why I've been blue

Exactly like you

Why should we spend money
On a show or two
No one does those love scenes
Exactly like you

I hope you'll understand

The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today

Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone

Her eyes were as blue as the sea
Her lips were the color of summer's red rose
And she promised she would always love me

The shadows will cover her face
Her last sun goes down, she's laid beneath the ground

Cause the jealous motherfuckers want to end my career 
I never feared, the ghetto is hell, but I learned ta 
Keep my mouth shut and pack a nickel-plated burner

Causes niggaz to hush, then I rush, like Manchus 
Who guard jewels and collect, Cash Rules with heavy jewels

Burning bodies into flames 
Between my anger, I lock down every chamber 
Hillside strangler, a nigga with a mask like Lone Ranger 
Rap poetic is injected into the brain athletic 
Build off of rhymin' calisthenics 
I'm determined, I raise a army like Hitler done Germans

No se si te das cuenta con el estúpido que estas
Yo se que no podrá quererte como yo
Que así no te amara jamas

Tal vez yo deba resignarme y no llamarte mas
Tal vez yo deba respetarme y no rogarte mas
Tal vez deba dejar con toda dignidad
Que vivas un romance en paz
No se quien de los dos es el que esta perdiendo mas
No se si te das cuenta con el estúpido que estas
Yo se que no podrá quererte como yo
Que así no te amara jamas

The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you

When I awake, I awaken with a tingle
One possibility in view
That possibility of maybe seeing you

Come rain, come shine
I meet you and to me the day is fine

Because I'm nobody's baby now

Nobody's baby

""Hey! Maybe I was meant for you""

What a shame that it's gone
All too soon
I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring

The bottom fell from everything

They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned his face to the people, these were the very words he said

I was down to St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table, 
So sweet, cool and so fair

Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this whole wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain
The gang'll know I died standing pat

Let her go, let her go God bless her
Wherever she may be
She may search this wide world over
Never find a sweeter man as me

Three pretty women to sing a song
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon
Raise hell as I stroll along

(INTRO)

Verse 1: Fermín IV
Si crees que se le está acabando el vuelo, no
Esto está comenzando
El danzón ya empezó a tocar (pararara) 
why no ha terminado, no
El paso del tiempo va imponiendo el respeto
why la calidad va mano a mano con la cantidad, viene 
(Viene) viene marcando la pauta why el sentimiento
Mi vida empieza desde adentro
Siempre brota lo que siento
Es verdad lo digo why me comprometo
Responsable soy why lo lamento
Pero creo que es el crecimiento
Por ahora está en el mejor momento
El amanecer siempre aparece corrigiendo al anochecer
why las cosas que se ven nacer
Hay que verlas madurar why crecer

Verse 2: Pato
Viviendo por suerte why clandestinamente
Más no estaba muerto solamente ausente
Si paré de pronto, nunca indiferente
No acabó el danzón why sigue igual que siempre
Si continúa el corazón
Ritmos unidos sobre ilusión
Noche a noche se escucha la voz
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Ruben Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Que se está bailando en cada rincón
Que está sonando en tu corazón

Verse 3: Fermín IV
Suena que suena las cartas sobre la mesa
No hay quien detenga esto nadie se mueva
Así es, todo tiene su tiempo why si estás dispuesto
A sembrar why cultivar hay que ver el fruto madurar
Hasta donde puede llegar sólo hay que desarrollar
Ampliar, solamente crear es inmenso el lugar
Espacio suficiente como para cohabitar
Escucha mi tierra hare eco
Entre las montañas se hare camino el concreto
Señales de humo que van creciendo cada día más
Tratando de comunicar
Exponiendo los adentros a la luz como van
Sin borrar nada sin tapar nada sin ocultar nada
Se presentan testimonios reales
El sentimiento no es más que puras verdades

Verse 4: Pato
Reuniendo por suerte why discretamente
Más no estaba lejos respectivamente
Si lo que se mueve proviene del vientre
No acabó el danzón why ha de seguir pa' siempre
Si se ha dado la ocasión
Ciertos sonidos de imaginación
Día a día que visita el sol
Los de tambores, acordes why son

Chorus: (Rubén Albarran from Café Tacvba)
Mandar obedeciendo en el danzón
Songoro cosongo songe be
Songoro cosongo de mamey
Es guardar silencio de movimiento
Ayunar de color why sonido
Ser mujer viejo why niño
why dejarse llevar...

Golpeado, por cierto 
Pero capaz 
De mirar hacia el frente 
Sonrisa inocente 
De manos que son nuestra gente

Sólo se llama buscar libertad

Ruben Bailey,"Back to the frontline, resurrected this old skool shit
'Cause niggas still respect it, it's all cool shit
Kinda tight so I select it to flow on
So unexpected and so on, but damn that

I want to take a minute tram back with the mainstream
Playing field where the main team kill bodies
And wannabe John Gottis shoulda been Zulu
But who knew but too few in my crew

And the rest didn't listen now some of the best is missing
Some of the rest is dissing, some of your chest is missing
Some of your views is changing, but none of your time remaining
It's a goddam shame a lot of fake niggas claim heaven sent

But me, I'm hell bent on destruction of the mass constructions
Of the mass destruction, of my ass restructuring
Of the past reflecting off the last injection
This cause and effect is known as infection

Made it known being prone to our own demise is imminent
I sure hope we leave a remnant",Remedy,1997
Rubén Blades,"Hay ojos de miles miradas
Cristales que observan al mundo pasar
Ojos que encuentran fortuna
Mirando a la luna y a su resplandor

Hay ojos que emanan ternura
Y hay ojos de inmenso dolor
Ojos que en noches oscuras
Viven de amarguras y desolación

Pero hay ojos que saben reír
Hay ojos de eterno fulgor
Ojos que ven en las flores
De multicolores
La gracia de Dios

Ojos

De jóvenes y viejos
En todos laos' del mundo
De todos los colores
De rey o vagabundo

Ojos que ríen, ojos que lloran
Ojos que piden, ojos que imploran
Ojos que están llenos de esperanza
Dando gritos de hasta cuándo

Que dicen la calle está dura
Ojos del pobre esperando
Ojos de aquel que se aleja y espera su libertad
De América Latina, ojos llenos de verdad

Ojos

Siguiendo los pollos en las esquinas
O mirando papeles en la oficina
Ojos dichosos, como el ojo 'e la vecina

Como los del ciego que miran más por dentro
Ojos de papisos en entierros llenos de sentimiento
Aeh, aeh, yo vine pa' mira'
Aeh, aeh, yo vine aquí pa' ve'

Ojos

Ojos que preguntan, ojos que responden
Ojos desconfiados, ojos bonachones
Ojos 'e policías, ojos de ladrones
Ojos de señoras y ojos de señores

Son los ojos de mis pueblos
Viendo como echar pa'lante
Esos ojos de estudiantes, que el cielo los bendiga
Y el futuro 'e nuestra raza y de América Latina

Rubén Blades,"Por la esquina del viejo barrio lo vi pasar
Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Why zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Why un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Why en un zaguán entra why se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo why no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro 'el gabán
Mira why sonríe why el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Why Pedro Navaja apreta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro why no ve a nadie
Why a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Why mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un trenta why ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

why Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un canon

why Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano why de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba 'hoy no es mi día estoy salá'
Pero Pedro Navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

why creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos why se marchó
Why tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje why da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios

Tus huellas se han perdido entre la oscuridad
Te estoy llamando América pero no me respondes
Te han desaparecido los que temen la verdad

Envueltos entre sombras, negamos es cierto
Mientras no haya justicia, jamás tendremos paz
Viviendo dictaduras, te busco y no te encuentro
Tu torturado cuerpo, no saben donde esta

Si es sueno de uno es sueno de todos
Romper la cadena y echarnos a andar
Tengamos confianza para adelante mi raza
A salvar el tiempo por lo que vendrá

Rubén Blades,"La ex-señorita no ha decidido qué hacer
En su clase de Geografía
La maestra habla de Turquía
Mientras que la susodicha
Sólo piensa en su desdicha y en su dilema
Ay, qué problema!

En casa, el novio ensaya qué va a decir
Seguro que va a morir
Cuando los padres se enteren
Y aunque él, otra solución prefiere
No llega a esa decisión
Porque esperar es mejor, a ver si la regla viene

Decisiones (Ave María)

Alguien pierde, alguien gana Ave María!
Decisiones, todo cuesta
Salgan y hagan sus apuestas

El señor de la casa de alquiler
A pesar de que ya tiene mujer
Ha decidido tener una aventura
(A lo casanova)
Y le ha propuesto a una vecina que es casada
De la manera más vulgar y descarada que
Cuando su marido
Al trabajo se haya ido lo llame
Para él ser su enamorado

La señora, que no es boba
Se lo cuenta a su marido y el bravo decide
Cómo no, invitar al atrevido y ella lo cita
Cual lo acordado
Y el vecino sale todo perfumado
Con ropa limpia que su esposa le ha planchado
Y trae una flor que se encontró en el tendedero
(A lo ""Love Story"")

Dentro en casa de la vecina está el marido
Indeciso sobre dónde dar primero
Con un bate de beisbol del extranjero

Y suena el timbre, ring-ring
(y no es el Gran Combo)
Comienza la segunda del noveno

Decisiones (Ya pa’ qué), cada día (Tu verás)
Alguien pierde, alguien gana
Ave María!
Decisiones, todo cuesta
Salgan y hagan sus apuestas
Ciudadanía!

El borracho está convencido que a él
El alcohol no le afecta los sentidos
Por el contrario
Que sus reflejos son mucho más claros
Y tiene más control

Por eso hunde el pie en el acelerador
Y sube el volumen de la radio
Para sentirse mejor (bien chevere)
Y cuando la luz cambiando a amarilla
Las ruedas del carro chillan
Y el tipo se cree un James Bond
Decide la luz del semáforo comerse
Y no ve el truck aparecerse en la oscuridad

Pito, choque y la pregunta
""Qué pasho?""
Pa’ la eternidad

Rubén Blades,"Que alguien me diga si ha visto a mi esposo, preguntaba la doña
Se llama Ernesto X, tiene 40 años, trabaja de celador en un negocio de carros
Llevaba camisa oscura y pantalón claro, salió anteanoche y no ha regresado
No sé qué pensar, esto antes nunca me había pasado

Llevo tres días buscando a mi hermana, se llama Altagracia, igual que la abuela
Salió del trabajo pa' la escuela, tenía puestos unos jeans y una camisa blanca
No ha sido el novio, el tipo está en su casa
No saben de ella en la psn, ni en el hospital

Que alguien me diga si ha visto a mi hijo, es estudiante de
Pre medicina, se llama agustín, es un buen muchacho, a veces es
Terco cuando opina, lo han detenido, no sé qué fuerza, pantalón
Blanco, camisa a rayas, pasó anteayer

Clara Quiñones se llama mi madre, es un alma de dios, no se mete con nadie
Y se la han llevado de testigo, por un asunto que es no más conmigo
Y fui a entregarme, hoy por la tarde y ahora no saben quién se la llevó del cuartel

Anoche escuché varias explosiones, tiros de escopeta y de revólveres
Carros acelerados, frenos, gritos, eco de botas en la calle
Toques de puerta, quejas, por dioses, platos rotos
Estaban dando la telenovela, por eso nadie miró pa' fuera

¿Adónde van los desaparecidos?
Busca en el agua y en los matorrales
¿Y por qué es que se desaparecen?
Porque no todos somos iguales
¿Y cuándo vuelve el desaparecido?
Cada vez que los trae el pensamiento
¿Cómo se le habla al desaparecido?
Con la emoción apretando por dentro",Desapariciones,1984
Rubén Blades,"Despiertas, no has podido dormir muy bien
Te levantas, caminas y pisas uno de los charcos de orine
Que el nuevo perro ha dejado por toda la casa
Maldiciendo, entras al baño brincando en una sola pierna
Enciendes la luz y restriegas el pie sobre la cubierta
Que tu esposa le puso al excusado
Vas hasta la bañadera blanca, abres los dos grifos del agua
Y controlas la temperatura
Levantas la cosa esa que no sabes cómo se llama
Y que hace que el agua salga por la regadera
Te bañas, no cantas, sales de la tina
Te secas con una toalla que dice ""disneylandia""
Te subes a una balanza que da siempre pesos diferentes
Pero aproximados
Cuando te estás afeitando, suena el despertador
Tu mujer abre los ojos, mira la hora
Lo apaga, se levanta, de su lado de la cama
Cada uno tiene su lado de la cama
Cada uno tiene su lado en todo
Tú la sientes saliendo del cuarto, rumbo a la cocina
El vecino de arriba prendió el tocadiscos
Terminas de afeitarte
Te limpias las cortaditas con papel higiénico
Que se te queda pegado a la piel
Te pones el desodorante, ""24 horas de protección constante,""
Un poco de colonia para después de afeitarse
Te arde la cara, sales del baño
Pisas otra vez el orine del perro
Le mientas la madre, en voz alta
Tu esposa, desde la cocina, te pregunta qué te pasa
Tú le explicas a gritos por qué no quieres otro perro en la casa
Mientras te secas el pie con la toalla mojada que dice ""disneylandia""
Ella se aparece y silenciosamente seca con un trapo el charco de orine
Vas al closet y sacas la ropa que te vas a poner miras el reloj
Hueles el café, te vistes, no encuentras la correa
Te haces la corbata dos veces porque la primera vez
La parte de atrás te quedó más larga que la parte de adelante
Vas a la cocina, tu esposa ya preparó tu desayuno
Le hablas otra vez del perro, ella, sin contestarte
Te recuerda que hay que pagar la cuenta de la luz
Y la matrícula de la escuela de los chiquillos
Cuelgas tu jacket del borde de la silla
Y te sientas en la mesa de la cocina
Tu esposa enciende el radio
Están transmitiendo las noticias
Mientras escuchas, mojas el pan en el café
Como te enseñó tu papá cuando eras niño
Suena el teléfono, tu esposa lo contesta, es para ti, de la oficina
Hoy van a arrestar al tipo, va un carro a recogerte, que lo esperes abajo
Cuelgas el teléfono, vas a tu cuarto, abres la segunda gaveta del armario
Tu gaveta, sacas tu libreta y los lentes negros, vas a la cama
Levantas el colchón y sacas tu revólver
Vas a la cocina, tomas tu jacket y lo pones todo en el bolsillo de adentro
Tu esposa te observa, le das un beso al espacio, al lado de la mejilla
Que ella no devuelve, o sí? abres la puerta y bajas por la escalera de madera
Saltando los escalones de dos en dos
Llegas a la calle, ves al camión recogiendo la basura
Aún está oscuro, pero huele a mañana, varón",GDBD,1984

Buscando nuevas promesas en esta tierra
Llegó a la selva sin la esperanza de ser obispo
Y entre el calor en entre los mosquitos habló de Cristo

Entre papeles y sueños de aire acondicionado
Y fue a un pueblito en medio de la nada a dar su sermón
Cada semana pa' los que busquen la salvación

El niño Andrés Eloy Pérez tiene diez años
Estudian la elementaria ""Simón Bolívar""
Todavía no sabe decir el Credo correctamente
Le gusta el río, jugar al fútbol y estar ausente

Le han dado el puesto en la iglesia de monaguillo
A ver si la conexión compone al chiquillo
Y su familia está muy orgullosa, porque a su vez piensa
Que con Dios conectando a uno, conecta a diez

Suena la campana: un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés

El padre condena la violencia
Sabe por experiencia que no es la solución
Les habla de amor y de justicia
De Dios va la noticia vibrando en su sermón

Pero suenan las campanas: un, dos, tres
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés

Al padre lo halló la guerra un domingo de misa
Dando la comunión en mangas de camisa
En medio de un padre nuestro el matador
Y sin confesar su culpa le disparó

Antonio cayo, ostia en mano y sin saber por qué
Andrés se murió a su lado sin conocer a Pelé
Y entre el grito y la sorpresa, agonizando otra vez
Estaba el Cristo de palo pegado a la pared
Y nunca se supo el criminal quién fue

Pero suenan las campanas otra vez
Del Padre Antonio y su monaguillo Andrés",El Padre Antonio y el Monaguillo Andres,1984
Rubén Blades,"Todos vuelven a la tierra en que nacieron
Al embrujo incomparable de su sol
Todos vuelven al rincón de donde salieron
Donde acaso floreció más de un amor

Bajo el árbol solitario del pasado
Cuántas veces nos ponemos a soñar todos vuelven
Por la ruta del recuerdo
Pero el tiempo del amor no vuelve más

El aire, que trae en sus manos la flor del pasado
Y su aroma de ayer, nos dice muy quedo al oído
Su canto aprendido del atardecer
Nos dice, con voz misteriosa de cardo y de rosa, de luna y de miel
Que es santo el amor de la tierra
Que es triste la ausencia que deja el ayer
Que es santo el amor de la tierra
Que es triste la ausencia que deja el ayer",Todos Vuelven,1984

Que no les dominé el miedo, no se pongan a gritar
Control y nada de nervios y cuidado con llorar

Rubén Blades,"Siempre en la noche mi mamá buscaba el sueño
Frente a la televisión, y me pedía que por favor
No la apagara, su soledad en aquel cuarto cuarto
No aguantaba, aunque jamás lo confesó

Yo niño, no entendía su horror, porque uno es joven
Y no sabe del amor, crecí mirando a mi madre vivir
Aferrada a una esperanza que la enterró, toda
Amargada, dentro de una noche que no acabó

Y mi madre le ha temido a la noche desde el día
Que se fue mi papá
Hoy la miro y comprendo que ella aún piensa
Que las cuentas del alma no se acaban nunca de pagar

Hoy día comprendo su dolor, y lo terrible que es amar
A una ilusión que está atrapada entre la sombra del pasado
Y que en las noches se libera y va a su lado
Como el fantasma de un amor que no murió

Mi madre le ha temido a la noche desde el día
Que se fue mi papá
Hoy la miro y comprendo que ella aún piensa
Que las cuentas del alma no se acaban nunca de pagar

Va nuestra canción como un saludo
Para los que defienden su derecho
A libertad y usan la razón como su escudo

No hay bala que mate a la verdad
Cuando la defiende la razón
Reunámonos todos para acabar con la maldad
Muévete y pon todo el corazón

Casi todos buscamos siempre la comodidad
Esto ha sido así toda la vida
El que va adelante casi nunca
Mira atrás para ayudar al que lo pida

Pero hay día llegó la necesidad
De seguir un rumbo diferente
En darnos la mano para cambiar la realidad
Depende el futuro de la gente
Allá y aquí, aquí y allá

Si no hacemos algo el mundo, se va a acabar
Muévete mi gente, mueve Panamá
Muévete Puerto Rico, con seguridad
No hay bala que pueda matar la verdad

Para acabar el racismo en Sur África
Lo cantan los niños, y mamá y papá
Para salvar el mundo de tanta maldad
Lo pide la gente en todas las esquinas

Muévete Colombia, Méjico, Argentina
Cuba, Guatemala, oye Costa Rica, Perú y Nicaragua
Que hoy te necesita, Brasil y Bolivia, Chile y Paraguay

Rubén Blades,"Están tomándose un café, sentados sin saber por qué
Sin tema para conversar, no saben ni dónde mirar
Se quieren pero no hay amor; se odian sin que haya rencor
Se buscan y huyen a la vez, entre el silencio que hay después
La soledad les da su abrazo, pero no aceptan su fracaso
Y pretendiendo devolver un amor que ya se fue
Y así pasan los días pretendiendo que todo está bien
Con silencios y café, esperando a que regrese el ayer

Así prolongan el final, aunque ya todo les da igual
Su triste juego del amor, donde jamás hay ganador
Pensando en lo que pudo ser, ninguno logra comprender 
Que entre silencios el vivir, es otra forma de morir
Algo que empieza en alegría, cuando termina es agonía
Dolorosa confusión, donde no hay explicación
Sólo silencios envolviendo la promesa que murió
Y un sentimiento de terror, al creer que nunca 
Encontraremos otro amor",Silencios,1985
Rubén Blades,"El borracho paró de cantar y se puso a contar su buena 
Fortuna, el barrio estaba dormido llena brillaba la luna
De pronto, un ladrón salpicado en neón, saltó como un tigre

A la cara; y le dijo, -""entrégalo todo, o se dispara""
El borracho temblando le entregó al ladrón lo que acababa 
De encontrar, un ""Smith & Wesson"", unos pesos y un puñal
El ladrón, asombrado, le preguntó, ""Y tú qué haces con 
Todo ésto?"" mejor será que me cuentes toda la historia
Y ojalá que la huma no afecte tu memoria"" 

A veces hablar resulta esencial, pero otras veces es mejor 
Callar porque a veces hablar resulta un error mortal

Con la información que el borracho le dió a tres cuadras al norte 
El ladrón encontró los cuerpos de una mujer y el de un hombre 
En un gabán, tirados sobre la acera en posición pre-natal
El ladrón con el pie sacudió a la mujer, a ver si reaccionaba
Cómo nada pasó, se agachó y la buscó a ver si algo encontraba
Y no halló nada
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la (bis) 
El ladrón dirigió su atención hacia el cuerpo del hombre en el gabán
Sobre él se agachó, y lo reconoció por el diente de oro que llevaba
-""Ay, pero si es el viejo Pedro Navaja""-; y empezó a burlarse de él 
Mientras lo registraba
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la (bis) 

A veces hablar resulta esencial, pero otras veces es mejor callar 
Porque a veces hablar resulta un error mortal

Como un rayo le entró la navaja buscando dentro de su cuerpo el 
Alma el ladrón sintió la luna quemándole la entraña; Y vió el más 
Grande milagro de su vida: -Murió viendo al sol salir de una boca reída! 
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la 
Pedro tomó su papel de identidad y se lo puso al ladrón en el bolsillo 
De atrás del pantalón para confundir la investigación. Pedro, herido 
De bala, recogió su otro puñal, él siempre trae encima dos, cuando 
Sale a trabajar; y del barrio hasta la luna brilló su carcajada

Cayó Cipriano Armenteros, así fue
El pueblo se reunió a ver cuando el preso regresaba
Escoltado por la tropa que Manuel Flores mandaba
Algunos viéndolo herido, de él riendo se burlaban
Cipriano en la memoria, sus caras fotografiaba

Los hombres del bandolero al rescate se lanzaron
Por Salsipuedes pasaron, quebrando la madrugada
Emeterio y Pascual Gómez cabalgaban en vanguardia
Medoro y Eliecer, al centro, Facundo en la retaguardia

La banda atacó de sorpresa, al galope sus caballos
El pueblo dormía, borracho, en Manuel Flores confiado
Cuando acabó el tiroteo, quedó Armenteros salvado
Así lo cuentan los viejos, así se fugó Cipriano

Y tiembla la tierra, se escapó Armenteros
Dicen que anda buscando a los que de él se rieron
En el pellejo de esa gente, hermano, estar yo no quiero

Y tiembla la tierra, se escapó Armenteros
Las ventanas están cerradas, no se abren ni por dinero
Todas las puertas trancadas con el cerrojo del miedo

Y tiembla la tierra, se escapó Armenteros
Buscando la recompensa, llegaron del extranjero
Y cuando vieron al hombre, los importados corrieron

Ay, ay, ay, se escapó Armenteros
Ay, ay, ay, se fugó de nuevo
En medio de la balacera, dice Cipriano, que Flores
Cuando le miró la cara, se mojó los pantalones

Cabalgando invencibles sobre el tiempo

Van Cipriano y su caballo, ""Flor de Viento""

Su fuego alumbrando nuestra memoria

Después de una discusión muy acalorada
Su esposa quería pedirle plata a los suegros

cabizbajo y luciendo arrepentido
que el era la causa de

Pues se retiró el patrocinador por el apagón, ""This cannot go on""
Semi-desnuda y emberracada, grita una Miss: 
""Coño: Este país no sirve pa' nada""
Aquí en el Sub-D: 
Olor a miau y a perfume. : Todo lo que baja sube
Somos la envidia de Europa. : Nuestra magia la provoca

Por el apagón, en otro lugar, alguien se alegró pues la oscuridad 
Lo va a ayudar a desempeñar la muy popular función de robar
Diez mil pares de piernas arrancan sin pagar la cuenta 
Y en la iglesia nadie se entera de lo que pasa allá afuera
Mientras, en casa unos culpan al Consumismo y otros acusan al
Imperialismo por este apagón y la confusión de nuestra propia ""civilización"". 
Quinientos años de cotorreo. Se fue la luz. Y sigue el saqueo
Aquí en el Sub-D
El fin del Imperialismo. : La tumba del Comunismo
Entre un Fidel y un Somoza. : Y no se arregla la cosa
Del beso y de la tortura. : Del goce y de la amargura
Alucinado y furioso. : Iluminado y glorioso",El Apagón,1992

Rubén Blades,"Encontraron el cilindro y a su casa lo llevaron con cuidado
Como a una bendición
Era Pascuas, y el objeto su regalo
Y los niños se encantaron con su aparición
Abrieron el cilindro y se maravillaron cuando vieron dentro 
Un mágico color, como una estrella, polvo de cielo, que 
Alegraba su miseria con su luz
Sobre sus cuerpos lo restregaron
Y lo adoraron como si fuera Jesús
Los vecinos se enteraron 
Y curiosos visitaron ""a la casa en que de noche sale el sol""

El cilindro y la familia fueron la mejor noticia de la Prensa, Radio
Y la Televisión: ""Un milagro de Dios?""; ""Otro Mago de Oz""
""Regalo de un Platillo Volador?"" Aquel cilindro, con el polvo 
De cielo que alegraba su miseria con su luz. Sobre sus cuerpos 
Lo restregaron, y lo adoraron, como si fuera Jesús

La luz del cilindro fue menguando y al irse se fué apagando 
El amor que lo celebró
Uno por uno fuimos pagando el precio 
Cruel de los que basan su felicidad en error
El gobierno explicó a través de expertos que, ""los muertos fueron 
Víctimas de radiactividad""
Le dieron una multa a un hospital local
""por botar substancias tóxicas en un área popular""
No hubo milagro, ni hubo justicia, y esa tragedia no es noticia ya
Ni aquel cilindro, con el polvo de cielo, que alegraba a la miseria
Con su luz
Ya no es noticia, esa tragedia de la Navidad sin el 
Niño Jesús
Nadie se acuerda de la familia que, brillando, murió 
En la oscuridad
El hospital pagó su multa, barata le salió la culpa
Pues la vida de un pobre no vale na'",El Cilindro,1992

Pasajero, pero mi amor es verdadero y no se marchará

Mundo todo cuesta, y aunque paguemos la respuesta con 
Llanto y dolor, el que no busca nada encuentra y sólo

Que por fin el león de sierra reposa muerto 
La guerrilla murió con el grita un sargento 

En la cañada del muerto fue la emboscada cogieron 
A la guerrilla hambrienta y cansada ay

Va pasando, desesperado buscando

Ciudad, sonriendo crípticamente a la humanidad

Realidad, esperando de repente ver la verdad
Brillando ominosamente en la oscuridad

Paseo que se transforma en fuga, escape que se 
Convierte en cita; se empaña el sentido en nuestra vida 
Cuando corremos en eternas retiradas que pretendemos 
Tornar en descubrimientos, cada mañana

Ojos de perro azul, saltando de rostro en rostro en 
Su soledad, deseando encontrar su casa en lo que no 
Es ya, midiendo al miedo en distancias por caminar
Ojos de perro azul, encadenado a un pasado sin 
Voluntad, sin ser esclavo tampoco está en libertad
Con sueños que no recuerda al despertar

Mirando gente que se ha dado a la fuga, pueblos 
Huyendo en confusas retiradas, viendo su huída 
Convertirse en cita pues del encuentro con la verdad 
Nadie se escapa, aunque te escondas tras la promesa 
De un mañana, ya eso no alcanza

Maldad, riendo sarcásticamente al comprobar que

Me preguntaba un chiquillo 
Por el significado 
De la palabra patria

Flor de barrio, hermanito
Patria son tantas cosas bellas
Como aquel viejo árbol 
Que nos habla aquel poema
Como el cariño que aún guardas 
Después de muerta la abuela

Patria, son tantas cosas bellas
Son las paredes de un barrio
Es su esperanza morena: 
Es lo que lleva en el alma 
Todo aquel cuando se aleja
Son los mártires que gritan bandera
Bandera, bandera, bandera

No memorices lecciones 
De dictaduras o encierros
La patria no la definen

Las estrellas, sólo sé que en ti veo mi fortuna
Y una carita que es de lo más bella
Voy todo a ti, cariño, yo creo en ti

Quiere ""salvarme"" ya no creo en lo que dicen los diarios
Ni tampoco en lo que habla la radio, pero en ti sí, cariño
Yo creo en ti
Con cada beso juntos nos sumergiremos en un mar de 
Pasión, placer y sabrosura
Y yo, al compás sensual que 
Marca tu cintura me dejaré llevar a una delicia eterna

No me pregunten más, yo no sé nada, no me interesa 
Hablar de zoquetadas
De qué nos vale el tener inteligencia
Si no aprendemos a usar la conciencia, pero tu sí, cariño
Yo creo en ti

En tu abrazo encuentro tranquilidad, cariño yo creo en ti
Llenas mi martirio en un mar lleno de felicidad, cariño yo creo en ti
Eres una prieta; un fin de semana un fin de semana y no voy a parar
Cariño yo creo en ti

Sin tu cariño son de cartón todas las estrellas
Cariño yo creo en ti En mis noches de dolor fuiste luna llana

Juan Pachanga bien vestido aparece
Todos en el barrio están descansando
Y Juan Pachanga en silencio va pensando

Que aunque su vida
De fiesta y ron, noche y rumba
Su plan es falso igual
Que aquel amor que lo engaño

Y la luz del sol se ve alumbrando
Y Juan Pachanga el manito va penando
Vestido a la última moda y perfumado

Con zapato en colores
Ye, ye bien lustrados
Los que encuentren
En su camino los saludan
Hey man que feliz
Es Juan Pachanga todos juran

Pero llevar el alma el dolor de una traición
Que solo calman los tragos
Los tabacos y el tambor
Y mientras la gente duerme aparece
Juan Pachanga con su pena y ámense

Amanece con la pena
Óyeme Juan Pachanga olvídala
No, no, no, no, no, no, te quiere la morena

De nada sirvieron regaños, ni viajes, ni monjas
Ni las promesas de amor que le hicieran los niños de bien

Rubén Blades,"Hoy tu me pides, hoy me solicitas
Que te de perdón
Yo no soy Dios para perdonar
Pero soy hombre pa' no olvidar
Una mala intención

Te di la mano sincera
Y me la echaste pal suelo
Te di otro chance mi pana
Y otra vez me pusiste un huevo
Tu no te compones ya

Yo no soy Dios para perdonar
Pero soy hombre pa' no olvidar
Una mala intención

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Ay te di un chance, chance mi pana
Y otra vez pusiste un huevo

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Me fallaste, me fallaste
Me fallaste más a mi
Y de ti en la esquina tos' se rieron

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Ay que te di un chance por mi hermana
Pero tu, tu no eres nada bueno

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
El fallo, fallo eres tu
El fallo, fallo, fallo bandolera
Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Palo, palo, palo, palo tuyo y bofetada para ti
Porque no eres nada bueno

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Ay con tu pinta de niño 'Yo no fui'
Y tremendo traqueteo

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
De flor che y no tienes nada
Tu lo que eres un chancletero

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Pero te di, te di la mano como un hombre
Y saliste mas vacilero

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Te están buscando
Los niños de los dientes oscuros
Del carro negro de antena larga

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Si en la esquina te conocen
Que tu no eres nada bueno

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Ay te pareces a la gente
Que uno invita a una fiesta
Y se van después que comieron

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Ay que ya te di un chance
Pero que te di un chance
Y tu saliste marinero

Yo te di un chance a ti
Y me fallaste de nuevo
Embarcaste a medio barrio por ti
Cuanta gente ahí lo sufrieron

Con el silencio se marchó sin contestar 
Y comprendí aquella noche 
Que ya nunca jamás 
Olvidaría su querer

Paula C
La madrugada me envolvió 
En su oscuridad 
Y aunque parezca raro 
Me hizo ver 
Con más claridad 
Lo que es amar 
A una mujer

Ya tu regreso
De nuevo aquel beso 
Me hizo vibrar 
Y así volví a soñar
Y así volví a cantar 
Y con el llanto 
Volviste temblando 
Y te oí murmurar 
Que yo era todo para ti 
Y nada más

Nuevamente 
Entre los dos 
Es la que anima

De esas que cuando se agitan sudan chanel number three
Que sueñan casarse con un doctor
Pues el puede mantenerlas mejor
No le hablan a nadie si no es su igual
A menos que sea un fulano de tal
Son lindas delgadas de buen vestir
De mirada esquiva y falso reir

El era un muchacho plástico de esos que veo por ahí
Con la peinilla en la mano y cara de yo no fui
De los que por tema en conversacion
Discuten que marca de carro es mejor
De los que prefieren el no comer
Por las apariencias que hay que tener
Pa andar elegantes y así poder una chica plástica recoger

Que fallo

Era una pareja plástica de esas que veo por ahí
El pensando sol en dinero
Ella en la boda en paris
Aparentando lo que no son
Viviendo en un mundo de pura ilusion
Diciendo a su hijo de cinco años
No juegues con niños de color extraño
Ahogados en deudas para mantener
Su estatus social en boda o hotel

Que fallo

Era una ciudad de plástico de esas que no quiero ver
De edificios cancerosos y un corazón de oro ver
Donde en ves de un sol amanece un dolar
Donde nadie rie donde nadie llora
Con gente de rostros de polister
Que escuchan sin oír y miran sin ver
Gente que vendio por comodidad
Su razon de ser y su libertad

Oye latino oye hermano oye amigo
Nunca vendas tu destino por el oro ni la comodidad
Nunca descanses pues nos falta andar bastante
Vamos todos adelante para juntos terminar
Con la ignorancia que nos trae sugestionados
Con modelos importados que no son la solucion

No te dejes confundir
Busca el fondo y su razón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Pero nunca el corazón
No te dejes confundir
Busca el fondo y su razón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Pero nunca el corazón
Recuerda se ven las caras
Y jamas el corazón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Del plovo venimos todos y ahi regresaremos como dice la canción

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Recuerda que el plastico se derrite, si la de de lleno el sol

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Estudia, trabaja y se gente primero alli está la salvación

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Pero que mira mira no te dejes confundir, busca el fondo y su razón

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante, pa' lante
Y asi seguiremos unidos y al final venceremos

Se ven las caras, se ven las caras, vaya, pero nunca el corazón

Pero señoras y señores, en medio del plastico 
También se ven las caras de esperanza
Se ven las caras orgullosas que trabajan por una 
Latinoamerica unida y por un mañana de esperanza y de libertad

Se ven las caras de trabajo y de sudor
De gente de carne y hueso que no se vendió
De gente trabajando buscando el nuevo camino

Eres la ilusión que nunca pude olvidar 
Que en todo momento vive dentro de mi 
Y que a pesar del tiempo aun domina mi existir 

Porque te quiero mujer, porque te quiero 
Y si me quedo sin ti voy a morir, voy a morir 
Porque te quiero mujer, porque te quiero 
Y si me quedo sin ti voy a morir, voy a morir 

Por culpa de este amor hoy vivo en la soledad 
Buscando una ilusión que nunca pude encontrar 
Me quema el pensamiento estando cerca de ti

Rubén Blades,"Chorrillo ardió, como Berlín, un fuego intenso
Que prendió hasta el zinc, Santa Claus trajo en navidad
Bombas para avenida a, por estar cerca del cuartel
Se quema el barrio y sus discos de Ismael
Entre la sombra, un general rinde el machete, sin pelear

Ahora y siempre, recordemos
Ahora y siempre, compañeros

La confusión era infernal
Llovían bengalas, lanzadas desde el mar
Cuántos murieron? No lo sé
Niño Jesús, dígalo usted

De eso se prefiere no hablar
Un trauma nacional aún sin sanar
Nunca se podrá resolver sin
Que enfrentemos al ayer

Ahora y siempre, recordemos
Ahora y siempre, compañeros

",20 de Diciembre,1999
Rubén Blades,"Norte claro y sur oscuro
Aguacero viene seguro
De puntillas, para que no duela
Mi recuerdo trae la voz de abuela

Los años nos hacen libres, o prisioneros
Un vaso medio vacío también está medio lleno
La vida es una ventana, o un basurero
Según el punto de vista que defina el pasajero

Viene el agua, nos anuncia el trueno
Parpadeando se derrama el cielo

La mano de mi abuelita me lleva entre al aguacero
Hasta una ciudad distinta, donde se vivió sin miedo
Sin rejas en las ventanas, sicarios o pordioseros
Ni arañas haciendo nidos en nuestra ilusión y sueños

Viene el agua, aguacero

Mi ciudad se ha vuelto dura y sabe a fuego
Un torbellino de buitres entristeciendo sus techos
Pero crece mi confianza, al ver entre el aguacero
El rostro de mi abuelita, que me hace creer que puedo

Claro oscuro, gris silencio esperanza hoja al viento
Huele a agua y hoy, de nuevo, nuestro barrio respira cielo

Viene el agua, otro tiempo
Abuelita, creo que puedo
Agua que va a caer

Agua que va a caer
Mi ciudad se ha vuelto dura
Agua que va a caer
Sus calles saben a fuego

Agua que va a caer
Pero vuelve mi ternura
Agua que va a caer
Al ver al rostro de mi abuela
Entre el aguacero

Agua que va a caer
Creo que puedo
Agua que va a caer
Barrio respirando cielo

",Aguacero,1999
Rubén Blades,"Día a día, me despierto creyendo oir tu voz
Día a día, todavía, me duele nuestro adiós
Quien no se ha equivocado no trató
Quien nunca ha perdonado nunca amó
Y quien jamás pecó, jamás vivió

Día a día la nostalgia me impulsa a continuar
Día a día la distancia me aconseja olvidar
Tú y yo, con un pedazo de razón, y compartiendo el
Mismo corazón, que tenemos partido en dos, día a día

Aunque lo intente mil veces no puedo ahogar lo que
A tu alma pertenece, y así olvidar

Día a día me levanto queriendo ser mejor
Y me acuesto, noche a noche, con mi contradicción
Viviendo entre la espada y la pared enfrento al
Horizonte del ayer, y de él se asoma usted, día a día

",Dia a Dia,1999
Rubén Blades,"Frente al precipicio hay un resquicio de razón
Que puede ayudarnos a encontrar la solución
Pero es inútil, nuestra decisión
Si el juego está arreglado por los dueños del balón
Y aquí estoy, contigo, tratando de aclarar la situación

Tiempo de encrucijada pide respuestas claras
De una familia rota
De una Nación quebrada sobre la desgracia
De una corrupción
Brutal vive y aún  resiste, la esperanza nacional

Y ahora nos toca reivindicar la vida, la memoria
Y el amor de América, y aquí estoy
Tratando, creyendo que no es tarde para hablar
Tiempo de encrucijada: lucha o retirada
O somos familia rota, o somos Nación salvada

",Encrucijada,1999
Rubén Blades,"Verde cinta de tierra
Que estando ausente llevo por dentro
Olas de Norte y Sur se unen en tu centro

Roja, azul, blanca aurora
Nació del tajo de una sandía
Un alma de inmigrante fue tu semilla
Y la sangre del indio formó tu orilla

¡Piedra de cielo! ¡Agua de luna!
Ngobe Bugle, Emberá, Chocó, blanco, negro y Kuna
Perfiles de una esperanza que no se esfuma

Un paraíso compraron cuentas de vidrio
Telas y espejos
Fuente de juventud para un viejo imperio

La luz dentro de tu entraña se transformó
En camino de acero
Y nuestra gente en sombras de la que fueron

¿Cuándo seremos manos, en vez de dedos?
Con claro oscuro, con socabón, ¡con fiesta y duelo!
Pedazos de corazón formaron tu suelo
Siempre estaremos aquí, aunque estemos lejos

En el puente del Mundo
Abiá Yala bin sógue

",Puente del Mundo,1999
Rubén Blades,"Alerta, que al que va en motocicleta
Ningun carro ¿lo respeta y autobus?
Mejor ni hablar tranquilo
Que cuando llegue la hora
Si usted no se descontrola
No nos lograrán prender

Deje el nervio ya y concéntrese
Es muy tarde Para hecharse atrás
Se hace lo que se tiene que hacer
Cuando ya no hay nada mas que hablar

Recuerde, el color del auto es blanco
Europeo y nuevecito y porta placa oficial
Son cinco, tres atrás, dos adelante
Nuestro hombre está en la foto
Que le acabo de enseñar

Colóquese al lado del chofer
Y no piense en lo que va
A pasar. no tenemos tiempo que perder
Arranque al oirme disparar

Hoy cambiará la vida
Hoy cambiará su vida
Hoy cambiará mi vida

Yo no sé si el tipo es bueno, o malo
Solo sé que le tocó perder
En el cielo está Dios, soberano
En la tierra, la orden del cartel

Espero que la ametralladora
No vuelva a trabarse ahora
Como en el ensayo ayer

Más tarde, después
Que cobre el trabajo lo invito
A tomarse un trago
No me vaya a despreciar

Yo, por él, no siento compasión
Nunca en vida él hizo algo por mí
Si es entre él y yo la selección
No me dolerá verlo morir

Hoy cambiará la vida
Hoy cambiará tu vida
Hoy cambiará mi vida

Rubén Blades,"La vida es una huella 
De triunfos y fracasos 
Formada por pedazos 
De amor y de dolor 
El tiempo es un rosario 
Sus cuentas los recuerdos 
Jardín del sentimiento 
De lo que se vivió 

Hay un tiempo pa reír 
Y otro tiempo pa llorar 
Un tiempo para partir 
Y otro para regresar 
Hay un tiempo pa vivir 
Y otro para terminar 
Hay un tiempo pa morir 
Y otro pa comenzar 

Cuando llegue la hora 
Del fin de mi camino 
Que mi sonrisa diga 
Que acepto lo que fui 
Las cosas materiales 
Las dejare contigo 
Solo se ira conmigo

Y otro para recibir

Rubén Blades,"Nadie escoge a su familia o a su raza, cuando nace
Ni el ser rico, pobre, bueno, malo, valiente o cobarde
Nacemos de una decisión donde no fuimos consultados
Y nadie puede prometernos resultados

Cuando nacemos no sabemos ni siquiera nuestro nombre
Ni cual será nuestro sendero, ni lo que el futuro esconde
Entre el bautizo y el entierro cada cual hace un camino
Y con sus decisiones, un destino

Somos una baraja más de un juego que otro ha comenzado
Y cada cual apostará según la mano que ha heredado
La vida es una puerta donde no te cobran por la entrada

Y el alma es el tiquete que, al vivir, te rasgan cuando pagas
Y cada paso crea una huella, y cada huella es una historia
Y cada ayer es una estrella en el cielo de la memoria

Y la marea del tiempo lleva y trae nuestras contradicciones
Y entre regreso y despedida cicatrizan los errores
Y cada amigo es la familia que escogemos entre extraños

Y entre la espera y el encuentro uno aprende con los años
Que solamente a la conciencia nuestro espíritu responde
Y que una cosa es ser varón y otra es ser hombre

Nadie escoge a su familia, o a su raza, cuando nace
Ni el ser bueno, malo, lindo, feo, inocente o culpable
Del nacimiento hasta la muerte toda vida es una apuesta
De nuestra voluntad depende la respuesta

¡Sueño por un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se acabe!
¡Luchen por un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apague!

Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando

Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguán entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Y Pedro Navaja aprieta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un treinta y ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

Y Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano y de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba hoy no es mi día estoy salá
Pero pedro navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

Y creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos y se marchó
Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje y da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas. sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró Navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Ocho millones de historias tiene la ciudad de Nueva York

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Como decía mi abuelita
El que último rie, se rie mejor

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
Cuando lo manda el destino
No lo cambia ni el mas bravo
Si necesitas un martillo del cielo te caen los clavos

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios
De barrio cuidao en la acera
Cuidao camara que no corre vuela

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida, ay dios

Todas la mujeres tienen algo en especial,
Siempre hay un detalle que me hace mirar,
Pero al conocerte empece a dudar

Yo no soy un buen atleta para un maratón
Pero si tu amor es la meta ahí me apunto yo

Yo vivía muy tranquilo y sin preocupación,
No tenia ningún problema con el corazón

Y para curarse quiere tu atención

Ay me estoy muriendo,  nena por darte un beso
Caminando el laberinto de la mano de la cura,
Eres luz en la distancia, disipando mi amargura 
Ha pasados tantos días, ha pasados mil veinte horas

Rubén Blades,"Mi madre no descansó y trabajó hasta preñada
Por eso, donde ella fuera yo adentro la acompañaba
Y mi abuelita decía, 'Así nos salió la baraja
En la casa de los pobres hasta el feto trabaja'

A la mansión del patrón un negro ha sido invitao
Lo mandaron a buscar como acto desesperao
Al no poder curar al señor
Nuestros blancos e ilustres doctores
Del brazo de la patrona llegó San Martín de Porres

Manejaba su virtud como si ella fuera un taxi
Por plata iba el pasajero, de la teoría a la praxis
Su cuerpo, una carretera que accidentó a mucha gente
Su amor, un huérfano herido, siempre buscando pariente

",Bochinches (Gossip),2002
Rubén Blades,"Llévame de vuelta a los días
Cuando corría con mi perro
A la tienda del Chino
A comprar diez centavos
¡De pan y cinco de queso blanco!

Devuélveme las tardes
Cuando la mano de mi abuela
Me llevaba hasta el final de la
Calle 13 Oeste, en Santa Ana
¡A ver el Mar del Sur!

Regrésame a las noches
Cuando el aroma a jasmin
Sembrado en latas
Se derramaba desde los balcones
¡Por todas las calles de San Felipe!

Cuando era niño mi barrio
Era un Continente
Y cada calle era un camino
A la aventura

En cada esquina
Una memoria inolvidable

En cada cuarto una esperanza
Ya madura
En nuestros viajes de ida
Y vuelta a los luceros

Fuimos piratas
Saltimbanquis y vaqueros

Nuestra pobreza nunca
Conquistó al dinero,
Pero en las casas nunca
Se rindió el ""Yo puedo""

Me iba a la cama con
La fe del que ganó
Me despertaba con
La paz del que aprendió

Que lo importante
En esta vida es el tratar
Que lo que cuesta
¡Es lo que no voy a olvidar!

Crecí luchando, como los otros
Los que crecieron como yo
De humilde cuna
Con su fortuna hecha de sueños
Como yo, como yo

Mi adolescencia
No fue fácil de llevar
Como tratar de atar
Un zapato al caminar

Nuestra inocencia
Retrocede al comprender que
En la vida real

La injusticia puede
Golear a la verdad
Muere familia
Se nos va el primer amor

Se confunde lo
Que una vez se afirmó
Una mudanza deja
Al viejo barrio atrás

Crece el bigote
Y la responsabilidad
Trabajaba y pensaba
Si otros, como yo

Siendo tan jóvenes
Sentían mi soledad
Si aún compartían
Nuestras almas la ilusión

De que el muchacho
Siempre triunfara al final
Me preguntaba si aún habrían otros

Como nosotros, como yo
Aún resistiendo, aún sin rendirse
Aún recordando, como yo, como yo

Y en la curva de los
Años me encontré
Con los muchachos
Con los que solía jugar

Con los que senderos
De estrellas caminé
Cuando el horizonte
Era un atajo sobre el mar

Y recobramos las memorias con café
Y nos tratamos aún de tú
Y no de usted

Y reafirmamos la lección
Que el tiempo da
Que cuando hay vida
Siempre hay posibilidad!

La lucha sigue
Y sobrevive como nosotros
Como yo
Y en otros barrios hay otros
Niños como nosotros

Como yo, ¡como yo!
¡Como nosotros!

",Como Nosotros (Like You and Me),2002
Rubén Blades,"Imagina y verás
A la constelación
Del crucero del sur
No la ovides jamás

Para que en cualquier
Rumbo que tomes
Esa estrella asome

Y su luz te oriente
Con la simple razón
De que todo
Merece consideración

Determina y verás
La posibilidad
De encontrar dirección
Porque todo es posible
Con tu decisión

Ten la curiosidad, de ver donde
Un viejo sol se esconde
Tras otro horizonte
Por la simple razón
De que todo depende

De tu imaginación
Si lo intentas, quizás hallarás
Un camino que nadie encontró

Si te orientas, verás
Que la luz de esa estrella
No te abandonó
Busca y encontrarás

La razón de los sueños
De Eva y adán
Se oriente, rapaz
Se oriente

Rubén Blades,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2002
Rubén Blades,"Ella, que con sus besos lima
Los afilados bordes de mi angustia de vidrio
Ella, profeta desarmada
Que sin cobrarme nada se enfrenta a mi peligro

Inútil es ante ella mi silencio
Pues oye cada cosa que no digo
Deshoja el argumento en que me escondo
Hasta dar conmigo

Espejo de un amor hecho distancia
Su rostro es el espacio donde vivo
En el desierto en que mi fe se arrastra
Por ella es que sigo

Ella, que sin rendirse insiste en regalarme
Sueños que mi razón resiste
Ella, que llena con abrazos los cínicos espacios
Donde mi pena existe

¡Joder, caló, caló!

Ella que a punta de besos lima
Los afilados bordes de mi angustia de vidrio
Ella, profeta desarmada
Que con sus manos de luna va
Enfrentando a mi peligro

Joder! inútil es ante ella mi silencio
¿Será que escucha las cosas que no digo?
Ella es calma y yo, pura tormenta
¡Ella, moneda y yo, un mendigo!

Lo que olvidé una vez ella lo encuentra
Y con profunda honradez me lo devuelve
Y aunque soy acertijo que atormenta
¡Ella me resuelve!

Redondo laberinto, el de la duda
Los pasos se convierten en castigo
En vez de intimidarla mi amargura
¡La bebe conmigo!

Ella, la sombra de mi sombra
La voz de mis palabras
La sangre de mi herida

Ella, que cada día me asombra
Con sus ojos de escuela
¡Que nutren e intimidan!

Llena de historias

En transición
Donde el futuro
En espiral se reproduce

La canción de la Etiopía

En la quena de los
Incas oigo a Irlanda
Y al Iran, al escuchar
Gaitas de Escocia

Rubén Blades,"Admiro a la belleza, pero en voz baja
El grito no impresiona a la eternidad
Las flores más bonitas son las del desierto
Pues pintan de colores su soledad

Lo que no se olvida es lo que nunca muere
Y el que no perdona, nunca amará
Quien apaga un cigarrillo en un charco en sangre
Por su indiferencia se condenar

No hay que temer a lo desconocido
No te asuste lo que aún hay que hacer
Que si tú vas, compay, compay, ahí yo voy contigo
Camino que nos lleva, que nos trae también

",Jiri Son Bali,2002
Rubén Blades,"Hay quien ve la luz al final de su túnel
Y construye un nuevo túnel, pa' no ver
Y se queda entre lo oscuro, y se consume
Lamentando lo que nunca llegó a ser

Yo no fui el mejor ejemplo y te lo admito
Fácil es juzgar la noche al otro día
Pero fui sincero, y eso sí lo grito
Que yo nunca he hipotecado al alma mía

Si yo he vivido parao
Ay que me entierren parao
¡Si pagué el precio que paga
El que no vive arrodillao!

La vida me ha restregao
Pero jamás me ha planchao
¡En la buena y en la mala
Voy con los dientes pelaos!
¡Sonriendo y de pie, siempre parao!

Las desgracias hacen fuerte al sentimiento
Si asimila cada golpe que ha aguantao
La memoria se convierte en un sustento
Celebrando cada río que se ha cruzao

Me pregunto, cómo puede creerse vivo
¿El que existe pa' culpar a los demás?
Que se calle y que se salga del camino
¡Y que deje al resto del mundo caminar!

A mí me entierran parao
¡Ay, que me entierren parao!
Ahí te dejo mi sonrisa
Y todo lo que me han quitao

Lo que perdí no he llorao
Si yo he vivido sobrao
Dando gracias por las cosas
Que en la ruta me he encontrao

Sumo y resto en carne propia
De mi conciencia abrazao

¡Parao! aunque me haya equivocao
Aunque me hayan señalao
Parao! en agua de luna mojao

Disfrutando la memoria
De los ríos que he cruzao
Aunque casi me haya ahogao
Sigo ¡parao! ¡parao!

Rubén Blades,"Duermo y despierto
Mientras sueño
Y cruzo el tiempo

Y vuelvo hasta el primer ayer
Entre la luz del primogenio
Me espera la memoria
Que otro vio nacer

Regreso a la primera huella
Cuando la vida comenzaba
En Africa, viaja eleggua
Sobre una estrella

Y abre el camino que conduce
América

El camino lo abre eleggua

Del ""Clan de lara"", de la tierra de arara
Vida que fluye del africa
Nuestra fuente original

Desde un mundo sin pasado
Sin fronteras ni extranjeros
Cuando todo comenzaba
Cuando no existía el dinero

En mi entraña va el recuerdo
De lo que otro ser sintió
Vertical el horizonte
La espiral que lo formó
Un camino hecho de estrellas

Alumbrando a la distancia
La raiz de un sueño nuevo
Que sólo el que insiste alcanza
La piel es pura geografía

El alma, en cambio, es el proyecto universal
Sangre del mundo que nos cria
Del primogenio ser, la fuente original
El camino lo abrió eleggua

",Primogenio (Beginnings),2002
Rubén Blades,"En el borde de un camino
Hay una cruz de madera
De barato presupuesto
Flores plásticas adornan
La memoria del que ha muerto

En la cruz alguien
Ha puesto un cartón
Pintao con pena

Sólo queda un apellio
Y un mensaje en acuarela
Que la lluvia ha desteñido

Me acerqué a ver qué decía
Y me dio un escalofrío
Otra voz me repetía
Pongo a dios como testigo
Lo que mis ojos leían

Viajero soy y ser
Caminos hice y haré
Mi vista en el horizonte
No sé cuándo llegaré
Pero si mi cruz ve usted
Siga la ruta en mi nombre

Yo no creo en casualidades
Siempre hay una explicación
Pero a veces uno encuentra
Imposibles que se enfrentan
De tú a tú, con la razón

Hoy sé que la ruta se extiende
Desde aquí a la eternidad

Cada tumba es testimonio
Que se deja en patrimonio
Para toda la humanidad
Me lo dijo una voz del más allá

Viajero soy y seré
Caminos hago y haré
Mi vista en el horizonte
No sé donde acabaré

Pero si mi cruz ve usted
Siga la ruta en mi nombre
Sigo la ruta en tu nombre

Rubén Blades,"En cada barrio hay, por lo menos, un loco
El del nuestro se llamaba ""Sebastián""
Lavaba carros y hacía de todo un poco
Para ganarse el pan
""Sebastian"" tenía una novia imaginaria
Y con ella discutía sin cesar
Se ataba al cuello una capa hecha de trapos 
Y corriendo por las calles lo escuchábamos gritar
""Sebastian, si me quieres conquistar
Sólo las estrellas bastarán
Sólo las estrellas bastarán""

En cada loco hay, por lo menos, un sueño
Ser amado era el ideal de ""Sebastian"" 
Con papel, lata, cartón y mucho empeño 
Comenzó su plan

Por amor alucinando, implacable
Fue creando la más grande super nave espacial
Para irse con su novia
""De nuestro barrio de mierda hacia el mundo sideral""
En cada sueño hay, por lo menos, un drama
Y en angustias se enredaba ""Sebastian""
Una noche, cuando con el cielo hablaba
Sobre el horizonte vio una luz cruzar
Feliz gritó, ""espérame"" 
Y lo vi correr lanzándose en el mar
Tratando aquel destello recobrar
Porque ""Sólo las estrellas bastarán
Sólo las estrellas bastarán!""

Sobre la arena sucia de la playa del mercado 
Hay una vaina que parece un proyectil

De sus alas cuelga una capa de trapos
De su sombra, una soledad sin fin

En las noches hace guardia, frente al mar

A ninguna otra ilusión se entregará

Rubén Blades,"Nadie escoge a su familia o a su raza cuando nace
Ni el ser rico, pobre, bueno, malo, valiente o cobarde
Nacemos de una decisión donde no fuimos consultados
Y nadie puede prometernos, resultados

Cuando nacemos no sabemos, ni siquiera nuestro nombre 
Ni cual será nuestro sendero, ni lo que el futuro esconde
Entre el bautizo y el entierro, cada cual hace un camino
Y con sus decisiones, un destino

Somos una baraja más de un juego que otro ha comenzado
Y cada cual apostará según la mano que ha heredado
La vida es una puerta donde no te cobran por la entrada
Y el alma es el piquete que al vivir te rascan cuando pagas

En cada paso crea una huella, y cada huella es una historia
Y cada ayer es una estrella, en el cielo de la memoria
En la marea del tiempo lleva y trae nuestras contradicciones 
Y entre regreso y despedida, cicatrizan los errores

Y cada amigo es la familia que escogemos entre los años
Y entre la espera y el encuentro uno aprende con los años 
Que solamente a la conciencia, nuestro espíritu responde 
Y que una cosa es ser varón, y otra es ser hombre

Nadie escoge a su familia o a su raza cuando nace
Ni el ser bueno, malo, lindo, feo, inocente o culpable
Del nacimiento hasta la muerte, toda vida es una cuesta 
De nuestra voluntad depende la repuesta

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apagué

Donde nunca desechemos la razón de los demás
Donde nunca olvidemos dar la mano, a quien? 
Al que se ha quedado atrás

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apagué

Festejar a nuestra tierra mejor que cuando a ella entramos 
Como muestra el cariño, con la esperanza del niño, clarito como el verano 

Sueño con un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apagué

Los blancos huesos de un muerto pueden ser de cualquier raza
Si la muerte no discrimina, entonces, que la vida tampoco lo haga

Luche por un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apagué

Donde lo que dice, piensas, haces, sientas, te den la felicidad
Sin que tu alegría se apoye en el mal de los demás

Luche por un mundo diferente
Donde nuestro amor nunca se apagué

Esta verdad es muy sencilla, hasta un chiquillo la sabe 
Si en tu vida nunca hubo ritmo, en tu muerte no habrá clave

Ole, le, le
Pura vida",Vida [Radio Edit],2003
Rubén Blades,"El que no se arriesga nunca aprende nada
Quien no busca puerta no hallara la entrada
En amor se apuesta entregando el alma
Why como nos cuesta, cuando nos enganan

A veces resulta incuficiente la voluntad
Si de otro depende la realidad, por eso entiendo
Why explicaselo al corazon, que solo aprende
El que arriesga su razon

El que nada intenta nunca hara camino
Nuestras decisiones van creando sestino
Asi fue conmigo

Eterna amargura la que nos deja el amor que no madura
Que malo sabe el dolor

Ya se va, me deja en la soledad, sufriendo

Se va perdiendo la fe, quedas diciendo, amor pa que
Buscando el consuelo en el licor
Recordando lo que el tiempo se llevo

Sobre la ausencia
Queda el recuerdo
Why la sentencia
Del sufrimiento

Oye hermano, es que la vida es asi
Why hasta un lobo puede morir de amor

Me embarca why se aleja,me olvida why me deja
Como a sinbad el marino, en el mar de la ansiedad

Dentro de la carcel de la memoria voy repitiendo
La historia que me condena en la eternidad

Tristeza llega, me abraza why me aprieta why no se despega
Why no me deja contrar la felicidad

Ya no estas mas a mi lado corazon
En el alma solo siento soledad
",Ya Se Va,2004

Rubén Blades,"Me fui pa'l monte buscando guayaba
Por la vereda del 8 y el 2
Y aunque encontré una casa dorada
Esa guayaba no la hallaba yo

Mucho he viajado por todo el mundo
Y nunca, nunca pude encontrar
Una guayaba que me gustara
Y detuviera mi caminar

Y aunque encontré una casa dorada
Esa guayaba no pude hallar

Buscando guayaba ando yo
¿Cómo? Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol

Una guayaba salva morena
Una guayaba que está bien buena
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol

U ru, ru guarara donde va miguel
U ru, ru guarara fue a buscar también Guayaba
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol

Pero que tenga mucho mentol
Pero que tenga, que tenga muchísimo sabor
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol

Busca una guayaba, busca una guayaba
Busca una guayaba por la vereda del 8 y el 2
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Que tenga sabor, que tenga mentol

Que tenga sabor que tenga mentol
Buscando guayaba ando yo
Guayabita sabanera
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Aquí hay dos
Que yo quiero una guayaba
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Venga y dame una manito
Ay ayúdeme coma y
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Ya la veo que usted
Ya la Veo que usted no coge
Y no Dice donde hay
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Dime esa guayaba bonita
Donde la encuentro, ay Dios
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Qué, que caminando
Siempre voy andando señor
Buscando guayaba ando yo

U ru, ru guarara donde va miguel
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Ven ayúdame de lao
Dime donde esta que nunca
Yo la he encontrao
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Acompáñame porque puede suceder
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Que yo encuentre esa mujer
Y la aprenda aquerar
Buscando guayaba ando yo

La busco por el monte
Y por la marqueta
Buscando guayaba ando yo

No, no, no, no, te escondas más
Y aparece prieta
Buscando guayaba ando yo

Que tenga sabor
Y que tenga mentol

Rubén Blades,"I speak to you in Jesus's name
As Jesus speaks through me,
The evil we do can't be blamed upon our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death-row to the shore
I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior, my Salvador!

It took me four years to learn
I was in prison not in church.
And two more to begin the book of my soul's search.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

A wild boy from the streets of El Barrio
An orphan from the hills of Mayagez

And when I wrote my story
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write I'll be transferred far away.
I'm leaving Greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the Latin population will soon be minus one.

Time is an ocean of endless tears.

I know how hard it's been for you these many years,
You say the Aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at El Malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son.

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street.
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state.

Correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
The politics of race.

A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white

If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write.

You were a child of sixteen
With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and batter",Time Is an Ocean,2006
Rubén Blades,"Usa la conciencia latino 
No la dejes que se te duerma 
No la dejes que muera 

Siembra si pretendes recoger
Siembra si pretendes cosechar 
Pero no olvides, que de acuerdo a la semilla 
Así serán, los frutos que recogerás
Siembra si pretendes alcanzar 
Lo que el futuro te traerá 
Pero no olvides, que de acuerdo a la semilla 
Así serán, los frutos que recogerás

Con fe siembra y siembra y tu veras 
Con fe siembra y siembra y tu va a ver 

Olvídate de lo plástico que eso nunca deja nah 
Siembra con fe en el mañana 
Nunca te arrepentirás 

Con fe siembra y siembra y tu veras 
Con fe siembra y siembra y tu va a ver 

Recuerda que el tiempo pasa 
No da fruto árbol caído 
Lucha siempre por tu raza 
Nunca te des por vencido 

Con fe siembra y siembra y tu veras 
Con fe siembra y siembra y tu va a ver 

Cuando lo malo te turbe 
Y te nuble el corazón 
Piensa en américa latina y repite mi pregón 

Con fe siembra y siembra y tu veras 
Con fe siembra y siembra y tu va a ver 

Y de acuerdo a la semilla 
Así nacerán los frutos

Hermano latino 
Con fe y siempre adelante 

Olvida las apariencias 
Diferencias de color 
Y utiliza la conciencia 
Pa hacer un mundo mejor 
Ya vienen los tiempos buenos 
El día de la redención 
Y cuando llamen los pueblos 
Responde de corazón 
Tu veras, tu va ver, tu veras, tu va ver 

Las semillas son los niños 
Que el tiempo hará crecer 
Pero hay que dar el ejemplo 
Pa que pueda suceder 
Olvida la rabotada y enfrenta la realidad 
Y da la cara a tu tierra y hacia el cambio llegarás 
Siembra cariño 
Siembra humildad 
Y da frutos de esperanza a los que vienen detrás

Rubén Blades,"Oye, esto va dedicado a todos los barrios de Puerto Rico
¡Trujillo! Dedicado al barrio de la Perla
¡Pocho! Dile a Johana que me haga un arroz con habichuela bien duro
Un saludito a José, los cogemos bajando
¯Y tú, ¿qué estás mirando?

Yo tengo actitud desde los cinco años
Mi mae me la creó con tapabocas y regaños
Desde chiquito, canito, con el pelo castaño
Soy la oveja negra de todo el rebaño
Y fui creciendo poquito a poco
Brincando de techo en techo, tumbado cocos
Y aunque casi me mato y casi me cocoto
Nunca me vieron llorando ni botando moco
Siempre perfumado y bien peinadito
Pa' buscarme una novia con un apellido bonito
Larita, mi primer beso de amor
Se casó la bruja, lluvia con sol

Allá abajo en el hueco en el boquete
Nacen flores por ramillete
Casitas de colores con la ventana abierta
Vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta
Que yo tengo de todo, no me falta nada
Tengo la noche que me sirve de sábana
Tengo los mejores paisajes del cielo
Tengo una neverita repleta de cerveza con hielo

Un arcoíris con sabor a piragua
Gente bonita rodeada por agua
Los difuntos pintados en la pared con aerosol
Y los que quedan, jugando basketball
Un par de gringos que me dañan el paisaje
Vienen tirando fotos desde el aterrizaje
La policía, que se tira sin pena
Rompiendo mi casa pa' cobrar la quincena
Aquí nació mi mae y hasta mi bisabuela
Este es mi barrio y yo soy libre como Mandela
Cuidado con la vieja escuela que no te coja
Que te va a meter con chancleta y palo de escoba
Así que no te me pongas majadero
Porque yo vengo con apetito de obrero
A comerme a cualquiera que venga a robárme lo mio
Yo soy el Napoleón del caserío
¡Oye! Esto se lo dedico a los que trabajan con un sueldo bajito
Pa' darle de comer a sus pollitos
Yo quiero a mi barrio como Tito quiere a Jaimito
Yo no lucho por un terreno pavimentado
Ni por metros cuadrados, ni por un sueño dorado
Yo lucho por un paisaje bien perfumado
Y por un buen plato de bistec encebollado
Por la sonrisa de mi madre que vale un millón
Lucho por mi abuela meciéndose en su sillón
Lucho por unos pinchos al carbón
Y por lo bonito que se ve La Perla desde un avión
¡Oye, dile!

Allá abajo en el hueco en el boquete
Nacen flores por ramillete
Casitas de colores con la ventana abierta
Vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta
Que yo tengo de todo, no me falta nada

Oye
Esto fue por la inocencia de Jonathan Román
La chilinga desde Argentina
Estamos calentando motores
Dale

Esa risa en La Perla la escuché en el chorrillo
Y de Tepito hasta Callao y donde se acallan chiquillos
Creo en barrios con madres que vivieron iguales de razones
Y al final se murieron sin tener vacaciones
Como decía mi abuela: así fue la baraja en casa del pobre
Hasta el que es feto trabaja por ese barrio eterno también universal
Y el que se mete con mi barrio me cae mal

¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Veo las luces de La Perla desde Panamá
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Brillando en clave Morse y me invitan pa' allá
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Un camino hecho de estrellas, semáforo la luna
¡La noche me sirve de sabana!
Salí a las siete y media y voy llegando a la una
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Nena frótame con vicbaporu como me hacía mamá
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Ni dormido me olvido de mi identidad
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
El hombre bueno no teme, no teme a la oscuridad
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
¡Ea! Y no me falta más nada

Allá abajo en el hueco en el boquete
Nacen flores por ramillete
Casitas de colores con la ventana abierta
Vecinas de la playa puerta con puerta
Que yo tengo de todo, no me falta nada
Tengo la noche que me sirve de sábana

Esa pared del barrio y eso es pa' que te asombres
Cincuenta años más tarde todavía guarda mi nombre

Aquí no se perdona al tonto majadero
Aquí de nada vale tu apellido, tu dinero
Se respeta el carácter de la gente con que andamos
Nacimos de muchas madres pero aquí sólo hay hermanos
Y ese mar frente a mi casa te juro que es verdad
Como el de La Perla aunque yo esté en Panamá
Y sobre el horizonte veo una nube viajera dibujando la cara del gran Maelo Ribera
Celebra esta reunión compadre
Qué te parece esta combinación de Rubencito y Calle 13?

¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Pero eso no resuelve el blanco sospechoso
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
La noche no absuelve al verbo mentiroso
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Si te perdiste hermano, encuéntrate a ti mismo
¡La noche me sirve de sábana!
Vente aquí a Panamá y contribuye al turismo

Rubén Blades,"El talismán de tu piel me ha dicho 
Que soy la reina de tus caprichos 
Yo soy el as de los corazones 
Que se pasean en tus tentaciones 
El talismán de tu piel me cuenta 
Que en tu montura caerán las riendas 

Cuando una noche de amor desesperados 
Caigamos juntos y en redados 
La alfombra y el alrededor, acabarán desordenados 
Cuando una noche de amor que yo no dudo 
La eternidad venga seguro 
Tú y yo, el destino y el corazón, seremos uno 

Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: el talismán de tu piel lo dice 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: lo dice el corazón y el fuego de tu piel 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: el talismán de tu piel lo dice 
Yo soy la tierra de tus raíces: a ver que dices tú 

El talismán de tu piel me chiva 
Que ando descalza de esquina a esquina 
Por cada calle que hay en tus sueños 
Que soy el mar de todos tus puertos 
El talismán de tu piel me cuenta 
Que tu destino caerá a mi puerta

Rubén Blades,"Ella, que con sus besos lima
Los afilados bordes de mi angustia de vidrio
Ella, profeta desarmada
Que sin cobrarme nada se enfrenta a mi peligro

Inútil es ante ella mi silencio
Pues oye cada cosa que no digo
Deshoja el argumento en que me escondo
Hasta dar conmigo

Espejo de un amor hecho distancia
Su rostro es el espacio donde vivo
En el desierto en que mi fe se arrastra
Por ella es que sigo

Ella, que sin rendirse insiste en regalarme
Sueños que mi razón resiste
Ella, que llena con abrazos los cínicos espacios
Donde mi pena existe

Joder, caló, caló!

Ella que a punta de besos lima
Los afilados bordes de mi angustia de vidrio
Ella, profeta desarmada
Que con sus manos de luna va
Enfrentando a mi peligro
Joder! inútil es ante ella mi silencio
Será que escucha las cosas que no digo?
Ella es calma y yo, pura tormenta
Ella, moneda y yo, un mendigo!

Lo que olvidé una vez ella lo encuentra
Y con profunda honradez me lo devuelve
Y aunque soy acertijo que atormenta
Ella me resuelve!
Redondo laberinto, el de la duda
Los pasos se convierten en castigo
En vez de intimidarla mi amargura
La bebe conmigo!

Rubén Blades,"El tiempo va
Hacia mañana, como una flecha
Quien escribe nuestra historia, nos lo dirá.
Que poco a poco, poquito a poco el tiempo va

Graba en una piedra esta verdad
Aunque no quieras, aunque no quieras el tiempo va

Baila una sombra en el aire, con ella tú bailarás
Agua que escapa en tus dedos 
Y se va como el tiempo va

El tiempo va
Y la energía que nos dio, no volverá 
Un reloj de arena bajo tus venas, así es la ley
Una vida es todo lo que hay

No queda rebeldía, ni queda ni libertad
Aunque no quieras se acaba el día y el tiempo va

Baila una sombra en el aire, con ella tú bailarás
Agua que escapa en tus dedos 
Y se va como el tiempo va

Bajan las gotas de lluvia
De ellas tú beberás
Agua resbala en tus dedos y se va como el tiempo va

Ay, ay, el día que te duermas, el color se dormirá
Y aunque baile una sombra en el aire tú ya no bailarás

Se van como el tiempo va",El Tiempo Va,2013
Rubén Blades,"Hay quien ve la luz al final de su tunel 
Y construye un nuevo tunel, pa´ no ver
Y se queda entre lo oscuro, y se consume
Lamentando lo que nunca llegó a ser
Yo no fui el mejor ejemplo y te lo admito
Fácil es juzgar la noche al otro día
Pero fui sincero, y éso sí lo grito
Que yo nunca he hipotecado al alma mía! 
Si yo he vivido parao, ay que me entierren parao
Si pagué el precio que paga el que no vive arrodillao! 
La vida me ha restregao, pero jamás me ha planchao
En la buena y en la mala, voy con los dientes pelaos! 
Sonriendo y de pie: siempre parao! 

Las desgracias hacen fuerte al sentimiento 
Si asimila cada golpe que ha aguantao
La memoria se convierte en un sustento
Celebrando cada rio que se ha cruzao
Me pregunto, cómo puede creerse vivo
El que existe pa´ culpar a los demás? 
Que se calle y que se salga del camino
Y que deje al resto del mundo caminar! 
A mí me entierran parao
Ay, que me entierren parao! 
Ahí te dejo mi sonrisa y todo lo que me han quitao
Lo que perdí no he llorao, si yo he vivido sobrao
Dando gracias por las cosas 
Que en la ruta me he encontrao
Sumo y resto en carne propia
De mi conciencia abrazao
Parao! aunque me haya equivocao

Aunque me hayan señalao
Parao! en agua de luna mojao
Disfrutando la memoria de los rios que he cruzao
Aunque casi me haya ahogao, sigo parao!

Rubén Blades,"Como me gusta estar de nuevo en casa
Y despertarme lleno de su olor
A ese café de la mañana
Que siempre corre hasta la cama
Y duerme hasta el despertador

Hoy tengo cita con la almohada
Y una reunión con e ventilador
Una salida con mi perro
Por que no entiende de pretexto
Y dejo en pausa mi sillón

Hoy, hoy es domingo
No hay compromisos con el reloj
Porque hoy, hoy es domingo
No hay nada mejor

Te saco un vino en la cocina
Y un buen asado espera en el carbón
Aunque tengamos mil problemas
Hoy descansamos de las penas
Alimentando el corazón

Que nadie rompa este momento
Es día de celebración
Hay que brindar por la alegría
Afuera la mala energía
Por que mañana Lunes se acabo

Hoy, hoy es Domingo
No hay compromiso con el reloj
Porque hoy, hoy es Domingo
No hay nada mejor

Hoy, hoy es Domingo

Que yo tengo el almanaque, en español y en ingles

Hoy es Domingo y no es bueno para trabajar
Hoy es Domingo, el día para disfrutar
Pero que mira que cuando se encuentran
Dos latinos siempre da igual
Que Lunes, que Martes, que Miércoles
Que siempre Domingo será

Rubén Blades,"I speak to you in Jesus's name
As Jesus speaks through me,
The evil we do can't be blamed upon our destiny
I have walked through the valley of death-row to the shore
I have stumbled through silvery water to my savior, my Salvador!

It took me four years to learn
I was in prison not in church.
And two more to begin the book of my soul's search.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

A wild boy from the streets of El Barrio
An orphan from the hills of Mayagez

And when I wrote my story
The words flew from the page
And my soul in solitary
Escaped its iron cage.

Time is an ocean of endless tears

Mama, I got your letter today
The next time that you write I'll be transferred far away.
I'm leaving Greenhaven's towers of stone
Where the Latin population will soon be minus one.

Time is an ocean of endless tears.

I know how hard it's been for you these many years,
You say the Aguinaldo makes you dream of home
Where once we strolled the beach at El Malecon
Go back don't you worry, I am your grown-up son.

The politics of prison are a mirror of the street.
The poor endure oppression
The police control the state.

Correctional facility
That's what they call this place
But look around and you will see
The politics of race.

A forest and a prison
Where the snow and guards are white

If you want to keep your sanity
You'll teach yourself to write.

You were a child of sixteen
With a twelve-year-old mind
You came here numb and batter",Loves Me Like a Rock,2015

You fight for your country

Patria son tantas cosas bellas
Como aquel viejo árbol

Como el cariño que aún guardas 
Después de muerta la abuela

Patria, son tantas cosas bellas
Son las paredes de un barrio
Es su esperanza morena
Es lo que lleva en el alma 
Todo aquel cuando se aleja
Son los mártires que gritan bandera

Rubén Blades y Seis del Solar,"El ultimo dia en la vida de Adan Garcia
Lo halló como todos los otros de su pasado: soñando ganarse el ""Gordo"" en la Loteria
Los hijos y la mujer durmiendo a su lado
Adan salió de su casa, al mediodia
Después de una discusión muy acalorada
Su esposa queria pedirle plata a los suegros
Y Adan besaba a sus hijos mientras gritaba
""Esto se acabó, vida
La ilusión se fué, vieja
Y el tiempo es mi enemigo
En vez de vivir con miedo
Mejor es morir
Sonriendo, con el recuerdo vivo""

Por ultima vez entró en la tienda del barrio
Y ahi le fiaron un paquete de cigarrillos
Por la Avenida Central lo vieron andando
""sin rumbo, las manos dentro de los bolsillos""
""Desde que a Adan fue botado de su trabajo""
Dijo un vecino
""noté en su forma de ser un cambio muy raro
Él, siempre muy vivaracho
Ahora andaba quieto
Pero en la tranquilidad del desesperado""

Dice el parte policial
Que Adan llegó a un Banco
Y le gritó a la
Cajera que le entregara t
Odo el dinero que ella en su caja tuviera
Y que si no lo hacia pronto, él la mataba
""El hombre me amenazó con una pistola""
Dijo una doña, ""por eso
Es que le daba lo que él quisiera
Por la clase de salario
Que aqui me pagan
No voy a arriesgar la vida que Dios me diera""

Cuentan que al salir Adan corriendo del Banco
Se halló con una patrulla parqueada al frente
Que no le hizo caso al guardia
Que le dió el ""Alto""
Que iba, ""gritando y sonriendo como un demente""
Al otro dia, los periódicos publicaban
La foto de su cadaver en calzoncillos
La viuda de Adan leyó, en la primera plana
""Ladrón usaba el revolver de agua de su chiquillo""

después de ver a mi mamá
luchando contra un cáncer
que no se puede curar

vi pasar a una familia
al frente iba un señor de edad
una doña, dos muchachas
y varias personas mas

de la mano del señor
un hombre joven caminaba
cabizbajo y luciendo arrepentido
que el era la causa de
una situación familiar
de la que nos enteramos al oír
al señor gritar

aunque tu seas un ladrón
y aunque no tienes razón
yo tengo la obligación de socorrerte
y por mas drogas que uses
y por mas que nos abuses

que el deber de un padre no acaba jamas
que el amor de padre y madre
no se cansa de entregar
que deseamos para ustedes lo que nunca
hemos tenido, que a pesar de los problemas
familia es familia y cariño es cariño
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

dos tragedias iguales

creas que tu amor es causa perdida
ten la seguridad de que ellos te quieren
y que ese cariño dura toda la vida
cuanto control y cuanto amor
tiene que haber en una casa
mucho control y mucho amor

mantén amor y control siempre ante
la pena combinando la esperanza
y el sentimiento dando la espalda

Caminando, di mil tropezones, caminando, y nunca paré
Caminando, entre risa y dolores, caminando, pa'lante y con fe

Con el tiempo, comprendí que la vida da pa'to'
Que nada borra el recuerdo de lo que uno caminó

Caminando, mirando una estrella. Caminando, oyendo una voz
Caminando, siguiendo la huella, caminando, que otro caminó
Caminando, buscando a la vida. Caminando, buscando al amor
Caminando, curando la herida, caminando, que deja el dolor!",Caminando,2012
Rubén Blades y Seis del Solar,"Siempre en la noche mi mamá buscaba el sueño
Frente a la televisión, y me pedía que por favor
No la apagara, su soledad en aquel cuarto cuarto
No aguantaba, aunque jamás lo confesó

Yo niño, no entendía su horror, porque uno es joven
Y no sabe del amor, crecí mirando a mi madre vivir
Aferrada a una esperanza que la enterró, toda
Amargada, dentro de una noche que no acabó

Y mi madre le ha temido a la noche desde el día
Que se fue mi papá
Hoy la miro y comprendo que ella aún piensa
Que las cuentas del alma no se acaban nunca de pagar

Hoy día comprendo su dolor, y lo terrible que es amar
A una ilusión que está atrapada entre la sombra del pasado
Y que en las noches se libera y va a su lado
Como el fantasma de un amor que no murió

Mi madre le ha temido a la noche desde el día
Que se fue mi papá
Hoy la miro y comprendo que ella aún piensa
Que las cuentas del alma no se acaban nunca de pagar

Rubén Blades y Seis del Solar,"Ligia Elena, la cándida niña de la sociedad
Se ha fugado con un trompetista de la vecindad
El padre la busca afanosamente, lo está comentando toda la gente
Y la madre pregunta angustiada: en dónde estará? 

De nada sirvieron regaños, ni viajes, ni monjas
Ni las promesas de amor que le hicieran los niños de bien
Fue tan buena la nota que dio aquel humilde trompeta 
Que, entre acordes de cariño eterno, se fué ella con él

Se han mudado a un cuarto chiquito con muy pocos muebles
Y allí viven contentos y llenos de felicidad
Mientras tristes, los padres, preguntan: ""¿En donde fallamos?"" 
Ligia Elena con su trompetista amándose están

Dulcemente se escurren los días en aquel cuartito
Mientras que en las mansiones lujosas de la sociedad

Va nuestra canción como un saludo
Para los que defienden su derecho
A libertad y usan la razón como su escudo

No hay bala que mate a la verdad
Cuando la defiende la razón
Reunámonos todos para acabar con la maldad
Muévete y pon todo el corazón

Casi todos buscamos siempre la comodidad
Esto ha sido así toda la vida
El que va adelante casi nunca
Mira atrás para ayudar al que lo pida

Pero hay día llegó la necesidad
De seguir un rumbo diferente
En darnos la mano para cambiar la realidad
Depende el futuro de la gente
Allá y aquí, aquí y allá

Si no hacemos algo el mundo, se va a acabar
Muévete mi gente, mueve Panamá
Muévete Puerto Rico, con seguridad
No hay bala que pueda matar la verdad

Para acabar el racismo en Sur África
Lo cantan los niños, y mamá y papá
Para salvar el mundo de tanta maldad
Lo pide la gente en todas las esquinas

Muévete Colombia, Méjico, Argentina
Cuba, Guatemala, oye Costa Rica, Perú y Nicaragua
Que hoy te necesita, Brasil y Bolivia, Chile y Paraguay

A su mujer y a los niños

Hace del hambre una almohada 
Y se acuesta triste de alma

Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabán
Pa' que no sepan en cuál de ellas lleva el puñal

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Why zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan qué está mirando
Why un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando

Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Why en un zaguán entra why se da un trago para olvidar
Que el día está flojo why no hay clientes pa' trabajar

Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm
Pedro Navaja las manos siempre dentro 'el gabán
Mira why sonríe why el diente de oro vuelve a brillar

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma está desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguán
Why Pedro Navaja apreta un puño dentro 'el gabán

Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro why no ve a nadie
Why a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Why mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
Refunfuñando pues no hizo pesos con qué comer

Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un trenta why ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal

why Pedro Navaja puñal en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puñal le hundía sin compasión
Cuando de pronto sonó un disparo como un canon

why Pedro Navaja cayó en la acera mientras veía, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano why de muerte herida ahí le decía
Yo que pensaba 'hoy no es mi día estoy salá'
Pero Pedro Navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na

why creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien salió
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie lloró
Sólo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puñal, los pesos why se marchó
Why tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje why da el mensaje de mi cancion

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Pedró navajas matón de esquina
Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina

La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburón enganchaste

Pa andar elegantes y así poder una chica plástica recoger

Ella en la boda en paris
Aparentando lo que no son
Viviendo en un mundo de pura ilusion

No juegues con niños de color extraño
Ahogados en deudas para mantener
Su estatus social en boda o hotel

De edificios cancerosos y un corazón de oro ver
Donde en ves de un sol amanece un dolar

Was so exciting

We've been together
Lovers at first sight
In love forever
It turned out so right

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people
We were strangers in the night
Up to the moment 
When we said our first hello
Little did we know
Love was just a glance away
A warm embracing dance away
For strangers in the night.",Strangers in the Night,1998

Rubén Ramos,"I stood in line and left my name
Took about six hours or so
Well, the man just grinned like it was all a game
Said they'd let me know
I put in my time till the Pocono line
Shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
Now I can't stay there no more

Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
To move some old cars around
Maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out
Van and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
And the junkyard's a pretty good ways
That job's about a half week old besides
It'd be gone now anyway

Unemployment said I got no more checks
And they showed me to the hall
My brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
A little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
We're headed down into fall

I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
Hustled up a little dough
But I got drunk and I woke up rolled
A couple of months ago
They got my harp and they got my dollar
Them low life so and so's
Harps cost money and I ain't got it
It's my own fault I suppose

The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
Two freights everyday
If it was just me I'd be headed south
But Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
Says we gotta wait and see
In my heart I know it's a little boy
Hope he don't end up like me

Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
Hope she don't break down and cry

Marie she didn't wake up this morning
She didn't even try
She just rolled over and went to heaven
My little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
Caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
So's to meet me by and by

Marie will know I'm headed south
So to meet me by and by",Marie,1993

Ruben Studdard,"Everybody's looking for that something
One thing that makes it all complete
You'll find it in the strangest places
Places you never knew it could be

Some find it in the faces of their children
Some find it in their lover's eyes
Who can deny the joy it brings
When you've found that special thing
You're flying with out wings

Some find it in sharing every morning
Some in their solitary lives
You'll find it in the words of others
A simple line can make you laugh or cry

You'll find it in the deepest friendship
The kind you cherish all your life
And when you know how much that means
You've found that special thing
You're flying without wings

So, impossible as it may seem
You've got to fight for every dream
Cause who's to know which one you let go
Would have made you complete

Well, for me it's waking up beside you
To watch the sunlight on your face
To know that I can say I love you
In any given time or place

It's the little things that only I know
Those are the things that make you mine
And it's the flying without wings
Cause you're my special thing
I'm flying without wings

And you're the place my life begins
And you'll be where it ends
I'm flying without wings
And that's the joy you bring

I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger

Imagine all the people sharing all the world, you

Are you gonna be out with a guy?
Standing around with your friends
What it is, what it is? Tell me what tha business is?

Are you thirsty? You wanna wet your throat before we go
Let's creep to the bar take a shotta XO
Maybe it'll help us loosen up
Guaranteed to get us right

We can two step to the door
I think I found what I came here for
I don't wanna wait a minute more
We've wasted half the night

When you walked by with those thick thighs
So captivating, oh, so motivating
Go on and take my hand, show me that you're comfortable
Let me give you what you need

Said he'd wait for Billy at the factory tomorrow

Flight without navigator, plight of a savior

Now what would Jesus do?
How you believe in Him? He don’t believe in you
The idea that you doubting I'm unbeatable
The genie and the princess bride inconthievable
These MCs is eatable, wait - edible
I’m fishing with dynamite, now I got a freezer full
Of rappers, bastards I'm ten steps ahead of you
Incredible, give credit where credit due

Mashing on the gas where them others they be maxing
Accelerate, generate, power with my pen and paper
Stimulate, you simulate, you do what I incinerate

We do it for the dinner plates, musical we innovate
You imitate, your theory full of holes and so we ventilate
Damn it, never gonna say they love what we doing on stage

Are a dead Sean in my back alley,

How big and dark and badly lit,
And if I said I did, would you believe me,
And I showed you gold, would you see through me
And if tomorrow didn't come,
Would you?

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

And I hear you speak my name
Softly in my ear and breathe a flame

Keep on glancing in my eyes
Till love's only trancing music dies

All of my future is in you
You're every plan I design
Promise you'll always continue
To be mine

Lover, please be tender
When you're tender fears depart
Lover, I surrender to my heart

Well, I say that the devil is in you
And to resist you I try
But if you didn't continue
I would die

Ruby Braff & Friends,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see

That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.

Where have I been all these years?

How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

I told her, she had a home just as long as I had mine

But I've changed that thing, you better leave married women alone

'Cause their husbands'll grab you, beat you ragged as a cedar tree

To all the haters like fuck y’all
To all them haters like fuck y’all
They going in for the kill
Cause they don’t like the way they feel
They just tryin’ to fill the void to avoid what is real

Cause the world is so crowded and everybody is
Shouting and there’s so many people doubting
We all just want a chance to get it but if you
Think of it sometimes you’re the one that’s not allowed and
You just wanna hear your voice
But it feels like you can’t do nothing bout it
Don’t let them make you quit
Don’t let them motherfuckers make you quit now

Cause, we might lose a battle but we'll win the war
And we don't care cause love is what we're fighting for
So fuck what they say
Cause we are the warriors
We are the warriors

Oh, they try to ignore us
You’ll never make it is what they always told us
Tried to make us hopeless
Take a warm heart heart and turn it to the coldest
Like we under hypnosis
We end up doin’ foolish things to get noticed
They act like they don’t need us
But it takes more than a tree to make a forest

Cause the world is so crowded and everybody is
Shouting and there’s so many people doubting
We all just want a chance to get it but if you
Think of it sometimes you’re the one that’s not allowed and
You just wanna hear your voice

So fuck what they say
Cause we are the warriors
We are the warriors

Now let them hear your voice
Now let them hear your voice
Don’t let them make you quit
Don’t let them make you quit, now

Rude Awakening,"You don't believe in love
You don't believe in hatred
Put your money in the bank
It's the only way to save it

You try to make a buck
But you haven't made a penny
You need a little luck
But you know you won't get any

You don't believe in God
You don't believe in glory
You've got a brother in the clinic
Tells the same kind of story

If he had another life
He'd know what would be waiting
If he had another soul
He could sell it all to Satan

You don't believe in war
You don't believe in Jesus
Got a sister in New York
She knows how she pleases

Walking the streets
On the south side of the city
Trying to make ends meet
Isn't that a pity for money?

Thought I was the queen of syncopation
You know you can't give the queen no bad advice

Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby
Thought I knew it all, baby
But I didn't know it all, baby

Little Ms. Know-it-all, you don't know it all

Living to get down
As the song became my lover

Rudies,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the kids would call me patches
Papa used to kid me about it
Of course deep down inside
He was thinkin' he had done all he could do
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
But he did wonders when the time got bad
A little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life had kicked him down to the plow
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders And in tears he said
Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later papa passed away
I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was dad's strictest rule
So every morning 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave this but I wanted a home
But I always remembered what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said, ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best, It's up to you to do the rest
:
But then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through, Cause
Everyday I had to work the fields
Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of a family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to face another day
Though years have passed and all the kids are gone
I aimed to take my mama to a brand new home
God knows people that I shed a tear
My daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin', ""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you
I could still hear papa when he'd say
Patches, I'm depending on you son
I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest"".",Patches,2003

I've been staring down your way
Don't know exactly what to say
I'm wondering if you feel the same

Because everytime I'm looking down
The questions what you're dancing around
I'm sick of playing silly games

Tell me, am I the type you go for?
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind

Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby

Every single night and day
I wonder if it's just a phase,
Or is it really something here
'Cause whenever that you need something
I feel it in our energy
Just pull me out my misery

Tell me, am I the type you go for?
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind

Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby

Rudimental,"Hell could freeze over now
You're you're our peace, hear me shout
Hell could freeze (hell could freeze) over now (over now)
You're you're our peace, hear me shout

Uh I wrote this to tell you how much I'm missing you
And how ironically I'm feeling crazy as an institute
I'm contemplating time you told me that I would be without you
Had an extra strategy and you were trying to see me out
We were like a part, had me at the mood swings
Couldn't get it off the ground like bruised wings
Not one, not two, but a few things
Made me question what it really was that you bring
Now that the madness over and the fog's been cleared and I'm sadly sober
I could see the break fails and the crash before us
And the heavens poured down like a last proposal
Like uh, give me one more chance
Last one, just one more dance
No future, just a past before us
And that will rerun till we cast the show

Cause I don't want nothing, playing games with you
Not in, not in, uh-uh
(We go, we go up and down) Hell could freeze over now
(And down, turn me inside out) You're you're our peace, hear me shout
(You make my heart do flush)
(Till I forger about)

Cupid's gun to our souls, he just can't trigger chemistry
Need a lot of things that you can't really give to me
I'm screaming on mute cause you ain't really hearing me
The hardest f*cking love is where you make your biggest enemy
Flashback to a year ago hand in hand and the trash with a fear would go(')
I don't understand how's it happen, where did it go
All the love and the passion, once it was gold
Uh, it's gone now
When I'm here, and I'm there, and I'm torn now
When I'm hurt and I'm bruised, and I'm torn down
And I made some mistakes, but mature now
And I've touched my regret through my pause now
And felt how it feels to be sure now
And I know what it means to deplore now
And I know what it means to endorse love
And I know when it hurts to the core now
And I've burnt every bridge that I've torn down
Then I picked up our heart from the floor now
And I want and I crave anymore now
So just give me one more chance
Last one, just one more dance
I know we go back and forth,
But my back's to the wall and I'm back for more

I don't want nothing, playing games with you
Not in, not in, uh-uh
(We go, we go up and down) hell could freeze over now
(Turn me inside out) You're you're our peace, hear me shout
(You make my heart do flush)(Till I forger about)
It's right, it's right

You make my heart, yeah, yeah
I don't understand, where did it go
And I'm here, and I'm there
Where did it go
As we go up and down
As we go up and down
As we go up and down

As we go up and down (Hell could freeze over now)
Turn me inside out (You're you're our peace, hear me shout)

Won’t give up (Go away)
Til I’m high

November phone call, on the hotline
You see the picture, every single sign
I got a secret
But can you keep it?

If tears had balance, what would life be?
You and me would be quiet likely
But you see this
I’m still a misfit

I feel,
Running in circles tryna find me
Blindfolded
With only the darkness you’re unable to see

I’m not there
I’m not there
And to tell you the truth you should cut me loose,
I’m nowhere, nowhere

So I hide myself away
To another place
I hide oh between the sheets
So you don’t see me ah
It’s a masquerade
Play another phase
I won’t give up, no
Hiding in lies goes inside out so weak

Won’t give up (I want you)
Won’t give up (go away)
Til I’m high (I want you)
Won’t give up (go away)

Tell another lie, commit another sin
This he says she says is wearing you thin and you know it
But you don’t show it

To feel,
Is something I'm tryin' it’s so hard to do
Unfolded
Now you’re survival I’ve gotten through,
I am scared
So so scared
And to tell you the truth this is nothing new
So I can’t oh I can’t
