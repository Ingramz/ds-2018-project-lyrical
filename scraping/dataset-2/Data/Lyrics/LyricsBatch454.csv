Anna Kendrick,"I got my ticket for the long way ‘round
Two bottle ‘a whiskey for the way
And I sure would like some sweet company
And I’m leaving tomorrow, wha-do-ya say?

When I’m gone
When I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone
You’re gonna miss me by my hair
You’re gonna miss me everywhere, oh
You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone

I’ve got my ticket for the long way ‘round
The one with the prettiest of views
It’s got mountains, it’s got rivers, it’s got sights to give you shivers
But it sure would be prettier with you

Anna Kendrick,"I hopped off the plane at LAX with a dream and a Cardagain
Welcome to the land of fame excess am I gonna fit in
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy, everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on
And the Jay-Z song was on

So I put my hands up, they're playin' my song
The butterflies fly away, I'm noddin' my head like, yeah!
Movin' my hips like, yeah!
Got my hands up, they're playin' my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, Its a party in the USA!

Anna Kendrick,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday

Uh, uh, I was thinkin' bout her, thinkin' bout me, thinkin' bout us, who we gonna be
(I know, I know, when I compliment her she won't believe me)
Opened my eyes, and it was only just a dream
(It's so, it's so, sad to think that she can't see what I see)
(But every time she asks me ""do I look okay, you know I'll say)
It was only just a dream

When I see your face
(So I traveled back down that road will she come back, no one knows)
There's not a thing that I would change, cause you're amazing, just the way you are
(I realized, it was only just a dream, it was only just a dream)

Anna Kendrick,"Oh,Mickey, you’re so fine
You’re so fine you blow my mind, hey Mickey, (Hey hey)
Hey Mickey (Hey, hey)

Oh, Mickey, you’re so fine (You’re so fine and you’re mine)
I’ll be yours till the end of time
'Cause you make me feel
Yeah, you make me feel
So shiny and new

Like a virgin
Touched for the very first time (Touched for the first time)

Like the one in me
That’s O.K.
Let’s see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let’s get down to it

Hit me with your best shot
Why don’t you hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away

Na na na come on
Na na na na na, come on, come on, come on

'Cause I may be bad but I’m perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don’t care I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I’m perfectly good at it

Sex baby,
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be
Let’s talk about sex (Alright)
Let’s talk about sex (A little bit, a little bit)
Let’s talk about sex, baby

Baby, all through the night, I’ll make love to you,
Like you want me too

(And I) And I guess it’s just the woman in you,
That brings out the man in me
I know I can’t help myself
You’re all in the world to me

It feels like the first time
It feels like the very first time
It feels like the first time

It’s going down fade to Blackstreet
The homies got at me collab creations bump, like acne
No doubt, I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch, a dog couldn’t catch me, straight up
Tell me who could stop when Dre making moves, attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour with homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers (Shorty get down)

Good Lord
Baby got them open up all over town
Strictly biz she don’t play around
Cover much ground got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can’t get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

(Girl)I like the way you work it,
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby,

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, baby

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up , babe

I like the way you work it
No diggity, I got to bag it up

Anna Kendrick,"Mother cannot guide you
Now you're on your own
Only me beside you
Still, you're not alone
No one is alone
Truly
No one is alone

I wish...
I know
Mother isn't here now
Wrong things, right things
Who knows what she'd say?
Who can say what's true?
Nothing's quite so clear now
Do things, fight things
Feel you've lost your way?
You decide, but
You are not alone
Believe me
No one is alone (No one is alone)
Believe me
Truly

People make mistakes
Fathers
Mothers
People make mistakes
Holding to their own
Thinking they're alone
Honor their mistakes
Fight for their mistakes
Everybody makes
One another's terrible mistakes
Witches can be right, giants can be good
You decide what's right, you decide what's good

Just remember
Just remember
Someone is on your side (Our side)
Our side
Someone else is not
While we're seeing our side (Our side)
Our side
Maybe we forgot, they are not alone
No one is alone
Someone is on your side
No one is alone",No One Is Alone,2014
Anna Kendrick,"He's a very smart Prince
He's a Prince who prepares
Knowing this time I'd run from him
He spread pitch on the stairs
And I'm caught unawares
Well it means that he cares
This is more than just malice
Better stop and take stock
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

All right what do you want
Have to make a decision
Why not stay and be caught
Should I give that a thought
What would be his response
But then what if he knew
Who I am when I know
That I'm not what he thinks
That he wants

But what if I am
What a Prince would envision
But then how can you know
Who you are till you know
What you want, which I don't
So then which do you pick
Where you're safe, out of sight
And yourself, but where everything's wrong
Or where everything's right
But you know that you'll never belong

And whichever you pick
Do it quick
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

It's my first big decision
The choice isn't easy to make
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all
Once you're there, though, it's scary
And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave
But you have to be wary
There's a lot that's at stake
But you've stalled long enough
'Cause you're still standing stuck
In the stuff on the steps

Better run along home
And avoid the collision
Though at home they don't care
I'll be better of there
Where there's nothing to choose
So there's nothing to lose
So I'll pry up my shoes
Wait no thinking it through
Things don't have to collide
I know what my decision is
Which is not to decide
I'll just leave him a clue
For example, a shoe
And then see what he'll do

Now it's he and not you
Who is stuck with a shoe
In a stew, in the goo
And I've learned something, too
Something i never knew
On the steps of the palace",On the Steps of the Palace,2014
Anna Kendrick,"He's a very nice Prince
And
And
It's a very nice ball
And

And
When I entered they trumpeted
And
The Prince
Oh, the Prince
Yes, the Prince
Well, he's tall

Is that all
Did you dance
Is he charming,they say that he's charming
We did nothing but dance
Yes, and
And it made a nice change
No, the Prince

Oh, the Prince
Yes, the Prince
He has charm for a Prince, I guess

I don't meet a wide range
And it's all very strange",A  Very Nice Prince,2014
Anna Kendrick,"But it isn't my fault
I was given those beans!
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans!
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk
To get up to the giant's
In the first place!

Wait a minute, magic beans
For a cow so old
That you had to tell
A lie to sell it
Which you told!
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold

See, it's your fault
No!
Yes, it's you fault
No!
Yes, it is!
It's not!
It's true

Wait a minute
But I only stole the gold
To get my cow back
From you!

So it's your fault!
Yes!
No, it isn't!
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed
She made us get the cow to get
The curse reversed!

It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed
And the place got cursed
In the first place!

Oh!
Then it's his fault!
So
It was his fault!
No
Yes, it is
It's his
I guess

Wait a minute, though
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear?
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer
Is how did the second giant get down here
In the first place?
Second place?

Yes!
How?
Hmmm
Well,
Who had the other bean?
The other bean?
The other bean?
You pocketed the other bean
I didn't!
Yes I did
So it's your-
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife!
So it's her fault!
No, it isn't!
Then whose is it?
Wait a minute!
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe
So the one who knows what happened
To that bean is you!
You mean that old bean
That your wife, oh, dear
But I never knew,
And so I threw-
Well, don't look here!

So it's your fault!
But-
See, it's her fault!
But-
And it isn't mine at all!
But what?
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again
We were needy
You were greedy!
Did you need that hen?
But I got it for my mother!
So it's her fault then!
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?
The harp, yes!
She went and dared me to!
I dared you to?
You dared me to!
She said that I was scared
So she dared me!
No, I didn't!
So it's your fault!
Wait a minute!
If you hadn't dared him to
And you had left the harp alone,
We wouldn't be in trouble
In the first place!",Your Fault,2014
Anna Kendrick,"I guess I can't believe you really came
And that we're sitting on this pier
See, I'm smiling 
That means I'm happy that you're here

I stole this sweater from the costume shop 
It makes me look like Daisy Mae
See, we're laughing 
I think we're gonna be okay

I mean, we'll have to try a little harder
And bend things to and fro
To make this love as special
As it was five years ago
I mean, you made it to Ohio!
Who knows where else we can go?

I think you're really gonna like this show
I'm pretty sure it doesn't suck
See, you're laughing, and I'm smiling
By a river in Ohio
And you're mine
We're doing fine

I think we both can see what could be better 
I'll own when I was wrong
With all we've had to go through
We'll end up twice as strong
And so we'll start again this weekend
And just keep rolling along

I didn't know you had to go so soon
I thought we had a little time
Look, whatever, if you have to
Then you have to, so whatever
It's all right 
We'll have tonight

You know what makes me crazy?
I'm sorry, can I say this?
You know what makes me nuts?
The fact that we could be together here together
Sharing our night, spending our time
And you are gonna choose someone else to be with no, you are
Yes, Jamie, that's exactly what you're doing
You could be here with me or be there with them 
As usual, guess which you pick!

No, Jamie, you do not have to go to another party 
With the same twenty jerks you already know
You could stay with your wife on her fucking birthday
And you could, God forbid, even see my show
And I know in your soul it must drive you crazy
That you won't get to play with your little girlfriends 
No I'm not, no I'm not and the point is, Jamie
That you can't spend a single day 
That's not about you and you and nothing but you
Marvelous novelist, you!
Isn't he wonderful, just twenty-eight!
The savior of writing!
You and you and nothing but you 
Miles and piles of you
Pushing through windows and bursting through walls en route to the sky!
And I

I swear to God I'll never understand
How you can stand there, straight and tall
And see I'm crying
And not do anything at all",See I'm Smiling,2015

The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away

As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away

Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay

Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy
Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just, call me up
'Cause I will always be there

Anna Kova,"Bah ouais c’est sur c’est la merde, c’est pas trop ça ce qui était prévu 
Nos ambitions sont en berne et notre avenir en garde à vue 
Et si c’est vrai que l’intelligence est la capacité d’adaptation 
Il va falloir la jouer rusé face à certaines situations 
Avec une enclume sur le dos, les pieds liés et le vent de face 
C’est déjà plus dur d’aimer la vie, de faire des sourires dans la glace 
On a perdu la première manche mais le même joueur rejoue 
Le destin nous a giflé, on n'veut pas tendre l’autre joue 
Alors va falloir inventer avec du courage plein les poches 
Trouver autre chose à raconter pour pas louper un deuxième coche 
Y’avait surement plusieurs options mais finalement on a opté 
Pour accepter cette position, trouver un espoir adapté 
Alors on va relever les yeux, quand nos regrets prendront la fuite 
On se fixera des objectifs à mobilité réduite 
Là bas au bout des couloirs, il y aura de la lumière à capter 
On va tenter d’aller la voir avec un espoir adapté 

Can you hear me? I am awake 
Can you see all the fights that happen through my eyes 
Don’t lie I reach the light and hope will guide me 

Un espoir adapté, c’est l’envie de croire qui résiste 
Même en milieu hostile c’est la victoire qui existe 
Ces cinq potes un peu perdues qui tentent de battre encore des ailes 
C’est retrouver le gout de la sueur entre deux barres parallèles 
Un espoir adapté, c’est de l’espoir bousculé 
Parce qu’on est dos au mur, y’a plus de place pour reculer 
Comme un instinct de survie on pense encore à avancer 
À la fin de quelque chose il y a bien un truc à commencer 
Après avoir nagé au cœur des points d’interrogations 
On va sortir de la torpeur certains diront reconversion 
Là bas au bout des couloirs, y’aura de la lumière à capter 
On va tenter d’aller la voir avec un espoir adapté 

I’ve been trying to let it go 
Been trying to free my soul 
But all the friends that I have lost 
And all the scars that I have left 
My body, embodies all my sorrows 
My bones mirror my own morals 
Now I don’t need nothing more than to feel my heart pounding 
I’ll hold on to this second chance I’ll breathe it 

Retrouver un espoir sans oublier ceux qui saignent 
Car dans cette quête on est pas tous logés à la même enseigne 
Moi j'ai eu ma deuxième chance et même si je peux la rendre belle 
Je pense souvent à la tristesse du dernier sourire de noël 
Un espoir adapté c’est faire le deuil de tous les autres 
Sourire encore ne serai-ce qu’en hommage à tous les nôtres 
Ceux qui étaient là, qui m’ont porté au propre comme au figuré 
Ceux qui ont adapté leurs vies pour rendre la mienne moins compliquée 

Can you hear me? I am awake 
Can you see all the fights that happen through my eyes 
Don’t lie I reach the light and hope will guide

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?

And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me

I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.

Tells me that you are my own.

Anna Maria Jopek,"A thousand years, a thousand more
A thousand times a million doors to eternity
I may have lived a thousand lives, a thousand times
An endless turning stairway climbs, to a tower of souls
If it takes another thousand years, a thousand wars
The towers rise to numberless floors in space
I could shed another million tears, a million breaths
A million names but only one truth to face
(I still love you)

A million roads, a million fears
A million suns, ten years of uncertainty
I could speak a million lies, a million songs
A million rights, a million wrongs in this balance of time
But if there was a single truth, a single light
A single thought, a singular touch of grace
Then following this single point, this single flame
The single haunted memory of your face

I still love you
I still want you
A thousand times the mysteries unfold themselves
Like galaxies in my head

I may be numberless, I maybe innocent
I may know many things, I may be ignorant
Or I could ride with kings and conquer many lands
Or win this world at cards and let it slip my hands
I could be cannon food, destroyed a thousand times
Reborn as fortune's child to judge another's crimes
Or wear this pilgrim's cloak, or be a common theif
I've kept this single faith, this one belief

I still want you

Like galaxies in my head
On and on the mysteries unwind themselves

And everything I see and touch is tainted
And it turns to dust

Who plays your voice to me
Who strings it on the breeze
If I could just believe
But it's nothing just the wind

If I put it in a hidden place
An image in my mind
The window may close some more each day
And then time might keep on moving

Who plays your voice to me
Who strings it on the breeze
If I could just believe
But it's nothing just the wind

Who plays your voice to me
Who strings it on the breeze

In an Autumn wind
We met out in mid air
And fell together
In a patch of ground
And grew to be a pair

With curly hair while mine was straight
And I was much to small

And crave some dots or some lines

I'll get up and go

On my way, I walked through town
Stopped at your house
But you weren't around
The lights were on to ward off thieves
While you stayed out all night
But it was you who stole my heart
When you hadn't any right

It's my town but I had to leave it
And head South where the climate is kind
And if a time comes when I'm feeling better
I'll be back like the birds in the Spring

I tried to think of better days lying in my berth
But I pondered revenge, for what it was worth

Valence minus one
Swimming through the sea, digging the scene
Just having fun
She's not worried about the shape or size
Of her outside shell
It's fun to ionize
Just a little atom of cl
With an unfilled shell

But somewhere in that sea lurks
Handsome sodium
With enough electrons on his outside shell
Plus that extra one
Somewhere in this deep blue sea 
There's a negative
For my extra energy yes
Somewhere in this foam
My positive will find a home

Then unsuspecting chlorine
Felt a magnetic pull
She looked down and her outside
Shell was full
Sodium cried ""what a gas be my bride and
I'll change your name from chlorine to chloride""

Now the sea evaporates to make the clouds
For the rain and snow
Leaving her chemical compounds in the absence
Of H2O

Are happy ones

To me

""Mama, the small hand's at eight
Get up or I'll be late
Please fix me something sweet and good
To eat now

For that bell in the yard won't wait
And neither does time""

And if you chose, I'll break the news

A time to talk, but without luck

You filled our cup
With your perfect words

We fell in love, 
We had no choice.

And I can't say 
For sure where you have gone,
But in that place 
I'm bettin' there's a better song

For we've all known down here,
The taste of joy and strife
You were the sweetest note
In the chord of life.

Anna Moffo,"[On a late night in the spring of 1827 
The city of Vienna is experiencing the largest lightning storm in its long history. 
Within a large disheveled room, 
Ludwig Von Beethoven is slumped over his piano 
And on the piano sits the just completed manuscript for his tenth symphony. 
It is his final, and he is certain, his greatest work.]

Since the time when ra and isis
Raised the sphinx out of the sand
And apollo dreamed athena
And men began to understand

That when darkness folds on darkness
In the restless tides of night
And lightning raises shadows
And for moments gives them life

It's been said by those who ponder
That it surely is a sign
That a life touched by the stars
Is now running out of time

And that somewhere in that darkness
In the heart of that great storm
The world returns a soul
That the gods caused to be born

And this was such a storm
The kind one rarely sees in life
For in a room now filled with shadows
The great Beethoven was spending

His last night

[From the shadows a beautiful spirit, fate, 
And her deformed dwarf son, twist, 
Emerge to inform Beethoven of what he has already deeply suspected, 
That this is to be his last night on earth. 
They are accompanied by numerous spirits and ghosts from his past.]",Overture,2001

Anna Nalick,"I'm sitting on a citadel
Contemplating life
Making a point to waste my time
I'm walking on clouds of white

What if I fall?
What if I don't?
What if I never make it home?
What if I bleed?
What if I break?
And I find that I can't take
The city below the Citadel
Holding my own hand?

And I'm breaking on the balcony
Breaking window panes
Killing the pain of broken hearts
I'm walking on clouds
Walking on stars

What if I fall?
What if I don't?
What if I never make it home?
What if I bleed?
What if I break?
And I find that I can't take
The city below the Citadel
Holding my own hand?

I'm holding on to something
It's keeping me from jumping
I'm so afraid to do it alone
And holding up this fortress
With imaginary forces
Longing for a life down below

What if I fall?
What if I don't?
What if I never make it home?
What if I bleed?
What if I break?

Lamp and flashing red and white
Through a starry night I'm better nowhere-bound
Than boundin' on your solid ground

Satellite, save my life
I'm wishing on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded, bated, all alone
A whisper on a two-way radio

Wishing on an airplane
Its callin' stars by name
A lonely song of freedom rings
In hope of someone listening and
So I send my feeble flare
Through the silent arctic air
Heading anywhere
Until at last I've finally found
A place to lay my anchor down

I'm wishin' on a two-way radio
Love might be just like me
Jaded, bated, all alone

Drownin' and I can't save me
Send some salvation

We've got it all worked out, the plans all made
If we believe in the fight then we're all saved
It's gonna hurt for a while but it would anyway
Let us stand resolute with our voices raised
We have a right to insist to be free and brave

sufriendo, cantando, viviendo.

iltamyöhällä mä raahustin
ja oveen aloin avainta sovittaa

kun jotain yrittää
ja silti ulos jää

siinä kerrottiin
suhdanteiden olevan nyt niin
et ei oo kotiin mulla enää asiaa
Vai niin, siis jouduin nielemään

kun jotain yrittää
ja silti ulos jää,

Ormai ci sei
Chissà se con lo stesso sguardo
Vedi me negli occhi tuoi

Allora sì
Io devo dirtelo
Mentre provavo a non pensarti
Ti pensavo sempre più

Siamo un po' troppo vicini adesso per scappare via

Tu non lo sai
Prima di te
C'è stato un altro che ha lasciato
Le ferite dentro me

Non aver paura giuro amore sono qui a difenderti
Con il tempo guarirò il tuo cuore cancellando i lividi
E per tutti i giorni che verranno ti respirerò

Io ti dirò le cose dette mai
Di questo amore noi saremo gli angeli
Il mio petto da cuscino
Per la vita ti farà

Sembra cominciata già
Una storia senza fine

Farò girare il mondo intorno a noi
Arriverà Natale senza nuvole
Le domeniche d'agosto
Quanta neve che cadrà
E nel tempo che verrà
Il mio cuore ti sorprenderà

Che freddo fa
Stringimi un po'
Riaccendi tutti i desideri quasi spenti dentro me
Con le dita sfioro il tuo profilo poi mi fermo un attimo
Per giocare con i tuoi capelli che nel vento volano
Prima di scoprire un bacio nuovo
Che sapore avrà",Un Nuovo Bacio,2002
Anna Tatangelo,"Guarda quanti lividi 
Guarda quanti spigoli 
Tra noi, 
Quanti sogni e brividi 
Hai contato le perplessità, 
E rimangono le cose dette a metà 
Sensazioni che non dormiranno più, 
Partiranno con le frasi e le parole dette mai

Non so stare senza te 
Non so stare amore 
Quale alternativa c'è 
Per non farci troppo male, 
Solo tu puoi dare un senso a quel che hai, 
Io so solo che in amore non si può mai dire mai

Perchè stare senza te 
È come spegnere il mio cuore 
Per lasciare posto ai se 
Dentro a un gioco di parole 
Solo tu puoi dare un senso a quel che hai 
Io so solo che in amore non si può mai dire mai, mai, mai 

Do uno sguardo al mio passato 
E ti vedo lì impalato già 
Mi hai lasciata incredula 
Poi mi ha detto:""Un giorno capirai!"" 
Non lo sai quanto ti ho odiato,non lo sai

Anna Tatangelo,"Nasci come l'alba chiara del mattino
Da tenere al petto sempre più vicino
Come un'autostrada lunga senza meta
Scegli tu l'uscita per la tua fermata
Mentre cresci cambi mille direzioni
Per capire dove trovi un'emozione
Ma c'è un'ossessione che non va più via

Come un temporale arriva all'improvviso
Sopra il viso scende piano il tuo sorriso
Nello specchio vedi sempre tutto nero
Scende dalla nave pure il tuo corsaro
Mentre sposti il limite all'esagerato
Stai per condannare a morte la tua vita
E la luce del tuo sole vedi andare via

Smettila di farti del male
È la tua vita non buttarla così
Apri gli occhi e guarda lontano
A cercare il destino ch'era scritto per te
Adesso
Smettila non farti del male
Sei così bella non è giusto così
Nello specchio della paura
Lascia il tuo corpo e porta il cuore con te.

Dentro la tua forza cerca di capire
Che la depressione ha preso il suo potere
Esci dal tuo mondo falso e fuori uso
Guada fuori qui come è meraviglioso
Non c'è medicina per il tuo malore
Solo con l'amore lo potrai curare
Con l'amore vero che c'è dentro te

Cerca un pò di ritrovare la stima
Ricomincia tutto proprio da qui
Chiama pure la tua amica del cuore
Che prova dolore a vederti così

Smettila di piangere ancora
Nella paura più paura non c'è
E come fa la forza della natura
Distruggi il male che c'è dentro di Te",Adesso,2008

Proprio adesso che stai crescendo, maturando
Ti prepari alle grandi sfide

Non ti scoraggiare mai
Io ci sono quando vuoi, Anna

Com'è bello sentirti viva 
Così agile e combattiva, intrigante 
Nella vita come sulla scena 
Si vince solo se la passione è sincera
Fughe e tradimenti
Dubbi tanti, tutto servirà

Vada comunque vada 
Dopo una lacrima una risata ci vuole,
Nessuna esitazione arrivi dritta quell'emozione fedele
Indossa quella canzone
Falla girare, falla sentire 
È lei che parlerà per te, lei sola 
Un vantaggio certo tu c'è l'hai
Tu sarai Anna come e quando vorrai, ricorda 

Sorprenditi e sorprendi
Tutti diversi e tutti interessanti I tuoi giorni
Tuo figlio prima di ogni altro evento 
L'amore non conosca mai il rimpianto, stagli accanto
Anna io ti credo ma ti chiedo più sincerità

Vada comunque vada 
Conviene spenderla questa vita, onorarla 
Si può sopportare il male 
E qualche volta anche perdonare, fa bene

Oltre alla musica, le parole

Facciamo questa strada insieme se vuoi
Sono felice di sapere che sei

I feel a wreck without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw their stars crashing

I’m a mess without my little China girl
Wake up in the morning, where’s my little China girl?
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw their stars crashing down

I feel tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It’s in the white of my eyes

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Baby, just you shut your mouth

Anna Ternheim,"I know a girl laying down
She's sleeping weeks at a time
And when she wakes up she watches TV
Counting cracks in the ceiling

No, I don't know what she's thinking
So I give up waiting for someone, waiting
Talking to someone, staring

I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind
Girl's laying down
Never come around

So much for girl staying
In afraid of being needed
And seen she watches
The world on a screen

She's distant
And God knows I tried to leave her
'Cause she's got a constant fever
I let it slip my mind

I never come around
I never come around
I left her fifteen years behind

I know a girl laying down
No, I never wasted my time
We have something in common
She's as different as I am

Make the wrong turn, you'll know
If you're thinking of going
Think no more

Who's taking you down there?
What's his name, let me know
The price he offers
Round the corner of love

Halfway to fivepoints
Is as far as you'll come
Halfway with high hopes of love

So be careful, my love
Be careful, my girl
Be careful with love

How to get to fivepoints?
How would I know?
A place so distant
And so long ago

Is as far as you'll come
Halfway with high hopes of love

Anna Ternheim,"Please put me to sleep
If there's room beneath your feet
See, I left my home
I couldn't get used to living alone

Put me to rest
Lay your head on my chest
Hold my hand when you leave
Don't wake me up
Just to see how you say goodbye

Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine
God, I waited so long
Maybe my time has come
To walk by your side

Please put me at ease
Now my soul is ready for peace
Give me the lover's curse
Now I am ready for you
My rebel, my hope

Maybe I could be yours
Maybe you could be mine

Maybe my time has come
To walk by your side

Anna Ternheim,"It's getting late
I think my time is running out
No one special
Nothing lasting with inside

How should I stay calm
When panic lies just ahead?
Everyone can see my youth
Hanging by a thread

No subtle men
Came to my town
No subtle men
Begging for my hand

I'm one of few who's left
When everyone has gone
The train is leaving
And it's too late to get on

So much for running
When no one stays to wait
For another broken promise
To slip my mind by mistake

Who would take my word
On anything these days?
I felt so many times
Saying I'm gonna change

Anna Ternheim,"Voices hard and hollow
Colder than I ever was before
I'm leaving you pieces
Of love to come for more

You always find me miles from where
I said, ""You must let go""
Or nothing sounds convincing
To the one you can't say no

Who could possibly save
Save us from madness?
Love is the common name
Again, we depend on the one to blame

It's bittersweet to swallow
Kindness as a consequence of guilt
So gather up the pieces of your last and dying will
And prepare yourself to live with whatever follows pain

Who could possibly save
Save us from madness?
Love is the common name
Again, we depend on the to blame

",One to Blame,2006
Anna Ternheim,"She'll ask you where you've been
You'll be hours late when you finally come home
She'll suspect something's wrong
Make sure to erase all your outgoing calls

Why trouble her lonely soul?
She doesn't have to know
Doesn't have to know

Why tell her, it would hurt her so
She's such a lonely soul
Such a lonely soul

She'll be watching you for sure
Afraid to find out what she already knows
And she'll try to stay calm
'Cause you'll be so hard to get to and she's still in love

Why trouble her lonely soul?

Doesn't have to know

Why tell her? It would hurt her so

Anna Ternheim,"Call me free today
If you see it my way
Time on my side
As well as my mind is

It's not with you for sure
No, not anymore
I intend to stay away for good

Just a matter how I define
My state of mind
Today is a good day
Today is a good day

Without your company
I have so many holes to fill
At least seven nights a week
Killing time

I still feel fine, I guess
My life was a mess
When I shared it with you
I was lonely

Now, I'm just alone
Just a matter how I define
Just a matter how I define
My state of mind
Today is a good day

Just a scratch on my ego
I get up in the morning
If we could plan tomorrow
I'll be keeping my mind cold

Until the evening when the hours forget me
And the waiting awakes me
And the voices of madness
From my subconscious singing songs of sadness

Today is a good day
Today is a good day
Oh, such a good day

Today is a good day
Today is a good day
",Today Is a Good Day,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Waking up was kind of strange
The past two years have made a change

You are barely on my mind
Saying goodbye sure takes time

Today, you should turn 25
With your best time flying by
Not knowing where your future lies
And all prepared to conquer life

We get no answers from the past
No, how the fire spread so fast

But New Year's Eve
All turned black
Sometimes you're lucky
Sometimes you're not

",Tribute to Linn,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Me and you
I better laugh in twenty years from now
With some perspective and dedication
I will find somebody new

It better be someone special
He better be coming very soon
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you

You or no one
I hope I'm wrong before I die of boredom
I wantmore than
Days and nights when I amuse
Myself alone

He better be someone special
He better be devoted just like you
It better be for real this time
Oh I know, it always was with you
You, you, with you

Friends forever, oh no
Another girl will change your mind
In less than half the summer
So before you fall in love, I wonder
When you asked for
Something that I couldn't give you
More of
Me and you
I talk as if it's now but nothing is new

She better be someone special
She better be more in love than me
And if I was your brightest hour
She is now, as far as I can see, see
As far as I can see
As far as I can see
She better be
She better be
She better be
She better be



",Better Be,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Then I pulled out in a day
To catch my breath some place far away

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I

Tomorrow morning set me free
For many nights you'll never sleep
When I'm far from reaching out of sight
Enough to get me on my high tonight

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I
All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I

Forever lost in 90 days
From early march till late in may
Farewell for now, farewell for now, farewellâ?¦

All to say farewell for now
No one brings you down like I do



",Bring Down Like I,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Mind made up, I'd given all for you
See'est la folie d'amour
By now my mind is clear
You planted all the fear
Doubts and despair and
You keep my heart on the run
I'm bound to fall in love with the one

Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi

So we planed a secret rendez-vous
Toute la nuit chez moi

Soon confusion grew
I sadly smiled for two
His head went down
He wore my heart like a crown
Ever since I fall for the one

Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi
Qui ne m'aime pas
Qui n'a pas besoin de moi

Wall burnt down
You never burned down yours



",A French Love,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Lately you've been bothered by your friends
We will disturb you, to make you talk again
Try to find the other side of you
The things you hide, what you don't say

We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through

Give you second chances easily
We wait for answers, for hours and years
But the sadness in your eyes won't go away
It becomes you, in a strange kind of way
I wonder where you come from
Who you've been
What you gain, if you win
But my guess is right you break like glass
And I wonder where, your god was then

I say no, oh no
I won't let you slip inbetween
I say no, oh no
I won't let you squeeze right through

Oh how sweet a girl like you can be
When she tries
You're changing skin like I change clothes
You're faking it well, but it shows

You say: lately I've been bothered by my friends
They need foregiveness
I need therapy, they say
Better lock up well before they come
With their prayers, and loaded guns
Better lock up well before they come
More than ten years to ignore, what they here for

We say no, oh no
We won't let you slip inbetween
We say no, oh no
We won't let you squeeze right through

We say no, no no no
Since you fall from every throne



",I Say No,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Caught by what comes by
Stand alone without a fair chance tonight
Here again by your side when
They turn on all the lights
Yes I'll follow you tonight

Using white lies if we have to
It's easy to forgive and forget it all tomorrow
I just pass by you, pass by me
My last way out and worst mistake tonight
Lying lips won't say my eyes give me away
Won't you please turn out the light
And I'll follow you tonight

I'll follow you tonight
The worst mistake to make
Or just the kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
And I'll follow you to any doorstep, any hallway
With hope of finding more
Not feel shallow not get bored
And find it useless, feeling meaningless
And just as low as I was high the night before

The worst mistake to make
Or just the kind of promise you simply have to break
So please turn out the lights
And I'll follow you tonight



",I'll Follow You Tonight,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Today must have been one of the strangest days
Some would say that you won't find love that way
The best days are not planned by common sense
By lack of time
You just happen to be where everything feels fine

It's a new secret I have found

From today I'll change my priorities around
I'm no longer in command, and people say
I'm off solid ground and you're to blame
But they don't understand, people never do
It's confusing, I don't expect them to

It's a new secret I have found

Today must have been one of the strangest days
I found a place where I could stay
And people say that it will kill me,
But they don't understand
People never do, but it makes sense to me
To be senseless to change my plans for you

It's a new secret I have found

And I'm off solid grounds for you



",My Secret,2006
Anna Ternheim,"Haven't you noticed
There is someone outside
Looking through our window
When we sleep at night
You must not leave me alone anymore
Awake all night, worrying for

You to be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else

Didn't I tell you
About the dream I had last night
We were both in it
And everything seemed so right
When I opened up my eyes
He was standing behind our
Don't remember the look on his face
But I remember, I remember what he said

To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
??
It's time for you to be with somebody like me

Somebdy touched me
And whispered in my ear
Come a little bit closer
There's nothing for you to fear here
So I left your sight
Followed my own voice now
The window was open
But he was gone
And I went back to you

To be with somebody else
It's time to be with somebody else
??
It's time for you to be with somebody outside

Pictures in your head at night

A lump but just a tiny hole, almost no light at all in here

You have never realised what I'm going through
and my agony grows like a mountain
It's twelve o'clock and all my hopes are standing
just on a dead phone
and my heart is shouting I love you",Dodeka,1998

Anna Vissi,"Seems only yesterday now,
Hiding my heart away
I kept my world outside
Tonight love could not be mine
Then suddenly I see you

I knew it had to be you
I feel your spirit in me
Love has saved my life

[Chorus]
Everything I am. everything I own
Everything that's happening before my eyes
I owe it all to you

Pure is the love
Soft is the touch, you thrill

Some things are meant to be
I found myself in you

No it wasn't supposed to end like this
But something inside
Holds on so deep so tight
Have to decide
To give up this fight.

[Chorus]
But I can feel you all around me
Sounds of love still resounding
And I'm praying to you
Forgive me this
I look to heaven and
Fall down on my knees
Look at my hands up
Hope you will believe and
I'm praying to you forgive me this.

You, well you never thought
It's gonna happen to you.
Youth is dangerous
When the heat of passions rules

And if I could, well I would
Have done it right
I toss and turn
When I think of what
You might have looked like

In my dreams I see you safe
Safe from harm.
In these fields if heaven you're free
Free to run oh oh oh

For you to bring me down
Those days are gone now

Ground while I wait around no more the fool

You thought I'd break then you were wrong
That I won't see what's going on but I knew
Here I am I'm alive and you will see I'll survive without you
And I won't be the one who comes running
It ain't like it used to be
Here's your turn to run to me

So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?
So in love with yourself
How could you love somebody else?

Always out at every party

I'm still in love with you
I still believe in you
I still hold on to the feeling,hoping it's real and knowing it's kiling me
You're still the only one,I love uoy right or wrong
And I can't give up and I won't move on
The ghost of your love keeps me holding on

Gone are days of laughing at love and tears
I got so many things I could tell you,
But then so many dreams never come true
I promised forever and I never stopped believing
We could have had it all
But the tide won't turn
And the world moved on

From around the universe

Supernatural love
It never stops,it never stops
Do you feel it comin'
Supernatural love
It goes beyond the physical

Call me, all I'm asking is to hold me, just one more time

Sleepless nights, with sweating agony
Thinking how it all went wrong for me,
Baby please, my life depends on you,
There's one else, I'm still in love with you

Call me, I'm feeling so lonely, I'm lost without you
Call me, all I'm asking is to hold me, just one more time

Cause I know, I'm nothing without you
I know, you're all that matters
I know, you're the only one baby
I know, don't let me down

Playing our cds, going through our photographs,
Its breaking my heart, baby what's wrong with us,
Its half past three, and I can't sleep tonight,
I'm thinking of you, just like I did last night

I need to hear your voice, call me all I'm asking is to

Anna Wallgren,"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak with no restrains
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away, into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  

Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man
In some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way, into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  

Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me  

Let it be a joke, let it be a smile
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  

Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanation, no questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",I Let the Music Speak,2014

And I knew I'd never see you again
We were not friends
It was different than that
We had a love 'til the end 
That was beautiful and dying
Who could have told?
The fortunes of the misfortunes we would hold?
And I never thought that we would grow old together
You wanted to be beautiful
You thought you were a star
And now that everything has disappeared 
You are who you are

That this is the world

Use me once twice and don't do it again
This time's the last time

The way that you held my face
Until it was black and blue
When I gave it all to you
The way that you'd always pace
Whenever you felt my grace
It's all coming back to me
It's all coming back to me
With all the powers that be
I'd be dead to you right now
I'm glad I never held my breath too long
And I'm glad I knew we'd part before death 
Or death that you'd give me

When you asked me to accompany you
I'm glad I learned to trust my intuition 
And not trust your selfish attitude
You can be so rude

Anna West,"Strawberries, cherries and an angel kissing spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sing to just a few

My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me craving for...more summer wine

Anna Wilson,"I took a hit off the joint of the myth 
They call love
Said there was nothing in it to claim
But a long ride of pain that would wash me away 
Down an alley of tears

But still I remain with a flame on high
No matter how I try to tame
This fever inside
Can't be satisfied (cause I)

[Chorus]
Crave, the madness of your touch
And I crave, the passion in ya's just what I
Crave, the toxins in your kiss, that involuntary fix
Makes me rage

It's the rush of a crush and there's never enough
Takes me down and up doesn't let me escape
From the love and the hate and the joy and the pain
It's the drug with a drain
And protection's the name of the game, and I'll play in spite
Of the warning signs
For a time I can feel sublime
And when I start to unwind I just

[Chorus]

Higher than cocaine
All the way to Paris and the seine
In a daze, caught up in a fling, this extraordinary thing

To know this need 
Just makes me, makes me,

Anna Wilson,"Frankie is gone
Daddy's figured it out by now
She's long gone
To a town she'd heard in a song
On the radio years ago

On a bus
Frankie offers her last cigarette
To someone named angel
On the ride she tells a tale
Of dreams undone and those to come

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Maybe we're not alone
Oh, oh, oh
Maybe we're not alone

On the aisle
A man turns to say
I've got nothin' to hold me since she went away
Angel says hey man, Frankie and me
You know we're startin' new just like you

So they ride
Side by side by side
Into the darkness
Every mile that they're passin' through
Just makes them think it could be true

But surrounded by
Silent points of light that fight to be seen
In a world that's quick to cast it's shadow
And douse the beams

It's the end of the line, time to go
So Frankie wakes angel

I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red-bottom and gold they say queen
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love french tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics? turn stale
Where they mow that's green
I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with Plan B
Cause Plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks you, you still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women
You love keepin' control
Of everything you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love runnin', duckin' police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say
When I feel, and I
Look in the mirror and know I'm there
With my hands in the air
I'm proud to say yea
I'm real, I'm real, I'm really really real

The reason why I know you very well
Cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don't come for free
And plan C just an excuse like because
Or the word ""but"", but what if I got love
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse cause your the homie they packed
Burning like a stove top, they love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much
I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love
Should I hate living my life inside the club
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm season
Should I hate them for telling me ball out
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
I'm hatin' the fact that none of that shit make me real

I do what I wanna do
I say what I wanna say

When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it

Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream's only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry

Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was 5 foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said

Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The convicts talk 'bout matchin', money and foreign whips
The private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, sniffin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suck a dick, fuck is this?
One more suck away from wavin' flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well that's me at these awards
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy

Anna Wise,"I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same

If these walls could talk

Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway
If you, if you, if you exercise your right to forget it
Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey
Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play
And shes plays only when you tell her no

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call all you put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush

If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it

If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted the same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

“Do I hate me? or do I hate them?”

Mi espera tuvo un final
Hablabas cuando yo te amaba y te burlabas
O creías que te hacia tanta falta

Tus frases no se me olvidaron
Me hiciste ver que había algo más
Las alas me has arrebatado
No puedo volar, me has herido en vano

Un huracán que mata despacio y me desangra
Tan fuerte que hoy acaba mi paciencia ante ti
Mis ganas de vivir, y me rindo este es el fin

Te detesto y sólo encuentro que yo de ti fui
Fui sólo una confusión

Y que soy yo tu gran error
El olvido de un viejo amor
Una confusión, que actuaste sin pensar
Que yo de ti me enamoraría y tal vez
Tu podrías arruinar mi vida, tú.

No quiero que me digas nada
No quiero que me vuelvas a hablar

Ansiosa di vederti e di scrutare ogni tua movenza.
E parlarti senza sosta dei miei ottimi propositi

Per non dimenticare che
Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare mai

Noi giocavamo sul balcone di una casa di ringhiera
Non smettevamo finché il sole non scendeva
Bastava poco, realmente poco
I pensieri di un bambino sanno colorare il vuoto

Non esisteva il verbo instagrammare,
Facevamo foto, io se chiudo gli occhi forte ancora lo ricordo
Mamma in casa col vestito nuovo
Papà in garage con le mani sporche d'olio, aggiusta la moto

Noi guardavamo rocky e ci picchiavamo
Per chi doveva esser rocky, prima di mettere i guantoni
Pranzo a casa dei nonni la domenica
Quando l'hai scoperto l'amore non si dimentica!
Le ferie giù in Sicilia, d'estate, al paese dove zia fa ancora il pane
Sorridevamo quando ancora sapevamo perdonare
Pensavamo che nulla potesse mai cambiare

Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare che comunque vada ovunque andrai
Sarai parte di me ed ogni volta che,
Impossibile, io penso a noi per non dimenticare mai

Ricordo mamma, le mani sulla pancia bella che dire bella,
Non e mai abbastanza
E sapevamo che ne sarebbe arrivato un altro
Stravolgiamo la casa per farti spazio
Ma tu di spazio, ne prendi poco,
Così poco, giusto il letto e qualche gioco
Poi casa si fa grande e papà c'è sempre meno
Un lavoro importante
C'è sempre qualche aereo

I soldi non c'hanno dato la felicità
Il contrario
Quasi quasi l'odiamo
Diventiamo grandi per necessità
Ma non siamo
All'altezza di quello che viviamo
Io ti tenevo in braccio
Come oggi tu fai con tuo figlio perchè hai avuto coraggio
Adesso insegnagli a sorridere, a perdonare
e a pregare perchè nulla possa mai cambiare

Per non dimenticare mai
Per non dimenticare che comunque vada ovunque andrai
Sarai parte di me ed ogni volta che, impossibile,
Io penso a noi per non dimenticare mai

Sarai parte di me ed ogni volta che, impossibile,

Annalisa,"Se ci perdiamo in questo mondo strano, cosa ci succede?
Se ci accorgiamo che il destino a noi non ci ha voluto bene
In questo eterno movimento che fa scorrere i pianeti
C'è chi danza con le sue paure, chi non ha segreti
Perché è facile poter pensare di tornare indietro
E riparare agli errori, non restare nell'ombra per un po' d'amore
Ovunque si nasconda

Pensa a quante volte ce ne stiamo fermi in strada ad aspettare
Che arrivi qualcosa che ci salvi mentre noi sogniamo il mare
Perché in questa vita noi cerchiamo un senso
Che non si può trovare
È per questo che riusciamo ogni volta a superare
Tutto, riusciamo a superare

Se ci incontriamo in questi tempi strani, cosa ci succede?
Se ci accorgiamo che il destino a noi non ci ha voluto bene

A superare gli ostacoli che la notte ci fanno sentire soli
E tutte quelle incertezze che nascondiamo
Per provare a sentirci migliori
Superare l'inverno, superare lo spazio ed il tempo
Abbracciarsi e restare in eterno

E pensa a quante volte ce ne stiamo fermi in strada ad aspettare

Safe home at last
No cannon fire dockside

Have you ever felt the sun shine so brilliantly, raining down over you and me?
Have you ever wanted more? (wanted more)

Think of all the time ahead; don't hesitate; contemplate; no, it's not too late
Have you ever wanted more?
Don't you know there's so much more?

Better not pout, I'm telling you why

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day

And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

yes, I've been there before
Where the trees are slowly whithering
Where their roots cry out for more
where the desert floor is dry and cracked 
No clouds hang in the sky
No winter rain or spring it seems
No change in sight

But seasons change and then they pass
no way to know how long they'll last
I'd love to know the reasons why

Where life seems to stay the same for a while
You want to change but don't know how to
It's the place where you feel empty inside
Can't put your finger on the need
I look at God and see what I want to be 
I look at me and see what I am

Are you going through a dry spell?
I was there a while ago
Now I've come to a place where the rain falls
where the trees bear fruit and grow
where I find a refuge in my God
It's a place of surrender I know
I look at God and see what I want to be
He looks at me and sees His own

Anne Briggs,"Oh Sullivan John, to the road you've gone, far away from your native home. 
You've gone with the tinker's daughter, for along the road to roam. 
Ah Sullivan's John you won't stick it long, till your belly will soon get slack, 
As you roam the road with a mighty load, and a tooten box on your back. 

I met Katy Caffey and a neat baby all behind on her back strapped on, 
She had an old ash plant all in her hands, for to drive her donkey on
Enquiring every farmer`s house, as along the road she passed, 
Oh where would she get an old pot to mend, and where would she get an ass. 

  There's a hairy ass fair in the County Clare. in a place they call Spancel Hill, 
Where my brother James got a rap of a hames, and poor Paddy they tried to kill. 
They loaded him up in an ass and cart, for along the road to go, 
Oh bad luck to the day that I went away, to join with the tinker`s band.

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006

Ages ago last night?

On merely this: a look, a kiss

Could slip away in one little daybreak

This jealousy is slowly chocking us both to death
You can give all your love in matter of moments
But jealousy will bind all our expectations
Into a web of fear
It runs through my veins
A thunderous stream of murderous thoughts
Burning fire through the blood
Words leave an after taste
And after words so will you .",The Last Emotion,1994
Anne Clark,"All this tenderness has come to nothing
All that we require is being rearranged
I've no wish to look to the future
For my expectations will no doubt be changed
Just rolling along on the rest of the waves
My statements and strategies are quickly dismissed
Poisoned pens in invisible paper
Steel knuckles concealed by velvet fists
What is the chance of us living
Some of our simplest dreams
Are all the structures we build here
Really as frail as they seem
The dying are the lovers of this modern world
The power and the glory survives
With radio active bargaining
And the valueless of our lives
My turn to crumble
My turn to fall
From so very humble
To nothing at all

This is where silence runs its course
And sadness wipes its eyes upon us
We fall from a structure build on troubled minds
My world becomes iron and grows an cold as Winter
Soldiers in uniforms of nudity march over open hearts
Sweetly and sickly scented by roses
And your world id crushing you like those flowers
By scripts written into your skin with the in of thorns
Ashen faces sink into silence
All lonesome trends brush shoulders
All of last nights degradation
Builds foundations on us both",Nothing at All,1994
Anne Clark,"The madman looked inside the eyes of the face upon the mirror
""It seems I'm losing my way again"" he sighed.
And once again the tell-tale tears begin their journey down
An ever deepening track.

His wife place a hand upon his shoulder.
How over these past few months, he's aged so many years.
He'd give this life to live again.
He'd be so more daring. Be so much bolder
But a little less aware.
It's something of which he can't
Be certain and so he stays restrained and hurting.

At breakfast he places a kiss upon his only daughter.
How he longs for her to run to them as she did when
She was young, but her secrets have become her fears too.
Yet still she remains his child.
His still-pretty wife manages so well. Makes excuses for his absence.
Tries so hard to find the road he's on.

The madman combs his hair, his expression has returned
Almost to normal and he blends almost perfectly with the crowd. 
Back into an ordinary life.
An ordinary life.",An Ordinary Life,1994
Anne Clark,"Through these city nightmares you'd walk with me
And we'd talk of it with idealistic assurance
That it wouldn't tear us apart

And you're gone now

Through a grimy window that I can't keep clean
Through billowing smoke that's swallowed the sun
You're nowhere to be seen

Do you think our desires still burn
I guess it was desires that tore us apart
There has to be passion
A passion for living, surviving
And that means detachment

To beat you with when you are down

Fearing all the time

Anne Clark,"What will it matter then
When the sky's not blue but blazing red
The fact that I simply love you

When all our dreams lay deformed and dead
We'll be two radioactive dancers
Spinning in different directions
And my love for you will be reduced to powder

The screams will perform louder and louder
Your marble flesh will soon be raw and burning
And kissing will reduce my lips to a pult

Hideous creatures will return from the underground
And the fact the I love you
Will die

You don't have to sleep to see nightmares
Just hold me close
Then closer still
And you'll feel the probabilities pulling us apart.",Poem for a Nuclear Romance,1994
Anne Clark,"I've been sitting here all day
Trying to understand
Why people want to rule each other
When the problem's close at hand

A little less of what you want
And more of what you've got
Is enough to keep you struggling
Without hatching other plots

But justify yourself!
Don't satisfy yourself!
You should be out there voting
Say the power mongers gloating

The left-wing rich
Trying to shed their guilt
Go knocking down dreams
Before they're even built
Don't tell me how to live my life
Don't tell me what to do

By people with politics and attitudes like you",The Power Game,1994
Anne Clark,"Suicide is an urban disease
Spread by people and places like these
A quick self destruct from the 21st floor
A smell of gas through the kitchen door
A stab in the back from the workers and bosses
They're counting their gains as you count your losses
As you count your losses
Blow the world apart with the press of a button
We all say it shouldn't but we know it will happen
Again and again like the rain and the ark
Onwards forever eternally dark
Eternally dark
The grit in your eye soon enters your heart
And all that was strength is just falling apart
We're jumping from one bed and into another
Searching for something that we'll never discover
Never discover
So we go on breeding - breeding contempt
From all of the repression that this has meant
If the bombs and the fire don't instantly kill
Then the greed from the ashes certainly will
Certainly will
This place is not my place
This place is not yours

Anne Clark,"There is a little place in a little room
Where a little chap hides away amidst the gloom.
Tucks his little legs undermeath a well-worn chair
Plucks a piece of paper and attacks at his despair.
A stubby lead pencil scratches through the fears
Of every little cruelness that reduces us to tears.
Sharp is the lead but well is penetrate

All the nooks and crannies that this world creates.
There is so little time for us to stop and look
As he places the cover upon his little book.
There will come a day when this little man will die
And they'll put him in a tiny hole undermeath the sky
His little lead pencel book and chair
Will be placed inside a plastic bag and taken who knows where",Short Story Party Mix,1994

As you hold me in the confidence of your bed
Tomorrow's turned into today instead!
And I wake each morningfeeling so ashamed

Having fallen to emotions that we both named
How shallow now all that rubbish seems
Hearts once full are bleeding dreams
Dreams that were reality

Have now brought out the worst in me
I don't want a part in this
The stinging touch, the poisoned kiss
The alibis to keep us close

The lies you spit when I need you most
Love is just a paradox
He loves me, he loves me not
A basic human nedd is such

To be able to destry with just one touch
A stinking filthy trick I'd say
One day the prey
Love is just a heart disease

And no cure can make this aching ease
But I'll tranquilise myself from that
Let fit emotions turn to fat
Let care and concern not breed here

I've had and seen them disappear
Tear stained eyeswillnot be seen
When to touch is nothing more then obscene
To fuck it seems is the only word

The ability to love seems so absurd
Absurd because we know we lie
Laughing at it all as someone cries
One day I may find it quite amusing

Anne Clark,"So this is where the future lies
In a beer-gut belly
In a open fly
Brilcremed, acrylic, mindless boys
Punching, kicking, making noise
From the cradle to the city streets
They spill out their aggression
By punching what they don't understand
And stopping all forms of expression
Teaching each other to be men
By spewing in the street
Well, now I know just what to do
To make my man complete
Against the power of their misguidance
We must learn to fight
To be just what we want to be

Like a carousel that's turning running rings around the moon
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Like a tunnel that you follow to a tunnel of its own
Down a hollow to a cavern where the sun has never shone
Like a door that keeps revolving in a half forgotten dream
Or the ripples from a pebble someone tosses in a stream
Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of its face
And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space
Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind!
 
Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head
Why did summer go so quickly, was it something that you said?
Lovers walking along a shore and leave their footprints in the sand
Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand?
Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song
Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong?
When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware
That the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair!

Those who never leave me in any doubt
That their selfish narrow lives are all they care about

I enjoy the silence in my life
I don't thrive on the chaos that those contact can bring
So many empty gestures
That don't mean anything

That nothing in this place is soft enough to hold
And nothing like tenderness can ever be unfurled

That the rushing roaring daylight
Has lost itself - its hysteria

Where a journey unfolds
Into the city of rain
Music's never made such living sounds
Absorbing the night's rhythm
The walls resonate with a thousand tiny drums
Soft shards of liquid glass dance on metal pipes
Mixing dust and dirt and grime
Into a shining lubricating all-consuming oil
Some drop away barely making contact
Each bursting on impact
Into a fountain in the air
Dribbling off the lips of window ledges
Splashing silver splinters in the blackness
Scales of lifted paint turn to almost living flesh
Smearing - it slides and streams into a opening
In the underworld below
Revealing secret routes
Where the trapped earth breathes
Yellow streetlight breaks its beam across the water
Electric currents hum, steaming in the dampness
Cascades carry me away
Wash away the tiredness
Cool the fetid air
I turn to where you're sleeping
Gently swimming through these hours
On to morning - unaware

Par nos gorges étranglées, tout nous porte à chanter,
Tout nous porte à frémir au désir au plaisir,

A pousser le verrou
qui nous sépare, qui nous sépare.",Le Verrou (Reprise),2004
Anne Clark,"This house is full of loneliness
Of sad weary silence
I switch on the television
For some company
Two actors
A man and a Woman
Give exaggerated little moans
As they simulate
A so called stimulating fuck
For my entertainment
Beneath the endless groans
It's not real
It's pretend
Just like we pretended that last time
To make you
Night is the most difficult part off all
I don't need this
This vile, crude reminder
Of how we play out our roles
Without any script at all",Armchair Theatre,2004
Anne Clark,"So these are circumstances
Leading to my sorry tale
I was in a town I didn't know
I'd arrived there by rail
It all began a week before -
The joys of Saturday Night -
An invite to a party
Or watching The Price Is Right
Opting for a soirée
For the first time in a year
Mixed badly with the revelers
Mixed Bacardi, wine and beer
The room moved back and forwards
The dancers did the same
Found refuge in a corner
That's when he asked my name
Well this is very nice, I thought
Smiling through the haze
As we talked of Auguste Rodin
Through to Harold Pinter's plays
Said he played piano
Said his name was Steve
Why shouldn't I believe
That he really lived so far away
Had to make a move for home
Scribbled down his address
Said he didn't have a phone
Would I like to come to dinner
On Friday of next week
To this i said I'd love to
As he kissed me on the cheek
That night I felt so happy
Excited through and through
See ! The company of strangers
Doesn't always leave you blue
Stumbled home contented
Like a cat that got the cream
Wake up a little weary
But I knew it was no dream
The next few days were auyiouns
What could I find to wear ?
What happens if i arrive
And there is no Hope Road there ?
My friend said don't be silly
No one does things like that
Now will you get a move on
And take off that stupid hat !
Made sure I set out early
Made sure I caught the train
Got out at the right station
Then of course came down the rain
Followed the directions
Exactly as he said
Asked people if they new Hope Road
But they just walked on ahead
I turned left at the junction
Took the fork off to the right
Straight over at the crossroads
Then down to the traffic lights
must have walked those streets for hours
in the dark and in the cold
Before I really could accept
There was no place called Hope Road
So here I am alone again
Indoors by myself
The TV, plants, books and I
All nearly on the shelf
Next time I'll be more cautions
Next time I Won't be fooled
It's another of those basic things
You're never taught at school
Let this be a warning
As you wander through the world
It makes no difference who you are
Be you boy or be you girl
Be very , very careful
When people seems so nice
It's not how that it's expensive
Later on you pay the price
There's no Hope Road",Hope Road,2004
Anne Clark,"The wood burns warm, the house is still.
The music soothes and soon I will
Look for in another, what I found in you
What we had in each other, but you couldn't live through
Old love burns, my body aches
And I'm taking time, for as long as it takes
As the sunset fades and the moonlight breaks
I'll try and put right all my mistakes

A throwaway world, a throwaway life.
I'm glad I'm by myself tonight 
When all passion's spent in the one you love
When there's no guiding hands from a god above
When all that's left is never enough.

But there was a time that I can't find
Filled with light from a love inside
Filled with love, it was a world so white
And we'd run from one to the other side
Filled with laughter and a love so bright
Now I wait for something by hushed firelight
Something that will tell me, everything's alright.

A throwaway world, a throwaway life.
I'm glad I'm here by myself tonight 
Where the wood's all warm and the fire burns bright
And I tell myself everything will be alright
As the sunset fades and the moonlight breaks
The world is a small warm room tonight.",Waiting,2008

Anne Cochran,"There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all 

But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them

Of Peace on earth, good will to men

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along the unbroken song
Of Peace on earth, good will to men
And in despair, I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth, I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song

What I'd give if I could keep

If only time stood still

And the years will make us gray

Jingle bells a-ringing
In keys of liberty
Children celebrating
Santa and his sleigh
Of reindeer who found their way again
Across the home, home of the brave
Tis the 25th day of December
In a season best to remember
That blessings and bows and mistletoes
Are not without tolls, guardian souls
A soldier has a soldier's duty
That takes no holiday
So because you're far from home this winter
There's one thing I'd like to say

Thank you for the gift of freedom
That lights these holy stars
Thank you for each and every Christmas tree

May angels fly beside you
May Heaven steel your hearts
May God remind you in his grace
Though tonight I cannot touch your face

It's Christmas where you are

Your chair is empty at the table
Still I take your hand
As we pray for peace in this small world
On our knees we stand
Of this body of this nation
You are the heart and spine

The freedom that you provide
For if we stand together
We will never fall

Merry Christmas to one and all

That lights these holy stars
Thank you for each and every Christmas tree

It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
I understand the reason why 
You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely. 
You can tell at a glance 
What a swell night this is for romance, 
You can hear dear Mother Nature 
Murmuring low, 
""Let yourself go!"" 

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's, it's de-lovely"".",It's De-Lovely,1988
Anne Geddes,"sun is creeping down 
behind the hill 
everything is calm 
everything is still 
so baby close your eyes 
and rest your weary mind 
let me hold you close 
I'll sing you this lullaby 
let your worries go 
you fall asleep 
think of nothing more 
memories will keep 
your dreams will turn to gold 
and you will wake and find 
that you hold a smile all day 
from this lullaby 
maybe somewhere in the silence 
you may wake and you're all alone 
just call and I'll be there 
even when I'm gone 
each day will end 
so I'll say good night 
till we meet again 
now baby close your eyes 
and rest your weary mind 
II'll let you know the joy you bring 
every time you hear me sing 
you this lullaby",Baby Close Your Eyes,2004
Anne Geddes,"You're a beautiful boy
With all your little toys
Your eyes have seen the world
Though you're only four years old
And your tears are streaming
Even when you're smiling
Please never be afraid to cry 

You're a beautiful boy
With all your little ploys
Your mind has changed the world
And you're now forty years old
You got all you can carry
And still feel somehow empty
Don't ever be afraid to fly 

All you beautiful boys
Creating multiple plays
You like to fence in your world
And settle down when you're old
You can run from pole to pole
And never scratch your soul
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back
Don't be afraid to be afraid

Anne Geddes,"I will always love you 
No matter what 
No matter where you go 
Or what you do 
Knowing you 
You gonna have to do things your own way 
And that's okay 
So be free 
Spread your wings 
And promise me 
Just one thing 
(Chorus) 
If you ever need a place to cry 
Baby come to me 
Come to me 
I've always known that you were born to fly 
But you can come to me 
If the world breaks your heart 
No matter where on earth you are 
You can come to me 
Don't walk around 
With the world on your shoulders 
And your highest hopes 
Laying on the ground 
I know you think 
You've gotta try to be my hero 
But don't you know 
The stars you wish upon 
They fall that's true 
But I still believe in you

And those seven seas you sail 
Or the winding road you roam 
Leave you lost and feeling all alone 
Let my heart be your beacon home 
(Chorus)",Come to Me,2004
Anne Geddes,"There's a tree 
Standing there 
In such an ordinary way 
But as I look around 
Everything keeps changing 
There's a leaf 
On that tree 
And it floats into a stream 
And like everything 
It gets carried away 
To the sea. .. 
(Chorus) 
But if we give a little of our love away 
Maybe meet in the middle 
Every night and day 
If we could hear just a whisper 
Of what the heart needs to say 
It could sure make a difference 
In some small. .. 
In some small way 
In your heart lies the key 
That unlocks your destiny 
Look within and we'll find 
Everything we're longing for 
(Chorus) 
Oh. .. 
May you cherish each moment you live 
And know all the love that you give 
Will go on and on and on. .. 
There's a sky vast and blue 
And it lies deep inside of you 
Breathe it in 
Let it out 
Breathe it in again. ..

Où son grand-père était bûcheron
Que dans son sang l'Orient coule aussi

Que nous l'attendions passionnément
Que chaque nuit s'efface au nouveau jour
Qu'il sera grand mais qu'il a bien le temps
Oh Dieu, qu'il a bien le temps

Devant trop de malheurs et de laideur
Qu'il regarde avec son cœur

Je lui dirai d'être sage et prudent
D'aller frôler les glaces et les feux
Qu'il goûte à tout mais sans jamais dépendre
Que trop peut être pire que trop peu
Oh, bien pire que trop peu

Qu'il est beau, que je l'aime, qu'il est ma vie, ma joie
Qu'il est un parmi des millions d'humains

Je lui dirai les chansons, les poèmes
Qu'il n'y a pas d'amour sans histoire
Que le bonheur est un grain que l'on sème
Qu'amour et santé ne s'achètent pas
Et qu'on n'est riche que de ça

Je lui dirai qu'un jour une autre femme
Viendra l'aimer et qu'il l'aimera
Que j'en mourrai de bonheur et de larmes

Anne Haigis,"He was my brother born the day I left
He took the mother lode and I took the rest
He was a fighter, he was always in control
He kept a candle burning way down in his soul

shots fired in anger and a widow cries alone
Just one more mother's son who won't be coming home
They speak in whispers there are riders to the east
The blind man says mister bring a bottle and a priest

that's the way it always goes
That's the way it's always been
Who you are or what you know
You're like a feather in the wind
Let the river wash you away
Reach the river if you can
Past the blue and past the grey
All the way, all the way
All the way to no man's land

there was no shelter there was nowhere left to run
They came like eagles screaming down out of the sun
I heard the whistle sound the engine pulled away
I saw my brother down and I left him where he lay

some fight for honor there are those that fight for gold
Some die believing all the fairy tales they're told
There are no heroes and there is no marching bang
There are no miracles down here in no man's land

that's the way it always goes
That's the way it's always been
Who you are or what you know
You're like a feather in the wind
Let the river wash you away
Reach the river if you can
Past the blue and past the grey

Anne Haigis,"I think my heart was designed to fade and lose color
To turn inside out and wash in the rain
It loses all perfection in cold water
So the desired look is obtained

And it rises higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove there are mountains I could move

So love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Is ashes from dancing in the fire

I think my eyes were made for deception
Interpreting lovers will call what we want the truth
With all I have seen burning behind these mirrors
The reflection they see is all that I pursue

And it rises higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove there are mountains I could move

So love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Ashes from dancing in the fire

And voices get louder
And the air's too thick to breathe
Still I lie awake and I wait for the unknown power
Dying for want of sleep

I think my life line was stolen from a movie
The one where they are trying to solve the crime
But this prisoner is always one step before them
And everyone's running trying to stop me in time

And it keeps rising higher and higher
Like this filthy heat above the city sky
And I feel like I'm going mad dancing in the fire
As if I'm only here to prove
There are lovers I could move

Oh love is spent dancing in the fire
Too high the cost and too quick the pain
And all that's left for the outsider
Ashes from dancing in the fire

You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care
You stood in my doorway, with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees, and

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art, Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must have gone off track with you

Excuse me, guess I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

You're tearing me, you're tearing me apart

Anne Haigis,"I was a sailor, I was lost at sea
I was under the waves
Before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said

Love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town

I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when they pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide

When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town",When Love Comes to Town,2007
Anne Hathaway,"Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can't barely stand on my feet. 
Take a look in the mirror
And cry, lord what you're doing to me. 
I've spent all my years believing in you, but I just can't get no relief. 
Won't somebody, somebody, can anybody find me, somebody to love.

Anne Hathaway,"At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day standing about, what is it for?
One day less to be living

At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the plague is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying

At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and
There's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day

At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your bum doesn't buy any bread

There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job
And in a bed
And we're counting our blessings

Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands
And the boss, he never knows
That the foreman is always on heat
If Fantine doesn't look out
Watch how she goes
She'll be out on the street

At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
Keep on grafting till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs off the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day

And what have we here, little innocent sister?
Oh, come on Fantine, let's have all the news
Dear Fantine you must send us more money
Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose

Give that letter to me
It is none of your business
With a husband at home
And a bit on the side
Is there anyone here
Who can swear before God
She has nothing to fear?
She has nothing to hide?

What is this fighting all about?
Will someone tear these two apart
This is a factory, not a circus
Now, come on ladies, settle down
I am the mayor of this town
I run a business of repute

Deal with this foreman
be as patient as you can

Yes Monsieur Madeline

I might have known the bitch could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret
Ah yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean
You'd be the cause I had no doubt
Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night

She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again
You must sack her today
Sack the girl today

We see each other plain
'm'sieur le mayor,'
You'll wear a different chain

Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me! there is something I must do
This woman leaves behind a suffering child
There is none, but me who can intercede
In mercy's name, three days are all I need
Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll return

You must think me mad
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man such as you.

Believe of me what you will (men like you can never change)
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do (men like me can never change)
You know nothing of my life (no, 24601)
All I did was steal some bread (my duty's to the law)
You know nothing of the world (you have no rights)
You would sooner see me dead (come with me 24601)
But not before I see this justice done (now the wheel has turned around Jean Valjean is nothing now)
I am warning you Javert (dare you talk to me of crime)
I'm a stronger man by far (I'm the price you had to pay)
There is power in me yet (every man is born in sin)
My race is not yet run (every man must choose his way)

You know nothing of Javert
I was born inside a jail
I was born with scum like you
I am from the gutter too!",The Confrontation,2012
Anne Hathaway,"Monsieur, I bless your name
I am ready Fantine!
Monsieur, lay down your burden
At the end of my days
You’ve raised my child with love
She’s the best of my life
And you will be with God

Papa, papa, I do not understand
Are you all right?
Why did you go away

Cosette, my child
Am I forgiven now?
Thank god, thank god
I’ve lived to see this day

It’s you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It’s you who must forgive a thankless man
It’s thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home
To you

Now you are here
Again beside me
Now I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live, Papa, you're going to live
It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die
I'll obey
I will try.

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well when I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of one who turned from hating
The man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy.

Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to your glory.

Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken
To love another person
Is to see the face of God.

Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of the people
Who are climbing to the light.

For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies.
Even the darkest night will end
and the sun will rise.

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord.
We will walk behind the plowshare
We will put away the sword.
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward.

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Anne Hathaway,"There was a time when men were kind
When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time

Then it all went wrong

I dreamed a dream in times gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed, that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream
I dreamed",I Dreamed a Dream,2012

Anne Hills,"As my aching head is begging for a sleep that will not come
I rise and walk the morning street again
I keep wondering how you're doing and I wonder where you are
And I know I'll be all right, but I don't know when
Hold onto me, babe, wherever you may be
Hold onto me, babe, I'm with you always
There was something locked in side you like a secret burning pain
In a prison where you would not let me go
I was sure we'd find an answer, til I woke and found you gone
Now just what it was, I guess I'll never know
I keep hanging onto something, but I don't know what it is
But at least I know the sound of my own name
And I work as hard as ever and I see the same old friends
But there's something deep inside that ain't the same

Anne Hills,"When princes meet
The poor little men must tremble
In judgment seat

They speak of their wars
While great armies assemble
Their armor shines
To shame the sun

They move like gods
They do resemble
All bow their necks
To iron feet when princes meet

When castles rise
The poor little men must build them
To charm the skies

They throw up the turrets
Where the great lords will them
They dig the dungeons
From the earth

And their brothers
Wives and children fill them
All those below cast down
Their eyes when castles rise

God save the king
For he grants us leave to serve him
His praises sing
And grant that we may deserve him

Who counts the cost?
The cattle and men to be lost?
'Tis no small thing to serve a king

When kings make war
The poor little men must fight them
They must do more

They hold out their necks
For great lord's swords to bite them
The sons of the lords cleave
Through their ranks

In the hopes some warrior king
Might knight them
It's what the poor little men are for
When kings make war

Hide your cattle in the woods, Francois
The lord is looking your way
Hide your women and your goods, Francois
They're coming around to make you pay

Hide if you can, poor little man
Think of a prayer to say
Hide if you can, poor little man
Think of a prayer to say

God save the king
For he grants us leave to serve him
His praises sing
And grant that we may deserve him

Who counts the cost?
The cattle and men to be lost?
'Tis no small thing to serve a king

Everything has its time
Show me a reason
And I'll soon show you a rhyme

Cats sit on the window sill
Children sit in the show
Why do I feel I don't fit in
Anywhere I go

Rivers belong where they can ramble
Eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free
Gotta find my corner, of the sky

Every man his daydreams 
Every man has his goal
People like the way dreams have of 
Sticking to the soul

Rain comes after thunder
Winter comes after fall
Sometimes I think I'm not after
Anything at all

So many men seem destined
To settle for something small
But I, I won't rest
'Til I know I have it all
So don't ask where I'm going
Just listen when I'm gone
Far away you'll hear me singing
Softly to the dawn

Oh, rivers belong where they can ramble, 
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly
I've got to be where my spirit can run free, yeah
Gotta find my corner, ooh of the sky, yeah (of the sky, yeah)
Rivers belong where they can ramble
Oh, eagles belong where they can fly (high)

Anne Marie Moss,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break!

I know you've been livin' in a downhill raid
You're seein' your death on a military plane
You better hold now, you can't take no more now
No doubt about it when you find out about it
You're gonna want to run and tell all your friends about it
Easy, It's so easy

When this whole world's turned upside down

Anne Murray,"I like your brother, and I like your mother
I like you, and you like me too

We'll get a preacher, and we'll buy a ring
And we'll hire a band, with an accordion
A violin, and a tenor who can sing

[Chorus]
You and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, babe
You and me, you and me, you and me
You and me, you and me, babe

We'll have a so-on, we'll get him a sister
Can count all the times, her daddy's gonna kiss her
He'll drink his baby blue, from a big bra-ass cup
Someday he maybe president, if things loosen you-up

[Chorus]

You'll take the train into the city every mornin'
Now you maybe plain but I think you're pretty in the morning
Some nights we'll go out dancin' if I am not too tired
Some nights we'll sit romancin', watchin' the late show by the fire

When our kids are grown with kids of their own
They'll send us away, to a little home in Florida
And we'll play checkers a-all day
Until we pass away

Anne Murray,"There's no where in the world that I would rather be
Then with you my love
And there's nothing in the world that I would rather see
Than you smile my love
 
For united we stand.  Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, Together, you and I
 
For united we stand.  Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, Together, you and I
 
And if the world around you falls apart my love
Then I'll still be here
And if the going gets too hard along the way
Just you call I'll hear
 
For united we stand.  Divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, Together, you and I

And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, Together, you and I

Anne Murray,"Once I was alone
So lonely and then
You came, out of nowhere
Like the sun up from the hills

Cold, cold was the wind
Warm, warm were your lips
Out there, on that ski trail
Where your kiss filled me with thrills

A weekend in Canada, a change of scene
Was the most I bargained for
And then I discovered you and in your eyes
I found the love that I couldn't ignore

Down, down came the sun
Fast, fast, fast, beat my heart
I knew when the sun set
From that day, we'd never ever part

Anne Murray,"[Chorus]
We all pull the load
We all pull the load
We gotta get up early in the morning
'Cause we all pull the load

Well, you can find you a world full of bother
And talking to your good neighbor
'Cause he ain't interested in favors
No, in the road that he's gotta hold

Oh well, the world outside is vicious
'Cause life's been canning his hopes and wishes
But still he's got ambition, yeah
In the life that he wants to own

[Chorus]

Preacher shouts out the answer
The congregation looks for the problem
Every man born has got 'em
But he just wants to go home

Go ahead and walk on water
We'll do like we ought to Lord
And sit back in the row

There's plenty of him to go around
He's gotta have a place to sit down
So save a little room in your soul

And show the world all the love in your heart 
The people gonna treat you better 
You're gonna find, yes you will 
That you're beautiful as you feel 
Waiting at the station with a workday wind a-blowing 
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers-by 
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing 
And they don't see it showing, why do I? 
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face 
And show the world all the love in your heart 
The people gonna treat you better 
You're gonna find, yes you will 
That you're beautiful as you feel 
I have often asked myself for reason for sadness 
In a world where tears are just a lullaby 
If there's any answer, maybe love can end the madness 
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try 
You've got to get up every morning With a smile in your face 
And show the world all the love in your heart

'Cause I'm in love with the Irish accent to your story
And I need someone to help me.

Well, they say that now you don't talk straight
And that of late it's been my lot to be afraid
To remember you by anything
But memories I already keep.

So put on another pot o' tea

Over the pain that came so close to you
And it comes so close to me today.
