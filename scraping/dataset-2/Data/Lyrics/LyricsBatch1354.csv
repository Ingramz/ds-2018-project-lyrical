Bruce Dickinson,"I will not accept the truth
I will not accept the truth
I will not accept the truth
That I'll never get there no way

I must not push forward, no
I must not push forward, no
I must not push forward, no
because I'll never get there
Never get there, no way

I will not believe your lies
I will not believe your lies
I will not believe your lies
You say I'll never get there
Never get there, well hold on

I will not accept your truth
I will not believe your lies
I will not acknowledge pain
I will survive and live again
Coming back now, rising back now",I Will Not Accept the Truth,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"These are the pictures
These are the feelings from the front line
Living in silence
Feeling the deafness like heavy smoke
Smiling with strangers counting days
Like a spring coiled up inside
Welcome to your future
Welcome to your book of life
Fingers crawl through pages

Nothing changes living here
Inertia
No wish to move at all
Inertia
Everything's a stone wall
Inertia

History let's you die
A ragged pile of silent accusers
Smell the blood of strangers here
No eyes no ears no smell no taste
The mouth of the maggot is full of this place
Murdered conscience the pressure is crushing heads
Like paper lanterns now
Unbreakable grip a dead hand
Driving us forward to the end
Kicking through the traces
A thousand years from now",Inertia,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"I see the scars of action writhing round your face
Too much inactivity and home's a lonely place
Throw away your beauty 'cause you know that it won't last
Throw away your present
You've need living in the past
So stake a trip with me
Across the bridge of lunacy
Fire up some beast and ride the skywaves
Don't want to waste my time on you
If you can't travel this way too
Fire up this beast we'll ride the skywave
I've thrown away my images
They're all so distant now
Discovery was a stranger then
So welcome to my house
Whatever demons torture me
I love them like a friend
Nothing lasts forever but the certainty of change
I'd rather move around and be that figure out life
And what it means
Fire up some beast and ride the sky waves
And when the fireballs work is done and we are part of the nuclear one
The whole Damn Thing begins again
Our glory days have just begun
A fiery side slip then we're gone
I'll see ya Monday morning
Anyway I'm coming back",Innerspace,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"I've got myself a widget
A gizmo with wires
And martian intent yeah
Strange face of beauty
On my machine
It blinks and stares right at me
Sees nothing but in its wires
A strange thing of beauty
That's my machine
You won't believe what it can do
It tells me things I never
Wished I knew
Like the mirror when you ask
It tells you true
Inside the machine
The web has got you now
Inside the machine
I'm part of it somehow
I'd strap my DNA to it
A living device, the light of my life, yeah
Strange thing of beauty
That's my machine
I sit and we crackle with static
It makes no sense ot have experience
When a strange of beauty
That's my machine
Inside the machine, we're looking for control
Inside the machine, we're part of it somehow",Inside the Machine,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"Hey you wait... cringing in the dark
You create what you always fear
A puppet of hatred dishing out poison
You use me, for bait, your begging bowl of lies

Chain letters of sniveling compromise
I can smell the difference... your truth and your fiction
You and your twisted convictions

Were you my friend when I belonged?
Were you my friend when I was strong?
Were you my friend when I was weak?
Were you my friend when I was crawling calling... out of my head?

Cold, like your blood the snake is always cool (cool)
When things get tough
You slither on the ground
You cover up your tracks when I'm around

It's over now my friend
Your dog has got its day
It's payback time, or what you had to say
You're stuck with the life you made

Stuck with the plans you made
Stuck with everything you are",Meltdown,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"I'm vacuum breathing and open-mouthed
As the red shift fills my eyes
Oh minister my promises as her shadow cuts the day away
I remember you when you walked into that room

Now dislocated jagged pieces
Are sliding into this broken mind
I'm swimming back against the river
But I'm rising with the tide

Where we came from
We're all going back there soon

How many times have we met this way
How many lives have we lived before
How many faces and how many names

Shadows come but shadows are gone
Shadows come but shadows are gone",Octavia,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"Trapped inside a web of fiery gravity that fuels all our needs
Chaotic energy that sucks the life from H to He
All life withers in the sun
I deny what I have done
Spend my days and nights
In roaring halls of crimson life
Solar confinement
Solar confinement, solar confinement
Solar distress flares
I've slept with many strangers
So fission fusion fission makes good sense
Where I laid my head my troubles
I put down to experience
It's cold and lonely in the sun
Deny what I have done
Spend my days and nights
In roaring halls of crimson life
A lonely boy sits in his room
His curtains hide the sun
Confess to what you've done
And no one understands",Solar Confinement,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"Yes, yes I'd launch into the rising sun
My living breath is measured
Every step is done
Fare you well my friends

See you down the line
Yeah, yeah...
I don't belong to nation state or dying race
I leave my prejudice

With you my religion's in space
So have a little respect
Why are we running in this space race
Why are we acting like we own the place

Just want to feel the starlight on my face
Reach out my hand and touch beyound...
Yes, yes I'd float around till gravity's end
Unity is coming, singular again

See you then my friends at the end of the line, yeah, yeah
Secret knowledge science logic all are done
Nothing left but burning up into the sun
On a cosmic beach I'll see ya there",Space Race,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"Spiraling falling, a silver machine
From wings of freedom silent above
Eyelids were burning, summer sun roasting
Fumbling chrome in the clear blue sky
Brighter than sunshine for all of our life times
Thousand stars turned day into night at the end
Where were you when it fell from the sky?
I saw the movie, I read the reply
In the beginning there was only the word
People were kissing in front of their shadows
Children were playing out in the yard
I am not guilty made no difference
I wasn't born and I wasn't made on that day
Where were you when it fell from the sky?
I saw the movie, I read the reply
In the beginning there was only the word
Strange death in paradise",Strange Death in Paradise,1996
Bruce Dickinson,"You wanna talk? You wanna go?
From your armchair things you know
Secret plans, conspiracy
Little people all around

You curse love, you curse hate
You curse your life, you curse your fate
Whatever you can be
If only you could learn, if only you could learn

Narrow vision, that’s the way
It finally helps you through the day
Too many reasons to believe
No time to understand

The clock is ticking like a bomb
Subversive things ain't going on
You're only seventeen
If only you could learn, if only you could learn
If only, if only, if only, if only, if only you could learn

Victim gravel on your knees
Victim of your own disease
Make my day, why don’t ya?
From your armchair, you’re a hero

If only you could learn, if only you could learn
If only, if only, if only, if only, if only you could learn

Victim gravel on your knees
Victim of your own disease
Make my day, why don’t ya?
From your armchair, you’re a hero

Screaming beauty, suicide
So cynical, you never tried
To understand the reasons
From your armchair you’re a hero

If only you could learn, if only you could learn
If only you could learn
If only, if only, if only, if only, if only you could learn

",Armchair Hero [*],1996
Bruce Dickinson,"Yeah, standing by the three kings
And I thought I saw a star
I could smell the holy spirit
It was coming from the bar

It's magic they said
Back from the dead
It's not Christmas yet
God's not coming back

God's not coming back

You turn my water into wine
You fix my table, it's just fine
Two ton rocks he rolled away
Lepers cured every Sunday
(Okay, goodnight, thank you very much)
(Be back next Sunday, alright)

It's magic they said
Back from the dead
It's not Christmas yet
God's not coming back

Hanging with Magdalene
He never dug the little queen
(She's a little stunner, you know what I mean?)
You look like Ian Gillan
But I bet you couldn't scream, aah

It's magic they said
Back from the dead
It's not Christmas yet
God's not coming back

God's not coming back
God's not coming back
God's not coming back
Oh well

Bruce Dickinson,"You don’t know your jailer
Like you, he’s never been free
He looks just like you, doesn’t he?
He’s got no sense of his own reward

Who needs freedom anyway
When you’ve got your golden cage?
What I call isolation
You might call a passion play, yeah

How long have you been here?
You really can’t say
How long will you stay?
Who cares anyway?

It’s a rescue day
It’s a rescue day
It’s a rescue day
Hey, hey, hey, hey

What’s the use in fighting
Battles that you can’t lose?
You’re here by an invitation
Another’s mad refuse

Escape is a temptation
But it’s much too tough to choose
That’s why I’m standing out here
That’s why I’m waiting out here

How long have you been here?
You really can’t say
How long will you stay?
Who cares anyway?

It’s a rescue day

Hey, hey, hey, hey

It’s a rescue day
Another rescue day
It’s a rescue day
Hey, hey, hey, hey

You build walls to keep me out
Or maybe to keep you in
Which ever jail you choose right now
Your house is not your friend, yeah

How long have you been here?
You really can’t say
How long will you stay?
Who cares anyway?

It’s a rescue day

Bruce Dickinson,"Journey back to the dark side, back into the womb
Back to where the spirits move like vapor from the tomb
The center of the cyclone, blowing out the sun
Break the shackles of your union to the light

I might've had a brother
As I was born, they dragged him under
To the other side of twilight
He's waiting for me now

Nativity was lost on me
I didn't ask, I couldn't see
What created me
What and where and how

Welcome home - it's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home - we've opened up the gates
Welcome home - to your brothers and sisters
Welcome home - to an accident of birth

Feel our bodies breathing as you try to stop believing
There's nothing you can do about your shadows
You can fight us, you are like us
And your body will betray you
Lay down and die like all the others

Where are the angels and their wings of freedom?
Jesus had his day off when they pulled you through...

Welcome home - it's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home - we've opened up the gates
Welcome home - to your brothers and sisters
Welcome home - to an accident of birth
(to an accident of birth)

Vision's growing dim as the daylight fades away
I'm spinning, twisting, black
Well, it's your dying day

Welcome home - it's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home - we've opened up the gates
Welcome home - to your brothers and sisters

Bruce Dickinson,"There, on a lonely desert hilltop
The pilgrims huddle closer
Waiting for a sign, the coming silver shrine
The arc of space and time

Truth, oh, the truth is never clear
Perhaps again next year
The hope lives on beneath the blazing sun
One day you'll come

In my heart I reach you
In my heart I reach out to you
In my heart I touch the face of God
In my dreams somehow...

In my heart I reach you
In my heart I reach out to you
In my heart I touch the face of God
It's all a dream...

In my heart I reach you
In my heart I reach out to you

Bruce Dickinson,"The first hellrider came
On wings of plenty in the dark
Poured out his poison
And he blew away his mark
The fascist from the east is coming
Mothers, hide your sons

The second hellrider came
From the flaming seas and molten sands
Pipers playing Hell's commands
Poured out his poison
With his promises of promised lands
blackened tongues of lying leaders

Here come the riders
As the wheel of Dharma's running out of time
Here come the riders
As the wheel of Dharma's running out of time

The third hellrider came
Teaching brothers to kill brother man
And the fourth hellrider waits
On an acid trip for an acid world
Wars of old religious fools and superstitious men
Throws some scary Tarot cards and...

Here come the riders
As the wheel of Dharma's running out of time
Here come the riders
As the revolution's stepping into time
The Darkside of Aquarius
Has robbed us of our souls and minds
Here come the riders
As the wheel of Dharma's running out of time

From the starlit sky on a silver sea
A lonely silver surfer comes to push the wheel for me
A lonely silver surfer comes to push the wheel for me

Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move that wheel right 'round
Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move that wheel right 'round
Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move that wheel around

Gotta push the wheel of dharma around
Push the wheel of dharma around
Push the wheel of dharma around
Push the wheel right 'round, right now (yeah)

Bruce Dickinson,"He rides the wave, aspiring slave
The prince of darkness plays his games
You're hypnotized, under velvet skies
He breathes the red wind 'cross your eyes

Who leads you to the dark secret?
Who leads you to the dark secret?

Your life is lost, your soul is damned
But it feels too good to make a stand
Bad is bad, but this is worse
Let judgment come, you love this curse

When you look at man, you're like a God
Swimming in the tide of life
Somersault into the flood
Washes you away

Who leads you to the dark secret?
Who leads you to the dark secret?

Who is your mistress, that leads you to the dark secret?
Who is your mistress, who leads you to the dark secret?

Who is your mistress, that leads you to the dark secret?
Who is your mistress, who leads you to the dark secret?
Who is your mistress, that leads you to the dark secret?

Bruce Dickinson,"In your hour of darkness be not afraid
As the moonlight shivers on your grave
Come back to find you here

Conjuring the ghost of Cain
He won't let you fall again
Return your soul to sleep again
By conjuring the ghost of Cain

To take you across the river

Bruce Dickinson,"Here, in a church, a small boy is kneeling
He prays to a god he does not know, he cannot feel
All of his sins of childhood he will remember
He will not cry, tears he will not cry

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
His small boy wonders, what was it all about?
Is your journey over has it just begun?

Vision of a new world from the ashes of the old

A tortured seer, a prophet of our emptiness
Wondering why, wondering why

Trapped inside a body, made to feel only guilt and shame
His anger all his life ""I hate myself!"", he cried
""Do what thou wilt!""
""Do what thou wilt!"", he cried

Bruce Dickinson,"The ashes drift away, smoke of our confusion
We turn our frightened faces to each other, say goodbye
Waited for the sign, waited for the moment
Waited for the miracle to arrive

Look at your future
Take a look at your burning sky
Look at your future
Look at your burning sky

The others, they have gone
Who wants to live forever
With nothing left to hold onto the past that we once knew?
We believed in heaven, we believed in angels
With arms of purest white
To hold us, catch us when we fall

Look at your future
Take a look at your burning sky

Now look at your burning sky

Like a swirling vulture on your face

The road to hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again
The road to hell is full of good intentions
Get on the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets

Brave new world of secret fantasy
That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp
Close enough to thrill, the danger of the kill
Price for failure of your will

We are starchildren, coming out of nowhere and to nowherereturn
Starchildren, a hundred million souls sucked out in one breath

Bruce Dickinson,"Who stole your heartbeat in the night?
The acolytes fearful in the flickering light
They hold a mirror to catch the breath from your mouth
But your breath was stolen by the wind from the south

Another winter's tale is done
Your immortal lover is gone
The chalice stolen from her hand
Eternal life at her command
Now all that she rules must see...

The howling shriek of death in your eyes
The whole court and the beast enter your room
The gold will turn to rust
Your empire follows you into your tomb

The wraiths of night caress
And whisper softly now, ""We are the dead""
They bear your life away
They tear your heart in two
They've taken the queen

To some better place, so they think
As the flame burns low

Now the flame burns higher
And it purifies the love that died
And scared rats closed in alive
Back to the earth, sealing the tomb

Our skeletons rise through the veil of blood
Who summons us now from our graves?
""We are the dead""
The shriek of death in your eyes

Is your journey over, has it just begun?

Has it just begun?

Bruce Dickinson,"This is the maze of life
This is the maze of death
This is the matrix of eternity

The demon never sleeps
The demon never lies
He beats my heart and leaves no echo

What heavy burden holds me back
Every step along the track?
Fear that reaches deep inside of me

At the trumpets of Jericho

Still the walls remain

At the trumpets of Jericho

Avalon's in chains
This is the river of space
This is the river of time
Chase the dragons of infinity

Atlas stands and laughs
Throws his burden down
Rolls the earth in the inferno

Fingers holding onto cracks
The howling wind that blows us back
Sucked into the grinding wheels of hell

At the trumpets of Jericho

Still the walls remain

Blow the trumpets of Jericho

Still the walls remain

At the end of the rainbow

There the grail remains

Sound the trumpets of Jericho

Avalon's in chains
As they drag you down
In your clothes of lead
See the golden light
Flashing overhead
Mocking you

Do you know who you are
In your robes of skin?
How many creatures live inside you?

Man is born forever free
But is everywhere in chains
Trapped inside this earthly prison cell

At the trumpets of Jericho

Still the walls remain

At the trumpets of Jericho

Avalon's in chains

At the trumpets of Jericho

There the grail remains

At the trumpets of Jericho

Still the walls remain

A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

In the smoky haze, she was dancing free
Should've ordered one but I ordered three
Then I watched the room and it was dancing two
So, I ordered four and I hit the floor

At the stroke of seven, I fell out of heaven

Did I arrive too soon?
Well, better late than never
When I come again, you will know it's time

Things are getting tight
Maybe one more stroke

Isn't she lovely? And so deadly. 
Her kiss is fifteen times more poisonous than the rattlesnake. 
And you see her venom is highly neurotoxic 
Which is to say that it attacks the central nervous system 
Causing intense pain
Profuse sweating
Difficulty in breathing
Loss of consciousness
Violent convulsions 
And finally death. 
You know what I think I love the most about her 
Is her inborn need to dominate and possess. 
Such power and dignity, unhampered by sentiment. 
If I may put forward a slice of personal philosophy
I feel that man has ruled this world as a stumbling dimented child-king long enough!
And as his empire crumbles, my precious Black Widow shall rise as his most fitting successor!

But for a foreigner he's quite a nice chap

He just cooks pasta, always faster
He smokes with his father, makes good carbonara
His cock's too long to fit in this song
He shaves his legs and always thinks about sex
His hands have blisters, don't trust him with your sisters
He talks baloni and eats rigatoni
His name's on his sticks, he's got smelly armpits
And when he plays his drums it sounds like this

He never takes a rest from chasing breasts and legs
He hates Peter Criss but he still likes Kiss

Bruce Dickinson,"And did those feet in ancient times
Walk upon England's mountains green?
Was the holy lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?

And did the countenance divine
Shine forth on our clouded hill?
Was Jerusalem built here
In England's green and pleasant land?

Let it rain, let it rain
Wash the scales from my eyes
Let it rain, let it rain
Let me see again

Bring me my bow of burning gold
Bring me my arrows of desire
I shall not sleep till the clouds unfold
Bring me my chariot of fire

Let it rain, let it rain
Tears of blood fall out of the sky
Let it rain, let it rain
Wash me clean again

From the frozen waters
The King will rise again
With two suns in the sky

I shall not cease from mental flight
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land

Let it rain, let it rain
Tears of blood fall out of the sky
Let it rain, let it rain
Set me free again

See the gleaming spires of the citadel
The King and queen will dwell
In our hearts

Can Jerusalem be rebuilded here
In this trivial time, in this land of fear?
In Jerusalem, where the grail remains
Walk into the light and dissolve the chains

Ohh, ohh

On a sleigh ride to the moon
Blue and white in the distance
Not sorry I'm leaving you

Now and then the earthrise fills my eyes
Now and then the dark side fills the sky
Turn around the starlight warms my skin
Even in the blackness there's a tune

Now that I'm not with you, I close my eyes and dream
Remember all my days as a prisoner of gravity
I left a piece of history and the future has begun
Sat here with my feet hung up and nowhere is my home

Now and then the earthrise fills my dreams
Squeeze my fist in anger, remember what it means
Turn around the starlight warms my skin
Every day in the blackness we begin, again

Now and then the earthrise fills my eyes
Squeeze my fist in anger, remember what it means
Turn around the starlight warms my skin
Every day in the blackness we begin

I left this ball of sadness when the fighting had begun

She said ""Curse you all never learn when I leave, there's no return""
The people laughed 'till she said - ""Burn""
Warning came - no one cared
Earth was shakin' - we stood and stared
When it came, no one was spared
Still I hear - Burn
You know we had no time
We could not even try
You know we had no time
You know we had no time
We could not even try

As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
And cold spirits of ice
All my life I am the echo of your past (echo of your past)

I am returning the echo of a point in time
Distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your, all your life shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand we must remain
Perfect strangers

I know 
I know, I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

Touching more than you see

Oh oh precious life

You've got to understand we must remain

When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.

Had a friend once in a room,
had a good time but it ended much too soon.
In a cold month in that room
we found a reason for the things we had to do.

When nothing, when nothing
Goes quite right it seems
As I look there I know
Fortune smiles on me so
But who knows, no one knows
About tomorrow

There'll be blue skies falling
There'll be bad scenes and bad dreams
In a world so uncertain
Through the clouds it's hard to see
I will grab you and lift you
As you hold on tight and sway
We'll go walking
Across the fields of gray

When I was younger I saw things in black and white
Now all I see is a sad, hazy gray
Sometimes I see a narrow flash of light
Sometimes I look and you show me the way

No matter what else happens
What the future will be
In a world so uncertain
Through the clouds it's hard to see
I will grab you and lift you
Calm your fears if you're afraid
We'll go walking
Across the fields of gray",Fields of Gray,1993
Bruce Hornsby,"Close your eyes and slip away
To the dream of your fancy
Close your eyes and float downstream
To where the marsh grass dances

Make you see there will be no tricks
There will be no tricks tonight
There will be some tricks tonight

Lay out on the sand on the shore
Let me take you down to the docks at night

Let your mind flow freely
Take some time and forget about time
You may find a little feeling
I can see you shining with sweat

Bruce Hornsby,"Is he sane or insane
That's all they want to know
Is he crazy or strange then
If so I want to go
I've seen him leave at night
Followed him so far
Drove out about thirteen miles
Then he pulled in to a shothouse bar

For a long tall cool one
Don't know just what's going down
Long tall cool one
Looks like a new friend I've found

Walking in the shadows
Now I want back in the light
As I make the drop I've got some
Second thoughts tonight
You see I walked right in, sat right down
Offered him a light
Big talk for about thirteen hours
He said can you help me with a job tonight

For a long tall cool one
Don't know just what's going down
Long tall cool one
He said some thing's in it for me right now

I've reached out into the darkness
Jumped up from my bed
Woke up in the middle of the night
Got myself in way over my head

For the long tall cool one
Don't know just what's going down
Long tall cool one
Looks like a new friend I've found

Long tall cool one
But it better never bite me well
Long tall cool one

Bruce Hornsby,"Train rolls by about 3 a.m.
Wakes me from a fitful sleep
Got the urge to jump on board
I believe I'm in a little too deep

Walk the train station
Walking through the park
Looking out for something
Still in the dark

One day you'll see something
Oh, with a familiar ring
It'll be just me moving through
On the way to something

It's your life, it's your world
It's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your life, it's your world
Your life, and I'm just passing through

Tired and confused, yes I am
Don't see much in the future for me
I'm a vagabond and a drifter
Not so hard to be

Walking down the highway
Walking through the park
Looking out for something
Still in the dark

Don't know what to say
When I see you smile
So I guess I'll turn my head and go
On the way to another mile

It's your life, it's your world
It's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your life, it's your world
Your life, and I'm just passing through

Walking down the highway
Walking through the park
Looking out for something
Still in the dark

Want faith in something
So hard to believe
Maybe one night soon
Maybe you could make me see

It's your life, it's your world
It's your world, and I'm just passing through
It's your life, it's your world
Your life and I'm just passing through

Bruce Hornsby,"Hey now, where are you going?
Where are you going, to my friend?
Said, ""I'm going out to find the pastures of plenty
I believe they're out there somewhere""

Did you hear about the girl alone in the world?
Thought she was losing her mind
She found it in the discarded refuse pile
Down near the railroad line

A book of sonnets torn and tattered
A few remained intact
One held the key, she said to me
To getting some feeling back

Sometimes my head turns round and round
Sometimes you talk but I can't hear a sound
Sometimes I look down, find my feet off the ground
I feel that I'm somewhere else bound

Hey now, where are you going?
Where are you going, to my friend?
Said, ""I'm going out to find the pastures of plenty
I believe they're out there somewhere""

She looked down the railroad track
Lined with trees on each side
She prayed for the strength to run to the boxcar
To pull herself up for the ride

You invite me to your house, you're so sincere
We sit so close for a while
You reach out for me in the low light so clear
But you look like you're frowning when you smile

Hanging around just to see what could happen
Hanging on by, oh, the thinnest thread
Sometimes I see the faintest glimpse
Sometimes I feel I'd be better off in bed

Hey now, where are you going?
Where are you going, to my friend?
Said, ""I'm going out to find the pastures of plenty
I believe they're out there somewhere""

Shoulder moves from side to side

From the middle of June till the summer's end
People would gather from miles around
To see the mighty Rainbow knock 'em down

Fancy shirts and shorts of plaid
Coat of more colors than Joseph had

Throw it down at the proper time

Like I always do
My love at my side, but only this time
My friends say something's changed you

They said you're running with the wrong set
The girl is someone you should never have met
Let her go on her own, son
Everyone else has just come undone

The old town fathers are up in arms
The city council is very alarmed
Cousins and uncles are having fits
Predictors of doom think this is it

Everybody else just stand around
Me and my baby, we're the talk of the town

The old statue there in the town square
Seems to stare at me
Walking around with my head down
They say can't we make you see

I said, ?Son, you know we're really color blind
But everybody else seems to really mind
Lose her now, I think you'll find
Everyone else will just fall in line?

Shouldn't throw stones out from your house of glass
'Round here lots of crackers and cheese
Stay away from those my daddy said to me
You'll get in trouble if you mess with these

hands roaming free

Bruce Hornsby,"She walked into town in a long white gown 
And the band played on with no one around 
And the rice was gone oh hours ago 
And the white wheeled limousine's standing alone 

Well they met at the club where the brasses blow 
Where the wine did flow oh he moved so slow 
But finally one night as the wind stood still 
He got up the nerve and she said ""I will"" 

The day did come and the groomsmen arrived 
Came a little early to go over their lines 
As they walked to the church on the cobblestones 
Was heard in the bushes a moan and a groan

There was always talk of a wandering eye 
He'd come to the club and he'd look all around 
It took a fair minded man not to wonder aloud

In my ever-present chair
People laughing and smiles all around me
Balloons and paper in my hair

There's a man in a car with the top down
Waving wildly at me
The poor son of a gun, I know he's thinking
Better him, him than me

I've stared down the devil and had to look away
Called out to the angels but no-one ever came
Laid down odd and even but double zero played
That's alright, I'm a lucky one, oh
Oh such a fortunate son

Well I was always taught well, taught well
To be the strong one and keep it inside
But sometimes I sit beside the freeway
And howl out at the dark, dark sky

I might just have to go out and burn one
Have a drink or a few
Fade away in a cloudy haze of smoke
And give the old man's best salute

Picked up a guy hitching on the highway side
Rode into town together looking for a sign

Had everything that money could buy

Went out to find any movie he could rent
Died his hair black, I bought him an olive oil suit
To run with the wolves, like Romulus in reno would

But I know you've got a dark streak too
And go out for a closer view
Go out for a ride, looking for the

When she had her palm read in the back of the house
She loved how everybody loved her when she took it out
Would jump around, would scream and shout

Better than towing the long, straight line
Careful what you ask for you might just find

And I always cross to the other side
But I go back every time
Maybe one day we'll come together

Saw two matchsticks burn, felt the bedsheets sting
Ugly words on a wall, and a robe in flames
Then I saw a little boy smile, when the clouds did move away

Letting my eyes roam over the plain
I'm laughing on my break
Feeling like a captive on a long chain
Watch the people pick up sticks
Big boss man cracks his whip
It's serious but we laugh to keep from crying
Spouting out the company line
Everything here's just fine
He says he cares about me but he's lying
Up, up in the big house
The king of the hill.

I'm watching the boss man
Talking to his sister with the dirty hands
They sit, cussing at the rules
Wishing they could lose me as fast as they can
He's got me in the roughest rig
He thinks I took his brother's gig
People say they've got the game rigged
His daddy gave him everything
A job and a house and his earring
Why does he think that I'm so threatening, so bad
And up, up in the big house

And there, driving the big cat, king of the hill

I'm over in my space
Swatting bugs, sweat stains rolling down my face
I'm trying not to drink
Knowing I've got to roll out of this place
Watch the people pick up bricks
King of the hill with his nightstick
Caught up in accounting tricks
Throw a bone to the poor hicks
Got some candy, take a lick
Great white hope, shooting bricks
Time to let us all share the wealth
Getting coffee for the big stick
Hand in his pants at the skin flick
Lots of poisons, take your pick
Mama, mama, mama come quick
Felling like I'm getting sick

While you talk in your line, keep everything fine, whoa fine

Between us, I can see, things are not what they used to be

Now I sit and wonder, why it's a friendship charade

Looking for fights all day, I don't want to play
Whoa, but I do, here we go, you fire off another lame remark
You're in the dark
No bite, just your bark but it leaves a painful mark

Oh, painful mark on your soul, takes its toll, might as well fold

I never stop to get set

Here a gun, there a gun, everywhere
See my man go tearing his hair

I'll do the best with what I've got
Clear my head and give it a shot

Who knows what will get you through
Don't know about me, less about you
I don't know but I'll try

Sherry loved his style
We loved to laugh as they glided past
But he kicked the blues for a while

Manny wanted to be artsy
Always dressed in black
Our spirits rose as he struck the pose
But he found peace in the wonderful clothes

And hey hey oh hey now, there you go
Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops no one knows
Hey oh oh there you go
Round and round and round it goes
First to laugh is the last to know

Jimmy went and joined the gym
His posing was a sight
We thought he looked like a clown in tights
But we were the ones home alone at night

And hey hey oh hey now, there you go
Round and round and round it goes
Where it stops no one knows
Hey oh oh there you go
Round and round and round it goes
First to laugh is the last to know

Johnson loved to feign indifference
A nihilist to the brim
We'd shout as he would spout
Nothing ever fazes him

Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now

One man saw a healer doing such good, good things
One man saw a sinner by the holy sea
Well Jesus and the pharisees didn't see eye to eye
But the man on the shore saw so clearly

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now
I want to be at the meeting, well I want to be in that number
When we all see, see the same, see the same way

One man saw a million men standing in peaceful grace
One man saw nobody missing work
Telling lots of bad jokes might just make you feel good
But you never know who you, who you hurt with your words

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way
Open our eyes, see the same, see the same way, hey now

There was a man playing G.I.Joe, way back there in the woods
In training for the coming of the promised war
Seeing all conspiracy, needs somebody to blame
If only he could open up, love a little more

You're looking at a picture, I'm looking at it too
Do you see what I see today, hey
Let's talk about the difference, find out what's in the way

Bruce Hornsby,"In light of all I've learned so far
I don't believe I'm so strange
In spite of all this time I spend
Calling the air by a name

When the first light comes over the trees
He will be singing with me
And if I feel like singing alone
He always lets me be

[Chorus]
I'm shaking my shadow hand
As the sun moves round the bend
With an imaginary man
And we'll make believe around and around again

There's a man walking around in the night
A lantern in his hand
Looking all around, searching in vain
For an honest man

In my little world of make-believe
I talk to myself or my friend
If real life comes tempting me
I'll go back in my room again

[Chorus]

So nice to pretend, think I'll do it again
No cards to send, no torn heart to mend
A little imagination and then
A world of fantasy with my friends

[Chorus]",Shadow Hand,1998
Bruce Hornsby,"Crawl up the back steps up to the back door
Reach up in the dark, turn the handle a little more
Open up real slow so the door won't creak
Look ahead, look behind, don't shuffle your feet

[Chorus]
They say he's crazy, they say he's gone
We play our tricks, make up funny songs
Sneaking around, feeling badly
Sneaking up on Boo Radley

Hear the caterpillar crawl, hear the bed buds bite
Hear the crickets scream, all the sounds of the night
Hear the sound of footprints on the ground I think I say
Don't step on the lightning bugs, watch the crack in your knees

[Chorus]

They say he's funny, got a loose screw
Stay away, he's a threat to you
Give him a break, what do we know
Might turn out we would like him so
We fear what we just don't know

I heard he served a long time ago
He saw some things we'll never know
We laugh and sneak around in the night
Fun and games but I know it's not right

Scared and fascinated
Ignorant we castigate him
Scared and fascinated
Ignorant we flagellate him

They say he's crazy, they say he's gone
We play our tricks, make up funny songs
Down the street walking sadly
Little sister loves him madly

Bruce Hornsby,"One eye is open, the other eye is shut
Don't throw anything to me
I'm in no place, no place to receive
And I just can't move a thing

Things are rough down here
You know it's a little grim
Whatever you've got to pick me up
To help me out, I'm in, I'm down with that

[Chorus]
In my dream I can fly, fly high
Over the fields and across the sky
Then I'm awake and I'm back on the ground
If you could take me back up there
I'm down, down with that

When I escape and close my eyes
Can't tell you from me
Sometimes in the dreams I look at myself
And it's looks so good, what I see

I'm having a little trouble here
Could you maybe help me out?
A little confidence pill you got
To take away my self doubt, I'm down with that

[Chorus]

Slow down sun, shake yourself
Why make your own hell?
Say what are you doing son?
I'm just trying to like myself

I'd love to help myself
You know I really, really would
May your days be bright and well

Bruce Hornsby,"I would try most anything
While I stand here lingering
Have a couple of songs to sing
To take your mind away

Promises of treats I bring
I'd give you most anything
Doesn't change anything
You're going away

Just goin', goin', gone away again
Here today, gone tomorrow
Little ones can't hide their sorrow
Goin', goin', gone away again

See you holding back a tear
The moment when I disappear
You look and look until it's clear
He's gone through a long time

You say don't make a special trip here
Please don't because I fear
One of my new friends
Might just spy a tear
Goin', goin' away

I'm just goin', goin', gone away away again

Bruce Hornsby,"This is no fond farewell
You can be sure I could wish it was no farewell at all
It's been a good long run
Oh to be sure I don't regret much, not much at all

And I'm gonna love the night away
Gonna do what I want to any old day
And all at once I know the clouds are gonna clear for me

And I will do alright
Well in truth, I might
I may be stumbling round on some cold night
And I will miss the times when we were so right
Although it seems so long ago, so long
This is my swan song, I'm gone, gone

This is no sorrowful day
You can be sure I've got no axe to grind at all
It's circumstance or burn out
You can be sure I've been grinding, 'till I'm grinding to a halt

Sometimes it's the right thing to cut the chord
You've been holding on hard but your hands get sore
Sometimes it's worth it but sometimes you wonder what for

And I will do alright
Well in truth, I might
I may be stumbling round on some dim dim light
And I will miss the times when we were so right

About that sweet magnolia thyme
Black-eyed Susan made some catfish stew
And papa brought some homemade wine.

All you southern children like to rock'n roll
The TV mamas tell you why
They got it on the boat from Africa
It's that Dixie Lullaby.

Well, Blind Willie Time he had a dime shoe shine
Stand down on Beale Street
And Willie would stop and just to say hello
All the shoes he'd meet.

Why are you so happy said the clean white buck
You got no reason to be happy Mr Time
And Willie would stop and just pop his rag
With a Dixie Lullaby.

So now you know the story of my southern home
With a honeysuckle wine
And if you ever think that you might come yourself
You ought to keep this thought in mind.
All you easy riders better watch you step
And if you're walkin' down below the line
That Louisiana man is gonna get you yet

Once they get out on the road
Well then everything is alright
Had to get away from the kids and the wives
Well they ran into some city boys that didn't walk just right
And the line was drawn for another showdown
Like they'd always seen it done
And when the lights came up on the little woods town
There was an old man bailing out a son

Going out for a night on the town
Going out to the smoke and trees
Going out for a night on the town
Going out for a look and see
Said do what your daddy told you
Well I just went out and did that
Van and willie went out one night

There's a green table down at the midway
Where they rack up the balls for the games
And reputations are made
There's a green forest full of oaks and pines
Where they cleared a cleared a space in the middle
Where secret scores are settled
And the claim was made round the table that night
And they rode off through the trees
And the young boys tell how the city boys tried
And how one man fell to his knees

Going out for a night on the town
Going out to the smoke and trees
Going out for a night on the town
Going out for a look and see
Said what made you go and do that
Well we were just having a little fun
Van and Willie went out one night

And the line was drawn for another showdown
Like they'd always seen and done
And one mans night for a drunken old time
Left a scar on on another one

Would flash his moves for the worshipful, oh worshipful
Well shoulder moves from side to side
Go over your head and dot your eyes
Well dot your eyes

From the middle of June to the summer's end
People would gather from miles around
To see the mighty rainbow knock 'em down

He'd pull up from around the back

Oh Cadillac
Well fancy shirts and shorts of plaid
Coat of more colors than Joseph had, everybody had

Well every night about a quarter to ten
From the middle of June to the summer's end
People would gather from miles around
To see the mighty rainbow knock 'em down

Take a quarter from the collection plate
Every night he would dominate
Jump to the top and pick off a dime
Throw it down at the proper time

She came to share my name
For years we lived as lovers on the open plains
Far off the heat wave shimmers
Pipelines and the gasoline
One day it all came running like a bad dream
Fire, smoke-filled lungs
I hope I'll be standing when the day is done
We're

Staring out at the red plains
And we're hiding out from the smoke and the rage
A lifetime living on the red plains
Watching out as it all goes up in flames

Get up on Sunday morning
Repent for Friday night
Don't let 'em tell you it's gonna be a fair fight
I gave her clothes and a diamond
She loved the things that shine
But one day the gold and the silver get left behind
Fire, smoke-filled rooms
I hope I'll be standing when the day is through

Bruce Hornsby,"Down in the southwest virginia town of richlands
I fell in love with an appalachian girl
She lived in a long line of little row houses
On the side of an old strip mining hill

She walked along on the jagged ridge
And looked as far as she could see
But the hills out there so up and down
You only see as far as the next big ridge

Everytime I see her face
On the street in the hollow of on the hill
Another time and another place
I feel her in my heart still

Everytime I see her face
On the street in the hollow in the bend
I see her in my mind and then
I go down the road not taken...again

Oh the coal dust sttles on the window display
They have to change it about every other day
Some things never change way out here
An outsider could always remain that way
She walked along on the jagged ridge
She told me she was thinking of me
But every time I tried to take her away
She alway ran back to the rocks and the trees

Everytime I see her face
On the street in the hollow of on the hill
Another time and another place
I feel her in my heart still
Everytime I see her face
On the street in the hollow in the bend
I see her in my mind and then
I go down the road not taken...again

Oh I went back there after many years
So curious and so secretly
As I looked on I held back a tear
The road not taken overcoming me

Oh I saw her she was sitting there
Older, thinner on the front porch
It seemed the light a little brighter there
Or maybe I still carried the forgotten torch

Everytime I see her face
On the street in the hollow of on the hill
Another time and another place

Looking over the crowd
The reunion band playing too loud
And he sees his fellow old star
Looks him up and down
Sees a little of himself in his frown

Looking for the fountain to drink some, to think some

Oh she wants to see if she remembers right
Say won't you come outside tonight

And when it was over
They sat there and looked back

Some fine day
You will find your way Across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river

She was proud and so strong
And she tried not to listen to idle talk
Downtown where she walked
They sit around and they say
That she came back with her tail between her legs
Like they always said she would

Well I hear it's better on the other side
They say you'll never do it so don't even try
Well you may be beaten down with your closed mind
But don't try and make it mine
Well I know

Some fine day
You will find your way Across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go
Across the river

""Your wild days are through"" is what they said
I dreamed she came, when I was down and
I walked where she led

Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
There's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here
Well I know

Some fine day
You will find your way Across the river
Row down slow
There's a long way to go

Bruce Hornsby,"There were people living in a green valley
Found a way to make a lot of money
Made the green turn gradually gray
They figured they could do whatever they wanted
Everything would be alright
But scars don't always heal away
And the sons and the daughters got diamonds and gold
But they were given a land where
Strong roots never take hold

Good seed don't grow
On the barren ground
Good things don't come along
As you just sit dreaming on
Good seed don't grow
On the barren ground
Say everything fades away
There you are still around
What'll you do where will you go

There was a ship along the coast
Carrying a load of black money
In the sound near the northern lights
When the ship set sail
The crew looked for guidance
In the bottom of an empty glass
Then the captain said ""pour me another rye""
Then the water turned black as that cold winter's night

Good seed don't grow
On the barren ground
Good things don't come along
As you just sit dreaming on

What'll you do where will you go",Barren Ground,2006
Bruce Hornsby,"She came from the backwoods
Bright teeth, stylish hair
Good fortune and everyone's smiles
Followed her everywhere

Had a taste for the good life
Had some stars in her eyes
Thought she would have it all
Once her name was in lights

Hey, hey, little Miss Jane
Sunny day turned to hard rain
Traded in your evening gown
For a jumpsuit of pain

The beauty queen and the wallflower
Feel the same in their darkest hours
All watch as the crown of jewels
Falls from the old guard tower

She walked down the runway
A crown of jewels she wore
Applause and lights, but at the end of the night
She was the first out the door

Drove all night at high speed
Arrived in the early day light
Flash of a knife, a nice evening dress
Couldn't change her man's mind

Hey, hey, little Miss Jane
Sunny day turned to hard rain
Traded in your evening gown
For a jumpsuit of pain

The beauty queen and the wallflower
Feel the same in their darkest hours

Bruce Hornsby,"Here is my hand for you to hold
Here's the part of me they have not sold
Others may come and they may go
But I love you young, I love you old

Only you can see yeah, the other side of me
Call me naive, I think you will
I love you now
Do you love me still?

Yes, only you can see, the other side of me
Call me foolhardy if you will
I love you now
Do you love me still?

She was running from a fat man selling salvation in his hand
She said he’s tryin’ to save me
But I’m doin’ alright, the best that I can
Just a pair of fallen angels tryin’ to get through the night

Step by step, one by one, higher and higher
Step by step, one by one, climbing jacob’s ladder

Comin’ over the airwaves the man says I’m overdue
Sing a song, send money, join the chosen few
But mister I’m not in a hurry, and I don’t want to be like you

And rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world
With mommy and daddy standing by

When happily ever after fails
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details
Since daddy had to fly

But I know a place where we can go
Still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by
And the tall grass wave in the wind

You can lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense
But this is the end

This is the end of the innocence
O' beautiful, for spacious skies
But now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords

For this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail
And we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers clean up all details

Since daddy had to lie
But I know a place where we can go
And wash away this sin
We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by

And the tall grass wave in the wind
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair spill all around me
Offer up your best defense

But this is the end
This is the end of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last
Now we've come so far, so fast

But, somewhere back there in the dust
That same small town in each of us
I need to remember this
So baby give me just one kiss

And let me take a long last look
Before we say good bye
Just lay your head back on the ground
And let your hair fall all around me

Offer up your best defense

With a dram glass in her hand
She's drinkin' away her troubles

Last time I saw little Maggie
She was sittin' on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four all around her
And a banjo on her knee

Pretty flowers were made for bloomin'
Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty women were made for lovin'

Lay down your gold watch and chain

I'll just let them be

This thing is great
My excitement will not abate
I will act and not hesitate
Listen all you can relate
Like a skater with the best of skates
Confidence elevates
Looking for an ecstatic state
You are the master of your own fate

Gather round the schoolyard gate, 
History will record this date
Feel the shifting tectonic plates, 
You can get it even if you're straight
Allow me to illustrate, how we humbly will create
Time for the shake and bake
Get up, little children, levitate

I will act and not hesitate
Listen all you can relate

Gather round the schoolyard gate, 
History will record this date
Feel the shifting tectonic plates, 
You can get it even if you're straight
And the village children levitate

Shining down through the trees

Walking on the sidewalk with W.C. Handy
And all the little people turn their heads

To see
I'm getting up, time to dust my broom
Sing nursery rhymes of pain
I'm trading cards with John the Conqueroo

Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers,"Deep down in the south county
Over where the paper mill runs
Lived a man, a young country doctor
With the perfect wife and sons
Well he worked his days
And Sundays he'd pray
And nobody knew
Why the wife slowly withered away

I saw the country doctor, to ask him what
was wrong with me
He was caught unaware, accidental and devil may care
Behind the curtain I see, two shadows in front of me
Oh nobody know the trouble I've seen

My guess, there was another woman
And with the kids and the money there was a lot to lose
He said she had an rare affliction
And he was doing all he could do
And we all believed him
Felt so sorry and then
I thought once he was a fine man
Now I don't remember when

I saw the country doctor, to ask him what
was wrong with me
He was caught unaware, accidental and devil may care
Behind the curtain I see, bottles unmarked in front of me
Whoa nobody knows the trouble I've seen

I saw the country doctor, in a place he didn't see me
Way out in the middle of the night where he thought
no one could see
Over there in the parlor room, making eyes,
hands roaming free
Someone soon must know, the trouble I've seen

Did you think about the young ones
One day they'll know it was you
And if they let you off one day
Who then will you turn to
And my wife remembers one thing
She said I remember kind of strangely
At a friends wedding one time
It was a look that he gave me",Country Doctor,2011

""It's coming any day now"", cried the priest
The people in high places may defend you
But son, you better hope they keep the peace

Can't you hear them calling, can't you see them shine?
The city halls are falling, the defenders drink their wine
And when the party's over, their stomachs start to sag
Defenders, defenders of the flag

The congregation's waiting at the altar
They can't find the preacher anywhere
They found him with the new girl from the choir
Where they store the boxes of the book of prayer

If these guys are the good ones, I don't want to know the bad
You wonder how it happened, they just picked it up from dad
And faded old glory hanging like a rag
Defenders, defenders of the flag, oh

Oh, the flag is flying high over the courthouse
The wheels of justice never stood a chance
The judge is down at Charlie's on his lunch hour
Checking out the picture show from France

Threw the ball to home but they always missed the tag

Picked up a guy hitching on the highway side

Died his hair black, I bought him an olive oil suit

When she had her palm read in the back of the house
She loved how everybody loved her when she took it out
Would jump around, would scream and shout

And left him standing on the old valley road
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on, walk on alone

Bruce Hornsby & the Range,"There's a place
A local roadside shack
A poor man's Paris with a parking lot in the back
There's a girl there
She knows how to unwind
She don't talk much but she knows just how to act
I said, don't tell me she don't love me
The money's just a mere formality

Every day, every night
Somethings going on, something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Any place, any time when I'm fading
My love lies waiting
Down the road tonight

When I was younger
All the older boys
Would drive me way out past the county fair
They'd laugh and point out
This roadside trailer
And say something wild's going on over there
They said, what they're doing
Don't mean nothing to you now
But someday it'll mean everything

They were dealing one-eyed jacks
And when I said I loved her
She said, just keep coming back",Down the Road Tonight,1986

Everyone sees the long day through
Well what would I do without the nights
And the phone
And the chance just to talk to you
A thousand miles away
What I wouldn't give for only one night
A little relief in sight
Or someday when times weren't so tight

When the day goes down on the
Water town
When the sun sinks low all around
That's when I know I need you now
You're what I miss
Every little kiss

Everybody here's a number, not a name
But I guess that's all right with me
As I sit alone after a long day
In the absence of company
Oh I let my mind wander,

From the air till they play the last song

I watch the side wheel spin and I
Think about her when I hear that whistle blow

She lived in a long line of little row houses
On the side of an old strip mining hill

She walked along on the jagged ridge
And looked as far as she could see
But the hills out there so up and down

I know of a certain tree
I always asked if you wanted to go
You'd just sit there silently

You know where you want to be
As I watch you tan in the waters so brown
Desire gets the best of modesty
Walk me down the side of the water
Lay your weary head on me
Lay your clothes up on the table
Wrap your worries round the red cedar tree

Oh she wants to see if she remembers right
Say won't you come outside tonight
Alright
They drive to the lookout on the hill

And when it was over
They sat there and looked back
Tomorrow was way in the distance
Tomorrow was a long time away

She said you're a scream and your accent's so cute

Oh down the lane
At night she walks on the banks and remembers how she
Dreamed of rowing away
And how she left one day
She left with a driven look in her eyes
Came back around with it still inside
They said give it some time and you'll forget about it too

That she came back with her tail between her legs
Like they always said she would

They say you'll never do it so don't even try
Well you may be beaten down with your closed mind
But don't try and make it mine

You will find your way across the river

Your wild days are through is what they said
I dreamed she came, when I was down and
I walked where she led

Standing on the shore
She looks to the west with a look of longing
To where the grass seems greener
There's a hard and distant prize
It probably won't happen but I think I'll try
Well even if it doesn't happen for me
It still beats hanging around here

Maybe something mattered

Some are gonna lay down

Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose.

If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows,

And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today,

When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys

Instruct Anna Sten in diction,

Now turns a handspring landing up-
