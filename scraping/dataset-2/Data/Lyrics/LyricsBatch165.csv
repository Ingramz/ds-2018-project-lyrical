Don Omar,"Esta pa bailarlo en una esquina
Con nueva gata
Trago en mano
Buena mata
Y que la nota nos lleve a donde tu quieras
Hoy yo no voy pa casa a mi nadie me espera

Entonces por que tan mesquina
Prende y pasa
No amarre el fuego
Dame melaza
Yo tengo de eso que tu quieres y te pompea
Y te lo voy a dar donde nadie nos vea

Huele a sereno, a puro y veneno
Boom, a tratar el bueno
Pasadolo hasta abajo, al callejon sin miedo
No salgan sin paraguas que esta noche hay trueno
Cojan su esquina, se me juntan las mas finas
Y los delincuentes que esto no termina
Bartender, hoy bebemos esta gasolina
El container, trankao en picosina
Sin grillete, el mio y su billete y pa la calle
Y pal que falle el combete
Cepille, y pa que le bille bille
Rimbe y Jumbo pa que Don y Calde se guillen
Llama los bomberos que se formo el reguero
Y que Adelita pide agua por el trasero
Tres acero iba pa dentro entero
Boom, sin pantomima a bolero

Esta pa bailarlo en una esquina
Con nueva gata
Trago en mano
Buena mata
Y que la nota nos lleve a donde tu quieras
Hoy yo no voy pa casa a mi nadie me espera

Entonces por que tan mesquina
Prende y pasa
No amarre el fuego
Dame melaza
Yo tengo de eso que tu quieres y te pompea
Y te lo voy a dar donde nadie nos vea

Salimos ready
No pa comer caca
Tego caluroso
Con una combi bellaca
Pa kam bum bum
Y pa trangalanga
Se baila como para embarazarla
Cuidado si anda sin pantis y en falda
Si te lo agarra esta dificil que salga
Siempre ready por si le caigo chingo
En la mano abierta un condón

Aunque parezca un bonbon
Uno nunca sabe cuanto se la han comido el toto
Mientras mas buena estan y le dan a la cuestión
Tu sabes que no se puede sin protección
De laton y el hijue puta en el microphone
Para que acelere el ambiente
Basura para el zafacon
Tato cool tato chulo
Para que meneen los culos

Esto es pa bailarlo en una esquina
Tu nueva gata
Trago en mano
Buena mata
Y que la nota nos lleve a donde tu quieras
Hoy yo no voy pa casa
A mi nadie me espera

Entonces porque tan mesquina
Prende y pasa
No amarre el fuego
Dame melaza
Yo tengo de eso que tu quieres y te pompea
Y te lo voy a dar donde nadie nos vea",Bailando Bajo el Sol,2015

Los que se inventaron esto
Bienvenidos al otro nivel

Que apaguen la luz
Yo saque la noche pa bailar contigo
Y solo faltas tu
Para intentar saciar lo prohibido
Si apagan la luz
Tu y yo, no somos amigos
Sexo y pasión
Solo dos cuerpos bailando encendios

En lo oscuro
Pégate un poco mas, contra el muro
Ahí es que es
Con este sandungueo que tenemos
Tu y yo sacamos candela

En lo oscuro
Pégate un poco mas, contra el muro
Ahi es que es
Con este sandungueo que tenemos
Tu y yo sacamos candela

Le toca el exorcista
Te habla pa la pista
Con la mala va pa afuera aunque resista
Si el bajo la excita
En lo oscuro se limita
La rosa cuerpo con cuerpo
Mientras grita, papi dame duro
En el muro se le quitan
Esas ganas te va a dar que la invita
Pa lo oscuro
Sexy la ropa se quita
Y con ganas toditas se excitan
En lo oscuro
Solita y suavecita, que le de hasta abajo y la desvista
Y le meta duro, a su cuerpito de revista
Y en un momento suelto estoy en lista

En lo oscuro
Pégate un poco mas, contra el muro
Ahi es que es
Con este sandungueo que tenemos
Tu y yo sacamos candela

En lo oscuro
Pégate un poco mas, contra el muro
Ahi es que es
Con este sandungueo que tenemos
Tu y yo sacamos candela

La mata el deseo
Empezó la vaina el pariseo
Sacude su falda
Su intención es provocarme

Se convierte en fiera
Ay si la viera
Como me provoca, como se altera
Y si estamos solo los dos
Le gusta meterme presión
Ok, sin juego
Nos vamos a fuego
Llego el andariego
Tanto brillo en el cuello los deja ciego
Sean sinceros colegas dejen el ego
Yo soy el veneno, ustedes tiemblan cuando llego
Llego la super fórmula fronteando con la tropa
El tigere se pega, mujeres con poca ropa
Empezó el botelleo, en la mano una copa
La calle ya sabe, que mueve la sopa
Anda suelta con un par de amigas
Loca, loca me provoca
Rapidito me sofoca
Yo me activo, si me besas, si me toca
El tigere quiere cariño dentro de la troca

Que apaguen la luz
Yo saque la noche pa bailar contigo
Y solo faltas tu
Para intentar saciar lo prohibido
Si apagan la luz
Tu y yo, no somos amigos
Sexo y pasión
Solo dos cuerpos bailando encendios

En lo oscuro
Pégate un poco mas, contra el muro
Ahi es que es
Con este sandungueo que tenemos

Don Omar,"'Cause I remember
Cuando me bailabas sexy, bajo el sol
De todas tus amigas eras la envidia mi nena
Bailame de frente y bañame en sudor

Dímelo bebo
Por que tu obsesión conmigo?

Serán esos ojitos que me vuelven loco
O lo rico que me das picos poco a poco
Esa locura que se vive en tus caderas
O esa cintura que me lleva a las estrellas

Mami tu tienes la culpa, me dejas con las ganas
Me dice que otro día, visitará mi cama
De pronto eres de esas, que quiere algo en serio
Pero como me gustas, no me queda más remedio

Que tratar tratar tratar de convencerla
No no no no conmigo no vas a jugar
Tratar tratar tratar de convencerla
No no no no conmigo no vas a jugar

'Cause I remember
Cuando me bailabas sexy, bajo el sol
De todas tus amigas eras la envidia mi nena
Bailame de frente y bañame en sudor

Aquella noche frente al mar cartagena
Tus ojos negros, tu cuerpo y la luna llena
Fueron tus besos y el calor de la noche nena
Que me tiene llamando, contéstame morena

Que el tiempo corre y la brisa de las palmeras
Solo me acuerda tu voz y piel canela
Son los recuerdos de una noche entera
Que murieron como espumas a orillas en la arena

Ma tienes la culpa, me deja con las ganas
Me dice que otro día, visitará mi cama
De pronto eres de esas que quiere algo en serio
Pero como me gustas, no me queda más remedio

Que tratar tratar tratar de convencerla
No no no no conmigo no vas a jugar
Tratar tratar tratar de convencerla
No no no no conmigo no vas a jugar

Don Omar,"Se canso de llorar
Y condeno su corazón a una celda
(The Last Don)
Para protegerlo del amor
Del peligro nunca estar cerca
(Mambo Kingz)
Ella se sentencio
A soledad por vida eterna
A todo se negó por miedo al dolor

Por un cretino fue que ella olvido
Los besos, las caricias y rechazo el amor
Por culpa de un cobarde fue que ella cambió
Y nunca más volvió a enamorarse

Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, su corazón lleno de miedo
Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, ya no confía en nadie no
Ya no confía en nadie no

Se canso de llorar y condeno su corazón, a una celda
Para protegerlo del amor, del peligro nunca estar cerca
Ella se sentencio a soledad por vida eterna
A todo se negó, por miedo al dolor

Por culpa de un imbécil que nunca la amo
Hoy llora noche y día viviendo del dolor
Por culpa de un estúpido que nunca vio
Que ella todo lo dio al entregarse

Hoy sufre arrepentida llora sol a sol
Al más grande cobarde que la traiciono
Al sucio, mentiroso que me la engaño
Y sueños le vendió sin valorarle

Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, su corazón lleno de miedo
Lagrimas de dolor, soledad sin consuelo
En eso se convirtió, ya no confía en nadie no
Ya no confía en nadie no

Se canso de llorar y condeno su corazón, a una celda
Para protegerlo del amor, del peligro nunca estar cerca
Ella se sentencio a soledad por vida eterna
A todo se negó, por miedo al dolor

Don Omar,"Hoy me levanté pensando en ti
Como sacábamos tiempo para nuestros encuentros, cerca de aquí
Esos momentos intensos del deseo dos presos, cuando era así
Dicen que han cambiado los tiempos
Que ahora tienes dueño
Y no me corresponde a mí
Solo te mientes a tí
Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Desperté con ganas de llamarte
Deseos de verte
De pasar a buscarte
Y no se puede aparente
Quiero la cabeza dañarte
Arrastrarte pa meterte
Beber toda la noche
Y en high arrebatarte

Te voy a enseñar que de tu cuerpo
Soy el dueño de sus partes
Con quien duermes de noche, no sabe ni tocarte
Contesta mi llamar, antes de que se haga tarde
Vuelvas a sus brazos, donde yo ya no pueda darte

Como aquella noche de pasión
Donde éramos fuego, quemándonos intensos
En tu habitación
Donde aún guardas recuerdos y el olor de mi cuerpo
Cerca de ti
Yo solo invento un pretexto y envíame un texto
Y yo te correspondo a ti
Cuando te sientas así

Y tu como que tienes ganas

Ganas, de olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará
Tu gatito no se va a enterar

Yo se que tienes a alguien
Que tu dices que lo quieres
Pero no le hacemos daño
Así evitamos que se entere

No dejes que la conciencia te frene
Que tu quieres que te haga lo que te hace siempre tu nene
Loco por sentir como ahora te mueves
Imaginarte me pone caliente
Y más cuando yo se como tu eres
Cuando comienzas nada te detiene

Maldy!
Hey tu sabes que esto no es amor
Las ganas son sentir tu color y tu calor
A ley nena pa que te tire la mision
Tengo un secreto que tu eres mi perdición
Eres sensual a lo bruto si es tu decision
Ah, de espalda para que baje el sudor
Es que yo quiero castigo pa tu cuerpo
Y lo telefones off
Sexo entre dos
No hay rastreo ni motivos pa discusión

Hoy como que tengo ganas
De olvidar que somos amigos
Hoy te quiero en mi cama
Se que te gusta lo prohibido
Porque demoras, que puede pasar
Que te guste y me pidas más
No te cohibas lo que pasará

Con una química especial
Nos tomamos de la mano
Dialogamos y desde ese momento

Yo vivo perdido en tus ojos
No me puedo controlar
Será tu mirada
Serán tus besos
Que no me dejan ni pensar
Yo vivo perdido en tus ojos
No me puedo concentrar
Será tu mirada que me cautiva
Y me hace delirar

Uoh uho

Esto que siento es tan puro
Que ni un solo minuto
En ti dejo de pensar
Cierro los ojos y ahí estás
Cada día al despertar

Esto que siento es tan puro
Que cada día que pasa
Yo me enamoro más y más
De este sueño no quiero despertar
Se me cae el mundo encima si te vas

Lo entrego todo por ti
Todito todo por ti
Y pongo a Dios como testigo de este amor
Hoy te entrego mi corazón
Lo entrego todo por ti

Quiero pasar el resto de la vida amándote

Le gusta la película de andar con gangster
Después de las doce, no hay quien la soporte
Porque cuando ella prende, la disco parte

Entonces parte, la pista cuando el dembow suene
Rompe, el suelo cuando el bajo explote
Y dale, fuego conmigo no amarre
Métele, dale y no ronque

Tu solo dobla
Dale dobla
Dobla rodilla
Pa que vea como el bajo estilla

El tigere con el don
Asustando como monster inc
Y la funda en la maleta, el trin trin
La fémina sigue bailando
Yo rompiendo el beat
Esta matando en la disco
Super fine

Me dijo algo revelador, matador
Que cuando escucha reggaeton, ella prende el motor
Perreo sensualidad sin pudor
La disco esta llena, por el calor sale el vapor
No pares de sacudir
Tu tienes que sobresalir
Con solo una mirada me empieza a seducir
Me pega a la esquina y yo me quiero morir

Quiero ver como menean

Mano arriba la delincuencia
Y si me copian la frecuencia
Júntense que al party llegamos sin clemencia
Nenas se apuntan pal estado de emergencia
Y prepararon toas el booty pa moverlo con demencia
Fueron con choque a tu bloque
Y al que se enfoque
Le damos chivo y con el impacto un toque

Don Omar,"Anoche shorty me salio picua
Me le puse duro y la mate en la raya
Nena deja esa gema, que el sol esta que quema
Ponte un traje de baño y vamos pa' la playa

Anoche shorty me salio picua
Me le puse duro y la mate en la raya
Nena deja esa gema, que el sol esta que quema
Ponte un traje de baño y vamos pa' la playa

Playa corazón y arena, dos mamis bien buenas
Whiskey con cojones, la música que suena
Si habrá party en piscina con la hija de la vecina
Bebiendo todo el corillo y smokeando en una esquina

Un dembow de mi cocina y mucha gasolina
Volumen para la bocina que hoy vamos para encima
Hoy nos fuimos al garete aunque llamen la policía
Activados los monsalvetes que la calle esta prendía

Shorty anda encendida, corriendo por la mía
Modelando en la de ella con su tropa prendida
Coquetea lucia para montarse en la mía
Y como yo ando prendido esta noche si es mía

Hasta abajo poseida en dembow y brujería
El deseo la controla, esta noche hay avería
Esa, esa baila sola si el Dj la motiva
Y como menea la cola, la muy zorra me la activa

Anoche shorty me salio picuda
Después le puse duro y la mate en la raya
Nena deja esa gema, que el sol esta que quema
Ponte un traje de baño y vamos pa' la playa

Anoche shorty me salio picua
Me le puse duro y la mate en la raya
Nena deja esa gema, que el sol esta que quema
Ponte un traje de baño y vamos pa' la playa

Brillan y corra la machina y bembemos hasta en la china
La corta va para arriba, fill y saliva
Bostel neverita palito y birrita
Con un par de cuquitas que se quieren y me invitan

Pero fuman, se medican y pa'l agua brincan
Yo y las hermanitas en G-String predican
Jumbo sube el bajo, que lo solicitan
Porque las excitan y el ritmo se aplican

Sirena para la arena, que la cosa esta buena
Tiburón para la orilla, hoy ganamos como sea
Sin miedo a la escuadrilla, hoy corona el más que mea
Y si alguno se guilla, se lo lleva la marea

Piratas sin garata, te llenan de guata
Anda derechito o te vas sin bata
Por ahi mancito y no nos ronque de plata
Usted cierre ese hocico y te quedas sin gata

Anoche shorty me salio picuda
Después le puse duro y la mate en la raya
Nena deja esa gema, que el sol esta que quema
Ponte un traje de baño y vamos para la playa

Anoche shorty me salio picua

Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando
Con fama soñando
Cantando y llegué.
Lejos del barrio estaba otra ciudad
Y en otro cielo se escuchó mi canción
Pero lo que jamás podré olvidar
Es de donde salí pues eso es lo que soy

Yo soy de aquí, bien orgulloso me siento
Directo de PR los reyes del movimiento
Don-Don, Yandel esto no es un invento
Esto es algo que cotizao’ son más de quinientos mil
A mi público yo le doy las gracias
Porque a pesar de la distancia nos siguen con ansias
Don-Don, Yandel mucho porte y elegancia
Talento desde la infancia
Porque soy de aquí
Pa’ lante voy a seguir
No voy a permitir
Que nadie me ponga el píe
Yo voy a tirar pa’ lante

Papi yo soy de aquí y aunque en Puerto Rico no nací
Represento la tierra donde yo crecí
Acostumbrado al tambor y al sonido del coquillo
Yo soy así de calma, sí, yo soy de aquí
Donde en esto comencé y con la calle me inspiré
Primero gatié, me paré y luego caminé
Poco a poco fui forrándome en plata
Viajando el mundo más que una azafata
Y yo no sé si tú lo entiendes pero así las cosas van
Conozco el avión por dentro
Ya parezco un capitán
Gracias a Dios le doy por escuchar mi coro
Le pedí plata y me respondió con oro

Yo soy de aquí
Del barrio que me vio nacer
De la esquina que me vio crecer
Del callejón con los panas fumando

Es de donde salí pues eso es lo que soy

Nací pobre pero un tesoro vive dentro de mi corazón
Y esa es la perla del Caribe
Quien arropa mi bandera cuando duermo en campo santo
Es el orgullo de la isla del encanto
Varios los frustra con to’ lo mío
Entramos por el monte y salimos por el río
Un ícono mundial vacilando en los chinchorros
Mi gente fuerte y firme como el morro
Soy el indio, el esclavo y conquistador
Par de manos
Soy el hijo de la humildad, la libertad y del tirano
Un talento del caserío (ajá)
Donde la esperanza es una *** (ajá)
Donde los difuntos resucitan (¿Cómo?)

Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

Don Parker,"You don't know what love is
'Til you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had  to lose,
You don't know what love  is.

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,2002

By the sight and the sound when the gun bust
Nigga tell me how to, fuck I know the smell of gunpowder
So well that when the shell spits sniffin it'll rouse ya

Why you send me like this to live a life with such malice
In the streets bound by the vows of marriage
To the game, I'm a hustler
Shellshocked from lettin the shells pop from the muffler

Get knocked, get bailed, with the bell heart just to touch ya
Fuck ya, I done paid all my dues in spades
and know the tools of the trade
Nigga fuck the police, I done spent life up in the streets

Ain't got plans for comin up in this piece
To give a nigga, every side of my struggle
To show why'all mothafuckas all the real ill shit they put a thug through
And they wonder why I let my pants hang, fuck with hoodrats

When I was seventeen, I used to know you
And I haven't seen you now in so many years
And the last time I saw you
You said you joined the Church of Jesus
But me I remember your long red hair
Falling in our faces as I kissed you

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With a house and car and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger
If I was lyin' by you now, I wouldn't be here at all

Well we parted so hard
Me rushing 'round New York with a guitar
Making love to people I didn't even like to see
And I still sometimes think of you
As I lay here in the six at morning
And in the lonely midnight
I've got to hold your face before me

I just want you to know I just had to go
I just want you to know I just had to grow
And you're probably married now
With kids and all
And you turned into a grown-up female stranger

Didn't have no place to go

Just, whistle while you work (whistle)

To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Our love story to tell

Just as every autumn leaves fall from the tree
Tumble to the ground and die
So in the springtime like sweet memories
They will return as will I

Like the sun dear, upon high
We'll return dear, to the sky
And we'll banish the pain and the sorrow
Until tomorrow, goodbye

You came to me when the leaves began to change,
Just like a gentle breeze that brings a Summer rain
Gave me a false hope that Winter winds would never come again,
Why did it have to end?

As all Summer days turned to Autumn nights
But like a bird who needs to fly into the sun,
You couldn't say
Why did you go away?

September Love, where did you go? 
You left with the sun did me so cold,
So when Winter turns to Summer, 
Will I find my September Love?

Well every Spring I hoped that I would find that special kinda love
To last me for all time
But still I wondered in the days and nights of Summer saved away,
until the day you came,
Girl you rise me up just to let me down,
You took me for a ride and left me on the ground,
And now I'm sending out a message in the sky, for only you
And every word is true

September Love, where did you go? 
You left with the sun did me so cold,
So when Winter turns to Summer, 
Will I find my September Love?

Stolen away,
Still I believed you'd come back one day (come back for me)
I'm searching for the heart that once was mine,
My September Love, yahh
And everywhere I go, I only see your face
I try to let it pass but my mind just can't erase 
So will the Winter gray, turn the skies to blue
And so I'll follow every road that leads to you....

Long the skies were overcast

Don Prell,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

Don Prell,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1998

Rich and my chick is a star, I never wish on a star
Pull up and sit on the car, 'member when we used to starve
Most of these niggas is frauds, they not who they say that they are
Niggas do it for the Internet
We ain't really really into that
Push a foreign but you rented that
Shoot a scene, gotta give it back
Took a loss on a lil cash
I ain't trip about it, had to get it back

Plugged in with the plugs, spites on with the blood

Got the Benz getting wiped down
Diss records, keep my name out it
I promise you won't get no fame out it
Rapping 'bout certain trap houses
Reminiscing when I used to slang out it
My life was excitin', all of this ice on
You catch me in Dyckman, I make it look easy
They hate when they see me, I'm higher than deacon
I'm speaking with Meeky and chasing the 'guine
Or you broke, you just feel abandoned
Crowd screaming and I hear 'em chant
Watch you steer the Phantom when I'm in the Hamptons

Shit crazy man

Don
Is it the love or the buzz that keep niggas around?
Take a dose of the drug just to simmer me down
Quick to hold niggas up, slowly bringing you down
And you supposed to be my nigga 'til infinity, how?
Some niggas never sold drugs (nah)
Without the scam its like certain niggas won't budge
They just get they hopes up
But I still show love, I never stunted on niggas
And I still play the buildings, get blunted with niggas
Behind my back like they ain't feed you
Why you hung with them niggas?
But jump right on my dick when I run into niggas
I know exactly how to humble you niggas, yeah
I got a trick for any one of you niggas, I swear
Pocket watchers looking at the bottle poppers
Run behind the diamond shoppers
Niggas stylin', sick Italian, box of rocks on my way to gym class
Ten bags inside the locker
Try to join a school team, never made inside the roster
I went to court for my shooters
Not on the court putting shots up
I played defense on the block
Couldn't defend as a blocker, I was lost
Without a direction to go
Could've been breathless, through God's grace I perfected a flow
I started off less than a O, how I'm supposed to survive?
Momma said the rent due, how I'm supposed to provide?
Motions reply, tears fall from both of my eyes
This when they put that pressure on you, gotta go and reply
Can't lower my pride
I filled out applications, waiting for a call back
They just had me waiting, thoughts marinated like
Will I ever get out this hell hole? Who the hell knows
Nightmares hearing my coffin drop on my cell clothes
We was outside since Ludacris was throwing elbows
Shell toes, PS2 and Grand Theft codes
New class think they street because they wearing du-rags
Too bad they couldn't clip my wings before I flew past (how ya day start?)
I woke up to 100 missed calls and another withdrawal
What should I quit for, I pour up and sip more
Then I drift off, Granny still in church praying on that Pick 4
It could be worse, I could still be on that sixth floor

Testing my patience, your label gon' have to check for replacements

Nightmares haunting me
Feeling like the last breath I was taking
God was warning me
Now every morning I'm checking for faces
Now that I get paid to party, I show up and bring my army
Better off safe than sorry, I'm never gonna play safari
LA nights boogie had the Lambo, I played the 'Rari
Selling white and I ain't tell 'em a word when they came and charged me
I never worked a shift, I got it from the first to fifth
I had to learn the tricks like stuff the bags and burn the tips
Christmas time I couldn't tell my daughter I ain't earned a cent
I had to hit the curb and pitch, I leave and I return with gifts
Made decisions to keep my momma with a place to live
And stayed up wishing that she never seen them dinner plates was missing
Where I'm from the young wild niggas just hate to listen
'Cause the old heads before us ain't showed us how to make a difference
I feel upset, my killers check whoever's sending threats
You still in debt, got plenty checks and I ain't get to spend 'em yet
Nothing in direct, I'm still a living legend in the flesh
I remember deaths, I couldn't cope but dog I'm still a mess
Bitches left and I wish 'em best

Yellow gold, keep it classic
Big money been around, push weight Jurassic
Send your bitch to Aspen for her b-day
Send your younger bitch to Coachella for 'bout three days
Same circle pass each other like a relay
You live in, I land on, difference between our PJ's
Niggas still making albums using label budgets
I get it out the streets before the label touch it
Take two years and tell the label fuck it
My kilos streaming in the streets without a single buzzing
Never wore all saints, retired Balmain

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",He's Funny That Way,2000

They shake their heads and say I'm riding high
But this thing has done drove me wild and now it's got me down

   And if my thoughts don't change a lot I'll jump right in and drown
   For after what you've done to me I know I've grown to be
   The laughing stock the talk of the town

And now I am the talk of the town

Don Reno,"I got money, marbles, and chalk sweetheart
   But I still feel like I am poor
   Cause my money won't spend, and my marbles won't roll
   And my chalk won't write anymore

There's an old saying that's been all around
I heard it before I could walk
How some's got wealth, some's got health
Others money marbles and chalk

While you were here I was happy and gay
Your presence made me feel so proud
But you left me, for another one day
Now I feel alone in a crowd

Money, marbles, and chalk is alright
For a miser who loves only gold
But give me a chance, to save our romance
For I love you with all of my soul

Has a wondrous attraction for me;

Its shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where His glory forever I'll share.

Back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an old cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B.Goode
Who'd never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sit beside the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Listen to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people comin' by they would stop and say
Oh my but that little country boy could play
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode

His mama told him someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people come from miles around
To hear you play your music till the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights a sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight
Go go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go go Johnny be Goode

Don Ringuette,"I have often walked
Down the street before,
But the pavement always
Stayed beneath my feet before.
All at once am i
Several stories high,
Knowing I?m on the street where you live.

Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town?
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?
No, it?s just on the street where you live.

And oh, the towering feeling
Just to know somehow you are near
The overpowering feeling
That any second you may suddenly appear.

People stop and stare
They don?t bother me,
For there?s no where else on earth
That I would rather be.

Let the time go by,
I won?t care if i
Can be here on the street where you live.

Oh and the night grows clear and empty as a lake of acid
Rain
And I don't feel your touch again.

Just like a torch, you set the soul within me burning
I must go on, I'm on this road of no returning
And though it burns me and it turns me into ashes
My whole world crashes without your kiss of fire

I can't resist you, what good is there in trying?
What good is there denying you're all that I desire?
Since first I kissed you my heart was yours completely
If I'm a slave, then it's a slave I want to be
Don't pity me, don't pity me

Give me your lips, the lips you only let me borrow
Love me tonight and let the devil take tomorrow

'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be.

I could lay me down and die.

Don Sebesky,"She kinda breezed into town from New Orleans
And said, ""Boys, I'm Big John's Cajun Queen
Now, I didn't come here to argue or waste anybody's time
I just come to get my man from your dirty old mine
'Cause he moves me

Now where you give up's where old Queenie's gonna start
'Cause I got a powerful love in my heart
So just show me the hole way down in the ground
And tell the whole wide world Big John's been found
And he's livin'""

So down in the mine without a sign of a light
Old Queenie went a-lookin' for John that night
She found him there at the bottom of the pit
And placed a red-hot kiss on his cold blue lips
He started breathin' (aah)

She waited a minute and then she kissed him again
And old John got the power of a hundred men
Up he come a-clawin' and a-diggin' like a mole
And said, ""come on Queenie, we're gonna leave this hole""
They started walkin'

Now a roar from the crowd greeted this fine pair
As they both walked out in that cool night air
And up for silence went Big John's hand
And the Queen said, ""I told you I'd get my man
'Cause he moves me""

You can find them today, they're down in New Orleans

They're a little bit wrinkled from the strain of time

She is cold I agree

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

Don Shirley,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings

When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

I'll do my best to make him stay

I know we both won't say a word

Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

Free and bright and gay

Of a half forgotten dream
Seems to glimmer when you hear the third man theme

Once again there comes to mind
Someone that you left behind
Love that somehow didn't last

That rapture so supreme

The Danube nights, the dancing lights again will shine

That screwy, ballyhooey Hollywood
Where any office boy or young mechanic
Can be a panic, with just a good looking pan
Where any barmaid can be a star maid
If she dances with or without a fan
Hooray for Hollywood

Where anyone at all from TV's Lassie
To Monroe's chassis is equally understood
Go out and try your luck, you might be Donald Duck

That phoney, super coney Hollywood
They come from Chillicothes and Padukahs
With their bazookas to get their names up in lights
All armed with photos from local rotos
With their hair in ribbons and legs in tights

But if you think that you can an actor
See Mr. Factor, he'd make a monkey look good
With a half an hour, you'll look like Tyrone Power

Donde tu y yo nos entregamos cuerpo
Y mente y sin razón 

Comenzaste a comportarte 
De manera inusual 
Palabras que pronunciarte 
No teníamos que escuchar 

Tal vez solo fue un error 
Y no fue culpa del amor 
Y por fin me he dado cuenta 
Soy adicto al dolor

Se que con el tiempo harás que todo 
Todo esto sea peor 
Buscare una excusa 
Un motivo 
Encontrare una explicación 
Para estar contigo
Y olvidar que la solución 
No estaba en el castigo 
Y simplemente no alejarnos tu y yo 

Tal vez todo fue un error 
Y no fue culpa del amor 
Y hoy por fin me he dado cuenta

Un amor como el tuyo nunca se olvida 

Mi pasado en soledad fue tristeza y dolor 
El sol a mi ventana nunca llego 
Perdido en un lugar la suerte no ayudo 
Mi adiccion al dolor me llevo hacia el alcohol 

No lo puedo entender 
Ha vuelto a suceder 
Pienso que esto sera distinto 

Yo no estaba acostumbrado a esto 
Y tu, me hiciste cambiar el recuerdo 
Del amor que es mentira, con una sonrisa 
Entraste en mi mente y me cambiaste la vida 
Brillo la esperanza que mi alma tenia 
Un amor como el tuyo nunca se olvida 

Dime, dime que esta historia no tendra un adios 
Que no es un fallido intento de mi corazon 
Quisiera encontrar una nueva ilusion 
Porque no es suficiente el destino gano 

No lo puedo entender 
Ha vuelto a suceder 
Pienso que esto sera distinto 

No lo puedo entender

Don Tetto,"Empiezas a buscar respuestas donde no vas a encontrar 
Mas que palabras suletas que te llevaran a terminar 
Con esto que creaste el dia en que eras uno nada mas 
Y lo tenias todo es suficiente la felicidad 

Que pasa 
Cuando el dia sea muy tarde y ya no puedas regresar 
Para vivir 
Necesitas comprender que hay mucho mas que terminar 
Perdido en un lugar 

Comienzas a recorrer caminos que solo te llevaran 
Al final del destino donde solamente encontraras 
Aquel supuesto amigo quien te mostraria la verdad 
Y ahora deseas menos de ese todo que haz dejado atras 

Ya lo veras no Encontraras 
Lo suficiente",Perdido en un Lugar,2008
Don Tetto,"Aqui vienes una vez mas con tu forma de caminar Tu 
Pelo negro y tu mirar que solo me hacen suspirar 

Tenerte a ti es un imposible Si lo logro sera 
Increible 

Pienso en ti En cada instante en cada momento Tu 
Creas en mi Ese unico sentimiento Quiero ser El 
Dueño de tus pensamientos Sin Saber Soy yo 
El que te ama en silencio 

La otra noche que pase al lado de su casa En esa 
Fiesta de color la distingui en la ventana Entre a 
Su casa, cerveza en mano y un trago de tequila No 
Coordinaba me caia pero hacia ella yo iba 

Y decidi que era correcto Debia decirle lo que 
Siento Me acerque a ella a paso lento Quise 
Congelar el momento 

Me paralice Y las palabras no me salieron Solo 
Me miro Y su mirada me llevo al cielo Me senti 
Mejor Y solo me quedaba sonriendo El miedo me 
Gano Di la vuelta y sali corriendo 

Me dijo vuelve aca y no hagas tantas tonterias 
Dime lo que ibas a decir vamos alegra mi vida 
Desde el momento en que te vi he quedado enamorada 
Ahora me toca a mi decir que es lo que siente mi 
Alma

Don Tetto,"No queda nada por decir,
He mostrado todo lo que hay en ti,
No quiero pensar cual sera tu fin.

Te crees tan tan especial,
Siempre igual a todas las demás,
Nadie te enseño lo que es el amor,
Andas por la vida sin dirección.

Aparentas ser tan buena,
La mitad es pura mierda,
Vive para los demás,
Pero yo se que estas muriendo en soledad...


Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte
Pasaran los días,
Pasan horas,
Pasaran semanas

why tal vez tu sigues igual
Como si nada de esto te importara
(nada de esto te importara)

Sales con él why el es feliz
Tan poco le importa igual que a ti,
Quien lo iba a pensar que seria tu fin.

Se cree tan tan especial,
Gastando el dinero de su papá
Why no sabe de amor,le gusta el reggaeton
Why no vale tres pesos ese cabrón.

Te trata como a una reina,
Sabe para que eres buena,
Viven para los demás
Pero yo se que estas muriendo en soledad...

Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte
Pasaran los días,
Pasan horas,
Pasaran semanas
Why tal vez tu sigues igual
Como si nada de esto te importara
(nada de esto te importara).

Te trata como a una reina,
Sabe para que eres buena,
Viven para los demás
Pero yo se que estas muriendo
Juntos moriran en soledad...

Oh dime cuantas veces lo hiciste
Tan solo por amor why no tan solo para divertirte
Pasaran los días,
Pasan horas,
Pasaran semanas
Why tal vez tu sigues igual

Don Thomas,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2008

Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon

The light of love has gone out, and now your shadow's gone away

Though I've got a son that I barely get to see
I see him for an hour. After that he's gotta leave
On top of that, I only get to see him once a week
Yea, right, lucky me
Well fuck child support and whoever disagrees
I learned a valuable lesson, indeed
But I'm just trying to be the best father I can be
Apparently I'm an unfit father, cause all I know is dope
And all I got is dirty dollars
But I'm selling dope to help my family get farther
Cause no 9 to 5 is gonna prevent us from starving
I'm sorry Jaylin, I don't get to see you like I want to
But I just wanna let you know I want to
If the court grants me visitation, them I'm going to
But you're to young to understand what we're going through
And your mama's low down
She's just doing everything to hurt me right now
Why? Cause I don't love her like I used to
So to get back at me, she knows she's gotta use you
And I don't know what else to do. She don't understand that this shit will bruise you too
And now I gotta take the bitch to court, so either way, it's a lose - lose
I tried talking to the bitch, but she keeps using you as a bargaining chip
And I am not the one to be bargaining with
That just makes me wanna go and put my paws on that bitch
I swear this shit ain't even right bruh
I ain't even got a chance to change your fucking diaper
This is what I get for going raw when I piped her
Thinking that I loved her, when I shouldn't have even like her
But I do not regret my child
Stupid bitch, I just wanna see my child
Do what you may, but you will never make me bow
Fuck child support, bitch take me to trial
Why you with this shit? Cause I ain't read you no vows?
Bitch move on. Me and you ain't working out
So... What's it matter that I moved to work out
'Long as I provide, and put food in his mouth
'Mater fact, I'm in school right now
'case the music don't work and I can put the work down
My momma say this shit sure to work out
All the bullshit I'm going through to see my first child
See his first steps. See his first Smile. Hear his first Words. Teach him how to count
But I guess I've been counted out, seeing as, the bitch don't want me around
When I speak to him, he don't recognize the sound
The sound of my voice, so he just looks around
I know she enjoys it, so I suck it up and smile

Had to call them right back like want a verse or a pound of it
Money (7x)
Yea I kinda like the sound of it
Got a box of bullets ready to touch you pussies
Fuck around and get found bloody
Outchea thugging without a budget
They trying to figure out how I does it
Independent and I’m winning
I was broke before but it been a minute
Spending chicken independent
That’s a rollie so here’s a ticket
Time is money
Can’t spend a second
Second guessing no indecision
My second weapon got extensions
That’s thirty shots
Living life as a thug nigga
That’s word to pac
Grind hard so we stir a lot
Swerving, serving like we never heard of cops
Prefer to handle my business personally
You want this work or not

My money dirty
My hands dirty
Pistol dirty
My whip clean
Bitch with me
We riding dirty
She talk dirty
But her pussy clean
I’m still dirty
I’m still working
I’m still serving
Nigga fuck you mean
My pockets fat
And my temper short
And my clip is longer than a limousine
And I let that bitch come bark at you
Bitch I’m strapped like a dog catcher
The last thing you want is confrontation
Cause I’m with the shit like your gallbladder
30 rounds in that 12 gauge
?????? that’s overkill
I live life in the fastlane
Either catchup or be roadkill
Trap nigga way before the deal
I don’t give a shit about a deal
Bitch I got a plug
I’m a heavy weight with more outlets than the opry mill
Such a flyguy I’m so outta here
I’m so fresh to death I ought to write a will
Got a box of bullets ready to touch you pussies
These hollow points tryna cop a feel
In the trees like a baby panda
Paranoid I’ll spray the hammer
I’m in my house up all night just starring at my surveillance cameras
I’m warning you no warning shots
I’ll pop your ass and you’ll learn your lesson
Stressed out
Still counting money cause that’s best antidepressant
If I thought that I could
Maybe I would
I got a lot of common sense but bitch I’m hood
And I’ve sold dope before I ain’t saying you should
But I’ve been broke before and that never feels good

Don Trip,"Yeah I know right from wrong but can't much tell friend from foe
My homie acting different, ole lady tripping I think she fuckin' us both
I think too much I know, but we been through way to much
Not her, my dog, one of the only people I trust
Told him I had a ring picked out and a tux
We was eating off of the same plug
And I see about any nigga he got beef with cause that's love

I am always get money fuck des hoes from the start
Now he say he boutta throw it all away for this broad
Fuck he mean, must be out his mind
He to focused on the pussy should be focused on the grind
Don't he know one slip of the lip'll have us both doing time
Say my nigga bugg'n out and he don't recognize the signs

I remember jumping out I was next to him firing
I ain't have nothing to do with that shit
But I was riding like that shit was mine
Everything I jeopardize, Jeffery Dahmer inside
How it's eating me alive, if I was weaker I'd cried
I wanna look him in the eye just to see if he a lie
But I leave it be and be quiet you know me and my pride

From the bottom we came that's my brother I swear
And you'll have me at your throat if you dare touch a hair
But it feel like something ain't right
Like he ain't all the way there
It feel like something done changed it bothers me cause I care
Now he might be actin funny bout that bitch real shit
Say he think shes a angel I think she with the shit
I don't trust that ho, fuck that ho, why he go and love her fo
If the truth was medicine I think he need a double dose
How we go from balling screaming money over bitches
Now he taking care of hoes got 'em all up in our business
Fuck is up

Fucked us up

I got money on my mind
I know that's my nigga but if he fuck this mission up
Then I gotta get him touched
I hate it but lately he been loafing, he too caught in his emotions
Put his faith in that bitch when they ho ain't worth a token
We not seeing eye to eye it ain't over til it's over
And the way this shit been going look like I'm gon have to smoke 'em
(What the fuck)

On the low I been unfocused I'm just hope no one notices
Tryna play my cards right but things got wild as the joker is
The things I love I'll kill for call my bluff with no poker chips
Got this chip on my shoulder which
Brings me to this lick im bouta hit
Knew him since we was kids everything we got we split
But when the sack hit then it's over with

Ride or die like a motorist
Now I'm on some solo shit
The plug say we cop 'em as a team or ain't no more bricks
Fuck it, talk him in to moving on this last sack
Soon as we go pick it up we hit the cut ""bla bla""
Im just trynna eat this is how it gotta be
Turned his back on all this money for a bitch I use to freak

Need a bed time story to read before I put this nigga to sleep
Ask her if he every tried her and I know she wouldn't lie to me
She just said I shouldn't trust him never said she didn't fuck em
I'mma catch him when he bring his money step to him and flush him
And it's nothing, blood money spent faster I just laugh
Its everything I love is in the past
And everything I love don't seem to last
I shouldn't have even asked
Cross him out and blame it on the cash, blood on my sleeve, brain on the dash
Dome him quick fast dont forget the bag
Hurry home to my honey my other homie hitting that (fuck is up)

Step Brothers

They shooting up movies
They shooting up schools
Young black fools
Ain’t the only ones that suit up with tools
Exercising my 2nd amendment and pleading the fifth
With A fifth
This my second this Remy
I drink, I don’t sip
And the reason is this
It’s fucked up out here
So we out here fucked up
If you make it out then you lucked up
Trying to save ourselves coming from
What we raised ourselves
Stuck between a rock and a hard place with the razor and scale
Turn wine back to grapes and it's raising hell
Breaking down bales
Just to make bail
Catching sells off a cell until you in a cell
I’m just trying to prevail
But only time will tell
Well, niggas telling over time
It ain’t no telling
I ain’t lying
Ain’t trying to go out like my homies did
I keep that on me and I put that on my homies kid
Wonder if I gonna be missed
If I did a lonely bid
Got homies in the pen who only focus keeping a phone hid

I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hope the seat belt right though
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to god I get a leash on life
Leash on tight
Only right that we know
And please don’t judge us for the path we chose
Looking up to heaven; no one sending me signs
Only if this was a movie I would press the rewind

He got that strap in his bag
See he get bullied at school
Young nigga shot dead in his class
He put his school on the news
Now put yourself in his shoes
Walking away didn’t help
He got no friends to defend him
He got to fend for his self
And he to skinny to fight
Running away just ain’t cutting it
His daddy ain’t home
His momma still struggling
She juggle three jobs
And get no help from the government
You don’t know nothing about him
But you trying to sucker him
Heart of a giant
I’m sorry he will never back down
And they gonna keep pick on him till one day he blacks out
And reach in that book bag and he pull that mag out
Now he get the last laugh and you’re just the class clown
Tool on deck
Yes I can’t help that
When momma was stressing
I hit my block like a tailback
See we trying to make it don’t got no suits
Just got cases
And I need more than this dope money to leave to my babies

I respect the time I keep my sneaks on tight
Head-on collision hope seat belt right though
Might be locked up tomorrow but we free tonight
Praying to god I get a leash on life
Leash on tight
Only right we know
And please don’t judge us for the path we chose

Paper, rock, scissors
Step brothers

Last time I checked, I deposit it
Teller tell you that it's obvious
That I’m getting lot's of it
I’m bossed up
I swear it cost so much that's why it cost to even talk to us (yea)
Make sure you get your offer up
Anything I do, I do it all for of us
Got a family that’s depending on me
I’m gambling or I’m spending some of it
All my niggas stay in to something
Got a short fuse that extended on me

Still sleeping on us
You’re in a coma
Don’t believe me
Just wait a moment
My brain cells got paper on them
This 40 glock got a laser on it
Gun you down, spray you up
Balling out, not laying up
Thumb it through, with no paper cuts
If your money talk, it ain’t saying much
My momma thinks I’m a loss cause
Fully automatic, fuck a guard dog
I rock G-shock, no Audemar but I’m still flashy as a cop car
In the grass like a lawn dwarf
Star, I got ya back like a lumbar

Okay, pour a deuce
Pop 1 bar, I’m gone but I ain’t going far
My driver need to be designated
She give me brain
Free education
They pass me bills with no legislation
Going back to Cali
My weed medicated
Keep asking me like everyday
Wassup with that stepbrothers
They either respect it or love it
Now we do it for the check of it
Woke up and said fuck it
Bout to open up my next budget

Now watch how our checks double
A nigga got drive like a lex bubble
Fuck you, pay up no discussion
Ride through the city with a toaster oven
Rob the game like it owe me something
Bruh, I’m going in keep the motor running
My bitch blowing like Etta James
In my truck I got mary jane
Feeling lucky no horseshoe but I run this shit like Edgerrin James
Neva changed, go figure
My brother faded like old pictures
We are not the same see the big difference is you’re softer than a roll of tissue
I know these rappers so frightened cause we handle bars like bicycle
I had to bring them so nice with it that my ink pen drip ice sickles

As soon as I finish rolling up this blunt, I’ll get right with you
So accurate with the heat, I feel like Mike Miller
The fn my lil light pistol shoot chopper bullets look like missiles
And more money and more white bitches that follow order I’m high Hitler
Eastside guerrilla I throw it up like a coin liquor
My money tall but I’m a short nigga
Got so much game I need a sports ticker
Of course nigga we killing this shit
Call the mortician we still in this bitch
As real as it gets I been dealing with splits no divorce nigga
Grind hard no choice nigga
I’m a underdog no forfeiting
Just me her and no intermission
She catch more kids than an orphanage
Live everyday like it's 420
I’m disoriented like the orientals
Had the cookies in the plastic no fortunes in it
No chorus but it’s going on like 4 minutes
Fuck it, Trip go and end it
Bout my commas like a run on sentence
I know I’m a trip no pun intended
Life’s a bitch, you keep playing with it till me and death come pay a visit
And my bullets are like jury duty, in other words anyone can get it
I slap your bitch with my magic stick and treat that bitch like a sack of shit
Dry your eyes, it’s a crying shame but I ball harder than catchers mitt
I’m sitting phat your majesty
I’m getting blowed like allergies
I grind hard no acid grease
I’m flipping pounds like balance beams

Step brothers

All them whips and them chains that you slaved for
When it was all said and done, you should've saved more
I'm worth less in the jail than in the graveyard
Heard I'm too black to play the race card

I wouldn't conform, so the label hit the panic button
You know they can't stand a nigga' when you stand for something
I do what I want when I want, I never had a budget
And I don't answer to not a soul, so don't ask me nothin'
They offered me a mansion and a Lamborghini
Where you been? I've got babies, ain't no way to feed 'em, off no per diem
I hear family this, and we the best, and it's a movie
Meanwhile, they in the office tryna' stick it to me
I told 'em fuck 'em, I'm buckin', you can't do shit but sue me
I get paid cash anyway, so don't misconstrue it
I'll gladly go back to pitchin', I don't give a shit
Got out my deal then I got rich, independence is the shit (Godspeed)

Granny just work, pay bills, never been on vacation
You shoot a jumper or you get a second rate education
Underground, I fuck around, never get played on the station
But that's okay, I tell the truth, the only way I feel free
They killed my favorite rapper Pac for that, hope they don't kill me
They pull me over, I go to court, then they gon' say I'm guilty
Even when all your money clean, they make you pay a lil' fee
What if instead of prison sentences, they gave us degrees
Ain't it ironic that they lock us up for playing with keys
Save your receipts cause freedom ain't free, and lawyers ain't cheap
And I know, I got court on the 18th

We're just addicted to our cellphones and brand names
I prolly' look just like a slave with all these damn chains
And Trip got so many whips, you'd think he got caught tryna' escape

They prolly' wanna chop my feet off for Kunta's sake
But I hop out that bitch and spray like I'm fumigating
And all I see is dollar signs, no hallucinations
I promise to leave my fuckin' mark like a used eraser
And I'm like fuck the world until I come again
I'm 'bout to buy some mo' guns and wait for Trump to win

Man, wish I can buy some mo' time for a bunch of my friends in the pen
They watching how you move, who you with, what you spend
You a felon, you ain't tryna' see that judge again
And you can't take this shit to trial cause they gon' rub it in

Damn it man, got too much pride to do the running man

And kill 'em all for my dog like Son of Sam

Don Walser,"Now, listen while I tell you 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn grows
Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom shines
Civilized people live there alright
But they all go native on a Saturday Night

Their music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit jar
They do the boogie to an old square dance
The woods are full of couples lookin' for romance
Somebody takes his brogue and knocks out the light
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellah packs a gun
Ev'rybody does his best to act just right
Cause there's gonna be a funeral if you start a fight
They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight
Yes, they all go native on a Saturday night

Don Walser,"How many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

How many lips have kissed you
And set your soul aglow
How many, how many I wonder
But I really don't want to know

So always make me wonder
Always make me guess
And even if I ask you darling
Don't confess

Just let it remain me and your secret
But darling I love you so
No wonder, no wonder I wonder
No, I really don't want to know

A little place called hamburger dan's
I put a quarter in the jukebox

I thanked her and called her back again
I said this song sure does fit me

Don Walser,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart

Whenever he walks through your mind
Stirring up memories that cloud up your eyes
Where the light of our love ought to shine

He must have been going insane

When somebody mentions his name

He's just a ghost story so don't let him scare you
He's not really there like he seems
And tonight when I hold you I'll hold you so close
I'll love him right out of your dreams

I know that he's called you
And told you that our love can't last
But don't you believe him cause honey he's wrong
He's never been right in the past

So don't let him haunt you and tell you those lies
He just can't admit that you're free
And the next time he calls you just hand me the phone
And see if he says it to me

He's just a ghost story so don't let him scare you
He's not really there like he seems
And tonight when I hold you I'll hold you so close
I'll love him right out of your dreams

He's just a ghost story so don't let him scare you

Don Williams,"Silver coins that jingle jangle
Fancy shoes that dance in time
Oh the secrets of her dark eyes,
They did sing a gypsy rhyme

Yellow clover in tangled blossoms
In a meadow silky green
Where she held me to her bosom,
Just a boy of seventeen

I recall a gypsy woman
Silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight
And the taste of life’s sweet wine

Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
And stir the darkness in my mind
Oh gentle woman you sleep beside me
Little know who haunts my mind

Gypsy lady I hear your laughter
And it dances in my head
While my tender wife and babies
Slumber softly in their beds",I Recall a Gypsy Woman,1975
Don Williams,"She's a barmaid in a west Texas dance hall

And the lines in her face say it all
But she still is a beautiful woman
In the lights of the Texas dance hall

But she won't sit down at your table
And I know that you can't hold her hand
She won't go home with you cowboy
She's in love with a rodeo man

I'm looking for something that'll last me all of my life
I'm listening for the sound

I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness
Every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness
Next to mine

A woman trying to find a diamond mine
Ain't my kind, she ain't no use to me
A big estate with a wrought-iron gate
A mansion on the hill, ain't where I wanna be

You see without love a house ain't a home
A diamond ain't no more than a stone in the ground
I'd give every material thing I own in this life

You say you think the change will do you good
If you feel that way well I guess it would
I can live my life without you
I've got places to go and things to do

But I'll never be in love again
My poor old heart will never mend

Don Williams,"Some people say that love is a rose - and maybe they've hit
It right on the nose
But other folks say that it's like the sun
Well a long time ago daddy said to me 'son I'll help clear
Up the mystery - I'll give you a simple rule of thumb'

If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

Now the dictionary won't tell you much - if love is the word
You're lookin' up
No I don't believe that definition's right
And the encyclopedia won't reveal the crazy way you start
To feel - kissin' on a moonlit summer night cause

If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

So go on and say that love is a game - or maybe compare it
To a flame
Or say it's a medicine that heals
'cause a panel of experts could fight all night - and never
figure out which one is right
but they'd agree on how it makes you feel

If it knocks you off your feet - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your life complete - then it's love - then it's love
If it turns you upside down - then it's love - then it's love
If it makes your world go round then it's love

Yeah if it makes your world go round - then it's love

I'm back on the road
Sometimes I don't know
It's hard to make good sense of it all

When I have to roam
My mind's back at home

But we're doing well
Somehow I can tell
I really don't know
It's something I feel

'cause we've been making it strong
Each day right along
Though we both hate being alone

We're still in tune
There's good loving
Midnight or noon

It's gotta be magic
I know it's true
'cause it's still working

We keep on wondering why
Though we both know it just has to be

Oh but honey the road
Can get to be such a load
You're all that helps me make it I know

Walk and talk, holdin' hands
We said we love each other I recall
We made a lot of future plans

But the years have come and gone
And a whole lot has happened since then
But tonight your memory's awful strong on my mind
And I would like to see you again

It'll come on back, make you blue
Cause I just saw a picture in my mind
Bout a time, of me and you",I Would Like to See You Again,1978
Don Williams,"First I get cold, then hot
Think I'm on fire, but I'm not
Oh, what a pain I've got
It must be love

There's nothing I can do
All that I want is you
Look what I'm going through
It must be love

It must be love, it must be love
I fall like a sparrow, fly like a dove
You must be the dream, I've been dreamin' of
Oh what a feeling, it must be love

Something is wrong alright
I think of you all night

Holding you close to me

Love me and hide me 
Kiss all the hurtin' of this world away
Hold me so close that I feel your heartbeat
And don't ever wander away

And there was no music till I heard your name
But I knew when I saw you smile
Now I can rest for awhile",Lay Down Beside Me,1978
Don Williams,"Oh, If you could only see me
In the day or in the night
Maybe then you would believe me
When I say every thing's alright

Have I told you if you leave me
Winter, summer, spring or fall
I could never love another
It's you and me or none at all?

I'll never smile again
Not me, I'll never dance
I'll never love again
Not me, not a chance

I don't think I'd get up tight now
'Bout this life I live alone
And everything would be alright now
When you just bring it on back home

'Cause I'll never smile again
Not me, I'll never dance
I'll never love again
Not me, not a chance

I'll never smile again
Not me, I'll never dance
I'll never love again

Needing someone and nobody's there. 

These are the things broken dreams are made of, Lord they're everywhere.

Another nightime that just never ends. 
A helpless longing for what might have been. 
Another morning to face all alone.

I wonder what I'd write
Cause of all the words there are to use

And some new words too
But my nights are never blue
And I don't mind the rain when I'm with you

Makes it harder to fight

I don't even remember
How many battles you've won

There's one that follows me around
It may sound funny
But somehow it only rains on me

It follows me almost everywhere
And it seems it's hardly fair
People will stop and people stare
But it only rains on me

Broken dreams and drowned parades
Lovers who just slip away
Guess I learn to live that way
It only rains on me

Seems to me there was a time
It used to rain on friends of mine
Now I look around and find
It only rains on me

I'll bet this won't hurt you much
You'll find someone soon enough
I'm the one that loses in love

I think I'm gonna drown

Right from the start I saw you
And couldn't resist you

Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat.
Your temperature's too hot for taming,
Your flaming feet burn up the street.
I am homeless, come and take me
Into reach of your rattling drums.
Let me know, babe, about my fortune
Down along my restless palms.

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed.
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast an' slashing,
An' your flashing diamond teeth.
The night is pitch black, come an' make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I got to know, babe,
If it's you my lifelines trace.

I been wond'rin' all about me
Ever since I seen you there.
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I'm riding,
I know I'm 'round you but I don't know where.
You have slayed me, you have made me,
I got to laugh halfways off my heels.
I got to know, babe, will I be touching you
So I can tell if I'm really real.

I have seen this old, cold world go gold and silver crazy.
Some people live to fill their pocket and it never seizes to amaze me.
If money can buy them happiness, that o'right for them I guess.
Money sure can buy a lot, but it can't buy what I've got.

CHORUS:
I'll take your love at anytime baby
It's solid as a rock, bigger than the sky
I'll take your love at anytime baby
I know it will be there as time goes by

This thing between a man and woman beats anything else going
Talk of fortune and talk about fame
It sounds nice is the way to tame

And they only get finer as each day goes on
We've been through some bad times but we made it somehow

With the cool blue mountain air.

I can understand your wanderlust.

Its refrigerator or bust.
I ain't got no words for going,
I got no longing for your open road.
Don't get found rollin' into town tugging on a heavy load.
You've gotta give me the nights with the city lights, and the people buzzin' everywhere.

Like notches on the butt of a gun

And a reputation all over town

Then I met you and the next thing I knew, there I was

Could take a desperado like me

With my bleeding heart there at your feet

You, You got me
We got somethin' everybody else can see
Me, I got you
We got a good thing honey you know we do

Friends, they all know
'cause we can't help but let it show
Smiles, we can't hide
We got somethin' just too good to hold inside

We don't need no money, honey you and I
What we've got together, money just can't buy
What we've got, there's plenty of
I've got you, you've got me, we got love.

And honey we just keep on a keepin' on

As long as we've got love, We can't go wrong

Don Williams,"I've been lonesome,
I've been empty
I got an achin',
Way down inside
I need someone,
Someone to hold me
Pull down the shade,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.

I need you so now
Come on let's go now
Kick off your shoes,
Turn out the light
And love me tonight.

Now don't you worry
We're all alone now
Let your hair down
Sit by my side
Turn off the T.V.
Put on some music
Pull down the shade
Turn out the light
And love me tonight

Don't think about tomorrow
It don't matter any more
We can turn the key
And lock the world outside the door.

Turn out the light
And love me tonight",(Turn Out the Light And) Love Me Tonight,1987
Don Williams,"I've held it all inward
Lord knows I've tried
It's an awful awakenin'
In a country boy's life
When you look in the mirror
In total surprise
At the hair on your shoulders
And the age in your eyes.

Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife.

Well the measure of people
Don't understand
The pleasures of life
In a hillbilly band
I got my first guitar
When I was fourteen
Now I'm crowding thirty
And still wearin' jeans.

Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife
Amanda light of my life
Fate should have made you a gentle man's wife.",Amanda,1987
Don Williams,"I been walking, walking in the moonlight
Tripping in the starlight, Lord and I'm feeling down
Walking in the shadows, sneaking down a side road
Come early morning I'll be there on the edge of town

I was a thinking, thinking about a good thing
Thinking bout a sweet dream, in my honey's eyes
And I was a sinking', feeling kind of lonesome
Come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side

I have drifted up across the mountain
And I have stumbled down the other side
And I've been tempted, tried and troubled
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied

She give me little loving, gives me little sunshine
Makes me have a good time, Lord when I'm feeling' blue
I couldn't refuse her, well I couldn't misuse her
Come early morning I'll be home with my honey dew",Come Early Morning,1987
Don Williams,"When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he'd stagger a little as he went out the door

[Chorus]
I can still hear the soft Southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me
Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me

Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was
The smell of cape jasmine through the window screen
John R. and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head

When I was in school I ran with kid down the street
But I watched him burn himself up on bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o'clock news
When I was eighteen, Lord, I hit the road
But it really doesn't matter how far I go",Good Ole Boys Like Me,1987
Don Williams,"I don't believe in superstars
Organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold

That north and south can't get along
That east is east and west is west
And being first is always best

But I believe in love, I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad, and I believe in you

Well I don't believe that heaven waits
For only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, He's up above
He's watching people everywhere
He knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man
Sometimes I wonder who I am

But I believe in love, I believe in music
I believe in magic, and I believe in you

I know with all my certainty what's goin'
With you and me is a good thing
It's true, I believe in you

I don't believe virginity 
Is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights
That black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood
Are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply
The rising cost of getting by

But I believe in love, I believe in old folks
I believe in children, I believe in you

I believe in love, I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad
And I believe in you",I Believe in You,1987

So I gave up and decided that I'd call

Things back here they never change at all
It snowed today, it's cold here for November
But I hear the weather's warm out there

Oh, and if you see Burt Reynolds would you shake his hand for me
And tell ol' Burt I've seen all his movies
Well, I hope you make for big time, I hope your dreams come true
But if Hollywood don't need you, honey, I still do

Last night I drove the truck to Amarillo
Some friends and I we had a laugh or two
But lately we don't cut up like we used to
'Cause all that I can think about is you
I know this is what you've always wanted
But I know now that all I want is you

Gotta get home to my loving honey
She'll be there waiting, waiting impatiently
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Usually I meet with the boys of Friday
Only this morning she said this is my day
The look she gave me sent a shiver down into my soul
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
Our love is on a roll, our love is on a good roll
I'm a songwriter a professional dreamer
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer
I should know if anybody knows at all
When love is on a roll, love is on a good roll
So I gotta go, I gotta get home early
Be with my woman, soft and curvy
Makes me feel like a king and not a regular Joe

Take me away from where I have been.
I know you love me,
But love me over again.

You have the way of filling my emotions
Till there's not a word left in my mind.
Times get so hard, so confusing

And up in the attic there are papers that prove the old house is finally his
After thirty five years the grass still don't grow in that rock hard west Texas ground
Where my old dad still clings to that old coyote town
Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name

Where the old men rock as the tumbleweeds roll
Pass the boarded up windows down Main
Waist high weeds hide a forsale sign at the drive-in where my innocence died
With a rusty advertisement dangling by a nail says popcorn and pepsi for a dime

And down at the depot where I left for good
There's a hobo and his three legged hound
Waitin' for a train that no longer comes to that old coyote town

And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don't ever slow down
As cars and trucks and time pass by that old coyote town
Daddy falls asleep in the living room on the sofa with the TV on

Sometimes he waits for a phone call from me sometimes he waits too long
But I still think of people and the place that he loves
How much longer will they be around
'Til it's aches to aches dust to dust for that old coyote town

Like horses the pickups are parked out in front of a cafe that don't need a name

You keep me going when my dreams have stalled
And you're always building bridges even when I'm building walls

Sometimes I come home bragging bout the things I've done that day
Like a thing that I'm on top and cannot fall
And when I'm high on my successes thinking only of myself

And sportin' miss Rita back by is side.  And he sang...

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime
 
Eddie traveled with the barroom bands till arthritis took his hands
Now he sells insurance on the side
Rita's got a house to keep, dimestore novels and a love so sweet
They dance to the radio late at night.  And they sing:

Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
Dance a little closer tonight
Dance a little closer to me, hey it's closing time
And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
She really made the Woolworth counter shine
Eddie was a sweet romancer, and a darn good dancer
And they'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime...

Don Williams,"I've never had a face you'd notice
The world never took much notice of me
I've never been good at conversation
I was too busy tripping on my own feet

I've never had grand illusions
Love was always for someone else
But in a world so few surprises
There's still a few surprises left

Ain't it amazing that miracles happen?
Ain't it amazing, you can still find your dream?
Ain't it amazing, it all comes true
When someone like you can happen to someone like me?

So hold me now so warm beside you
Let me stay forever near
Sometimes I think I'm only dreaming
But I wake up, you're still here
",Ain't It Amazing,1990
Don Williams,"I should take my time, I know, take it easy, take it slow
Every heartache needs to mend, before you love again
So I hold on for awhile and try to keep this old heart free
And then I look across a room and someone smiles at me

[Chorus]
Oh and heaven help me here I go again
Before I've even had the time for this old heart to mend
Oh I just get over one heartache and then
Here I go, like a fool, falling again

People tell me take your time, wait awhile and clear your mind
Give yourself some time to heal, If you fall be sure it's real
But it seems that every time, I'm almost on my feet
Someone makes me say hello, someone on the street

[Chorus]",Falling Again,1990
Don Williams,"I keep your picture on my dresser
I keep your pillow on the bed
I keep believing you still love me
I keep saying, you'll come back again

I keep a light on in the window
I keep it burning day and night
I keep saying didn't mean it
When you said goodbye

Oh, I keep putting off getting over you
'Cause that would be too hard to ever do
I just can't believe you and I are through
So I keep putting off getting over you

I know you told me to forget you
Said, ""Go and find me someone else""
But I keep saying you're going to come back
So I keep living all by myself

Oh, I keep putting off getting over you
'Cause that would be too hard to ever do
I just can't believe you and I are through
So I keep putting off getting over you

Must have been something I said
We had some words, she said some things
I guess I must have lost my head

And I can't go on this way
I'll call her up and swallow my pride
When she says hello I'll say

I... want you back again
Oooohhhh what a fool I've been
I... won't do that again
My tears won't stop and my heart won't mend
I want you back again

So I gather up all of my courage
And I found my last dime
I need it so , but God only knows
If we can make up this time

I tremble as I dial her number
Ohh I hope I'm not to late
I say it's me, and I hold my breath
And softly I hear her say

There's many a land I have to see
And when I'm far away in a land of strangers
I know my good friends think on me

It's good to see you, so good to see you
Oh, how I've missed you since I've been gone
'Cause I've crossed the ocean, traveled through many lands
And it's good to see you, to be in your home

Oh, it's a wonder when it comes to friendship

There's a constant thread that's never broken
And it ties me to, my friends at home

Don Williams,"It's hard to hide a lingering disappointment
But most of the time I wear it well
But there are times when I just can't help remembering
The night you left, that rainy night when my whole future fell

Rainy nights and memories go together
And with every drop of rain I feel the pain
I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rain

The blowing wind that moans outside my window
Seems to echo the closing of a door
For it was then I first realized, I had heard your last goodbye
And my whole world went crumbling to the floor

And with every drop of rain I feel the pain
I can almost hear my pleading, on the night you were leaving
But I might have well have tried to stop the rain

Don Williams,"YOU GET TO ME
WRITER DON WILLIAMS

You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.

Night after night I've tried holding you tight and then I'll stay away.
I've tried holding your hand, being your man and just anyway.
When it comes down to feelings it's always the same old song ,
My poor hearts just reeling but you act like something's wrong.

Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.

If I could cry, bring a tear to your eye, maybe that's the way.
'Cause were in the strains of living your pains from yesterday.
Really got to keep on growing, looking for the brighter day.
Like the water that keeps on flowing well I just can't stay away.

You get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.
Oh you get to me and it's been plain enough to see that you get to me,
You just can't believe how you get to me.

There was mist on the creek 
While the cigarette's smoked
And when the sun rose up and burned off the cold
The smoke turned to silver and then turned to gold

That's what it does with a kiss
I'm not the man that I just was 
Love don't get deeper than this

When I was young and my daddy was gone 
I'd go to sleep with the radio on
And sometimes they'd played such a beautiful song
Me and the sandman would sing all night long
Darlin' that's just what your love does 
When you just whispered my name
I'm not the man that I just was 
Nothing about me's the same

Darlin' by this time tomorrow 
There's no telling who I might be
Your love just keep changin' me
And I've come to think that 
The heart's like a kite
And in the best breeze 
It still cannot take flight

It runs like a river between a woman and man
But it's course can get twisted 
It's bed can run dry

And a heart become desert in the wink of an eye
Once there was loving once there was trust
Once it was honest and open and just
Our love was a diamond that grew between us

But time can turn even diamonds to dust
Diamonds to dust oh diamonds to dust 
Time can turn even diamonds to dust

Uh huh uh huh
Time is a teacher it's kind and it's cruel
It gives you the wisdom to see you're a fool
And it gives love and takes love 

It hurts and it heals
And it never parts easy with the truth it reveals

And all that I found was a dead end street

Treated underhanded by everyone I meet

Remembering when, whoa, whoa, remembering when

I remember a time when I thought the world was mine
The world belongs to somebody else now

People telling me I should be someone
And the things I?d learnt were forgotten in my haste
Till I reached the end of the rainbow I had chased

It was only water shining in thin air
I put out my hand and there was nothing there
After all the promise, after all the prayer
It was only water shining in the air

Now I've got a wife and she sees me through
And I've got a friend I can talk straight to
And I've got some dreams just a bit more down to earth
And I don't forget what a rainbow's really worth

'Cause it?s only water shining in the air
I put out my hand and there was nothing there
After all the promise, after all the prayer

Then you just be my guest
If you want to pay those dues

And I'm an ordinary man,
Sometimes I wonder who I am.

If I wait for cloudy skies
You won't know the rain from the tears in my eyes
You'll never know that I still love you
So though the heartaches remain
I'll do my crying in the rain

Raindrops falling from heaven
Will never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I'll wait for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see

I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool

Album: Flatland

Give me too many bad signs,
I'll be gone and I can tell you why
Right or wrong that's just the way I am
I'm not looking for sympathy, we either do or we don't agree
All I need to know is where I stand

So it's comin' right down to you,
I wanna stay.if you want me to
But I don't wanna waste your time,
So I don't want you wastin' mine

When the sun's sinkin' low, I get so restless
Should I stay or go, that is the question
I really need to feel that you'll never
Leave me alone, maybe that's all I really need to know

Maybe I get too impatient, when I sense your reservations
I guess I'm, just scared you'll say goodbye
'cause I would hope I've let you know what it's like inside your love
I pray it lasts for more than just awhile

So it's time to make up your mind either way I will survive
Not knowing is enough for me to ride away
With a broken dream

When the sun's sinkin' low, I get so restless
Should I stay or go, that is the question
I really need to feel that you'll never
Leave me alone, maybe that's all I really need to know

Are you only sleepin to wake another day
Shadowland, Oh how could I have loved you
I never really knew you, anyway

Mama asked Jesus to keep Daddy home at night
I guess it was a pity, but Jesus never did it

Nights like that you could smell salt water on the wind

So we'd play a game he made up
And stay out a little later

Don Williams,"I thought I'd be an angel
And fly on astral skies
I thought I'd wear a fanciful disguise
And It's taken me a lotta time
To find out I'm not one
An outlaw on the run,
On this side of the sun.

I hoped I'd be a champion
And live without a care
I thought I'd change the world,
Make it just and fair
But my youth slipped by before my eyes
Much to my surprise
Before I had begun,
On this side of the sun.

Out on this end of the wind
Winter's coming 'round the bend
You pray for rain, before you know,
You're standin' in a foot of snow
So you pull your coat up to your chin
Pick your shovel up again
'Cause your work is never done,
On this side of the sun.

I took it to a fortune teller
I thought that she might help me
She looked into my eyes
And smiled mysteriously
But she didn't know as much as me
I stared back, dejectedly
'Cause I know where she's from,
This side of the sun.

Out behind these prison walls,
Dark clouds come and hard rains fall
You pause a moment for a dream,
They row you gently down the stream
You wake up angry in the night,
Jump up, ready for the fight
But the war is never won
On this side of the sun.

Now they tell me music
Can free a person's soul
So I sing a song everywhere I go
But It's not much different than before
I'm still looking for the door
I wonder if there is one,
On this side of the sun...",This Side of the Sun,1996
Don Williams,"Today we laid old man Pate to rest
His big hands folded across his chest
God rest his soul just two days ago
He was in his yard waving to me

As I stood by his grave the impression was strong
One minute we're here and the next we're gone
And with each breath of life that is given to us
We should only have time for love

So tell me what can be gained by fussing and fighting
The answer is left up to us
I think it's time we learned enough is enough
Oh we should only have time for love

Sometimes I'm unwilling to open my eyes
Just too stubborn to compromise
When you stand your ground oh there's no backing down
That makes for a long bitter fight

And you know it's such a waste to engage in that
Tearing each other down in a tit for tat
When we could be hard at work building a trust
Oh we should only have time for love

Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around.
Traced her footsteps down to the shore;
Afraid she's gone forever more.

I looked at the sea and it seemed to say:
I took your baby from you, away.
I heard a voice crying in the deep:
Come join me baby, in my endless sleep.

Why did we quarrel, why did we fight?
Why did I leave her alone tonight?
That's why her footsteps ran into the sea;
That's why my baby is gone from me.

I took your baby from you, away.
I heard a voice crying in the deep:

Reached for my baby, held her to me.
Stole her back from the endless sleep.

Had some coffee and talked with some old friends of mine
Laughing at the good times they remembered
Then I remembered a time

She made me feel like I wasn't wanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave

I caught her out one Sunday morning
With a man they call big Dave
He's the meanest man in the state of Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave

I said, ""you'll pay, both you and David.
I'm gonna see you in your grave.""
They laughed at me, and then I shot 'em
I took their cheating, scheming bones to Miller's Cave

A little ever day 'til I had enough""
Before he could finished she said, ""You know I will, baby""

WRITERS LEN HANDLER, A.J. GUNDELL

Harry and Joe move south with their wives
Enjoying the golden years of their lives
But life doesn't always give back what it owes
Suddenly there was just Harry and Joe

Now Joe'd been a teacher gentile and calm
Harry, a teamster with a fuse like a bomb
Thrown in together by life's crazy whims
That pepper and salt like their unshaven chins

CHORUS:
Harry and Joe lean to and fro
They lean on each other wherever they go
Two lonely fighters doing all that they know
To get through each day Harry and Joe

Harry and Joe, cheating at cards
In a Florida apartment that smells like cigars
They brag about grand kids and the wives they love so
In the late afternoons of Harry and Joe



An ambulance siren from across the backyard
Joe looks at Harry and deals out the cards

Harry and Joe lean to and fro
Like they lean on each other wherever they go
What tomorrow may deal them there's no way to know
So they get through today Harry and Joe
They get through each day Harry and Joe

Well, I've got this place of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard, got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh, there’s something 'bout you

Somethin' about you like distant thunder
And I can’t say I ain't been warned
But there’s no shelter to crawl under
Ever gonna save me from this storm

Oh, there’s something 'bout you
That I can't shake
There's somethin' 'bout you
That's been keeping me awake
The whole night through
Oh, there’s something 'bout you

Well, I've got this life of mine
It's nice and quiet and I like it fine
I work real hard, got no time for you
But I've whiskied up my coffee cup
Sittin' here tryin' not to call you up
It's gettin' to where I don't know what to do
Oh, there’s something 'bout you
Babe, something 'bout you

Don Williams,"There's two hundred people pushin' up daisies
In the graveyard out back of the old Baptist church
There were some schemers. some sinners and dreamers 
and not one died wishin' they spent more time at work

[Chorus:]
Take it easy on yourself 
The world will keep turnin' 
with out any help 
I love you better than anyone else 
Take it easy on yourself 
Leave all the old tears, the good times and lost years 
The guilt and the heartache right where they are 
I got no hard lesson just love without question
So right now just lay down in these open arms

Clouds, clouds have covered up the sun again
Makes me wonder why I ever tryyyy

Moon, moon tonight as bright as it can be
Stars,please tell the moon don't shine like that for me
Makes me think of how it used to be

Oh heart what made you think you could be the one
To laugh and run with her beneath the sun
And to feel that two could be the same as one
And to never tell a lie or be told one

Love, lovin pages turn early to seed 
Will, will anything life be left for me
Or is our future history, history

Oh heart what made you think you could be the one
To laugh and run with her beneath the sun
And to feel that two could be the same as one

Don Williams,"Pretty little baby, lying in a manger
Staring at the strangers, who've come so many miles
They were told to follow the star up in the heavens
And it brought them to the stable of the little baby child
Could this be the kingdom of the high and mighty
Is this the ruler, born here tonight
Should we lay our treasures, here by the cradle
Oh you must be the Savior, pretty little baby child
Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things
They knew when they knelt there beside him
They were looking in the eyes of a king
And that his tiny little fingers would bring us together
For ever and ever, pretty little baby child
Wonder of wonders, there in the darkness
The light of the promise, how it shines from his eyes
The angels were singing the hallelujah chorus
To the Savior before us. Pretty little baby child
Sometimes the greatest of miracles
Come from the smallest of things

Don Williams,"Back in my younger days I used to go all night long
Now I just stay at home and everything is all right
Back when I first met you I used to live in a haze
But that was so long ago back in my younger days
I would do anything just to stumble and fool
It's a wonder I'm standing here I've broken so many rules
Now I dance with you every night and still I'm amazed
Your love made a man of me back in my younger days
Oh it doesn't seem that long ago
You you make it feel like the first time we made love
And I ain't even gettin' enough well well well

As I go through the photographs I laugh and turn the page
It's the ballad of me and you from such an innocent age
Talk about a dream come true we reinvented the phrase

It's better than it used to be back in my younger days",Back in My Younger Days,2000
Don Williams,"Well I was raised up by the golden rule
In an old house with a patched up roof
We had a hard home but it pulled us close
We were family

Oh that summer when the crops all died
Was the first time I saw Daddy cry
An' I heard Momma say what goes on here stays
In the family

[CHORUS:]
Well our clothes weren't new, that old car was used
We held our own
Whoa you just can't buy, that sense of pride
We grew up on, In the family

I remember every Sunday night
After supper round the firelight
How peaceful Daddy looked
As he read the good book

Well, some folks said we were barely makin' do
We were better off than they ever knew
We never had much but we sure had love

Haven't I been with you all the way 
There's no time like now to make amends 
Cause after all we're more than friends

[Chorus]
This could be the time for you and me 
We could go wherever we should be 
So don't put words between us we shouldn't say 
Don't be acting half way, when you know we're all the way

There are times that I don't see the light and I don't know if what I do is right 
When I'm wrong it's never meant for you so don't confuse my love with what I do

Don Williams,"Tempted, tempted, tempted to fall in again
Tempted, tempted, I'm tempted to fall in love again
Sometimes love, can hurt you bad
Make you stop and wonder what you really had
But I guess it's all part of the master plan
To be tempted to fall in love again
Tempted, tempted, tempted to fall in again
Tempted, tempted, I'm tempted to fall in love again
When I miss love the most it's late at night
When the party is over and everything gets quiet

And that same look must be in mine
And who knows what we might have been
Another place, another time

Or could it be we just didn't try
Looking back we see so much that we left undone
We should have known it would wither and die

The ground must be tended but we left it alone
The seeds that we scattered are all parched and blown
Flowers won't grow in gardens of stone

And made it a place where nothing could live

And you, it's only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

And the road has been too long

In the spring becomes the rose",The Rose,2004

With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then daddy came in to kiss his little man

With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he staggered a little as he went out the door

I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me Hank and Tennessee
I guess we're all gonna be what we're gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me

Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain't afraid if you're washed in the blood like I was
The smell of Cape Jasmine through the window screen
John are and the wolfman kept me company

By the light of the radio by my bed with Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head
I can still hear the soft southern winds...
When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
And I watched him burn himself up on Bourbon and speed

But I was smarter than most and I could choose

The moonlight holds the spotlight that we shared
I found new notes on that old guitar, she believed I could be a star
She told me that she wanted to be fair

She said, I love you more than to hold you down, boy you`re glory bound
We can`t share a world with different dreams
So I chased mine and she found hers too, but someone else made hers come true
Now I`m a star, but every time I sing

My heart goes drifting down a dusty Dixie road
Taking my mind, back in time
L.A. lights burn like hell once you know
You left heaven waitin' down the Dixie road.

Every night I`m in a different place and I`m searching every stranger`s face
Trying to find the girl that`s just not there
She`s back there in Montgomery and I`m clear across the country
But whenever I`m alone I go back there.

But this time someone new walked in
While she was all alone

And he told her that there was much more life to see
Than she would ever see with me
Now she's going, going, gone

It's over, I never thought I'd see this day
When everything would walk away
That I depended on God, he'll hold her

To make sure she don't change her mind
I've lost her all the way this time
She's going, going, gone

I should have paid attention, there were many warning signs
But I just never thought she'd walk away
Here I stand in silence, just an echo of the words
I heard her say

Lost some things I won't get back
A few times there I got off track
But I'm hoping Gods OK with that

I've had my fun I've made some friends
I've loved and lost and loved again
Been down that less traveled road
Just to see how far it goes
Spoke my mind I've been myself
Tried not to hurt nobody else
But if I did I hope they'll forgive

I'd like to think I'll still be here
To celebrate a hundred years
With a lit cigar and an Ice cold beer
Latin heart and thinking clear 
But if I'm not I've had my run

Don Williams,"Some people run some people crawl some people don't even move at all
Some roads lead forwards some roads lead back
Some roads are bathed in light some wrapped in fearful black
Time oh time where did you go time oh good good time where did you go

Sometimes I'm satisfied sometimes I'm not
Sometimes my face is cold sometimes it's hot
At sunset I laugh at sunrise I cry at midnight I'm in between and wondering why

Don Williams & the Pozo Seco Singers,"I don't believe in superstars
organic food and foreign cars
I don't believe the price of gold
the certainty of growing old
that right is right and left is wrong
that north and south can't get along
that east is east and west is west
and being first is always best.
 
But I believe in love, I believe in babies
I believe in mom and dad, and I believe in you.
 
Well I don't believe that heaven waits
for only those who congregate
I like to think of God as love
He's down below, He's up above
He's watching people everywhere
He knows who dies and doesn't care
and I'm an ordinary man
sometimes I wonder who I am.
 
But I believe in love, I believe in music
I believe in magic, and I believe in you.
 
I know with all my certainty what's goin'
with you and me is a good thing
it's true, I believe in you.
 
I don't believe virginity is
as common as it used to be
in working days and sleeping nights
that black is black and white is white
that Superman and Robin Hood
are still alive in Hollywood
that gasoline's in short supply
the rising cost of getting by.

Some are dead and some are living

They turned off the water; I'm behind on my rent.
Last night I drank my last beer,
And where do I go from here? 

I've been laid off since Monday before.
The union is holdin' out, hopin' for more.
Well, I could be laid off for years.
Oh, where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here? 

Sittin' at the kitchen table,
Staring at my unpaid bills.
Sometimes I feel so unable:
It's the boredom, not the worry that kills.
Oh where do I go from here. 

Where do you go when nobody needs you?
Why can't you sleep when there's nothin' else to do?
And why are your thoughts so unclear?
Oh, where do you go? Where do you go?

But my sofa and chairs just got repossessed.

Don Wilner,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000
Don Wilner,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Don Wilson,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's heaven
How high the moon
There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven
It's where you are
The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will, how still my heart
How high the moon

Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
