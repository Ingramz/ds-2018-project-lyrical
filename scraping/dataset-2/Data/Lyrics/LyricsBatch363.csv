Yes I did baby
Yes I did

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile, but
Deep inside I could hear 
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Because I love you I just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it (yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (oh yeah)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (I'm gonna be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

Said I wouldn't walk away
Somedays I want to stay (days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay (need to be okay)
Never thought it would be true
Me livin' without you (livin' without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move

I used to say I couldn't do it, but I did it (but I did baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (to my eyes)
And I know inside I'm gonna be alright (be alright)

I said I couldn't do it, but I did it (but I did it)

They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change the number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All thru the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see

'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare to try
Girl, this is thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, diller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

(Rap performed by Vincent Price)
Darkness falls across the land
The midnite hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighbourhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist

I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while

But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step

I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died

So bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey in Rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now do you believe in rock and roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?

Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues

I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died

I started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey in Rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Now for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me

Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned

And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died

We were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey in Rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and falling fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast

Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
While the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance

'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?

We started singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey in Rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the devil's only friend

Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan's spell

And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died

He was singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey in Rye
And singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play

And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken

And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died

And they were singin' bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey in Rye
Singin' ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

On the half shell they're the heroes four.
In this day and age who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with mugging mysterious.
All police and detectives are furious 
'cause they can't find the source of this lethally evil force.
This is serious so give me a quarter.
I was a witness. Get me a reporter.
Call April ONeil in on this case eh.
You better hurry up.  There's no time to waste.
We need help like quick, on the double.
Have pity on the city man it's in trouble.
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger when

determined to put these crooks in jail.
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened but before she knew it,
she fell in the trap and got caught.
Yeah, she was all alone, with no friends and no phone.
Now this was beyond her worst dreams 
'cause she was cornered by some wayward teens.
Headed by Shredder, they were anything but good.
Misguided, unloved, they called 'em ""the foot.""
They could terrorize and be angry youth 
and they'd mug the people who needed proof.
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound.
Shouting ""Cow-a-bun-ga"" as they hit the ground.
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower 
'cause they possessed Turtle Power.

Heroes on the half shell, they're on a mission.
When there's a battle got the enemy wishing that they stayed at home instead of 
fightin' these Ninja Masters with moves like lightnin'.
They were once normal but now they're mutants.
Splinter's the teacher so they are the students.
Leonardo,Michelangelo and Donatello make up the team 
with one other fellow, Raphael.
He's the leader of the group, transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop.
Pizza's the food that's sure to please.
These Ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese.
Back to the story, it's not hard to find.
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind.
Those were the words that the Master instructed 
but a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted.
 
That was the last straw. Spring into action.
Step on ""the foot"" now they're gonna lose traction.
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice.
Your shell is hard so you shout, 
""They can't dust us off like some old coffee table.""
Since you been born you been willin' and able to defeat the sneak, 
protect the walk, fight for rights and your freedom to speak.
Now the villian is chillin' so you make a a stand.
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand.
Remember the words of your teacher, your master;
""Evil moves fast but good moves faster 
than light shining for your illumination.""
Good versus evil equals confrontation.
So when you're in trouble don't give in and turn sour. 
Try to rely on your Turtle Power.

He looked and he looked, he could see nothing there
But a small speck of dust blowing past through the air

“I say, how confusing, I've never heard tell
Of a small speck of dust that is able to yell
So you know what I think? I think that there must
Be someone on top of that small speck of dust”

Provides little opportunity

Educated in a small town
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town
Used to daydream in that small town
Another boring romantic that's me

But I've seen it all in a small town
Had myself a ball in a small town
Married an L.A. doll and brought her to this small town
Now she's small town just like me

No I cannot forget where it is that I come from
I cannot forget the people who love me
Yeah, I can be myself here in this small town
And people let me be just what I want to be

Got nothing against a big town
Still hayseed enough to say
Look who's in the big town
But my bed is in a small town
Oh, and that's good enough for me

Well I was born in a small town
And I can breathe in a small town
Gonna die in this small town

Rock man lovers driving Lamborghini

Gunshots ranged out like a bell

Fallin' on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed

Wish I could say the save the world, like I was super girl
The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground
With nothing but a T-shirt on
I never felt so beautiful
Baby as I do now
Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down
It's like a private joke just meant for us to know
I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away
Sometimes it's hard to breathe
Just knowing you found me
'Cause I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?

Come and take me
Love you save me
Like nobody else
Now I can be myself

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggic May,2005

To all the girls I cheated on before

To all the girls I cheated on before, I tip my hat like Willie Nelson
You got pressure, take a sip of this Molson
Here's what happened, it wasn't my intentions
To fall into seduction while playing a temptation
I thought I had it figured out, but games don't last
The hourglass ran out, I got sprayed with the tear gas
Big men don't cry, hold my feelings inside
Stress brings me pain, I gotta hold my pride
When I see you with another guy, jealous thoughts of homicide
Call me selfish when I say Abraham has many wives
You say this is the 90's, either it's gonna be me or her
I found myself in a blur
Lookin' into the clouds thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

To all the girls I cheated on before, it's a new year
I got a new change of gear, I swear
I can see clear now the clouds disappeared

Second verse is gonna hurt, based on a true life story
I got married at 24 in New Jersey
You know the feelings start nature take it's course
Two years later 'Clef gets a divorce
When I had the cold feet, I shouldn't've walked the altar
With Dionne Warwick, she could predict my future
Went with my feelings even though it wasn't right
Creepin' with my secret lover in the middle of the night
Back home, break of dawn, dinner's at the table
Thin Line Between Love And Hate is on cable
I'm lookin' at myself thinkin' out loud
""I'm in love with two women, who is it gonna be now?""

And if your girl acts up at the carnival, then you snatch her friend

Break it down right here

One love, you're lucky to have one love
It sounds bugged, drinking wine from the same jug
One heart, one mind, one soul
She ain't a gold digger, she don't care about your bank-roll
Keep your money, she make her own cheddar
All she want from me is respect like Aretha
Cooked me lasagne, stayed in for the winter
Chilled to the summer, now I'm gone 'til November
Have you seen her?
I think I did
But what I did wrong was take a love for granted
Cause first comes trust, don't rush into lust
Easier said than done, I lust and I must
Passion is a must, but then we start to cuss
We was just makin' love, now we tearing up each other's guts
Like species, she called me an animal
So feel the tongue of the warm-blooded mammal

Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
If we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me, would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we will remember
Whenever we remember

Something never comes never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope

Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most

You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
Don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste

Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive

Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion

We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.
I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,
And the circling is worth it.

There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.

To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside
Going through a living hell
And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden

They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbing for you and me
It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it everyday
Some say this country's just out looking for a fight
After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right

Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember
Just what they're fighting for

Everybody loves to root for a nuisance

So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to,
Censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the f*** that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with f***ing cornrows
You're like normal, f*** being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you a**uming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherf***in' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, f*** you
I'm drunk so Satan take the f***ing wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But f*** it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the f*** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?",Rap God,2014

I keep it in, you let it loose
It's only love that makes you feel like I'm getting
So completely
Naked and you don't remember
How you let yourself become so unraveled
Your naked pretty as a heartache
Waiting for your second skin to settle in

My hardened heart can't hide me now
It loves as much as I allow
And in the end the eyeball army will just drag me down
And I'll be

But in the bing for days show you how I'm real
Come home to the truck with the Optimus Prim grille
Handin' out crack got the scene poppin' off
They not sleepin' on 'em the fiends is noddin' off
For real tell me how you a thug and you Superman (Nigga)
I just seen you in the club doing the Superman (I Said Nigga!)
A bunch of clowns holmes all

Major paper cake by the layers
If these dudes is live I'm the created player
They callin' 'em kings when they so so hot
Somethings wrong wit that picture must be photoshopped
I don't promote violence but when sparking the flame Blam
Arms start waving like the Carlton Banks dance
When them tools go pop it move whole blocks
Come around wit cha dog or get Kujo shot
These emcee's is lame I tryta be an emcee wit brains

Question is can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
Have fun and get blunted on a Sunday afternoon
My nigga Babe got room, grab the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Around the full good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Uh drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm fuckin' faded
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin' hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)

Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? Ayo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Macking interrupted by some niggas set-tripping
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggas how to act

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice

Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light
Put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got rugers and m-14's with enough
Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin'
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Filling the sky, usually drilling the one

And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to
Question me, bout the colors that I got on?

Bout to get your whole crew shot on

Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way

One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hopping out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud-ass motherfucking barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Calling men ladies, sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me, it's okay, go with him Hailie

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that, this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat

Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5 and 6, but that's it.

For a nigga with a dream,
Atlanta is the city,
And they make it so seem,
But ride through the city,
And The Streets ain't clean,
All I see is drug deals, big wheels and feinds,
But any way they took East Atlanta back,(?)
Throw Atlanta Down,
Turned little Vietnam to a white folks town,
And fo, I forget to say you should have been fixture streets by MLK,
I ain't talkin' about the dope,
In talking about the raggedy road,
Niggas crack they rims riding over potholes,
But that's how it goes,
When you stuck fuck outta luck and lost in the ghetto's.

[Chorus]
You got a one way ticket to hell,
Smack dab in the middle of the ATL,
And aww, I don't want to hustle no more but the streets won't let me go,
All my niggaz say,
Zone 1 (right here), Zone 2 (right here), Zone 3 Zone 4 (right here), Zone 5 and 6, but that's it.

They talking ATL, Atlanta Georgia,
We the shit,
We talking Holy Feild you know that nigga named Michael Vick
They called me mamma boy but now they call me drummer boy,
They talking jet skiis, I had that shit last summer boy,
Charles is gone, Cher is show case,
5 5 9 night life (they had it goin on),
Back then Shawty D was gone,
Flat heat right here was on,
They put me on the song back then we all got along, ain't had no switch game
Atlanta just won't be the same,
Hit Man, Sammy Sam, DJ Smurf and Ying Yang,
I know when kids rockin(?) used to beat the block, I lived in a little house boy,
And the block party would never stop, I remember when G-Lyfe was when I had that little jelly bean,
I remember them East 30 Cadillacs and
Cut Supreme,(?) I built the school and shot Marvin that's what I did,
I remember the curfews what we used to get(?).

[Chorus]

A parking lot Alley niggaz thinkin' again,
When you speaking bout' Atlanta mention Ying Yang Twins,
There born and raised,
God done made it hard for us,
'Cause y'all outta towners came here and fucked shit up, 
But y'all can't fuck with us, cause as soon as shit start goin on you leave Atlanta and go right back home,
And that's the pussy mother fucker,
Ya heard me motherfucker, bring off in there mouth (?) ATL-ANTA,
Stop asking me cause that why I stay, if you can spell,
That's Atlant motherfucker, ya heard me mother fucker,
So don't ask me again,
'Cause I ain't saying it again,
Let me ask you do you remember jelly bean Cherri Show Case Club sense in tha game,
Lemme tell you about some ghettos,
Inglewood East Lameadows(?) ATL.

No longer keep me bound

In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in

Niggas walk by and blast without leaving a footprint

Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates

On every corner, cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya

Ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese

Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em

Where niggas die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit' my shit off safety - for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's

Passin' by with uzis - and who you aimin' at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-tat-tat-tat {*automatic gunfire and screaming*}
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
Tryin' to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get
Hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin' HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin' games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit' crews

You knew he already had a family

You went and got pregnant, didn't you bitch, didn't you?
The ol' 'keep a nigga baby'
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here, 'cause that nigga ain't shit""
How 'bout being a woman, and tellin' the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a hoe
Tell the kid
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out

Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic

Makin' fools ""RETREAT!"" like Megatron and Starscream

Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly

Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly
That magic night we kissed
There in the moon mist

Never before were mine so strangely willing

This one thing I know
When love goes wrong
A man takes flight

The moon don't shine
The tide don't ebb and flow
A clock won't strike
A match won't light

And day is dark as night

And a woman's sorry sight

A man goes out, gets high as a kite

You can't fight it, honey
You can't fight it
When love goes wrong, nothin'
No bows, honey, just cigat bars and off
Nothing goes right

Met the divine Miss O

Who got arrested down in old Hong Kong
He got twenty years privilege taken away from him
When he kicked old Buddha's gong

And now he's poppin' the piano just to raise the price
Of a ticket to the land of the free
Well, he says his home's in Frisco where they send the rice
But it's really in Tennessee

That's why he said, ""I need someone to love me
I need somebody to carry me home to San Francisco
And bury my body there
I need someone to lend me a fifty dollar bill and then
I'll leave Hong Kong behind me for happiness once again""

Won't somebody believe
I've a yen to see that Bay again
Every time I try to leave
Sweet opium won't let me fly away

Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me

An old music master sat composing a tune
His spirit was soaring and his heart full of joy
When right out of nowhere stepped

You gotta jump it, music master
You gotta play that rhythm faster
You're never gonna get it played

And you'll achieve posterity

Simply sat there amazed
As wide-eyed and open-mouthed
He gazed and he gazed

How can you be certain little boy
Tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend
A hundred years from now

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

An old-fashion gent comes parading
Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes
The Lamplighter's Serenade

The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk
But when it's half after love time
He reaches for his sticks and from his bag of tricks
He lights every star in the sky

And if a lady or a beau should answer no
He sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day

Hoagy Carmichael,"Up a lazy river by the old mill run
Lazy, lazy river in the noon day sun
Linger awhile in the shade of the tree
Throw away your troubles, dream a dream of me

You know, before your sister was born
This is what your Mama did for a living
Music opened a whole new world to me
No matter how bad I feel, no matter how sad or sick I am
I just touched these keys and poof, like magic
I always seemed to feel better
I've always known you had talent, Bobbie
This piano is for you, Charlie worked hard for it
See God wouldn't have made you suffer so much
If you weren't gonna make up for it later

How happy you can be
Up a lazy river with me

Throw away your troubles, baby
Dream a dream with me

Up a lazy river with me

From the halfway mark

To be a star, a big star
You gotta be talented obviously
You gotta be tenacious, have charisma
But most importantly, you've gotta have it
A great intangible and you've got it all, Bobbie
You're gonna be bigger than Sinatra
I'd settle for a little Jolson Mama, Mama, Mama

Ah ah ah, there are blue skies up above
Forever long as we're in love
We'll be up a lazy river
Up a crazy lazy river
Up a lazy river
I ain't goin' your way
Get out of my way
Up a lazy river with me

Hoagy Carmichael,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that were apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust
Of yesterday
The music
Of the years
Gone by

Chorus:

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song.
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you.
When our love was new, and each kiss an inspiration.
But that was long ago, and now my consolation
Is in the stardust of a song.
Beside the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew.
Though I dream in vain, in my heart you will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of loves refrain.

When I say to you

Do you love me

You gotta jump it, music master,
You gotta play that rhythm faster,
You're never gonna get it played

And Mister Reginald De Koven
They better do the same as you,
Or they're gonna be corny too.

Then about nineteen thirty-five
You'll begin to hear swing,
Boogie Woogie and Jive,
You gotta show that big broadcaster
That you're a solid music master,
And you'll achieve posterity,
That's a bit of advice from me.

As wide-eyed and open-mouthed he gazed and he gazed
How can you be certain little boy, tell me how?
Because I was born, my friend,
A hundred years from now.

And disappeared into the infinite,

Hoblins Choice,"Oh I could hide 'neath the wings
Of the blue bird as she sings
The six-o'clock alarm would never ring
But six rings and I rise
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes
The shaving razor's cold and it stings

Cheer up sleepy Jean
Oh what can it mean to a
Daydream believer and a
Homecoming queen

You once thought of me
As a white knight on his steed
Now you know how happy I can be
Oh, our good times start and end
Without all I want to spend
But how much baby do we really need

Oh what can it mean to a

Hobo Johnson,"It feels so good
Oh that's my shit right there
That's the ticket
Give me the ticket
Give it to me, baby

I'm too emotional
Good luck to my future wives
And their future lives without me
You guys will do great!
I'm sure that I've prepared you for every guy you'll date
And every guy you'll marry
And every guy you'll hate
It's the lullabies I sang out of tune
That's probably what did it
Or my twin size mattress that I had since I was seven
That we have to sleep on whenever she spends the night
And if she falls off again, she'll find another guy to like

We're just Romeo & Juliet
But getting drunk and eating Percocets
But just to ease the stress
But soft what light, through yonder window breaks
It is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balcony
How romantic

Nothing like getting drunk and getting manic
On a motherfucking Monday, I
I brush the bangs behind her lovely little ear
As she describes in detail how the end is truly near
Wow, and I'm sure that we can do this for forever
Or until we drink the poison, 'cause she sees some cloudy weather
As Rosaline, lies in bed, seething, wide awake
Because a burning love for Juliet only took a day
And if Romeo and Juliet continued to be married
Then there's half of a chance
That their kids would get embarrassed
When all the kids at school all talk about their parents
And Romeo Jr. has to say they're not together
And Junior will dream of the day when he's a man
And what he'll do to avoid that fifty percent chance
Of his kids feeling the way he feels
He'll probably just stick with the Netflix and chill

Dear Shakespeare
Could you write a happy ending please?
Could you write a happy ending please?
We just deserve a happy ending please, please
And every sting from every teardrop
From every ring at every pawn shop
I'm not missing both my Christmas'
Though family would be nice
In my dreams, my kids are happy
And I know that they won't mind
One Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas
Just one Christmas

But dear mom
Conversations from a couch haven't ever felt the same
Since you looked Dad in the eye
And you told him that things are about to change
My mom was made from Adam's rib
And the marriage went south
When the snake came back and asked my mother out to dinner
And my dad found out, and asked my mom what that's about
And she said ""Oh, it's nothing""
For dad loves to shout really loud
Loud enough to knock the lamps and dressers to the ground
In my memory, I can hear
Chopin's nocturnes playing in the background
A slow trainwreck, you'll close your eyes
But forever hear the sound, and boy, it's tough
'Cause that's the sound of people falling out of love",Romeo & Juliet,2017

With a violent frame
And an arrow would cross their hearts

I like New York in June, how about you?

I love a fireside when a storm is due.
I like potato chips, moonlight and motor trips,
How about you?

When all the lights are low
May not be new, but I like it,

To a degree.

That includes me.

I like banana splits, late supper at the Ritz,

I gave up on you a while ago, and you still blessing me lord
You never questioned me lord
I feel your energy lord
You showed me how to forgive my family and enemies lord

To spread evil, that's not the remedy lord
And it will never be lord
Pride I push aside and recognise the sensory, lord
I'm a slave to my own thoughts, no penitentiary lord
We all gon' die and lie in the cemetery eventually lord

I'm letting go

(I remember when I was your age, I wish I would've known what I know now
But this is just the that way life goes, it's meant for us to learn)

Letting go of your promises
Promises lead to consequence, when you commit to something and do the opposite
Sick to your stomach, you're vomiting, a Ramadan
No food for children you're fathering
The possibility of your family surviving this shit is kinda slim
First place, the gold trophy, bitch I gotta win
Seems like that's what my only option is

Handsome dude she wanna be with standing by camera crews
I let her snooze and dream 'cause none of them wishes tangible

And I'm tryna see lights cameras action like Mr. Cheeks

Army fatigue bake boxes for the league
No ghetto barrettes and weaves down to the sleeve for the fees
If packaged she'll be petite know how to roll up my weed
Her doing's doing the deed and she don't really need shit

They asking Domo ""where you been? "" They feel they got ditched
Just look for the influence I be under that bitch and
It's a headlock when it come to that grip
You ain't never met a motherfucker done in that sick

Bitch lay off the gas that they giving your head tank dog
Thinking that you better than me will get you taked off

The world is low, the devil waits so I stay high as heaven gates
See I'm on it everyday, minutes never go to waste
If ain't no profit on the way then we cannot negotiate
Scripture texts for holy sakes, who's tellin' what the Lord will say
Until that day, I'll be tunnel vision on the paper chase
Odd Future, fuck your feelings, check the score we fuckin' winnin'
Check the list we in the building, stupid swag, Paris Hilton
More potential, you's a liar, step up we will crucify ya
Head first, yea it's going down like a scuba diver
Need the fire, I'll supply ya, put the hire on the block
Swag on deck, if you need it I be overstocked

It tells my hands and rubs my glands, I'm I'll as fuck, bitch fuck your mans

Keep the bong hash in my canister, I'm headed where it's handed first
Domo rollin' up, Left Brain already smokin'
You smell that loud ounce? Mary Jane has already spoken
My shades on, bitch I'm lokin', no need for aggravations
'Cause a fake nigga in his death bed will be fuckin' collaboratin'
Kush escaped without a roller, high roller, no time for strollers
Made it stoned because I'm workin' over, too many posers tryin' to rob my bowl
I'm pretty sure Tyler will represent it, I fell asleep before you bitch niggas present it
I'm fuckin' authentic, remember it, you motherfuckers pretending

Me and Leggo just skate at the mall
Next thing you know wildin' out at Watch the Throne
I had a dead phone so I gave that little nigga my cam
He snapped that shit, the motherfuckers went HAM
Like Miss Piggy cunt around Kermit
I'm like how many fucks can I get a day?
Fuck respect, I'd rather hang myself on the wall with a noose on neck
Before I change to fit in your block, so I'll make sure I cannot fit in a house
And I hate genres, fuck hip hop with their searching cop high top flip flops
In the middle of the winter, y'all like fuck them kids, like a weird babysitter might say
No diggity, I'm still tryin' to find it but I lost it somewhere in Austin
In a creek with Dawson and this vegan bitch tryin' to eat my sausage
That sounds awesome
Fuck these parties, I'm real awkward
I stand there, I don't know what to do man
I'd rather be at home with my crew and my new rooms, staring at my brand new MoonMan
Listening to MF Doom and Wooh Da Kid and Bricksquad 10-17
Shout out to Waka, rest in peace Slim

Coroner's out when they're killing the gorgeous
Diamond cut like what the fuck is flawless?
Tell the runner to go and get me some go
'Cause I'm bubblin' on you horrors
I'm such a mystery
Mystery is more quite than a hipster Prius takin' a trip to Egypt
Niggas claim to be scenic when I know they ain't seen shit
I see shit fuckin' seasick, rain showers is what I predict
My flow is like gymnastics, so
Beef flips, patty cakes, smoke a pound of dro for the algae taste
Say what up to my pinky, say hi to my index
Fuck all the hoes want middle finger, thumb take shots like a pentax
Bitch I kill 'em all, you could just write off they're death tax
Boxin' niggas out of the mic, punch lines, death match

I invented swag, fuck what these other niggas talkin' 'bout
Niggas wanna brag 'bout the shit that they lack
But the truth of the fact, it's all word of mouth
Talk a lot of crap, but ain't shit for sure
Bathin' Ape shit that I get for low
I don't pay much and I don't say much
But I still got a swag you should get to know
I flip a show, spend it on apparel
Spanish bitch tell me I look mucho dinero
Then she say she love me and I tell her I don't care ho
I'm in the fast lane with my foot on the pedal
Smash, I'm takin' off
Lot of niggas hate, but I shake 'em off
Put that hash in a bong, it'll make ya cough
And the purp's goin' down like the Lakers lost
Cause we them niggas, yea
Doper than the 80's, baby
Careful, I might snatch your bitch and turn her to a wavy lady
Scare 'em when I'm taking steps

The beat, wears it like a kevlar
As I smoke my tree, medlar, South African
Coughing 'til there's pains in my fucking abdomen
I spit negative just like a halogen
My breeze more of a fucking masculine
The rascals win, killing them all with a javelin
Snakes, I'm just rattling, suit taylor never taddling
You niggas a bunch of squares, Madison
As far as real niggas, bitch nigga my battle's sick
On top of being talented, bitch I'm fucking passionate
I'm a golden curse, call me treacherous, treasure chest
Better yet, I'll build on to the beat like Tetris
Remember me, forgetfulness, I am your correctionist
I stitched odd and future together like a leather vest
You fucking sweater neck, feather peck, Rosetta checks
I put together decks and push for beef, If head for less
I'm headed out to Sydney Australia with Tim Donnelly
He gets caught up at security, the TSA don't follow me
Tea parties are the shit, forty mags by the scones
I'm fighting for gun rights to shoot a nigga in his dome
Click your fucking heels, there's no place like home
Cock back and blast off written on the tombstone, ain't that a bitch

Let's see, what's wrong with me might be my fucking tourett see
I need a vacation cause all this shit got me stressing
So after the showers with Sandusky,
me and Sean Kingston went and rented a couple jet skis
Lionel rolled the blunts up, so meanwhile me and Lucas getting fucked up
You can smell us coming like a faggot when he hicks up
Listening to Common's last album to get pumped up
So finally asked [scratch] when I can get my dick sucked
You know Casey Anthony, was handling
Dropping her kids off so she could come out and dance with me
Wine in the pantry, wrestling on my trampoline
Learned some new chords while you uncreative were sampling
I'm wolf, I spit flow-y partly
As retarded as the sound of deaf people arguing
You hold the future of the kid you daughter's gargling
Me, I have the odd future motherfucking sargeaning
(Tyler calm the fuck down) No, I'm the fuck now
My poppa didn't give one, that's why I'm like this now
I'm still down to cut throat
And if another fan asks for a photo while I'm snacking on my pizza lunchable
I'm 'a fucking snap like Berman when he acts right
Then have a mental breakdown and proceed to use a crack pipe
OF will be done for, niggas will be dumb poor
Don't believe me, OK be right back, I'm headed to the gun store
M-16's and them 16's came out of nowhere like your kid's wet dream
What you mean old news, oh you
Will you need us to fucking show you that we're harder than finding a fucking snickers bar in whole foods
In a black hoodie, nose bruised and a gold tooth
Hoping the security guard doesn't hold you in custody
But luckily had a couple of guns with me
Like gay step mom, none of you motherfuckers can fuck with me",P,2012

I text message, messages to fuckin' estrogen

Cause I never am purchasing, reimbursing your currency
Put your body on the curb to work the street, I hearse the streets
Heard she sweet, she Hershey's sweet but me I'm extravagant
Hop on the bandwagon kid, I'm about to tell you some tragic shit
The love is lost and the drugs they cost, in the studio mixing raw
Bitchs shit in my draws like you piss in my draws, nigga my dick's in her jaw
I'm Wes Snipes with lead pipes, don't dabble with the apple
Cause a swagga like mine turn them apples into Snapple
Fuck the pick of the raffle, king of the castle
Nigga, Genghis Khan mansion, we the Marilyn Manson
Making money in the present, it be safe for my grandsons
African drugs for when the champ come

Suicide watch nigga, kill yourself
Opposition who? Nigga reveal yourself
How you steal our swag and figure you still yourself?
Splinter Cell creeping in this bitch, you couldn't feel the stealth
Wolves are prowling, hunger at it's fucking best
I'm a beast like the gorilla head that is on my chest
Please let me flex, I'm going off I need some fuckin' bread
Drugs are green, my bitches white and tonight I need fuckin' head
Excuse the swag, I'm tryna tone it down like Jenny Craig
Fresh to death then I guess we looking like the living dead
Oh shit, yo bitch, look at how I'm doing you
Bitches on my dick but look at me I'm fucking beautiful
Niggas tryna figure out, but all I hear in my interviews
Is why this so cool? You niggas are so unusual

I killed that pussy and grabbed that knife
Now I got real authentic cheetah print shit (Nigga, you're a liar)
Nigga don't believe me, kiss your lady
And boy, you're gonna get them heebie jeebies?
Nigga my dick stay way disease-y, I make it look easy
51-50, I'm off the Heezy, you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
Came in the game like Speedy Gonzalez, I'm fuckin' Looney
See these girls talkin' all that shit (What?)
I'm just tryna see some tits (What?)
Let's get it poppin' like, MC Lyte, around some dykes
I'm, out this bitch like hocus pocus
And me and Lucas got a couple of pickles
And met up with bitches, gave 'em cum on their dimples
Then my dick went limp so, took about 3 pills of Extenzo
Now my dick's longer than a 5 door limo
Harder than a soft right hook from kimbo on PCP and cilantro
When I'm with your bitch I'm like, ""Where my dick go?""
Now she think I'm 'bout to eat her hole

In Christ alone, who took on flesh
Fulness of God in helpless babe!

Scorned by the ones he came to save
Till on that cross as Jesus died,
The wrath of God was satisfied 
For every sin on him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

There in the ground his body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain
Then bursting forth in glorious Day
Up from the grave he rose again!
And as he stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me
For I am his and he is mine 
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the power of Christ in me
From life's first cry to final breath

Can ever pluck me from His hand

This time

I am distracted often
Running to meet you somewhere
Hoping the flowers never die
And then you leave me breathless
Rushing to look in the mirror
Surprised to see the face is mine

[Chorus]

So what is wrong with me
I know I should be happy
I don't feel right in my own skin
I'm just waiting for this whole damn thing to end
All I can think about
Is how I can just get out
Love is maddening
Love is maddening

Hoku,"I was free when we met
You were eating a burrito
With a girl-some brunette
At El Torosco's.

Then you smiled
Like you knew
That someday we'd be together.
And together we were
For a while.

[Chorus]
How do I feel'
Ever since you walked
Away from me.
I miss you for real,
Everyday of my life.
How do I feel'
Now that it's over,
For the thing that I miss the most
Is missing you.

I was lost
For a while
Every place brought back a memory
Of a kiss, or a smile

That you gave me.
Now it's changed
Well I guess.
More and more

I miss you less and less.
Sometimes it's hard
To let go.

[Chorus]

Sometimes you get trapped
In the time of your life.
But you know
It gets a little easier
Over time.

How do I feel'
Now that it's over.
For the thing that I miss
The most.

I miss the moody
Walks in the rain.
I miss the poetry.
I miss the days.
I miss the sad songs
I used to play.

For the thing that I miss the most,
How do I feel'
I miss you for real.
How do I feel'
Now that it's over,
For the thing that I miss the most
Is missing you.",How Do I Feel (The Burrito Song),2000
Hoku,"I don't know where we stand anymore 
You've got one foot in my life 
And the other's out the door

Deep inside I've wanted to believe 
That somehow  maybe someday 
There'd be some one there for me 
And I hope I haven't lost my chance 

I don't want to wake up to reality 
Of you not being here with me 
There's so many possibilities 
That we let slip away 
And if you're heart could speak 
What would it say 
You're scared to say you love me, I'm Scared 
Will you always stay 
You don't have to run away 

I wish I could believe in what I feel 
I've been fooled so many times before 
I don't know what is real 
Maybe I'm just fooling myself 

I've been running out of reasons to let go

and the tears that we both cried

Make me feel alive again

In the first place
Maybe
Maybe it's all wrong
But you never should have gone
In the first place

Without you here
I always wanted more
Like what we had before

It wasn't all a dream
You're still a part of me

But you never should have gone

Will you come tell me you 
Love me or let me go

Or you spend the rest of your life
Picking things up off the floor
She's still alive but I am sure
That all the stars belong to her
On California king-sized beds
She's wrapped in rags inside my head
This is the story, this is the story of someone who's wild
Big black rules, pearl, life

Are they coming soon

Childhood dreaming is a thing of the past

Do you remember sleigh riding in the snow
And dancing all night to ""Baby, Please Come Home""

May I give him the star you gave to me""

A voice that was heard throughout the world
""Go down little angel girl and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world"", 'cause

Inside my Cadillac, That is my shit
And I throw it up (I throw that up)
That’s what it is (That’s what it is)
In my C A D I L L A C bitch (biatch)
Can’t see me through my tints (Nah ah)
I’m riding real slow (slow motion)
In my paint wet drippin shorty like my 24’s (Umbrella)
I ain’t got 24’s (No oh)
But I’m on those Vogues
That’s those big white walls, round them hundred spokes
Old school like old English in that brown paper bag
I’m rolling in that same whip that my granddad had
Hello haters, Damn y’all mad
30k on the Caddy, now how backpack rap is that?

I Got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Man I’m lounging in some shit Bernie Mac would’ve been proud of
Looking down from heaven like damn that’s stylish
Smilin’, don’t pay attention to the mileage
Can I hit the freeway? I’m legally going 120
Easy weaving in and out of the traffic
They cannot catch me, I’m smashing
I’m ducking bucking them out here
I’m like go fuckin their tastic, I am up in a classic
Now I know what it’s like under the city lights
Riding into the night, driving over the bridge
The same one we walked across as kids
Knew I’d have a whippin’ but never one like this
Old school, old school, Candy paint, two seater
Yea, I’m from Seattle, There’s hella Honda Civics
I couldn’t tell you about paint either
But I really want a Ducati so I put in the hours
And roll on over to the dealer
And I found the car, junior, problem with this geezer
Got the keys in and as I was leaving I started screaming

I got that off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky
I shine, the city never looked so bright

Backwoods and dope
White hoes in the backseat snorting coke
She doing line after line like she’s writing rhymes
I had it hella my love, tryna blow her mind
Cadillac pimpin’, my uncle was on
14 years out so excuse me and my niggas was gone
Sendin’ portions of his liquor, water in the Patron
Rather smiling like I won the fucking lottery homes
(Fuckin' lottery homes)
Tires with the spokes on it in the 4-2
Most of the mayonnaise, keeping the buns on ‘em
My dogs hanging out the window
Young as whoosh, fuckin like we ball
Tryna fuck em all, kill the fuckin wimps
See what’s poppin’ at the mall, meet a bad bitch
Slap her booty with my palms, you can smoke the pussy, I was tearing down the walls
I’m motherfuckin’ off
Son, swear these eyes tryna hypnotize
Grip the leather steering wheel while I grip the thighs
See the lust stuck up in her eyes, maybe she like the ride or did she like the smoke?
Or does she want it low? This shit a Coupe de Ville so you’ll never know
So we cool with niggas, my nigga fuck the limit
Got a window tinted for showing gangstas in it
Slice off when the gas is finished, Q

Off-black Cadillac, midnight drive
Got that gas pedal, leaning back, taking my time
I’m blowin’ that roof off, letting in sky

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Hollow Tip,"We been a block like top notches
Gold things and topless
Hoes jockin reflections and diamonds from my watches
What's poppin?  Smokin on veggas and kill switches
Homies twisted and fitted in EB and Hilfiger
Real niggas on my side ballin out of control
And all the hoes know we got the north financially sold
On the road, doing shows, backstage with hoes
Nobody knows what goes down once the doors is closed
Playa clickin on the scene, smokin Sacramento green
Leave as we sweep down your street in something clean
On a mission pimpin, flippin up chips to make a livin
Concentrate on millions, and sick of dealin these killins
It's another hustle everyday but I maintain
Caught up in this struggle, so I refuse to gangbang
Got my mind on bigtime, that this whole world owe us
Hollow Tip and the whole high side fittin to

Chorus:
Blow Up (everytime) 
We don't have, we don't have to rush (let's not rush this thing)
It's not worth it (it's guaranteed that we)
Blow Up (we'll make, we'll make money)
Blow Up

Now I'm on the rise, and more exposed to my eyes
I'm in the 95 Maxima the limits the sky
High siden Eddie Bauer, I'm the man of the hour
Top dollar, with a hairy ball on my collar
Dry my eyes from all the rainy days 
And slingin yay, now when we parley
Gold things spin to the bay
And to the day we close down shop
We got tapes to sling $50,000 knot
Sippin expensive drinks, 18k links
And more sophisticated than a top notch can think
In the industry risin, and we still high siden
Something fully equipped, Nautica and diamonds
Thought I wasn't sliden up in um cause I'm hollow
When Rimmie Marks swallows out the $30 bottle
When the Lexus roll up, babygirl hold up
Because I'm down with high side my whole clique fittin to

Chorus

I'm on a mission about my mail, million dollar clientele
Nationwide I'm satisfied, but decide it was hell
I had to struggle hard to be financially stable
But now I'm in the light with hundred spokes on my label
Loungin in condos, sittin on leather and brass
Lookin at big screens, my Tommy Hil's full of cash
Can you imagine it, my whole crew havin it
Tuxedos and Benzes and automatic clips
On a rise to the top it's a trip nonstop
We in this game for the millions, scrilla over props
Gold things touch the ground, like green crush it down
Let my 15's hit till the hoes say must it pound
I'm the man across the land, pay my bills by the grand
Hoes rush me, tryin to touch me, got top notch fans
Now the struggle is over, no more jobs only your love
All these haters still talkin but they can watch a nigga

But now, what why'all playas on highside like to
Do man on the real...

I like to
Floss a lot hit the cock a lot and play with triggers
Parlay with my playa click thug niggaz
Sip the liquor and roll the hip up in a vega leaf

And smile at bitches with daimonds in my gold teeth
Crease the Guess I put the dank smoke in my chest
Polo shirt and a Eddie Bauer fishing vest
Never stress it's all nilly

If funds is running low I send some pounds out to Philly
To get my scrilly
Ya'll know the really
It truly cost to floss

So I'm wanted by the haters so I pack a nina ross
And ball and chose to roll
I rise on them hundreds
Supposed to keep a 45 in my Abercrombie french coat

Spit the flows to the peeps and make my pockets swell
My records sell and my '69 fishtails
Through the streets of killa cali sac valley

Hoes on me cause I reside under the palm trees
What I mean is doggy style on the carpet

With a star bitch
Freak me from morning till the dark shit
Get rich is probly always been a nigga dream
Find a team bout their green and now I'm on the scene

Staying clean like gold and diamonds on my left wrist
Lexus 400 running through they sections
Stressin cause highland niggas making true scratch
Who's that Mic in the maxima with j-mac

Fagbag because he'll never like to do much
Hatin studs and actin tough'll make you get touched

Why we hot we slide the drops cold body tops
Flamy knocks bitches wavin till the candy stop
Pop the Remy top and cruise with my danny cocked

Got it locked me and Dame and niggas we call the shots
Hoes'll stop when ballas floss through the spots

I'm gonna rap that jack sometimes

Holly Brook,"Where'd you go?
I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone

She said, ""Some days I feel like shit""
Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along but the trips always feel so long
And, I find myself tryna stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me when I feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call
But when I pick up I don't have much to say
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin'
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here singing ""Where'd you go?""

I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever
That you've been gone
Please come back home

You know the place where you used to live,
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs,
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile,
But now, you only stop by every once in a while,
Shit, I find myself just fillin' my time,
Anything to keep the thought of you from my mind,
I'm doin' fine, I plan to keep it that way,
You can call me if you find you have somethin' to say,
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',
Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,
Me and the rest of the family here singing, ""Where'd you go?""

I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone.
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone,
Please come back home

I want you to know it's a little fucked up,
That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',
Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses,
For while you're not around, and feeling so useless,
It seems one thing has been true all along,
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone,
I guess I've had it with you and your career,
When you come back I won't be here and you'll can sing it

Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone
Where'd you go?
I miss you so,
Seems like it's been forever,
That you've been gone

Please come back home

Holly Brook,"Mike:
This is a story of them against us, win or lose
Forcing your feet into someone else's shoes
Everybody's got something to say, that we ought to
Live their way, what we're doing's not okay
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec
You ever feel like the pressure is
Too much to take, too much weight?
Ladies and gentlemen
If anybody can hear me right now please shout back
We're not the only ones feeling so trapped
In the dream of somebody else, in fact
They got their heads full of some overblown scheme
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

Holly / Tak / Mike:
Gonna be sombody
(For anybody telling me I can't)
Gonna be someone
(For anyone who told me I had no chance)
Gonna be somebody
(I'm telling you the time has come)
Gonna be someone
(And maybe you'll get it when I'm finally done)

We don't sleep to dream, we sleep to build stamina
Energy to do our thing, get your camera
Cause this ride is about to begin
Sit down and buckle it in, lemme say it again
In this world everybody's got a chip on
Both sides of the neck, got no respect
Wait up a sec
When I was young they said the
Odds of making it were slim to none
Ladies and, fuck it
I'm tired of them saying the dream you have
Doesn't exist, telling you you're worthless saying you should quit
Basically telling you that you'll never be shit
Really they're pissed cause they'll never achieve some
Opportunity they missed back when they were sixteen
And all they want to do is push you to be that
And all you want to do is scream back

Lupe Fiasco:
They're gonna think you're crazy
Mumbling to yourself in the basement all day
Uh-uh-uh-ing and to yourself
My pops didn't dig it with shoveling it to myself
My boys used to get it they dug it because they felt
My undertaking took me I was making in my stealth
A wealth of rhymes of crazy I would chuckle to myself
Then they went into the mental rolodex
See I knew 'em by heart like a brain in my chest
Then I took 'em to school where subjects were getting felt
Books under my seat notebook laying on my desk
My teacher's like, ""Mr. Jaco?""
""Yes?""
""With all that knowledge, you ain't trying to college
Be a lawyer or a doctor, get a whole lot of dollars
Rather degrade woman and glorify violence?""
Well the work that works for me might not work for you
No homework, I got work to do",Be Somebody [*],2005
Holly Brook,"Unlocking metaphors
Caches that were safe before
Lost their secrets to the wind

It isn't everyday
You can see the other face
Watching you I'm watching me who could this be

Your wounds begin to sing
Red melodies that sting
Like ice bury me twice

Running from the heat from the lines that break me
I'll give another try

Fallen angel
Your terminal high
Feeding the hunger of your sky
Take all the poison that I give
Just to live
For the feeling
Use me again

Your stuck in a centerfold
Written in capitals
Bake the time talking through wine

Young boys that you tantalize
Sipping on your pretty eyes
But you kill just to feel real

Lately on this vine the showers have been steady
Are you ready for this flight?",Again & Again,2006
Holly Brook,"Sittin' here I'm dwellin' on the things that I keep
Holding on to yesterday
Ties are broken ties are made I try so hard to find my way
Around this crazy place
Nobody seems to understand me
Till you came along and told me this

All will be forgotten
Every tear you've cried
As soon as you awaken
To what's right in front of your eyes
Standing by your side

Sittin' here I'm thinkin' 'bout the weather and
The countryside around me
Simple little things like these are good to keep
My silly mind from wondering
I feel the summer breeze wash over me
Oh I know the laughter know the love and
Maybe I've just got enough to give

All will be forgotten
Every tear you've cried
As soon as you awaken
To what's right in front of your eyes
Standing by your side

The road is long before me now
The memories beg me to stay
But lonely is born from pride I've found
So I'll reach out",All Will Be Forgotten,2006
Holly Brook,"Cellar door, what's the use
Cellar door, are you open to find me
Iron ore shields remorse
When I look, I look to your beautiful name
And find you're not the same

Cellar door, what's the case
Are you locked in your shadow's embrace
Do you feel so insane
That you don't, you don't want to show me your face
But I, I can relate

Holding on to everything
That makes us bleed

Overflowing underneath my pretty face
With the presence of the haste
Now they're sayin' don't believe anything
But I do believe, I know you well

Cellar dooroligist
Your therapy is the one I love best
You give me strength to confess
That I, I will not last very long
So soon, I'll be gone

Oh, these walls know everything
And I'm tired of being lost inside

Overflowing underneath my pretty face
With the presence of the haste
Now they're sayin', don't believe anything
But I do believe I know you

Overflowing underneath my pretty face
With the presence of the haste
Now they're sayin', don't believe anything
But I do believe I know you

Love will come to me and I will not remain
Hover over these confused contaminated veins
Love will come to me and I will not remain
Hover over these confused contaminated veins

Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah

Holly Brook,"Someone tell me what to do
I feel like I must be a fool
For ending up right back at the start
The things that we don't comprehend
Are laughing at my mind again
I think that I think too hard
And I don't give enough credit to my heart

I'm so
Damn curious to know
And there are too
Many unanswered questions
Then we hold on to

I've put my theories to the test
You know I've tried to do my best
But maybe we weren't meant to strike gold 
Sometimes things that you ignore 
Are all the things I'm looking for
Will I learn to let go
Give into love and listen to my soul

I'm so
Damn curious to know
And there are too
Many unanswered questions
Then we hold on to

Portraits of your loved ones
Are more than what you see
All the elements they capture
Are more to you than me
A different dimension we've yet to define
There's a forest to cut through with thorns and vines
There is no reason to try",Curious,2006
Holly Brook,"Though I'm young and cynical
That''s not my only crime
I've been stealing all your cigarettes
To save another dime
In case you haven't noticed I just gave them all away

TELL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME NOW
THAT I'VE TRADED ALL MY ARMOR FOR A CROWN
COME ON WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ME NOW
THAT I'VE TAKEN DOWN THE MIRROR ON THE WALL
AND THE SWEET RAIN IS READY TO FALL
GIVING IT UP FOR YOU

Well I take a lot of medicine
I don't really need
I was drinking at eleven
Getting high at seventeen
So now I don't appreciate the taste of expensive bitter wine

TELL ME WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME NOW
THAT I'VE TRADED ALL MY ARMOR FOR A CROWN
COME ON WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ME NOW
THAT I'VE TAKEN DOWN THE MIRROR ON THE WALL
AND THE SWEET RAIN IS READY TO FALL

And kill another dove
But when your heart becomes a hunter
You may wound your chance to love",Giving It Up for You,2006
Holly Brook,"Now I've come to cry
Shed your skin to rest my naked eye
And criticize
All that I implore
Seems to be one foot outside that door
Coming between me and waking

Underneath the corset of your mystery
Piece by piece undress you from your history
I'm sleeping with seclusion in sweet disarray

You can go heavy on me
And I will not weigh you down, down, down
You can be steady and clean
I can take it
Heavy on me
And I will not weigh you down

Born unto this pride
Silence is something you can't hide
You can't deny us
Nothing has been said
Yet so many words have filled my head
Now they completely surround me

Tie the lines of honest conductivity
Caught between the center of our gravity
I don't have that much time to burn anymore",Heavy,2006
