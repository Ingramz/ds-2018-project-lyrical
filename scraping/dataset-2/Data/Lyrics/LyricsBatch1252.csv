Vikki Carr,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,1992
Vikki Carr,"Esos hombres
Que tanto los amamos
Y que nunca
Se pueden olvidar
Que nos hacen
Temblar con su presencia
Y con una mirada
Nos pueden desnudar

Esos hombres
Por quien lo damos todo
Golondrinas
Que vienen y se van
Que nos hacen
Sentir como una reina
Y con su indiferencia
Nos pueden destronar

Nos mienten
Nosotras perdonamos
Con todo
Nos vuelven a engañar
Se marchan
Seguros que esperamos
Y dejan entre lineas
Que pueden regresar

Esos hombres
Son fantasmas que aparecen
Que están en nuestra vida
Para bien o para mal
Que pueden con un beso
De nuevo hacer soñar
Que pueden darlo todo
Esos hombres
Que nos quieren cuando quieren
Que nunca nos retienen
Ni nos dan la libertad
Pero a pesar de todo
Difícil es amar
Si no es por esos hombres.

Que difícil
Vivir con esos hombres
Que nos tiene
Como una propiedad
Que no quieren
Saber de nuestros celos
Y viven exigiendo
Nuestra fidelidad

Nos mienten
Nosotras perdonamos
Con todo
Nos vuelven a engañar
Se marchan
Seguros que esperamos
Y dejan entre lineas
Que pueden regresar

Que están en nuestra vida
Para bien o para mal
Que pueden con un beso

Vikki Carr,"Recuerda que tu
Te marchaste
Y al despedirte
Sin importarte que lloraba
Te sonreíste

Pero de amor
Nadie se muere
Siempre decías

Y ahora
Tu me dices que
Te mueres
Que me extrañas
Que en verdad
Me quieres

Pero es tarde ya
Hay otro amor en tu lugar

Hay otro en tu lugar
Hay otro en tu lugar
Hay otro en tu lugar
Hay otro en tu lugar

Y es que el amor se acaba
Tu me lo decías
Sin importarte nada
Todo mi dolor
Pero como en la vida
Hasta la suerte cambia

Y es que el amor se acaba

En el amor
Como en la vida
Todo termina
La rosa
Quieras o no quieras
Tiene la espina

Y el tiempo
Borra la tristeza
Siempre decías

Y ahora
Tu me cuentas
Que estas triste
Que tu mundo
Sin mi amor
No existe

Vikki Carr,"Hasta siempre
te dije al despedirte
imposible
pensar en un adiós
pero el beso
que al irte me dejaste
dolió,
no era un beso para dos

Quedé quieta
mirándote alejarte
por momentos
mi corazón paró
se hizo un nudo
tan grande
en mi garganta,
dolió
y una lágrima asomó

Me dí cuenta,
sentí que te perdía
lo sabia
sentí pena de mi
dí la espalda
diciéndome a mi misma:
""Lo perdí""

Mala suerte,
si por amarte
hoy tengo que sufrir
por no tenerte
Si con tu adiós
estas abriéndome
una herida
si por mas que te pida
no vuelves junto a mi

Mala suerte,
porque te vas
y nada puedo hacer
por retenerte
Porque tu amor
está buscando
otra guarida
son cosas de la vida
tendrá que ser isa

Hasta siempre
te dije al despedirte
me mentía
quería una ilusión
al mal tiempo
le puse buena cara
y por dentro
escondí la procesión

Me dí cuenta
sentí que te perdía
Lo sabia
sentí pena de mi
dí la espalda

""Lo perdí""

Vikki Carr,"Adoro la calle en que nos vimos,
La noche cuando nos conocimos,
Adoro las cosas que me dices,
Nuestros ratos felices
Los adoro, vida mía.
Adoro la forma en que sonríes,
El modo en que a veces me riñes,
Adoro la seda de tus manos,
Los besos que nos damos,
Los adoro, vida mía.

Y me muero por tenerte junto a mi,
Cerca, muy cerca de mi,
No separarme de ti
Y es que eres mi existencia, mi sentir,
Eres mi luna, eres mi sol,
Eres mi noche de amor.

Adoro el brillo de tus ojos,
Lo dulce que hay en tus labios rojos,
Adoro la forma en que suspiras
Y hasta cuando caminas
Yo te adoro vida mía
Yo, yo te adoro, vida mía
Yo, yo te adoro, vida, vida mía.
Yo te adoro.",Adoro,1994
Vikki Carr,"Poor little, sad little blue Bluesette
Don't you cry, don't you fret,
You can bet one lucky day you'll waken,
And your blues will be forsaken,
Some lucky day lovely love will come your way.

If there is love in your heart to share,
Dear Bluesette don't despair
Some blue boy is waiting just like you,
To find a someone to be true to,
Two loving arms you can nestle in to stay.

Get set, Bluesette,
True love is coming,
Your lonely heart soon will be humming. 

Pretty little Bluesette, 
Musn't be a mourner,
Have you heard the news yet,
Love's 'round the corner.
Love wrapped in rainbows and tied with pink ribbons 
To make your your next springtime 
Your gold wedding ring time.",Bluesette,1994

Vikki Carr,"Me equivoqué contigo
Me equivoqué a lo macho
Como muy pocas gentes
Se habrán de equivocar

Te conocí en la iglesia
Y te mire en silencio
Por no turbar tú rezo
Que para mí es sagrado

Por tu carita buena
Por tu mirada clara
Por tantas otras cosas
Hubiera yo jurado

Pero qué triste realidad me has ofrecido
Que decepción tan grande haberte conocido
Quien sabe Dios porque te puso en mi camino

Me equivoqué contigo
Como si no supiera
Que las más grandes penas
Las debo a mis amores

Me equivoque contigo
Después de tantos años
De tantas amarguras
Y tantas decepciones

Pero te hallé en la iglesia
Y tu carita buena
Me hizo formar de nuevo
Un mundo de ilusiones

Pero qué triste realidad me has ofrecido
Que decepción tan grande haberte conocido
Quien sabe Dios porque te puso en mi camino

",Si Nos Dejan,1994
Vikki Carr,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love

Vikki Carr,"Love, look at the two of us
Strangers in many ways
We've got a lifetime to share
So much to say
And as we go on from day to day

I'll feel you close to me
But time alone will tell
Let's take a lifetime to say
I knew you well
For only time will tell us so
And love may grow for all we know

Vikki Carr,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,1996

por favor, que no se rompa.

Que no se rompa la noche,

como el tallo de la rosa,
que sea de luna blanca
con su escarcha y con sus sombras.

que tengo que amarte tanto,
que si la noche no acaba
yo te voy a enloquecer.

Vikki Carr,"Quisiera abrir lentamente mis venas,
Mi sangre toda verterla a tus pies,
Para poderte demostrar
Que más no puedo amar
Y entonces morir después.

Y sin embargo tus ojos azules,
Azul que tienen el cielo y el mar,
Viven cerrados para mí
Sin ver que estoy aquí
Perdido en mi soledad.

Sombras nada más
Acariciando mis manos,
Sombras nada más
En el temblor de mi voz.

Pude ser feliz
Y estoy en vida muriendo
Y entre lágrimas viviendo
El pasaje más horrendo
De este drama sin final.

Sombras nada más
Entre tu vida y mi vida,
Sombras nada más
Entre tu amor y mi amor.

Qué breve fue tu presencia en mi hastío,
Qué tibias fueron tus manos, tu voz;
Como luciérnaga llegó tu luz
Y disipó las sombras de mi rincón.

Y yo quedé como un duende temblando
Sin el azul de tus ojos de mar
Que se han cerrado para mí
Sin ver que estoy aquí
Perdido en mi soledad.

Sombras nada más
Acariciando mis manos,
Sombras nada más
En el temblor de mi voz.

Pude ser feliz

Then you had to come along
I fell in love with you first time
I looked into them there eyes
You've got a certain lil' cute way of flirtin'
With them there eyes
They make me feel happy, they make me blue
No stallin'
I'm fallin'
Going in a big way for sweet little you
My heart is jumpin'
You sure started somethin'
With them there eyes
You'd better watch them if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble
They're gonna get you in a whole lot of trouble
You're overworkin' 'em
There's danger lurkin' in
Them there eyes
Maybe you think I'm just flirtin'
Maybe you think I'm all lies
Just because I get romantic when I gaze in
Them there eyes
I fell in love with you first time

I held you right on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came
My eyes had a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command
I had your love on the tips of my fingers
But I let it slip right through my hands but I let it slip right through my hands

Vikki Carr,"This is the lesson taught to me
A long time ago at my mother's knee
She said, someday someone who loves you
Will make you cry
Though he loves you he'll hurt you
Till you feel you could die
But if he says forgive me
Forgive if you can
For you are his woman
And he is your man
When you're looking for roses
There are thorns you will meet
And remember my child
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
Well it's finally happened
Now it's my turn to cry
Oh my darling you've hurt me

Till I feel I could die
But you're saying forgive me
And I understand 
For I am your woman
And you are my man
Don't tell me about heartache
I've cried my share of tears
I've had my share of rain
But after the storm
No rain will appear
I just know when you hold me
My whole world is complete
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet
And the lesson is clear
Without any thorns the rose can't be sweet",The Lesson [*],2010
Vikki Carr,"No dejabas de mirar estabas sola
Completamente bella y sensual
Algo me arrastro hacia ti como una ola

Cazaste al aprendiz de seductor
Y me diste de comer sobre tu palma
Haciéndome tu humilde servidor

Que vuela a quien lo toma

Y tu no me dejaste ni hablar

Vikki Clayton,"Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again

And who knows where the time goes?",Who Knows Where the Time Goes?,1995
Vikki Clayton,"I think I'm goin' back
To the things I learned so well in my youth,
I think I'm returning to
The days when I was young enough to know the truth

Now there are no games
To only pass the time
No more coloring books,
No Christmas bells to chime
But thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win

I can recall a time,
When I wasn't afraid to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got
A lot more than a skipping rope to lift

Now there's more to do
Than watch my sailboat glide
Then everyday can be my magic carpet ride
And I can play hide and seek with my fears,
And live my life instead of counting my years

Let everyone debate the true reality,
I'd rather see the world the way it used to be
A little bit of freedom, all we're left
So catch me if you can
I'm goin' back

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,
I can remember

I can recall,

And I've survived through every bend 
You're just a page I need to turn and I'll be on my way
For me it's over not the end. 

Why should I stay and fight another lonely night?
I've got no reason to pretend. 
You lied too many times and I've got too much pride 
To let myself be fooled again. 

So if I turn you away, it's really nothing more 
Than my way to say that it's over. 
If I turn you away, you'll know the reason why 
I just couldn't stay anymore 

Somewhere a stranger waits for me with eyes to warm my soul 
His arms will hold me night and day. 
You taught me everything I know 'bout breaking hearts and so 
I think it's time for me to say 

You've had your way too long and I've been oh so wrong 
To be a fool and not be gone. 
I'll tell you here and now, I'll make it through somehow 
I'll find it easy to go on.

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Viktor Krauss,"My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will ride, as the cities fly by
And the tail-lights dissolve, in the coming of night
And the questions in thousands take flight

My love is a miles in the waiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
And the secret that burns and the pain that would stop
And it's [Incomprehensible]

Leading me on
Leading me down the road
Driving beyond
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red-eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while on the side

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back, no
There is no turning back, on the run

My love is in league with the freeway
Oh with the freeway and the coming of night-time
My love
My love is in league with the freeway

About the kidnap, blind fold, and the blind mouse
The coroner report say he simply signed out oh

And cut the mouth off of who ever comes out they teeth

V sell time to an inmate
And then tell him a rhyme for the hell of it to demonstrate

The beat sound like the underwater, make it from the slaughter

Even if you hear some wack shit you never give a chance
Some shit sound like all you could do on fit is riverdance
It's not a hobby, don't be sloppy
Doin deals with these labels is likened to a botched robbery

Nobody wanna hear that bullshit it's too morbid
It's no prints he hold the mic with a mic glove
And rolls dolo from state to state like Ike Love

Like on top of the world loser keep it gully
Rap creeps seem they got too much juice in they belly
It's why they brung V he still hungry
And spit something thick on the mic like a lungie

Mind ya daughter she on line for the water
To get lucky like when she found a quarter kinda sorta
Remember me God, clean timbs with emery board?
He only came to save the game like a memory card

Ooh shrewd, a lot of crews is too rude
And it's way too many let's not and say we do dudes
He said 24-7 I be on call
He use his vacation days to watch Babylon fall

Numbskulls.. get ta steppin' they dumb dull

Form blazin sword for the police robeast
Cochise, write a rhyme like a book report
And sell it to a rookie you could tell by the hook he bought

You ain't know he sell hooks and choruses?
They couldn't bang slang if they looked in thesauruses
It's like a friendly game of dodge ball
Oddball guard y'all, he played the garage wall

With the Stan Smith's checkerboard lace
And the brand new INF they ain't check the broad waist
You saw his face? so who next to get they neck chopped

You ain't have to tell V nothing
Trust him
It really ain't no time for discussion
He'll be back in ninety-three press of a button and they busted in
His first impulse was to smack the dirt
All four wore plain clothes and lumberjack shirt
Recognize one face from school six degrees ago
He'd snuff him in his braces just to switch the station to BGO
He kept a punch line every lunch break lunch time
And this is no time to pump fake it's crunch time
The same split second they let off the toast
That's when he hit the speed dial and sped off ghost
I know those cats don't like V
And if they took my head off they'd get off most likely
And probably thought the time gizmo was my wallet
And hit the hills forty more times on some foul shit
Pick a crime he was out in the nick of time
To get paid another day and live to kick a sicker rhyme
For illa it's like miller malt liquor time
Up town finery were it's probably not best to flaunt
Everyone's your best friend V steps into the restaurant
My friend he said you must be psychic
What's the price of fourteen
It's real you like it
Huh, be back at night the fourteen G pack was really packed tight
But back at the lab he found that the sleaze stack was right
Not only was it three cracks light between white
The test show lactose, ambisol
lecithin five types of aspirin and other kinds of medicines
Next time I'll bring my men who speak Mexican
And let the tech's spin
Make 'em contact the next of kin

Viktor Vaughn,"Confirmation of your worse fears
Ever since his first years had a thirst for beers
Back from the future, it'll make you more sober-er
And brought back a long list of fakers who crossed over

I'm like, fuck it, bubble-baller
Catch â??em up at Bob's show, stall him with a troubled caller
Bastard, who could make G's faster
Than a newly re-mastered while being truly plastered

There's four sides to every story
If these walls could talk, they'd probably still ignore me
Contemplate war over a cup of warm coffee
It's really getting gory, tell your problem to Maury

Don't bore V with the ""Glory, hallelu-ey""

I knew he had new G, who he? Viktor Vaughn
He had a new sicker song, I think he call it ""Lickupon""

Umm but uh, he study rhymes and patter-ins
Climb so steep sometimes the beat don't be mattering
Sounded like a half-dead from scurvy band rock
A programmed, computer bio-grafted Herbie Hancock

Maybe next life he'll try harder
Died a martyr at the hands of the fire-starter
More scripts ripped available for via barter
Transport a stack to the lab via charter

On the microphone he came to daze and amaze ya'
What a guy, practice banging flies with razors
And watch out for the robot, he got eyes with lasers
Tell â??em when they come with more topics besides blazers

Enough with the guns already, they're all toys and lames
The joy's in the aim, he asked him, how's ya' poison game?
Do you bust your crossbow? Also, more so
Accurate body blows to torso, thought so

These flows you won't find in no ""how-to""
If the blacksmith doubt you, he smack the shit out you
Make nothing gone, let nothing twitch
Just don't be near the mic when the on-button switch

V bring the beef like a trucker to Fuddrucker
Delivery to all y'all motherfuckers and bloodsucker
Coping more pleas than when a rap nigga bicker on
And that's my word is bond, I think he call it ""Lickupon""

Umm, he wrote this one with a fever sick in bed
With his dickhead inside a chickenhead
No, a dead chicken's head, he said it help his nausea
If he lost ya', wait â??til he tell you about the flying saucer

Dag, the kickback'll leave your wig ragged

Now who wants to buy a brand new tsetse fly call?
Alright y'all (zooom), the speed was break-neck
Faster than the hi-speed, dual cassette tape deck
(How far?) The distance was light-speed
He went to see a buddy who said he had some white weed
In case it might need, it didn't mean much
For in his lean clutch was the elusive green Dutch

Who that? Kinga, Vaughn's younger brother
A real live swinger who rock Louis Vuitton pleather
And he walk around like he think he king
Even made the hood-rats stop to kiss his pinky ring
Like a soup sandwich on a hand dish
Some say his language is way too outlandish
He did his thing, spoke in a jig slang
And translate Einstein's theory of the Big Bang
He told his boo: ""Boo, I put a spell on you
Stay with me, whether we broke or we well-to-do
If it don't work, the hell with â??cha
May the doorknob hit â??cha where the poor slob bit â??cha""

Part Zimbabwean and part Trini mixed in
Big shot, sold a guy a pound of pig snot
Said it was proven to remove stains and ink spots
Kinky flow, dripped down her leg to her pinky toe
Jiggy hoe, who don't know as much as she think she know
One week she stepped to him like a Slinky, yo'
Wig like a mink skin, soft like Twinkie dough
Then she kissed the queen, and told her she need Listerine

To take a piss then help the teacher

And it's waitin' in the beakers the bite on teen features
The preachers come with sermons and parents pack bleachers

On the radio, mack the knife
I watched him freeze roaches and bring 'em straight back to life
He used a different approach than I ever read
The only thing he ever said was 'the roach is never dead'
We studied transfigurations and different ways
To break the trance off the nigga nations
It's even bigger with the Haitians, no time for litigations

And that was science for the head, so we did the knowledge and sped to the shed
Mixin' dog bone with egg

Ever later, use her to carbonate her
Scoop her in the butter, soft of a spoon roof navigator
Or the land or the lex or the benz

My boys warned me you was poison like BBD first cassette
And still I put all my chips on the worst bet
Gave up the skirt, now I gotta hear it from the street
How dare you drag my name in the dirt and cheat
You could've broke it off and ended it and dip
And if you spoke soft we could've still preserved the friendship
Now you apologize, that's what they all say
You wasn't sorry when you sucked him off in the hallway
But have it your way, raw, no foreplay
That's you if you want a dude who wear a mask all day
And just to think I used to be proud of you
And you had some real good power

Probably kissed me later that evening, I should be hurling
Matter of fact, gimme back my bracelet and my Shearling
I rather waste it or give it to your girlfriend
She did let me stab it last week while you was workin'
Remember our vacation out to Maryland
I dooked the maid Carolyn, she made me throw the towel in
Like all foul men the time I hit your moms off
I told her knock it off but she had to set the rocket off

Surrounded by city and by sea

As if to say, ""I despise
Such poisonous family ties""

Could never forget or neglect her
It carries her home and closes her eyes

Swallows the water
Fixes her face like a good little daughter

Por cada esquina de esta ciudad
Sigo hechando de menos

Que ya no me das

Sigo teniendo los mismos defectos
Que nunca pudistes arreglar
Sigo perdiendo el tiempo con
Fotografias que me hacen llorar

Sigo pensando en los
Buenos momentos
Que ya no regresaran

Y vuelvo a ir contra la corriente
Vuelvo a luchar con mi soledad
Vuelvo a sonar que despierto
Pegada a tu cuerpo
Queried olvidar que no estas

Y vuelvo a ir contra la corriente
Bus cuando formas para ocultar
Que nose bien lo que siento
Y nose sí quiero seguir

Que nunca e podido evitar
Sigo esperando que habras la puerta
Que nunca debimos cerrar

You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

When I was down you just stood there grinnin'
You got a lot of nerve to say you got a helping hand to lend
You just wanna be on the side that's winnin'

You say I let you down, you know it's not like that
If you're so hurt why then don't you show it
You say you lost your faith, but that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose and you know it

I know the reason that you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd you're in with
Do you take me for such a fool to think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide what he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street, you always act surprised
You say, 'how are you, good luck,' but you don't mean it
When you know as well as me you'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once and scream it

No I do not feel that good when I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief perhaps I'd rob them
Now I know you're dissatisfied with your position and your place
Can't you understand that's not my problem

Well I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment I could be you
Yes I wish that for just one time you could stand inside my shoes
You know what a drag it is to see you

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So
 
[Chorus]
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town",Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,1997

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph.
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords.

I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book.
I'd love to turn you on

Woke up, fell out of bed,
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
And looking up I noticed I was late.
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream

They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

Down around San Antone
They love to go all night and treat you right
And party till the cows come home
 
I love it when the let their hair down
And dance real close to you
You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do
What the cowgirls do

They ain't no different up in Oklahoma
They ain't afraid to stay up til dawn
They love to cut a run and chug a lug

You know I'm a sucker baby for what the cowgirls do

Vince Gill,"Love sure is something no one can explain
It can bring you such joy, it can bring you pain
And with every emotion, love puts us through
There's nothing you can say, when love finds you

Love is the power that makes your heart beat
It can make you move mountains, make you drop to your knees
When it finally hits you, you won't know what to do
There's nothin' you can say, when love finds you

[Chorus]
Give it all you can give it, when your love comes around
If you put your heart in it, then it won't let you down
You'll find out it's true, baby, someday when love finds you

And when you least expect it, it will finally come true
There's nothing you can say when love finds you

Vince Gill,"The face of an angel; pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees; and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

I feel so helpless; I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, bu the words can't be found
Whenever you come around

I get weak in the knees; and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around

And when you smile that smile
The whole world turns upside down

When it comes to the affairs of your heart

Well I've heard you say how much you love him
You think someday you'll be his bride
Baby, you just can't trust him
'Cause I've known the boy all of my life

So you better think twice before you roll the dice
You better think twice before you give you heart away

You really must think I'm something
Talkin' trash about my best friend
I just hate to se eyou wind up with nothing
'Cause you're way too good for him
And I know that you don't believe me
But I've been with him when he's runnin' around
He don't mean to hurt nobody
He ain't never gonna settle down

Vince Gill,"Troubles and trials often betray those 
On in the weary body to stray 
But we shall walk beside the still waters 
With the Good Shepherd leading The Way 

Those who have strayed were sought by The Master 
He who once gave His life for the sheep 
Out on the mountain still He is searching 
Bringing them in forever to keep 

Going up home to live in green pastures 
Where we shall live and die never more 
Even The Lord will be in that number 
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore 

We will not heed the voice of the stranger 
For he would lead us to despair 
Following on with Jesus our savior 
We shall all reach that country so fair

Where we shall live and die never more 
Even The Lord will be in that number 
When we shall reach that Heavenly Shore

To buy a loaf of bread and an ice cream cone
He never knew the danger of talking to a stranger
Now the boy can't find the way back home

Won't you be the children's eyes they're all alone

The hardest part's not knowing
Where they are or where they're going
Won't you help the children find
The way back home

The faces on milk cartons thrown away and soon forgotten
What if one of those sweet kids was your very own
Tonight those kids are weeping while yours are safely sleeping
Won't you help the children find the way back home

Can't you hear the prayers
Of every childlike heart tonight?

Denver snow falling,
Somebody said it's four feet deep.

Give me the laughter;
I'm gonna choose to keep
Another tender Tennessee Christmas,

Maybe tinsel town's for me.

We'd have it made there;
Bring home a tan for new year's eve.
Sure sounds exciting,
Awfully inviting,

Still I think I'll gonna keep
Another tender Tennessee Christmas,
The only Christmas for me.
Where the love circles around us,

It's a warm holiday;
It's the only place to be.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.

Vince Gill,"I was there to buy a pistol. She was there to hock her ring.
The broker in that pawnshop deals in almost anything.
He'll pay you for your misery 
or he'll sell you someone's pain,
And that twinkle in his greedy eyes says your loss will be his gain.

She stood back in the shadows as the broker dealt with me.
Her eyes were dark and desperate from some private misery.
His word was so prophetic when he said, 
You've got a steal.
I said, ""Throw in one bullet, and you've got yourself a deal.""

A Saturday night special is an easy thing to buy.
All you've got to be is 21, or 15 if you lie.
Just hand the man the money, and if someone's got to die,
The broker in the pawnshop won't even blink an eye.

He handed me the pistol, and I was almost to the door,
When I heard him tell the lady, ""Seven dollars, nothing more.""
The lady started crying as he took her wedding band.
My hand was in my pocket, and the gun was in my hand.
I had planned to use that bullet on myself, to end my life.

I was once somebody's husband. She was once somebody's wife.
I usually mind my business but I could not walk away,
His dollars just weren't making sense, and I knew I had to stay.
The broker's face turned pasty when he caught my icy stare.
It would never leave my pocket, but he knew the gun was there.
I asked him what his life was worth, and he opened up that drawer.
For a simple golden wedding band, he paid two thousand more.

That Saturday night was special even though it wasn't planned.
As we walked down the sidewalk, she reached and took my hand.
We crossed a bridge, and I took that gun and sailed it through the air.
I said, ""Ever been to Texas?"" she said, ""I think I'd love it there.""

A Saturday night special is an easy thing to buy,
All you've got to be is 21, or 15 if you lie.

But you can't buy a pistol there, you can't hock your wedding ring",Saturday Night Special,1998

Vince Gill,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor I see it there below 
A city with a legend, the West Texas city of El Paso 
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl 
And a little place called Rosa's where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl 

I don't recall who sang the song but I recall a story that I heard 
And as I look down on this city I remember each and every word 
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy and the way he used a gun 
To kill another cowboy, then he had to leave El Paso on the run 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
The cowboy lived and rode away but love was strong he couldn't stay 
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
I try not to let you cross my mind but still I find
There's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand 

My mind is down there somewhere as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico 
I can't explain why I should know the very trail he rode back to El Paso 
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time 
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time 

Somewhere in my deepest thoughts familiar scenes and memories unfold 
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long, but I have never told 
Like everytime I fly up through the heavens and I see you there below 
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso 

El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in the mystery 
That died there in that desert sand so long ago 
El Paso City 
By the Rio Grande 
A voice tells me to go and seek, another voice keeps telling me 
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Hag, it must have been a real mean bottle
That made you play the blues that way

A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil
It's a miracle you're standin' here today
A real mean bottle made you such a rebel
It must've been a real mean bottle made you sing that way

A real mean bottle poured straight from the devil
It must've been a real mean bottle made you sing that way

Vince Gill,"I saw an old lover today on the street
She said, ""Do you remember how we used to be
On fire with that passion, we'd burn down those nights?""
No I haven't forgotten how we used to fight

I finally got married and settled on down
Yeah she's a preachers daughter in a sleepy little town
Does she make you laugh since we said goodbye?
No she ain't that funny but she never makes me cry

She never makes me cry like you used to
There's nothing about her that reminds me of you
I promise I don't see your face when I look in her eyes
And she never makes me cry

Does she make you beg for her love in the night?
No, she ain't that selfish and she never makes me cry

She never makes me cry like you used to
There's nothing about her that reminds me of you
I promise I don't see your face when I look in her eyes

She never makes me wonder when she's coming home
There's something about her like I've never known
It's been nice to see you but now I must say goodbye
She never makes me cry, she never makes me cry, no, no

She never makes me cry
She never makes me cry

Vince Gill,"I wipe a tear away
As I give up this day
Wondering if I'll ever find someone
When I close my eyes and dream
These are the words I'm whispering
Someday, love will come.

My head up in the cloud 
And certain as the morning sun 
I will always believe there is somebody just for me 
Someday, love will come.

After all these nights of waiting 
And someday
I'll find a chance worth taking

To save the best for last

I guess nothin' stays the same

I'll miss you when you're gone

And the things that we've been through
C.F. Martin built him
Back in nineteen forty-two

I remember when we met
I was only seventeen
I spent all my college money
On a half a dozen strings

I thought my folks would kill me
I found out I was wrong
They said your future's written on your face
When you sing those travelin' songs

So we headed for Kentucky
With a suitcase full of dreams
My rough-out books, a few T-shirts
A worn out pair of jeans, ooh

This old guitar and me
We spent a lot of nights alone
Well, sometimes we'd get lucky
And take bar maid home

One night stands for breakfast
Two strangers with the blues
We'd wake up in the morning
And both feel a little used

Well, home was just a highway
We'd roam from town to town
Just me and that old flattop
Not caring where we're bound

From Maine to California
With a five piece travelin' band
Singin' songs about the hard times
That face the common man, ooh

This old guitar and me
Lord, we did the best we could
One was born a sinner
And one a piece of wood

God sent a wooden angel
To guide me on my way
We were meant to be together
Until my dyin' day

Well, now my dearest old companion
Lies underneath my bed
Well, our travelin' days are over
Man, but the memories fill my head

Well, I've settled with my family
Here in the hills of Tennessee
To teach my children's children
'Bout this old guitar and me, ooh

We'd float that boat down old Whippoorwill River

And its simple pleasures

Then I met a girl
With a head full of curls
A pure and innocent heart

And when weekends would come
Wild horses couldn't keep us apart.

On the humble side of town
There stands a little Christmas tree
It looks a lot like Charlie Brown's

And underneath there's one little gift for him
And one little gift for her

After six months on the new job
They're still barely getting by
So in the way of decorations
There's nothing there to catch your eye

But both of them would be the first to say
We're together, we're gonna have the merriest Christmas anyway

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
That's where the feeling starts
And like a fire inside, it touches every part
Christmas is all in the heart

And even if no white snow falls
Well, that's all right because
The joy can still be found, wherever you are
Christmas is all, all in the heart

Two little blond haired boys with big dreams
Tried to sleep but sleep wouldn't come
And we'd be tearing into presents
Long before the break of dawn

With mom and dad and cameras making sure
We'd never forget that day, no, no, no

Now I'm the one who's taking pictures
In the middle of the night
Of my own little dreamers
That just can't wait until daylight

And in my sleepy eyes the spark still glows
Well, I guess there's just some things a kid never outgrows

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
That's where the feeling starts
And like a fire inside, it touches every part
Christmas is all in the heart

And even if no white snow falls
Well, that's all right because
The joy can still be found, wherever you are
Christmas is all, all in the heart

No, it's not in the snow that may or may not fall
And it's not in the gifts around the tree
It's in the love Heaven gave, that night our Savior came
And that same love can still be found wherever you are

'Cause Christmas is all in the heart
And the joy can still be found, wherever you are
'Cause Christmas is all, all in the heart
It's all in the heart

A heaven of diamonds 
Shine down through the night

In spite of the chilling weather . . .

In the lane, snow is glistening 
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight 
Walking in a winter wonderland 

Gone away is the bluebird 
Here to stay is a new bird 
He sings a love song, as we go along 
Walking in a winter wonderland 

In the meadow we can build a snowman 
And pretend that he is Parson Brown 
He'll say, are you married, we'll say, no man 
But you can do the job while you're in town 

Later on we'll conspire 
As we dream by the fire 
To face unafraid the plans that we made

At a table all alone
A candle burnin' in the darkness
His glass of wine was almost gone

And something about him felt familiar
And it made me stop and stare
The way he held his hands before him
Looked like he was lost in prayer

Hey son, what are you lookin' at?
Why do your eyes look so sad?
There's somethin' in the way he sat there
It made me think about my dad

I'm lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

Hey son, why don't you pull up one of those empty chairs?
Bring it over here by my side
Buy me a glass of wine
This looks like a real good place to hide

You know I've always been a fisherman
Fishin' for souls along the way
You kind of remind me of my only son
And I lost him 33 years ago today

I'm lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
I know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

There's somethin' I must give you
The compass that my father made
It'll point you in the right direction
In case you ever lose your way

You know I've got somethin' here in my pocket
This is little silver cross
I think my son would want you to have it
When you think all the hope is lost

We're lookin' for the answer
Just like everyone
We know that there's no ending
To the love between a father and the son

And Hag about misery and gin

And the bartender said it's closing time

Oh I wonder if she's having trouble sleeping

And if those songs keep on runnin' through her mind

Vince Gill,"Well, I left Oklahoma
Driving in a Pontiac,
Just about to lose my mind.
I was going to Arizona,
Maybe on to California
Where people all live so fine.

My mother says I'm crazy,
My baby calls me lazy,
But I'm gonna show them all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and
I don't need no more damn schoolin'.
I was born to just walk the line.

Gonna set my watch back to it
'Cause you know that I've been through it.
Living on Tulsa time.

So there I was in Hollywood,
Thinking I was doing good,
Talking on the telephone line.
They don't want me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs;
My mama says my baby's doing fine.

So then I started winking,
Then I started thinking
That I really had a flash this time.
That I had no bussiness leaving,
And nobody would be grieving;
You see I'm on Tulsa time.

Gonna set my watch back to it

Vince Gill,"Virgil Caine is the name
And I served on the Danville train
'Til stone man's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again

In the winter of '65
We were hungry just barely alive
By May the tenth, when Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so. well

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
Said, ""Virgil, quick come see'
There goes Robert E Lee""

And I don't mind choppin' wood
And I don't care if my money's no good
Ya take what ya need and ya leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Like my father before me I'm a workin' man
And like my brother above me who took a rebel stand
He was just eighteen, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave

And I swear by the mud
Below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up
When he's in defeat

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went na, na, na, na, na, na

Gee, it's been a long, long while
After all that I've been through
Just cause I'm in love with you
But there will come a day, you'll see
You won't have control of me
You can't hurt me like you do
Just cause I'm in love with you

To think that I had been permitted to see a part of nature's plan
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more than the selfishness in man.

Little children painting pictures of the birds and apple trees
Oh, why can't the grown up people have the faith of one of these
And to think those tiny fingers might become a killer's hand
Oh, there's nothing that stands out more than the selfishness in man.

Then perhaps in his great wisdom we might learn to understand
Then there'd be no shame or sorrow and no selfishness in man.

While a dark-eyed girl sang, and played the guitar
Hookers, and hustlers, filled up the room

It's a cold situation
If that -- that don't -- kill you soon

And on the wings of angels you will fly

And you wrestled with your demons till the end
But it’s your laughter and your songs that I’ll be missing

Oh it’s hard to think about eternity

Seems the land of opportunity for me is just a curse
Tell that judge in Bakersfield, my trial I'll have to wait

She was shiverin' in the dark, so I offered her a ride
Three bank jobs later, four cars hotwired

There wasn't one Lincoln and there wasn't one Dodge
Wasn't one Japanese model or make

About the Savior and the woman at the well
Said it ain't for me to judge this life you're leading

If you ain't too proud to get down on your knees

Womens and wine and whiskey for dinner
Oh, I knew I was in trouble the first time I seen her
I went and married that contemporary Christian singer.
Yes I did

Well now I run for home when it's closing time
I read my Holy Bible and I walk the mile
I can't wait to see what my baby's gonna do to me
A little guitar slinger

Well, there's a few licks left in this guitar slinger
Even though half of my stuff's in the Cumberland River
Well, now all I really need is just one six stringer
Yeah, I might have slowed down a little but buddy, I can still bring her.

Hell I'ma gonna show her when it's party time
See everybody dancin' and we'll feel so fine
If y'all just show up and shift for me I swear I'll play for free
I'll be your guitar slinger
Yeah I'll be your little guitar slinger baby",Guitar Slinger,2011
Vince Gill,"If I die a drinkin', I won't feel much pain
'Cause Lord we all got demons that drive us all insane
I'll die just like my daddy with a bottle in my hand
So if I die a drinkin', that's just who I am

If I die a cheatin' in the arms of another's girl
If in a fit of rage and jealousy, he takes me from this world
I can't say I'd blame him, I'd probably do the same
So if I die a cheatin', I'll live with the shame

If I die a singer of some old lonesome song
We're all drawn to heartache when someone's done you wrong
The last song I'll be playin' is “When the Saints Go Marching In”
So if I die a singing, Lord, my song will never end

If I die a prayin' to Jesus on my knees
Everyone I've ever loved will be waiting there for me
The dirt can have my body but the Lord He owns my soul
So if I die a praying, Lord, I ain't afraid to go
If I die a praying, Lord, I ain't afraid to go",If I Die,2011
Vince Gill,"Out on Route 66, way back in the sticks
Out on the old Chisolm trail
Just east of El Reno next to Ted's Escondido
Sat the old Lucky Diamond Motel

Lucille and Madonna slinging cheese enchiladas
Chain smoking non-filtered Pall Malls
Old men shooting pool and cursing like fools
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

[Chorus]
Yeah the old Lucky Diamond, Lucky Diamond Motel
The Queen of the old mother road
There's color TV and the kids eat for free
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

There's air streams and truckers and two timing lovers
Teenagers out raising hell
There's cowboys and Shriners and old five and dimers
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

Room 23 was the first time for me
A stripper named Rita Cantrell
I spent all of my money on that sweet Spanish honey
At the old Lucky Diamond Motel

[Chorus]

Oh the sign said, we doze but we never do close
I remember her red dress so well
Old Rita's passed on, the neon sign's gone

Just tore down the wall, a piece of America fell
Now I'm all for progress, but God knows that I miss

You done me wrong for years
I hope someday you suffer too
And shed a million tears

There on our wedding night
The warm glow of your heart so gay
And your eyes blue shining bright
 
Your lips were like a rose red wine
The stars alone can yield
My one and only valentine
My lily of the field

A man of worldly charms
Who turned our whole world upside down
And stole you from my arms
 
Our love was like a sacred scroll
You never did learn to read
I gave to you my heart and soul
And you left it there to bleed

Down through our golden years
You broke my heart and left me blue
To shed a million tears

But that's something I can't do

And cupid fired a shot

And our dreams were one of bliss

And the nights were like a kiss

With a trace of misty morning
And the promise of tomorrow in her eyes

And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day

Vince Gill,"Got on a bus in Memphis
Destination Rome
Georgia ain't no paradise
But a place I just call home

I sat next to a broken hearted bride
She was cryin', tryin' so hard to hide
Her selfish sorrow

I tried to get her talkin'
She didn't have much to say
She asked me for a map to death row
But I didn't know the way

She had lost a million in the game
One look out the window
At the pine trees and the rain
It wasn't her day

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever seen
Multicolored lady
Angry red, passion blue
But mostly shades of green

Midnight came and brought more rain
Nothing seemed to ease her pain
The hours that we talked
Seemed like minutes all in vane

I watched
As her tears kept runnin' wide
Bye and bye and bye, way back after a while
She started smilin'

Multicolored lady
You ain't like no rainbow I've ever known
Multicolored lady
Come go with me, I'll take you to my home

Oh, by the way, I'm bound for Rome

",Multi-Colored Lady,2014
Vince Gill,"Well, I've got to run to keep from hiding,
And I'm bound to keep on riding.
And I've got one more silver dollar,

But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no,
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.

And I don't own the clothes I'm wearing,
And the road goes on forever,
And I've got one more silver dollar,

But I'm not gonna let them catch me, no
Not gonna let 'em catch the Midnight Rider.

And I've gone by the point of caring,
Some old bed I'll soon be sharing,
And I've got one more silver dollar,

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.

But I'm not gonna let 'em catch me, no
Not gonna let them catch the Midnight Rider.

On one cold and cloudy day

For to carry my mother away

By and by, Lord, by and by
There's a better home a-waiting

A heartache here is but a stepping stone
Along a path that's winding always upward

Until then with joy I'll carry on
Until the day my eyes behold my Saviour
Until the day God calls me home

You gotta walk it by yourself,
Nobody here can walk it for you,
You gotta walk it by yourself.

Some people say that John was a Baptist,
Some folks say he was a Jew,
But your holy scripture tells you
That he was a preacher too.

Daniel was a Bible hero,
Was a prophet brave and true,
In a den of hungry lions
Proved what faith can do for you.

There's a road that leads to glory
Through a valley far away,
Nobody else can walk it for you,
They can only point the way.

Sister does and brother, too,
They may beg you to go with them,
But they cannot go for you.

That drowns the tender reed""
Some say, ""Love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed""

Some say, ""Love, it is a a hunger
An endless aching need""
I say, ""Love, it is a flower
And you it's only seed""

It's the heart that fears breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking
That never takes the chance

It's the one, who won't be taken
Who can not seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Life's the seed, that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose

Vince Giordano,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004
Vince Giordano & the Nighthawks,"Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got a shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock. 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock, 
Plymouth Rock would land on them. 

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking. 
But now, God knows, 
Anything goes. 
Good authors too who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose. 
Anything goes. 
If driving fast cars you like, 
If low bars you like, 
If old hymns you like, 
If bare limbs you like, 
If Mae West you like, 
Or me undressed you like, 
Why, nobody will oppose. 
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in- 
Truding in nudist parties in 
Studios. 
Anything goes. 

When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her, 
Then I suppose 
Anything goes. 
When Rockefeller still can hoard en- 
Ough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows, 
Anything goes. 
The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today, 
And black's white today, 
And day's night today, 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux. 
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clo'es, 
Anything goes. 

If Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction, 
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes. 
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now turns a handspring landing up- 
On her toes, 
Anything goes. 
Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From that news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
(If any brains you've got) 
From those little radios. 
So Missus R., with all her trimmin's, 
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows 
Anything goes.",Anything Goes,2004
Vince Giordano & the Nighthawks,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic 
That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed,

At least it'll tell you 
How great you are.

Vince Guaraldi Trio,"Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
Sweet and lovely
Heaven must have sent him my way

Skies above me
Never were as blue as his eyes
And he loves me
Who would want a sweeter surprise?

When he nestles in my arms so tenderly
There's a thrill that words cannot express
In my heart a song of love is taunting me
Melody haunting me

Sweet and lovely
Sweeter than the roses in May
And he loves me
There is nothing more I can say

Vince Guaraldi Trio,"Make it mine
Make it mine
Please, make it mine

Three coins in the fountain
Each one seeking happiness
Thrown by three hopeful lovers
Which on will the fountain bless

Three hearts in the fountain
Each heart longing for its home
There they lie in the fountain
Somewhere in the heart of Rome

Which one will the fountain bless
Which one will the fountain bless

Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
Just one wish will be granted
One heart will wear a valentine

Vince Guaraldi Trio,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1957
Vince Guaraldi Trio,"I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love.

Tell me please,
Where can he be,
The loving he who'll bring to me
The harmony I'm dreaming of.

It'll be goodbye, I know
To my tale of woe,
When he says ""Hello!""

So I am just a little girl
Who's looking for a little boy
Who's looking for a girl to love!",Looking for a Boy,1957
Vince Guaraldi Trio,"Yesterdays, yesterdays
Days I knew as happy
Sweet sequester days
Olden days, golden days
Days of mad romance and love

Then gay youth was mine, truth was mine
Joyous free and flaming life
Forsooth, was mine
Sad am I, glad am I

Vince Guaraldi Trio,"Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a pluma 
Que o vento vai levando peloar
Voa tao leve Mas tem a vida breve       
Precisa que haja vento sem parar...

A felicidade do pobre parece 
A grande ilusao do carnaval, 
A gente trabalha o ano inteiro
Por um momento de sonho 
Pra fazer a fantasia
 
de rei, ou de pirata, ou jardineira 
E tudo se acabar na quarta feira
Tristeza nao tem fim Felicidade, sim...
A felicidade é como a gota de orvalho 
Numa pétala de  flor
Brilha tranqüila Depois de leve oscila     
E cai como uma lágrima de amor
A minha felicidade está sonhando 
Nos olhos da minha namorada
E como esta noite 
Passando, passando 
Em busca da madrugada 
Falem baixo por favor
Pra que ela acorde alegre como o dia   
Oferecendo beijos de amor 
Tristeza nao tem fim

Vince Guaraldi Trio,"A day in the life of a fool
A sad and a long, lonely day
I walk the avenue hoping I'll run into
The lovely sight of you coming my way

I stop right across from your door
But you don't see me anymore
So back to my room I go with a gloom
And I cry tears of goodbye

Tears of goodbye",Samba de Orfeu,1962
Vince Guaraldi Trio,"When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you",Since I Fell for You,1962

Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year

Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Wie treu sind deine Blätter!
Do grünst nicht nur
Zur Sommerzeit,
Nein auch I'm Winter, wenn es schneit.

Wie treu sind deine Blätter!

O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!
Do kannst mir sehr gefallen!
Wie oft hat nicht zur Weihnachtszeit
Ein Baum von dir mich hoch erfreut!
O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!
Do kannst mir sehr gefallen!

O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!
Dein Kleid will mich
Was lehren:
Die Hoffnung und Beständigkeit
Gibt Trost und Kraft
Zu jeder Zeit.
O Tannenbaum, o Tannenbaum!
Das soll dein Kleid
Mich lehren.

Vince Guaraldi Trio,"A month of nights, a year of days
Octobers drifting into Mays
You set your sail when the tide comes in
And you cast your fate to the wind

You shift your course along the breeze
Won't sail up wind on memories
The empty sky is your best friend
And you just cast your fate to the wind

That time has such a way of changing a man throughout the years
And now you're rearranging your life through all your tears
Alone, alone

There never was, there couldn't be
A place in time for men to be
Who'd drink the dark and laugh at day
And let their wildest dreams blow away

So now you're old, you're wise, you're smart
You're just a man with half a heart
You wonder how it might have been
Had you not cast your fate to the wind",Cast Your Fate to the Wind,1996
