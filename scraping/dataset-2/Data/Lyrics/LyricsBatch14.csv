Locked up, they won't let me out,
And I had a long day in court **** stressed me out,
Won't gimme the bail they can't get me out,
Now I'm headed to the county,
Gotta do a bid here, im used to living luxurous,
I don't wana live here, the walls is gray the clothes is orange,
The phones is broke, the food is garbage,
A lot a niggas is livin with these circumstances,
Sp's the same i still murk ya manz'z ,
Drug money to rap money work advances,
Niggas ran and told that i shoulda murked to kansas,
Niga got popped for a murda attempt,
Knocked me on d block when i was burning the hemph,
Had a brick in the stash hope they don't take to a further extent,
Locked up and they wont let me out,
When i hit my cell block, niggas know to get me out.

[AKON]
Im steady tryna find a motive,
Why do what I do.
Freedom aint gettin no closer,
No matter how far i go,
My car is stolen, no registration,
Cops partolin, and now they done stop me,
And i get locked up,

[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Akon]
Headin up town to re up,
Back with a couple peeps,
Corner blocks on fire,
Under covers dressed as feens,
Makin so much money,
Products movin' fast,
Put away the stash,
And as i sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up

[CHORUS]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

[Styles P]
Now that im locked up i rep two sets so
Ima ride or die and stay d blocked up
Two tooth brushes up,
Whoever wanted with p
When i walk by nigga get up,
Cuz im locked up they cant get me out,
I smoke a stick of haze when they stress me out,
Go and hit the bar when the reds be out,
Cant wait for the day when they let me out,

[Akon]
Cuz visitation no longer comes by,
Seems like they forgot about me,
Commissary is getting empty,
My cell mates getting food without me,
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life,
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I get locked up

[CHORUS]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (my nigga im locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (cuz im locked up)

Akon,"I'm from the hard knock academy
Automatically had to be
Carryin' automatics sprayin' sparatic inaccurate
Clips to the back of it
Barrel cockin' it immaculate
Learn to move packages in n out of Los Angeles
We savages, bustin' off rounds sprayin' banana clips
Knockin' pills off like Anna Nicole Smith
Shit, I'm in the hood walkin' with choppers
Cock em and pop em coppers glauks be talkin' like
Blockedie block, block I'll probably popped Hoffa and possibly jus forgot where I tossed em
This niggas obnoxious, me and top got your picture in the cockpit
She wanna pit stop, jus see how the cock spit
These boss's deposit the profit they watch as we cop it on top of the ostrich and fox's
It use to be the lil guys in stress now Ima boss where I'm from, with the last stress on my chest

See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba
Know me, yah Know how I Do
The way that I move nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
Cause I'm to smooth Nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
I thought you knew nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
You ain't got a clue Nigga (yah neva gonna get it)

Who in the hell left the gate open? (Drama)
I'm pretty down for the wild, wild west
Like them 1800's in em stage coaches
If I ain't strapped then my blaze pokin'
If it ain't a 600 big body then the 6 4-0 honey is spokin'
The drama spokesman, streets endorsed em
I rather be up in my nine then closed in my coffin
I'm from Wes Covina, this ain't Compton
Still money passed around like we takin' an offerin'
I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
When they see the sad happy faces they know the drama is on
Its the west coast back at your front door
We up close and personal, we ain't done till the curtains close
Could be friend or foe, love it or hate it
I'm the king but I play with the Aces
Run up to find out I keep it loaded like bases
Yah wise in your mouth but need braces

See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through

Cause I'm to smooth Nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
I thought you knew nigga (yah neva gonna get it)
You ain't got a clue Nigga (yah neva gonna get it)

See when I walk through the door
I wonderin' why these fake Niggas jackin' me for?
On display like I came from the store
Posin' like a mannequin in front of your hoe
Up front blockin' 151 peep now
Convicts Surround the whole compound
Cause you don't really want what your starin' at
Clip full of Bullets, don't mind sharin' that thing

See I know you'll like my swagger
No strap when I come through
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba

You're an alcoholic
You're an alcoholic red nose reindeer like Rudolph
I'm here to tear the roof off
And if you want to take it to the guns, I'ma shoot off

Your head before you reach for the pistol
And when the bartender turns around I'ma reach for the Cristal
You not ready for this style, I'm straight Psycho wit it
And I bet you in love with, yeah Psycho hit it

A long time ago, I'ma keep doing my thizzle
Till it's time to go, but for now it's time to blow
Good as me in the club popping bubbly
I can't complain life is lovely
Either you hate me or you love me

Fans wanna know when the Nuts is gonna come next
It doesn't matter competition is no contest
I don't mean to brag, I'm just being honest
Where my dogs at smoking up at the college?

Clap your hands to the beat and get your bounce on
Put your drinks up, if your blazing get you ounce on
Girl I'd house you, but this ain't no house song
And no kissing, I dunno what you had your mouth on

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Look, don't approach me in a physical manner
'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer

I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas
I speak through those switches, spit like Obama
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
Thats A to the K with a fucking bandanna

Seize your empire, believe in no lies
Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire

That's it though, no more games
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuffs
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

I'm steady tryna find a motive,
Why do what I do?,
Freedom ain't gettin' no closer,
No matter how far I go,
My car is stolen, no registration,
Cops patrolling, and now they done stop me,
And I get locked up,

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out

Headin' up town to re-up,
Back with a couple keys,
Corner blocks on fire,
Under covers dressed as fiends,
Makin' so much money,
Products movin' fast,
Put away the stash,
And as I sold the last bag fucked around and got locked up

They won't let me out, they won't let me out, (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they wont let me out, (I got locked up)

Holla for the gold
Some say I'm to drunk
Some say I'm to blowed
And rollin kilos I'm stackin these C notes
Watchin my cheeses grow and blowin on trees though
And I really can't help it I'm addicted to time gorilla grind
And no time for groupies or free stylin
Want it green as a getco I'm respectful to some of you'll
But some of you'll be frontin I don't owe shit to none of you'll

Watch for the kiss
I stay calm under pressure
By any means or measure
Remember ones trash is another mans treasure
Business before pleasure I'm disciplined and I'm forced
While you rap cats battle to see who dopest
I'm in the trenches face down in the game bra
And can't nobody no my real name bra
Livin in the seasons they killin for no reason
If I make it pass 30 then I'm over achivin
Belivin in the truth belivin in the way
The life that I follow might bring me a brighter day
In the truth in the way

How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

How many blacks gotta die by the hands of another 
Don't you understand that man's the same color so that man is your brother 
That's what happens when that man is from the gutter 
And that man is a hustler trying to survive, moving grams of that butter 
See, his momma was a dope fiend, poppa was a rolling stone 
He never knew what family was he grew up in a broken home 
Ever since twelve years old he was known as grown 
'cause ever since twelve years old he was on his own 
And even though it seemed like school was the best plan 
His only choice was distributing the rock like Def-jam 
While everybody else was getting diplomas 
He graduated from the middle of the strip to the corner 
But I don't knock him cause he tryin' to bubble 
There's no food on the table, the rents past due and that's why he hustles 
And I ain't sayin' that its right to be dealin'
All I'm sayin' is I feel him I guess 
I just see eye 2 eye wit his struggle you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

Now baby girl's got a promising future 
But her moms passed away while she was younger and her father's a loser 
He'd always abused her but what else you expect from a coward 
He wasn't even proud when she got accepted to Howard 
And even though she loves college everyday it would stress her 
But it wasn't cause of exams or she hate her professor 
It was her financial situation here she couldn't pay a semester 
And the only means of making it better was totally reversing the role 
Lap dancing working that pole even though deep down its hurting her soul 
And even if it meant taking off her clothes 
She was down for what ever to help her accomplish her personal goals 
And I ain't trippin' off a-how shortie livin'
She gotta pay her tuition put food in the kitchen and that's why she strippin'
And I ain't sayin' I agree with her job but shit times is hard 
I guess I just see eye to eye with her vision you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 
Stay down stay down just to live a brighter day 
Stay down stay down just to live a better way 

Now see the moral of the story is this 
If you ain't tryin' to help stop our troubles then don't knock our hustle 
Cause really at the end of the day its not ya'll struggle 
But you always got something to say 
Well hear this fuck you 
Yeah that's right I'm talking to you come try to sleep in our beds 
Eat off our plates, take a walk in our shoes 
Look at the world from our view try to live by our rules 
Drink the same water we do, put your kids in our schools 
I guarantee you won't maintain your health you'll probably try to end it all 
And hang yourself or bang yourself 
You couldn't possibly understand all pain we felt 
And without folding your hands play the games we dealt 
I'm being real I ain't tryin' to be evil 
Look how we live, look how y'all live 
C'mon be serious how is we equal 
Matter fact I feel I'm wasting my time 
I'm finished writing this rhyme 
Y'all never gonna see eye to eye with my people you know 

How many days we gonna live our life struggling on the streets 
How many days we gotta live our life searching for a way to eat 
You gotta stay down stay down just to see a brighter day

Remember those days when I went to bed hungry 
All I ever ate was white rice and honey 
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy 
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin funny 
I remember playin over needles in the street 
Everywhere I go and there was some part of me
Thirteen thirteen was, hookers and hoes 
On 11th avenue sellin bodies for dope (Whoa) 
Remember cryin sayin that will never be me 
Gonna make it someday gotta be somebody 
Say, mommy don't worry it's just you and me 
But, one day we will get out of this misery (Hey!)

Fresh white tee, fresh car walls, summertime hood niggas look like stars
Jewelry drip, fresh white airs, 
Mommy shake it up keep your ass right there (oh, can you believe it?)
My man got liquor and my cup's right here, 
I can smell smoke pass the dutch right here
Nigga pass that, Capri pants with the waist cut off, 
I wanna smash that (oh, can you believe it?)
Party ran pack, mingling baby, and I can LL shake, you jingling baby?
Back your ass up, I'm a start tingling baby, 
We can have more fun if wiggling baby (yea, can you believe it?)
P hit the club with a dutch and a dub with it, 
Nigga don't cuff it if you ain't in love with it
Matter fact let the grub get it, 
Please don't hate cause at least you can say you was with it

Can you believe it? Get a break and get off the streets, 
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed, 
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, I ain't never gonna leave, 
The ghetto is all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga 
Laying back trying get this dough

Let me hear you say oh, let me hear you say oh oh

Big ass truck, brand new rims, tank top Yankee, tanned out Tims
Bracelet, chain, fronts bob thin, new tattoos, 
New black shoes (hey, can you believe it?) 
Gucci, Ermays, do that too, 
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black coupe
Nigga drop the top, come through the hood, 
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot 
(ooh, ooh, oh can you believe it?) 
Lending outfits all in the bus cause none of us could 
See a summer without trips (none of us can see it)
Mad hoops so the little boys might bark at you 
But they all lack good if the hood bothered you

Can you believe it? 
Get a break and get off the streets, 
Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, attack from the weed, 
That's when it really bond on me
I'm a be here for life, never gonna leave,

Ladies in the club poring Chris in cups
Niggas in the jail calling home on the phone (cause they locked up)
But you still trying to act like ain't shit enough
Mad sieves in the park, mad fights in the park 
Niggas talk how they run every night from the narcs
Aside from the light to the dark then the dark to the light, 
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life 

Can you believe it? 
I've done spent ten again, watching her bend again, dancing for many men
Tell me have ever though about getting in, 
A room full of convicts and D Block militants
We'll show you the time of your life, 
You can occupy my passenger side
Introduce you to the street life, 
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Ohhhh, all up in the club and you know how we roll,

Watch yourself
Before you get
Blown away

You know where I come from
The place where your fate is a mic
Or a bull, or a dum dum
A jail cell, a pine box
And brothers is dumb young
Young boys
Still bustin' guns for the slum
That they come from
Cops is the only ones they gon' run from
That's it
They puttin' they hood up
But nine out of ten of us ain't got good luck
You gon' ride on a man and catch twenty-five
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
So me, I play the hood, baby
Not in the
Mama got a little church I could join
But I didn't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join
But I didn't go yet
Cool with the devil on my back
I'm in cold sweats
'Bout to do some dirt
In some dirty black old sweats
If you known, you should've shown the way
Most of the hood 'bout to get blown away

'Cause I was raised up to show no fear
Cowardly hearts'll never last long here
If you ain't man enough to make shit clear
Guaranteed you'll get blown away
'Cause I done seen the block break down tears
And I done seen the cops break my peers
Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years
Tryin' not to get blown away

See, I ain't never shot nobody
But I'm known for fightin'
So when I strike, man
You'll think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child could take a life by pullin' the trigga
Retaliation only takes anger mixed with passion
So you target in the distance and keep on blastin'
They say guns don't kill people, people do
So when you're hit, man
You feel that shit the evils do
Can't see myself get beat down
My eyes swollen
Mom's cryin', they don't know what happened
My pride's stolen
If I ain't got my heat, then I got a blade
That hit ya off

[Chorus]

Keep my eye out for jakes
Ears to the streets
Other eye out for snakes
And these scandalous freaks
If we ain't on good terms
Don't bother to speak
Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me
Same thing'll make ya laugh will make ya cry
And while this nigga quiet nigga, he'll take ya life
Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice
If somebody else could travel
Through the tunnel of life
'Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there
When you're ridin'
But I'll stay to myself
So if you see me out there
With a bear we fightin'
Then, nigga, go help the bear

Why can't you understand my pain?
How can I explain?

I can't believe your love is gone

'Cause you never took the time to know me

And everybody wanna live another life
But ain't no length you'd go, or mountain you'd climb
Not to better your day, but all that'll do is leave room for people to say
I guess your living better now, sharing a lil' of that cheddar now
'Cause I remember days back when a brother was hustling and robbing too
I done tossed the Beretta now, on a whole 'nother level now
But still I can't enjoy my fame unless
my people doing the same and getting money too

I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done

I'm sorry for the times I left you home
I was on the road and you were alone
I'm sorry for the times that I had to go
I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know
That you were sitting home just wishing we
Could go back to when it was just you and me

And all the times you didn't know what to do
Sorry that you had to go and sell those packs
Just trying to stay busy till you heard from Dad
And you would rather be home with all your kids
As one big family with love and bliss
And even though Pops treated us like kids

He got a second wife and you didn't agree
He got up and left you there all alone
I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own
I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief

I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast
I wish I would've listened and not be so bad

I'm sorry that the FEDS came and took me away

For the embarrassment that she felt

Her daddy should never let her out that young
I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down
I hope they manage better next time around
How was I to know she was underage
In a twenty one and older club they say
Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame
Verizon backed out disgracing my name
I'm just a singer trying to entertain
Because I love my fans I'll take that blame
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
Even though the blame's on you
I'll take that blame from you

Money in the air as mo' fair

Take you to the motel 'ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk dog, but she told on me, oh well
Take a picture wit' me
What the flick gon' do
Baby, stick to me and I'm a stick on you
If you pick me then I'm a pick on you
D-O-double G, and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy, n' yours is right
Rip-ridin' them poles, and them doors is tight
And I'm a get me a shot before the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy and, baby I'm pussy for life

I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know

Shorty, I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas, n' they all got cheese
So you lookin' at me, now what's it gonna be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryin' get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' bout thirty stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
You know my pedigree,
Ex-deala, use to move 'phetamines
Girl I, spend money like it don't mean nothin',
An' besides I got a thing for you

I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know

Mobbin' through club in the low-pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smokers section (just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet  you rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' n' jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin' you smilin', n' grinin', n' lookin' at me

Girl, n' while you're looking at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wantin' to just give you everythin' n' that's kinda scary
Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast, but I got a thing for you

I see you windin' n' grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know
I wanna fuck you, love you, you already know

No time to waste, back to my place

Akon,"See, I can kinda recall a lil' ways back
Small, tryin' to ball, always been black
And my hair, I tried it all I even went flat
Had a lumpy curly top and all that crap, now
Just tryin' to be appreciated
Nappy headed brothers never had no ladies
And I hit the barber shop real quick
Had 'em give me lil' twist and it drove 'em crazy (crazy)
Then I couldn't get no job
'Cause corporate wouldn't hire no dreadlocks
Then I thought about my dogs from the block
Kinda understand why they chose to steal and rob
Was it the hair that got me this far
All these girls these cribs these cars?
I hate to say it but it seem so flawed
'Cause success didn't come till I cut it all off

Little girl with the press and curl
Age eight, I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen, and I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
February, 2002
I went on and did what I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the woman that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Good hair means curls and waves (no)
Bad hair means you look like a slave (no)
At the turn of the century
It's time for us to redefine who we be
You can shave it off like a South African beauty
Or get in on lock like Bob Marley
You can rock it straight like Oprah Winfrey
If it's not what's on your head, it's what's underneath, and say

Hey (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations, no (hey)
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am the soul that lives within

Who cares if you don't like that?
With nothin' to lose, postin' with the wave cap
And the cops wanna harass 'cause I got waves
Ain't see nothin' like that in all my days
Man, you gotta change all these feelings
Steady judging one another by their appearance
Yes, India, I feel ya, girl
Now go ahead, talk to the rest of the world 'cause

(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better person?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair make me a better friend? Oh
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
Does the way I wear my hair determine my integrity?
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I am expressing my creativity
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

Breast cancer and chemotherapy
Took away her crownin' glory
She promised God if she was to survive
She would enjoy every day of her life, oh
On national television
Her diamond eyes are sparkling
Bald-headed like a full moon shining
Singing out to the whole wide world like, hey

Cause I'm loving the way you shake your ass, bouncin', got me tippin' my glass,
Normally don't get caught up too fast but I got a thing for you.

{Convict} 
(Yeah, SHADY) 
{Convict Music} 
(Guess who's back) 
Still here, haters 
{Akon & Obie (Trice), Yeah} 
Whatcha gonna do it with it, A? 
Whatcha gonna do? 
{Take em on back to the streets} 

Akon [Chorus]: 
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah 

Obie Trice [Verse 1]: 
It's risky, the bitch tend to rise out a nigga 
It's history, Snitch, who decided he's a member 
Once he got pinched, coincided with law 
Same homie say he lay it down for the boy 
Brought game squad around ours 
How could it be? Been homies since Superman draws 
Only foniness never came to par 
He had us, a true neighborhood actor 
Had his back with K's 
Now we see through him like X-Ray's 
Cuffed in that Adam car 
No matter, his loss, we at him, it's war 
Knowing not to cross those resevoir dogs 
You helped plant seeds just to be a vegetable 
When we invest in team, it's to the death fo sho 
No ex and oh's, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca 

Chorus:
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah  

Obie Trice [Verse 2]: 
We started out as a crew, in one speak, it's all honest 
Private conferences when we eat, Benihana's 
Recondences when we peep enemies on us 
Been on these corners, sellin like anything on us 
Knowing heaven has shown us being devil's minors 
That ain't got shit to do with the tea in China 
We gon keep the grind up til death come find us 
Meanwhile leanin in them European whips reclined up 
It's an eye for an eye for the riders 
We ain't trying to get locked up, we soul survivors 
Po Pos is cowards, there's no you, it's ours 
We vow this, mixing yayo with soda powder 
Who woulda known he would fold and cower 
Once the captain showed, he sold whole McDonalds 
So no exs and ohs, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca 

Chorus:
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch 
Cause you will get hit, pray I don't face you, yeah  

Obie Trice [Verse 3]: 
Nowadays, Sammy Da Bull's got the game full 
So he move to a rural area to keep cool 
He snitchin on a snitch now, there's nothin to tell 
Nowadays, your circles should be small as hell 
Ain't tryin to meet new faces, this don't interest me 
Even if we bubble slow, we'll get it eventually 
No penitentary, there will be no climacy 
You will meet the lowest snitch in given us a century 
These cats is rats now, the streets need decon 
That's how they react now, weak when the heat's on em 
Stop snitchin, you asked for the life your living 
This act is not permitted, Nowhere on the map, It is 
Forbidden to send a nigga to prison if you been in it 
Along with em and then snitch and become hidden 
So it's no exs and ohs, tex calicos 
Aim at your chest nicca 

Chorus:
I keep the 40 cal on my side 
Steppin with the mindstate of a mobster 
See a nigga pass by 
Tuck your chain in cause he might rob ya 
Got glocks for sale, red dots for sale 
Anything that you need, believe me, I'm gon lace you 
Just don't whatever you do, Snitch

Every touch of her lips would always make me tipsy

Pulled her to the dance floor
And that's when she whispered
Be careful what you ask for
I grabbed her by the waist 
And I sat her on the table
Explained how the heartburn
She's giving me is painful
And now you want to leave

Well none of my friends trust me with you to drive
I'm so into you, I hope you're feeling it

You want me to drop everything
So it surrounds you
Man I love you so much
It makes me sick to my stomach
And I love it how I can vomit
And you think nothing of it
I never meant to argue with you, please forgive
Girl I need you in my life and the reason is

Ya see my moonshine
She keeps me warm when it rains
I forget my problems when she eases the pain
And my friends keep telling me to call it a day
She don't love ya Savage, it's all in your brain
See I don't believe a word
That you say to my face
I'm in love and I know she feels the same
I'll buy you all the ice you want

They got they finger on the trigger, hand on the nines
See everyday they feel the struggle, but staying on they grind
And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

They ride high, like them cust' Chevrolet's

I got a dozen peelers for niggaz who doesn't feel us
I changed for a reason but, homey, it wasn't scrilla
They can't say that nothin' changed but my clothes
Oh, I'm lyin', I do change up my hos
I pitch game; you should see the change-up I throws

Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop

So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay

A pocket full of women understanding how I'm living
Show them hos how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 Cent, yes, many men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hos, then the clothes, I'm a have to let 'em go
You know how the dog roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the east just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the beach where them niggaz is a beast
But I just listen; all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first, nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach, and I'm strong to the finish

See, me, man, I'm nothin' like you
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'

I'm livin' that boss' life (life)
You can have anything, just don't fuck with my money (my money)

This is for the West, and the East, and the Dirty South

Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
When you in Magic City, you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin' ain't the route (route) that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin' it when they can't do without it
Just put the P up in it, nigga, if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dollar
If she a balla, she gon' ride with a short caller
Roll with the boss dog in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
But I would never bother breakin' out (Tha Doggfather)
'Less I knew that she was 'bout him havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the doctor (doctor)

I could kill 'em, when I get in them

When it all goes down and they put me in my grave

Now these niggas respect it
Knowin I'm th wrong one they wanna mess with
From the gutter
With my brothers
Knowin on these ghetto streets they don't love us
Duckin' these undercovers
These muthafuckers doin everythin to try n bust us
But these suckas, know they cant touch us
They envy deep in they hearts
Nigga if they ever try to rush
Nigga they know we gon' rip 'em apart

'N he went home, but its all good

Got me doin' dirty dirt; so used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no nine to five work 
Studied on the streets; hustlas know what I mean 
Thugstas ballin' before us; I'm tryin' to make that major league 
So we never leave, never till the sun came up (came up) 
Gotta get it, nope, no leavin', no grudge (no grudge) 
Today games they play, gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off, then it's all on you (on you) 
Gotta watch what you sign too; try so hard, but I won't act a fool

I can't be humble, e'rybody bougie and industry
But me, I'm in the concrete jungle
Where rap about your cash'll get your mouth bloodied up
Run in your house, real late, you and your wife buddied up
I can't afford to rap about no cars with no 24's
Shorties on my block is real, hard with they 44's
I know some teenagers, that'll strip you like a female
Take your jewels off, when you get your car detailed
Sell it half price, like they got it on retail
Put you on the ocean floor, right by the seashells
They all got the look, like they'd ride on you
Take it easy young boys I got my eyes on you

I got my eyes on you!
And I'm posted on the corner with that thing on my side
Said I got my eyes on you!
It's a message to them stick-up kids, don't even try
Used to be a bad lil' shady nigga just like you
And I pop that ass one by one, plus two
Got my eyes on you!
Along with my whole squad ready to ride, yeah

Where I come from, you don't get caught slippin'
You don't get caught trippin'
Cause if you fall down then it's ""Off with him""
Another one off in the wood box
Man'll get revenge cause that's how the hood rock
Mighta been different if, he had a good pops
The war go, on every day but it should stop (should stop)
And them killers gettin' younger and younger
I guess it's the hunger, so they cockin' back and takin' you under
And shorty got his eyes on me, I got my eyes on him
I know the look so I'm a ride on him
I'm a catch his ass slippin' then slide on in
It's a pool full of sharks, boy dive on in

[Styles P:]
You know I keep the thing on the corner
Them shorties on the block is real wild, you make a move you a goner
Moms gon' be a mourner, family gon' be pissed
You should know how it is, you raised on the G strip
Grams to the bricks, O's to the pound
And the strap and the clip is for, holdin' it down
Get a hole in your shirt, or your hat knocked off
Cause them shorties got gats and they thirsty to pop off
The nights is short, the days is long
I blame the crack-head parents that raised them wrong
My dutchie is long, my haze is strong
I keep my eyes on you, it's the Ghost and 'Kon

And ain't nobody takin' from us, and that's the bottom line

Now she tricks off the track right by school
She takes a loss 'cause she don't wanna see her child lose
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used
And then she runs to the pastor
And he tells her there will be a new chapter
But she feels no different after
And then she asks him, where my money at?

I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

She's like Shakira belly dancing on the Grammy Awards
Like Beyonce clapping hard for them the MTV show
She's so amazing, she drives me crazy

Baila, baila, mamita que te quiero ver
Rompiendo la pista abusadora
Eres bien tentadora, de todas la mas seductora

Baila, baila, mamita que te quiero ver

I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

For me, is so tempting that I can't deny
For us to be together side by side
La noche esta buena para experimentar
Just me and you together, sin parar

Excuse me, Zion, don't mean to interrupt but she's fire
Way her body jiggling all in her attire
Dropping it down low while she bring it up higher
While we sing it now

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

Shorty so sexy, I wanna take you to my crib
Excuse me, Kon, let me help you out, she don't speak no English
Ella se ve de lo mas de bien quiero sacarte de aqui
Por si no lo sabias esta noche, you're gonna end up with me

Then I can just ride you, you know slip and slide you
Flip you over good lovin' is what I can provide you
If you don't want it, then walk away 'cause it's your right to
But I wanna show you to the world, never hide you

'Cause you're the most beautifulest thing that I ever seen
And you got the potential to blow me up like gasoline
Girl, I'm trying to be patient, trying to be a gentleman
Can you see what you're doing to me?

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me
I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

I love the way she moves, I see the way she's coming
I wanna rock her body, I know she's waiting for me

I made the mark on February 1st
Between me and you you can call it birth
The beginning of our universe
Remind me of Alicia keys verse
I'm falling for you
I wish I had an opportunity to not do
What I did to hurt you
Now I'm here living with regrets

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't loose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me
I'm on the highway swerving
I ain't drunk but I'm about to hit the curb'n
Looking at the calendar getting nervous
Just a few more days to the first soul

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart

Get the calendar go to August 3rd first words
Stay we heard our first words
First argument gotta let it go
Cause it could possibly affect what our future holds
Flipping pages now famous thinking back I aint seen you in ages
Wishing that I could of made it less painless
Brings me back right back to the same as

I know that it was my fault,
I know that I got caught,
So please don't loose your thoughts
Of me loving you and you loving me

June July August is just another day,
September October November trying to find a way
In December to mark my calendar to meet again
If only we can go to that place where me and you know,
There's no faith fronting cheating even lying,
The time has come where we stand face to face

This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you
So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began

And did she every think I was good enough for her
Despite my suffering I come to loving, That she was
There when I needed her the most.
And that is the sound I received from above letting me,
Know that everything is going to be OK
And that she was that someone that pull me out of the mud

Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
'Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day (welcome to my sunny day)

Block don't stop always stayed hot
No matter how the seasons got
I still remember when they took me away
Kept it on lock den I got caught den I realized dat I had to stop
Den I took the time to explore a better way

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day

Welcome to my sunny day
My sunny day
Everyday
A better day
Welcome to my sunny day
My sunny day
Every day
A better day
Welcome to my sunny day

Been a long day
On my way to my holy place to pray
Give thanks for every blessing given to me
I know there's more to see, more to me, no more living in misery
Cause this is how I visioned life to be

Searched high and low, so close, yet so far to go
I just know, there's a sunny day

Who'd ever thought that I would see this day
Where I would see my ghetto life fade away
Cause I was lost and couldn't find a way
And now I look forward to every day

Welcome to my sunny day

I'm that type of guy that will save ya
I'm that type that will call you later
Won't be around to give you that time

Gotta get on the grind and get to that paper
That I can do
Gotta keep my baby girl laced up in the latest and the fliest suits
Never one for none, lets get cake up, hold it down, that's all you gotta do
Then I walk up in the place, with a pocket full of money, my brother like, I outta do
Stepping out with the finest suits, look at me now

But there ain't too many know how to get that dough
That's the type of girl I want around me
Even though I'm a with her, make a man feel free
Roll with the fellas, even hold my cheese
Look like something you would see on TV
She don't mind climbing up that ladder
Similar to the words, it don?t matter
But this time they wanna see us together
Look at us now

I don't plan to ever let her leave my bed
Till she sees the color purple like Annie Mae
Now she wants to start holding on me, like whatever she's smoking on

And you know we don't play when it's time to grind. That's how it goes,
You wanna get that dough.
I'm making it but I'm still hungry,
But whatever it takes I gotta go get this money.

When I first jumped in the game I was 7 years old,
Drop a model get the money, give a fuck about a ho.
Servin' porcelain to people left a brick up in my coat,
Always told to eat fast,
Never snitching was the code.
I would never post pone cause the money get gone,
Never waiting by the phone gotta get it on your own.
Real niggas get paid every second of the day,
Hit the mall blow a quote that I can't fit in this phrase,
Just know it's two colors in that Def Jam chain,
Lil money wanna scam,

Make way,
Feed me,
Gotta get this money.

They bring me back bags,
Louis vitton something.
Don't really know the price,
Just know it costs money,
And when it comes to money,
They know it ain't nothing,
Throw a 100 on jewels,
Make it back up on a Monday.
Why niggas trying floss,
They balling outta budget.
Everyday on the grind,
Bitch my mind is on my money.
Tell 'em roll up the trees,
And deliver me the scummy.
Forget a 9 to 5,
Overrated me to quit.

I get it opposite legit.

How much for the chain?
I spend bout a 100.
See you can dim the lights,
But my wrist still sunny.

And my fitted in the glock.
Dickies cut with a frame,
And a half up in my sock,
Gotta get it anyway,
And keep it level from the cops.
Bitch I never play the grind,
First rule off top.
I been in it for the dough,
You niggas need props .
I'm just in it for the guap,
100 million in the pot.
Only know to go get it
So the printer don't stop.
Grab 50 hit a lot,
And go and dump it on the drop.

But I'm likely to ride
I'm on top of the game
Fuck if you like it or not
Ask how I get them freaks
Strawberry swishy sweets
You'll be dealing with H when you dealing with G's
Now she deal with the realest
Shopping like it's still December
Diplomat on the fender of the phantom I'm the winner
I do it for the hood
I do it cause you're gay
You suckers wish you could Ricky Ross I'm in the bank

[Plies]
Hey feds,
Heard your bringing my name up
Know you want me bad
Think I give a fuck
Better indict me now
Before price go up
Came in the world thuggin' leaving with big nuts
Yeah I run it with killas homie, so what?
What you want me to say, I sold a little dust?
Send your informant
I bet he leave bust
I ain't scared to go
I believe in Jesus

I wake up to get my cake up I'm out to grind
What can I say
I'm a product of my environment
Uh oh, I'm in the game
Watch me do me
Kickin' these niggas
Khaled man call this Bruce Lee
Summer winter spring I can't forget the fall
I still remain a dog
A diabetic and all
All I want is my paper
I don't care what they say
They stick their tongue out when they bow they head (Cause we the best)

[Ace Hood]
Hey knock knock
Yea I'm knocking on the banks door
With the million dollars and I'm dropping off the cash flow
See you ain't heard I hit a lick
Now my money right
Spend it on the u-haul dipping on the turn pike
Call up my dogs
Rag on my face
Bodies gon fall
Tell em it's Ace
If I catch a charge
Nigga ima flee the state
Hit my niggas LA Reid and Khaled
Watch me beat the case

You niggas fly
Before you were just maggots

[Chorus]",Out Here Grindin',2008
Akon,"When they tell you that you'll never get over (ha ha ha)
Just tell 'em they're number one (El Captain partner)
You're a champion (yeah, the Ali of my day, you know me)
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!
(I can't hear ya, I'm way up here, what you say?)
Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go bust!)

Now, there's, nothin' you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm goin' in (hey!)
I'ma make the world feel my pain
While I'm showin' you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't shit
We ain't got nothin but everything to gain
Look, even if a muh'fucker try to pop me
I'm so blessed, do anything that you could do to stop me (stop me)
Now I'm climbin up the ladder and I'm jumpin at the top
You might wanna call me,  rocky
See there's more of us, ugly
You don't really wanna war with us, trust me
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious, hug me

[Chorus]
I see it in your eyes, it ain't hard to tell
They're watchin' you (can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin')
They just tellin' you lies, they want you to fail
They're plottin' on you (and they can never stop my movement!)
So, don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over
(you know exactly what to tell 'em!)
Just tell 'em they're number one (number one)
You're a champion!

Hey, see the websites lyin', tryin' to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flyin' like I don't got time
Got e'rybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? best get me off it
At least quit lyin if you must keep talkin'
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walkin'
Boy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shawty
Couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag and a brand new forty
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it
Shawty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip fallin' off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? take it up with god homie

[Chorus]

Any situation where you might get fed up
Gotta stay focused, homie keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doin'
Homie gotta handle your business and then you better step up
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuin'
Ain't nothin' in the work gon' really stop what you're doin' (ohh!)
Go hard no matter what they be sayin'
Nigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it movin' (ohh!)
Take a look and see yourself in me
Cause it's all about we (we)
Me and you securin' a win together
So we could be the best that we could ever be (ohh!)
Stay up on your grind, be the first one to, set it
People try to shut me down, I won't, let it
I'm so stubborn for the success
You know my motto, don't stop, get it, get it!

You know I gotta get a shock wit a steady can
You can have a brother coming out the pelly pants
If I gotta keep em looking at the way you belly dance
She got a cute portfolio, fast like a Nascar that she drove before
Because I can tell by the way she ride that stick, 
That she ride that dick like a rodeo eh
On top while I'm huggin' them thighs, 
And you know I like looking at what I do see,
I'm tryin' to hit it from the bottom but she told me 
To be real still cause she wanna do me
Like a gangster when I touch her
Thought I was rough but she was rougher
She cut me, I didn't cut her
We tradin' places like Usher
Because drop to the floor then Eisa
Come rock my boat like Aaliyah
If u can grind on me like Shakira
Well u on top then I just might see ya
He don't really know the way you can work
He said he ain't hit it good while he was at you
But you be givin' me the vision of a freak 
So I gotta lay back I wanna see what that do girl

I'm feelin' how you bump and grind with the twist 
Come and slide with the twist if you ain't got class (class)
How you doing? And I knew that you was ready 
When I saw how the fatty lookin' in the black pants (black pants)
I and you know that I know that I be good 
When you be on top of me giving me a lap dance (lap dance)
You move your body like a choreographer 
I would lay down and watch if I got that chance (that chance)
I would be all on you, with an apology, that I would be better
But I'm lovin' the way she rockin' me
Possibly I could open the odyssey from a good to bottom, let her get on top of me
I knew that she was a little bumped when she got in the truck
I wanna hit after sippin' the yack in the club
I love the way the booty look when she backin' it up
Come with me and lets get buck in the back of the bus
A good time if want that there with me
Give it to me cause I gotta get that there
New po is here go in sip that there 
Then pop this here let me hit that there
So sexy if I love five eight
When she ride me she make her body vibrate
When I'm lookin' at her I never get irate
When she get on top me of me and then gyrate

It's Montana baby, lookin' like you mad I made it
Catch me in the fresh Airs, Louis bag, white tee, Gucci hat
Game in a doobie wrap, streets keep calling back

I don't know what it is
But it keeps callin' my name, I can't imagine me leavin' this game
I'll tell you what it is
It's the money, the cars, the clothes and all these fast ass hoes (hoes)
It got me married to the streets
Married to the streets, married to the streets (streets)
It got me married to the streets, married to the streets

One day at a time

Saw you in the club
You were dancing with somebody
So close so tight
You were killing me so slowly
My friends were telling me what you're doing
Can drive a man so crazy
Trying to live my life
It's been 6 months since you left me

So I oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day, one day, one day
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time

I am not the jealous heart
But you stole my heart baby
Dancing with that guy
Made it so hard for me to watch baby
I just been around running in circle
I'm going through it in my mind baby
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls
To stop from crying out loud baby

Oh I oh I
Still thinking about you baby
I try I try
Can't stop thinking about you baby
Oh I oh I
I keep thinking about you baby
I try I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know, and I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

First thing I gotta do is try to face it (try to face it)
But your voice keeps playing in my ear (playing in my ear)
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it (trying to fake it)
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know, yes I know
I gotta take it one day at a time

One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go

But it seems so impossible

Platinum hammer through the metal
Wreck the booth up, I'm too tough
That inner city grammar
Step your jewels up, they bruised up
I'll sparkle for the camera
Harsh reality's what (?) holding them back from opening
Verbal attack all over these niggas, push the herd to the back
I'm the kind that they pray on, spending half of their day on
Lay on, niggas for days, just shots spray on
My sound system knock and in pound Tupac
6-4 jumping like the ground too hot
They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here
Two tone, two door, grey top, roof floor
Green guap galore, in and out of new hall
That bright light you saw, was a paparazzi flash
I'm tryna snap a picture through your Maserati glass

To fill up a swear jar
And have it overflowing so don't get me going, don't dare start

I'm past grinding for me, guess I just be grounded up
Like ground round or a pound of chuck
Tightly wound as fuck
Till the fire Marshall's come shut
Fire Marshall ground 'em up
I guess you should just shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck
I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm not down for blunts
To say I keep it 100 would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a hoe, or asking a gal to suck
And blowing your dick cock
Is she up to screw and down to fuck
It's a man's World and I'm trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts wrapped with muzzles
Running through a house of mutts
Other words I'm shutting up everyone one of you bitches mouth's up
And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt
And ain't shit changed, my shit still don't stink player
My farts may have become staler ever since I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster job for white trash, I'm a garbage pale kid sailor
Yeah, see me up all in your bitch means I'ma rape her,
All I got for these hoes is dick duck tape and a stapler 
So bitch you better look for table scraps to scrape her

Get on your mark

Akon and Asher Roth

They say they want that hot shhhh, say no more
Had to walk around the block, couldn't take no more!
Like escaper from the rock, couldn't wait no more
Sean Con cocked penis mightier than the sword
So I'm sleeping with the whores while I file for divorce
Plain and simple and I'm short, when it rains, man, it pours
Stepping in manure, second sippin' in the moor
Quickest leopard gets the boar, secret weapons win the war
Desprate, but I'm pretty sure that I'm destined to endure
Flesh into the core, Pauly D to Pauly Shore
World of cyborgs and tours of cyberspace
What's behind the door, the allure of something strange?
Of course, this is why I came, the forces are untamed
No corporate or dumb fame, I'll record for chump change
Course is unphased, contorted or concave
I'm sort of a poor sport, nothing short of Liu Kang
Got me feeling like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, you know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, hey hey hey!

I tried conversing with God, but only hearing myself
I be throwing up a lot but I ain't here for my health
When I'm feeling like blah, I had to loosen my belt
Ate the corn right off the cob, didn't need no help
So, now I've come to realize I'm on my own for real
So most of em I approach em with a Slomin's Shield
Keep my enemies close cause they prone to steal
When friends become foes know you're doing it well
Just keep it going
I'm a red pill taker, who's my real maker
Drew poems on tombstones to feel safer
Loopholes for new souls, let's keep praying
Too grown to complain, I create the lane I stay in
Forever underrated, so now I'm Nicholas Cage-ing it
Doing all about anything as long as you put my face in it
Face it, I didn't want to be famous, but that's the way it is
Way I play the game, it's no wonder the brother made it like

I fall and I rise, with the fire still in my eyes
My scars and my strife, you know I will survive
The strength that I find when I dig down deep inside
Got me still in this fight, and I'll be the last man standing!

Something beautiful happens
In this world

Oh
Akon
And Lonely Island

You don't know how to express yourself so
You just gotta sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside her (her)
I just had sex (Hey!)
And I'll never go back (never go back)
To the not having sex
Ways of the past

Have you ever had sex?
I have, it felt great
It felt so good when I did it with my penis

A girl let me do it
It literally just happened
Having sex could make a nice man out' the meanest

You'll never guess where I just came from
I had sex
If I had to describe the feeling it was the best

When I had the sex
Man my penis felt great
And I called my parents right after I was done

Oh hey, didn't see you there
Guess what I just did
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest

Well sure
Nice of her to let you do that thing
Nice of any girl ever
Now sing

I just had sex
And it felt so good (felt so good)
A woman let me put my penis inside her (her)
I Wanna tell the world

To be honest
I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it
Doesn't really make sense
But man, screw it
I ain't one to argue with a good thing
She could be my wife
That good?
The best 30 seconds of my life
My life!

I'm so humbled by a girls ability to let me do her
'Cause honestly I'd have sex with a pile of manure
With that in mind the soft, nice smellin' girl's better
She let me wear my chain and my turtle neck sweater

So this one's dedicated to them girls
That let us flop around on top of them
If you're near or far, whether short or tall
We wanna thank you all for lettin' us fuck you

She kept looking at her watch
Doesn't matter, had sex
But I cried the whole time
Doesn't matter, had sex
I think she might have been a racist
Doesn't matter, had sex
She put a bag on my head

Still counts
I just had sex
And my dreams came true (dreams came true)
So if you had sex in the last 30 minutes
Then you're qualified to sing with me
I just had sex (everybody sing!)
And it felt so good (we all had sex!)
A woman let me put my penis inside her
(I wanna tell the whole world!)
I just had sex (I just had sex!)
And I'll never go back (no, no, no!)

Grab the controller, similar to wii,

Gotta let you know, your worth about a million ?,

Shot with bullets that were meant for me, family's never forgiving me
I know, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving, I had to grow up
Slinging crack on the corner ain’t quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I’ve known
Owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn’t graduate from college but

Why you look so good, but I ain't ever seen you smile
Got a man that defined you, everything in this world
But I guess he ain't loving you right, girl, no

Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only
He ain't giving you attention
Wanna know, wanna know, wanna know
Is he telling you you're sexy?
Girl, I wonder if you let me
When I look at you I wonder, wonder, wonder

You're too fine to be looking so blue
So blue, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

So blue, so blue

With a body like that, girl, you've been his, ain't fair
See, I will love you all time and all around town, I swear
I can see that he ain't been hitting that at night
One ride with me would change your life oh

'Cause I, I can see that you're lonely
Baby, you're one and only

Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surrounding when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dogs got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pain to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures ain't say them words and we dry stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm still thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families these mother fuckin' ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepared for the payback because it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

Cuz when you need it the most ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unaware-able
He fuck around jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
Figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, No chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
He was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kids, old snitches
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh
There's a story in me

Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action they grabbin' me take the stand, damn
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even crack a smile
Knew him since a child, man this game so foul
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
If he got the money we attack him like a pitbull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I sold)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
Where I surrender to you (surrender), surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you, surrender to you
Which I will never do

'Cause when you need it the most ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)

And the ones that you keep close are the ones will take you down (always take you down)

Akon,"'Cause I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers
You should be ashamed like a motherfucker
The streets packed with all these lame lil motherfuckers
Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

These youngsters think that I'm so cool
They wanna learn the game from an old school
I give em strategies to sleep on
So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
Now first on your check list
Be your own man cos your friends ain't shit
They only come around when they need to
Use that home boy shit to deceive you
Remember you don't owe nobody, niggas
Niggas put the bite to the hand that feeds, that’s your body
And they forgetting how they got there
This is life, it's a game, but it's not fair
It's hard enough trynna get by
Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
And staying drunk on the regular
Talking dope talk on your cellular
But in this game that's a no-no
The streets ain't the only ones watching, taking photos
And life ain't bitches and money
This life's bout getting this money
Because that bitch is a problem
Can't live with and can't live without her
My advice to you is stay on your grind
Keep that bitch on her back and your faith on your mind, nigga

You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

And we don't talk to police
That's the number one rule on the streets
'Cause if you can't do the time, then you don't do the crime
Nigga keep the streets quiet
You don't upstrap unless you have to
Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
You gon' revenge somebody?
Dig two graves, just in case it's two bodies
And never bring a stick to a gunfight
One shot, one kill, you get one life
And shitting where you sleep ain't an option
People knowing where you sleep, that's a problem
You got to watch these niggas
They ain't your home boys, not these niggas
First chance you call sleep, they could murk you
So don't put squares in your circle
'Cause these streets don't love nobody
You gotta pay attention to the signs, Johnny
If you a weak nigga, don't try to play hard
Better keep your punk ass out the yard

'Cause I ain't ever change on you motherfuckers
And OG's spitting game on you motherfuckers

Everybody wanna be a hard stopper
You won't find too many riding out without a chopper
They end up dead or somewhere in lock up
Where somebody will break em off something proper

And don't get fronted, just avoid that
But if you have to, pay them boys back
'Cause niggas ain't playing, it's a drought
The border is closed, the cash running out
And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks
Every nigga in the way getting shook
You got to play the game by the book
I fuck around and your life getting took
And last but not least, when you make that money
Keep it low-pro, don't say shit, dummy
And don't say shit to your girlfriend
Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
Take notes to the game I'm providing
Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
Nigga them feds ain't stupid
You ain't the only nigga trynna do this
Riding round the hood in a four-door
Flying spur ol' rims, trynna show off
You drawing too much attention
And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
But once you in it, it's hard to get out of

Akon,"Decisions
This was the hardest day of my life
Should I stay or should I go?
Help me, Lord, to decide

Three blocks from home when she caught my eye
I shouldn't even be looking but she just had to be mine
Ten bedrooms, ten baths, 7,000 square feet
I was weak in the knees, she was the house of my dreams
I had just moved in to the place down the block
And now I'm thinking 'bout moving? Imagine my shock
I talked to my real estate guy, Peter
He was like, ""Your house is beautiful, yo, how could you leave her?
6,000 square feet, a dolphin-themed pool
If I'm being honest, Connor, yo, I think you're a fool
But it's cool, you can definitely afford both places""
Tell me what to do, God, my heart's torn in pieces

So many options and all in my price range
This decision is torture, my head's playing mind games

Should I move? (Should I move y'all?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (Tell me should I buy it?)
Should I move y'all? (With my money)
It'd be nice to have some more space (More space)

So I turned to my friends playing out by the pool
As I sipped on my drink, I screamed what should I do?
They just shrugged and I could tell that I was on my own
With this decision, no vision, which house to call my home
I had to get away so I flew to Majorca
Dove in the ocean, went swimming with orca
I drank too many piña coladas and fell asleep
Had a dream about both houses and began to weep

Tell me how many houses can one man own?
I'll be paying in cash, got no need for a loan (But still)

Should I move? (Should I move?)
Tell me should I buy this new place? (I don't know what to do)
Should I move y'all? (I think I should just buy it)
It'd be nice to have some more space (I think I'm gon' buy it)

So much pain, so many struggles
But I made it through
I bought the house, it's beautiful
And I kept the old one for my dogs
Sometimes it just works out (Shit works out)
Peace
Oh, and now I own two houses, oh",Should I Move?,2016

Újra itt vagyok
Vissza kellett jönnöm hozzád
És lehet, hogy maradok
Tudom, tudom
Nem láttál rég
Bármit is mondasz, szemedben
A megértés tüze ég
Én szóra váltanám a gondolatot
De félek, hogy nem érdekel
Sajnos nem állnak össze a mondatok
Én nem ide jöttem
Nem ezt akartam
Reményt kaptam csak az útra
Én, az örök átutazó
Azt, hogy minden bûnöm megbocsájtható
Hello, hello
Nem tûntem el
Csak egy távoli bolygón jártam
Lehúnyt szemekkel
De kinyílt lassan e szem
Most is rád ragyog
Könny reszket benne:
Látom, hogy vak vagyok
Én szóra váltanám a gondolatot
De félek, hogy nem érdekel
Sajnos nem állnak össze a mondatok
Én nem ide jöttem
Nem ezt akartam
Reményt kaptam csak az útra
Én, az örök átutazó
Azt, hogy minden bûnöm megbocsájtható
Hello, hello
Én a régi vagyok
Tévedésbôl jöttem a Földre
És félek, hogy itt ragadok
Hiszed vagy nem
Egyszer hazajutok
Nem látsz majd többé
Hiányozni fogok

Akrobatik,"{Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]}
It's Akrobatik
With the final fantasy tactics
Eliminatin' wack shit
[With strategy that's sick]
Teaming with my accomplice who helped me on the Fat Shit
We'll fuck your tower up
With multiple power-ups
My appetite for pain will eat a meteor shower up
Crash a thousand crews [Grab a bite] and get showered up

{Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]}
You feel refreshed
Now let's continue the quest
I use a towel to
Catch innards of those we disembowel for
Foul play [Lif what did Colin Powel say?]
Who knows? I had flood waters wash his ass away
He was just another rabble-rouser from Babel's tower
Living in the glorious realms of false power

{Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]}
I make you shake ya ass
I make you nod ya head
Plus give you the motivation
To get your ass out of bed
Cause to me, MC means Motivate the Crowd
And eliminate the evil cause
I know they hate the proud
I blow the fakers out of the box with Hip Hop
[They oughtta stop or watch they frame get chopped
Or better yet they suffer from paralysis and shot]
So if you feeling this pump ya fist when it drops yo

[Chorus]: Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]

Sent to tear down the terrorists
Perceptionists [Who's that?] Ak and Lif
[And you know that we're
Attacking with the raw for sure]
The earth [yo check it] get another realm to explore

{Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]}
At this point the predator blinks
Knowledge rifles past the head of the sphinx
The nation cringes as a terrorist thinks
How to spike his next target
But we're all americans here so our place is the market
Death to whoever tries to harm it
We'll demonize you
Provide adversity you'll never rise through
We upgrade to downsize you
[Who says we can't buy you?]
Here's a dollar that claims faith in Allah
Currency currently funding a holy war
You'll only get a little cut
So you know there's more
We assure you that we're heavily in debt
[I'm sick] Sorry we don't have the remedy yet

{Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]}
Yo I shower fat freeze
On the powers that be
So when they come to me with bullshit
I devour that steeze
Like tryin to charge a hundred grand for Bachelor's degrees
And creating filthy air that be stifling the breeze
And filling our TV's
With these gold tooth wearing MC's
Who probably don't even know their ABC's [But got cheese]
But we all know that cheese goes bad and gets molded
So my priority is wisdom for my head to hold it

{Mr. Lif + [Akrobatik]}
The wicked get scolded [Their soul] They sold it
They got a million ways to make sure that we're molded
Along the same lines as those with no spines
But the power of these rhymes is changing the times

[Chorus]: Akrobatik + [Mr. Lif]

Sent to tear down the terrorists

This is the last chapter
Bombs hit who? Crushed what?
Over there? Oh my god, oh dear
I was hmm.. I think I was *h* movin somewhere
About to paint my fear bright glare not quite clear
Stay blinded to the light of possibilities
Think I heard the screams of those in my proximity
On how they started thinking wishfully
Guided by fear I'm suddenly aware
Please, is anybody out there?

It was a gentle fission kiss on my block
And hot light like a baby breathing sigh a terrain
And now my name is merely left
Suckin on brain exist before the final flash
The emotion of pretty details of a life I had passed
Now my warm night in Brooklyn is ash
Falling from the snot of loosies that I choked
Around the corner from class
Before the moments when the moon can move fast
Another summer slowly growing with the friendships
That would end with a blast
Or how the hours could so blissfully lag
She slid her tongue between my lips and I gasped
Told my dawgs and they laughed
Now we're combining our cash at last
A pack of smokes and a flask
Hopeless liquor with a

Convert to atheism denounce god pronounce religion dead
Faith in nothing trace my wrists with razors
I refuse to wait for the blades to erase my spirit
Death - faced with it - run to it - not from it
Swallow all the pills in the medicine cabinet
Chase it with a bottle of 151 hung mommy
Head outside the smashed windows in trash my hotel lobby
Break the grip off the time at last
I find I get to him up Wish I did more sinnin
Get a strap on run up in two women
Laid in the middle of a highway wait for pain to hit me
Still a can with people lootin screamin come and get me
Finally it was porn shop biggest gun crowded street
Blow my brains to hell - I'm gone - and let the devil come for me

What's the chance that I'd be one of the last ones left of my preceders
The Earth Crusher came before I could even conceive a fetus
But I did go from nothing to misunderstood elitist
Who tried to tell his people the lies instead of acting like defeatists
But what good is that? Cause we're now all goin to hell
Like some kid playin in his class out talkin before the bell
I died believing in righteousness but I could have indulged more
Cause giving in to temptation don't seem that raw no more
I heard some airline offered flights into space
I shoulda took it to see earth before they matched up the place
I thought I'd be alone when they finally came to get me
But nobody gotta miss me because they all comin with me

Our horizon was accessorizing we bred more need
Best believe this be the equation of greed
I need a new car and thus new breaks
Another tune-up with lube
Whatever's put together shall be unscrewed
In times of famine we made more food
Food made more people
It's all explained within the cycle of evil
Would I trade it all?
Cruisin down the highway on a bright summer day
Gazing out a plane to see the earth from miles away
Watchin the patriots win the super bowl
Grabbin that fumble from Ricky Prole
Or my stereo provided me with rhythm and soul
I don't know, all I know is I feel guilt for
Every single thing I've ever bought and sold
I shoulda been at more demonstrations
Planted bombs in corporations
Murdered CEO's and cancelled TV shows
Burned billboards and torn posters
I coulda read more
Finally I get to meet this god they left us dead for
And its ill, its power to the form of a bill
To which people killed by manipulated free will
Conscience be the crucifix a chopping block for poppycock
And I can feel our spirits drop upon these streets I oddly walk
Enough talk! Here's my last chance to cherish a thought
My flesh is fully melted and my stomach's in a knot
So to my love I hated to leave you alone
Parted my zone passion took me to places and my life was a poem
Baby I was on my way home about to catch a flight
Our meeting has dissolved in radiation and light
Love you gave me made me shine
You're gorgeous with a powerful mind
You lifted my spirits and strengthened my spine
I'm at peace with my life cause knowin you was divine
You made me see eternal beauty in a world that was dying

So hot that all the mercury is splatterin'
My brain cells are large like Jupiter
While other kids mentality get stupider and stupider
Talkin 'bout their street star wars
Can't rock for eight bars eyes redder than Mars
Put that rapper on the spot if I don't see that he's tight
Then I'll shower his platoon with verbal meteorites
I'm not the type to sweat what the media writes
Emcees is way off like Pluto 'cause they feed into hype
A lot of kids heads blow up like supernovas
But Ak's down to earth so I maintain worth

From the ropes to Pakis all the way to Landsdown

[Verse 3: Big Juan]
How you gon' lie about the place that you're from?
The house you grow up in, the block that you hung
Politics ain't my fortay
You gettin' fucked without the foreplay
Heaven trouble comin' through the doorway
G ain't playin' you dubs in the clubs
And heads ain't showin' you no love in the Hub
Spend time on the road, hotel's all alone
Not for Hillstreet times ain't no place like home

[Chorus: x 4 Guru]
I'ma get home, I'ma get there
Make it back even if I'm caught outthere

[Verse 4: JaySon]
When I think of the Bean I think of the artist who
Got fucked over by Maurice Starr and Larry Wu
I think I-L-be	, fifteen years of are & be	 transmitted outside Dudley
Plus the Bumrush specially celebrities
Aks Kane, Moe Dee, Mo Vaughn and Eric B.
Murdapan, Deathchester and Glocksbury
The weed's extra sticky, coke's extra heavy

""Boston""
[Verse 5:Big Shug]
It's the chin checkin', Chuck chokin' predator
Boston rap (Big Shug) Murdapan settler (huh)
I'm bettin' the stakes be high, when you die
Diss the crew, and lose the sight in you eyes
We multiply to bring the real on the track
Cross the line and there ain't no goin' back (fuckin' fag)
In fact, these niggas will rip ya ass apart
Bury that head in Franklin and your body in Hyde Park

[Chorus]

[G-Squared scratches]
""Boston""
""Boston""
""Representin' mass""
""Boston""
""Fuckin' Boston""

[Verse 6: G-Squared]
We make history daily
Represent Boston like Arabs and Israelis
Police tail me, backstabbers try to nail me
DJ's play me at the clubs past eleven
On 88.9, 94.5 and Hot97
Beantown's a cold city Dorchester gritty
Murdered over a fifty, hometown ain't it shifted
I travel the map but I always come back
To burn it down behind 24 tracks

[Verse 7: Krumb Snatcha]
Shoot outs fit niggas get twist in the Bean
Below the exploded magazine leave my head on the scene
Long time to Glocksbury twist your nine on the spot
Either you out to get this paper, or you work for the cops
My don stylo finally ya niggaz know how it go
Most hated at the back with the gats at the show
Quick to die with the stripes on squeezing like a python
Half the industry ya already dead before the mic's on

[Verse 8: Akrobatik]
My rapstyle's changed like Rodman's head
It's Akrobatik representin' Common Square (Hell yeah)
Where you can hop on the Red Line
And catch me at the Middle East
Wippin' hoes close to headline
The winter's east Stone Cold like Steve Austin
But I promise my heart will never leave Boston
And that's the bottom line cause Akro say so
Intimidatin' with my pitch changed up like Pedro

[Chorus]

I've got a question

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing

How unfortunate, it wasn't what you thought it kid, in basic training
They taught you how to slay man as a start-up kit
And you showed up with a gun to load up
Hopin' a college education's waitin', maybe a steady occupation
Now you're weighing many lives against yours
President orders, got you on course, with holocaust, Sargent is lost
General's boss, plans cross, now you in the crosshair
Of a sniper's shaky scared, shot off your ear
All fucked up down, one round just hit him in his from some young yet expendable citizen
He's from the other side of the line, fightin' for time
Time to see his kids walk, time to talk with his pop
Time to have a rational thought without the thought of bein' shot
(Damn) his gun jammed now you gotta bombart
It's a soldier's suicide slide know you tried hard to stay alive
When you're catching fire from both sides
And we miss you at home, it's time the government truly left you alone
Dropped you off and popped one in your dome
Now we've seen it in Iraq and the Congo, America's motto
""Kill their leader then we make a stronghold!!""

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We've been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something

Where are the weapons of mass destruction?
We've been lookin' for months and we ain't found nothin'
Please Mr. President, tell us something
We knew from the beginning that your ass was bluffing

I never thought of this the day that I enlisted
That I'd be dodging bullets, seekin' weapons that never even existed
For someone else's personal beef, I risk myself
While the Commander-in-Chief, would never come to fight himself
I feel I'm bein' tricked even worse that the civilians
Nobody ever told me that we would be killin' children
Feelin' like the ones that sent me here are the psychotics
But if I say that out loud, I'm ""unpatriotic""
But would Donald Rumsfeld back me up with the chrome?
Would Tom Ridge fight or would he stay secure back home?
And would Condoleeza Rice cover grenades in a fox hole?
I'm startin' to believe what I was told is not so
What's the reason for the war?
I'm shootin' at these people that I got not animosity for
I wonder if I'm just a pawn in someone else's struggle
Or a here even though I'm just a small piece of the puzzle
I know that when I finally return where I reside
I'll make up for the months my wife and moms cried
And carry on for all my fallen brothers who died
see, you can't take my pride, 'cause I'm a fuckin' soldier

El dia que me muera les voy a sacar un susto

Dicen que por la joyas que yo traigo
Devo de andar vendiendo algo, no hay pedo
Sigo adelante como me gusta

Nomas estas pinches squinkles que me siguen

todo lo feliz que soy, todo este grande amor (2x)

A pasado mucho tiempo, mucho mucho tiempo 
doy gracias que todo he conquistado, no miento
pa' que seguir sufriendo por alguien, que feliz es solamente siendo infiel, si.

El juego de la vida nunca se me olvida why esto es puro estilo como la bebida , estranarte no es cuestion de explicar , es tristesa verte en tu final.

Chorus(2x)

pa' que maldesirte mejor debo agradeser why doy gracias por que tu me hicistes ver , tras de cada mentira que te pase, me ensenaste todo lo que pudiste hacer.

Desilucion para ti lo que logre, yo soy hombre why esto no parare, no te pasa, el vato te conduce con la raza manera de seguir en la masa

Asta aqui estoy bien no me paso en la esquina soy el mismo perro que salio de la neblina why aqui hacer ruido con la voz mas alta, a mi me sobra lo que te falta 

Has lugar para mi primer vez sin practicar a hacer tu mujer una buen fanatica why ahora que dije todo no he comparado, el movimiento de akwid a comensado.

Que puede hacer uno

El otro dia me dijistes que me quieres
Mira como eres, tu vato es camarada mio why quiero que tes esperes
Para que tu why el se separen de un final
Para que hacerle mal
Te quiere un chingos why te quiere dar el resto de su vida
why tu aqui en la movida
Tu sabes muy bien que me gustas sonar no es malo
Espero el dia para echarte un palo
Sabes muy bien que llevamos un tiempo
why yo escondiendo le que siento
No creo que tu sientas algo diferente
Siempre estas tu en mi mente
Que tal si lo enfrentamos los dos
Diga lo que diga
Que eres mas que mi amiga
Asi pudieras hacer todo lo que has querido siempre
Ensenarme lo que sientes

Sin saber sin querer yo me enamore de una hermosa why bonita mujer 
Sin pensar simpre sigo oye lo que digo no encuentro la manera de decirselo a mi amigo (X2)

No encuentro la manera de explicar lo que siento, 
La vieja de mi compa esta bien buena why me arrepiento
Sin saber me enamore de ella 
Una chica sensual why muy bella 
Sin querer me dio correspondencia 
No me la quito de encima es muy necia
Hal mirarle me caupta con sus ojos
Es prohibido why lo sabemos los dos
Nunca me imagine terminar de esta manera 
Vencido sonando con una bella guera
Hay que mi compa la siento te lo juro pero esta decision pal corazon es muy duro
Que voy hacer, la quiero a la brava 
Tambien hay veces siento que me lleva la chinagada
Pues ni modo sera lo que dios digo 
Pensar que hare unos dias solamente era mi amiga

Sin saber sin querer yo me enamore de una hermosa why bonita mujer 
Sin pensar simpre sigo oye lo que digo no encuentro la manera de decirselo a mi amigo (X2)

“hola” “hola” “se puede?”  “pienso que si”  “esta aqui?”  “no”

Que es lo que esperas llevas un rato, mintiendole a tu pobre vato 
Todavia le dices que lo quieres why lo besas en mi frente
Ya no es amigo es oponente
Na aguanto mas ver los dos juntos, 
Estoy celoso dijo que quiere ser tus esposo
Tal ves tu todavia lo quieres con migo juegas
Voy acavar patiendo piedras
Ahora si se puso buena la movida
Porque de claro no encuentro la salida
Me gustas mucho why yo soy hombre
Me cay de a madres pero no me olvido de su nombre
Que cosas no, perder todo el control
Pero ella es mas caliente que el sol
why ahora solo queda explicarselo a mi compa
Se ma hare que esta noche va ver bronca

Sin saber sin querer yo me enamore de una hermosa why bonita mujer

Les voy a dedicar una cancion ay les va.

Que es lo que tanto me buscas cuando no estoy
Me sacas de onda porque tu ya sabes donde voy
Cuando no stoy en la casa me suena el celular
Apenas de mire ayer y no te puedes aplacar
Ya sabes mi situacion no te salgas del calson
Yo no te debo nada para darte una razon
Donde voy, donde vengo, donde estoy no te interesa
Con que te compre algo pa'que no tengas tristesa
No preguntes con quien hando y quien es ella
Ya sabes cuando quieras mi cañon rompa mi estrella
No soy solo tuyo y bien lo sabes no mas porque no me allas
No es razon pa'que te claves cuantas veces te tengo que explicar
Que pa'que yo este contento nesecito un par y como no estoy amarado
Deja de chingar! yo sigo siendo el ausente y no voy a parar.

Ya llege de donde handaba
Se me consedio volver
A ti se te a figuraba
Que no me volverias a ver
(repeat 2x)

Por alli dicen voces nena
Que te handabas decidiendo
Partir de nuestro ojar por lo que te han diciendo
A las voces no hagas caso ni a lo que diga la gente
Me quieres fucilar na mas por que handaba ausente
Te no guste o no te guste decidimos hasta el fin
Me veas pelon a rapa o me veas de malandrin
Te veo de hoy en ocho cosa que me vala madres
Tambien tu no te fijes ni le expliques a tus padres
Ya sabes la rutina no estoy so no me busques
Te explico cuando llege con tus chikles y tus dulces
Como dicen mejor pedir perdon que permiso
Tengo mis guevos puetos y a nadien me le humiyo
Da te la vuelta pero ya sabes cuando llege
Respeta tu papito y me saludas a mi nene
Tu no preguntes con quien hando y que hando voy
Estoy donde me incuentre y hando..

(chorus):
Ya llege de donde handaba
Se me consedio volver
A ti se te a figuraba
Que no me volverias a ver

Si porque vengo de lejos
Me niegas la luz del dia
Se ma hace que a tu esperanza
Le paso lo que a la mia

Ya sabes que que dia te toca
Para mirarme no seas egoista
Cuando veas otras tocarme son amigas con derechos
Que yo les doy a ti te toca mañana pero por el dia de hoy
Ya no marques este numero hando por alli
Pero si quieres te llamo para decirte ""hi""
Y para confirmar mañana que te mirare
Pero aguas con tu vato te las tienes que esconder

Las ganas me hacen falta neta
Por handar de callejero
Tomando entre las barras handando de mujeriego
Por eso mismo no me quieren tus papas
Yo no me murtifico y ademas
Nada yo pido de nadien vivo como yo se
Cuando a mi me de la gana llegare!
Tambien no handes mitoteando mis negosios
De eso no sabes nada por un eror haci
Puedes darte una llamada.

De tenerlos bien puestos

Llego la hora de enfrentarte con tu oponente
Todo se ve obscuro entre la gente, 
No busques la salida piensa en tu movida si
Tiempo de desahogarte de esta pinche vida
Bueno mano me pusieron en este dia de hoy
Lo que tengo si muero te lo doy
Maneras me hacen falta pa lansarme con mis punos
Un hombre no conoce de rasgunos
Dos brazos dos manos dos codos why dies dedos
Reventar toda la madre si eso es lo de menos
Pa subir arriba hay que ser el ganador
Ni miedo ni conosco de dolor
En este mundo nadas sirve (no)
Siempre hay que estar al brinco
Porque unos compas no se animan sin los otros cinco
Todo en la linea tienes que representar 
Ni modo te los tienes que agarrar

Para subir arriba no hare falta una escalera
Maneras me hacen falta pa seguir.…..
Para llegar al lo alto no hacen falta un par de alas
El mundo se revela entre las caras (X2)

Agarrate bien traigo peso como un tren
Des hacer al que me cruce no me importa con quien
Se me quiera poner al brinco aqui estoy
Piensas que porque me crusas voy a parar donde voy
Mi camino es marcado why no me puedes parar (huh)
Yo naci para ganar (haste)
Nunca acepto una derrota me sacudo why me levanto
Cualquier cabron yo le aguanto 
Pa lo que yo triago no hay remedio why nunca lo avera
Terminara cuando yo muera
why dudo que sea pronto soy duro como el fierro
Atrevete why tu mundo cierro
No creo que desaguantes
Eres echo de papel, te rompo te arrugo why te tiro como aquel

Pisando fuerte para no seguir sufriendo

Los muros de la vida deshaciendo (ooooh)

why que te lleva la chigada
Para otra vez trata de pensarlo dos veces antes
De que me ponga yo mis guantes
Haste de mi cara no quiero ver lo que te hice
Boltea para el espejo why ayi tu me lo dices
Podrias ver parado why evitado 
Es lo que pasa cuando me camino es crusado

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti
Tu ojos quieren ver tus labios quieren morder

Primeramente de todo devo decir halgo
Desde muy joven me pasado buscando
Lo dulce nunca lo dejo pasar, why las haynas me hacen hasta cantar
Lo que verdad me vuelve loco why me hare sentir como un dios 
Son las piernas, caderas why los labios
why esa briantina si devo de ser derecho, 
Me encanta cuando lucen en tus pechos

Vieras como loco me traes me esplota la cabeza
Tengo que pausar con mi noblesa 
Quieres ser mi una ves quedarianos encantados
Lucen bien tus pechos implantados
Nadamas una ves como quieras a la vuelta
Tu vato nunca se dara cuanta
Es la cosa que me da vida, nomas para mi
Que me pone tentacion como un candy

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti
Tu ojos quieren ver tus labios quieren morder

Me puedes llamar delicado pero ya sabes como va
Me gustan las mexicanas gueras casi sin ropa
El trasero de “baum!” why los pechos de “whoa!”
Me tiene alta como humo
Tiene un olor que puede estas con ella noche why de dia
Ellas es mi fantasia
Listo paso para la pansa de los pantalones bajos
why su edad es otro caso
Me tienes frotandome las manos como si fuera una rata
Imaginandomela a gatas
Puede calentar a un perro why hacerme infiel
Asi como mueve la piel
Se le ve el brazier why se le nota que lo estira
why unas gorditas dicen que son de mentiras
Es tan exajerado que hasta me puse rojo
Echandome un taquito de ojo

Cuando me miras asi, se lo que quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar mi cuerpo quieres tocar
Cuando me miras asi me pones loca por ti

Cuando me ves asi se lo quieres de mi
Sientes ganas de amar siento que quieres mas mi cuerpo quieres probar

Puedes mirar sin tocarlas son las reglas de juego
Seria une loquera enamorarme de nuevo
Viendo por la ventana rozando la baqueta
Subir a dos treces es la meta
Tentacion nunca me iso sufrir ven nena quieres ir
Tengo maneras de hacerte desvestir
Me tienes enloquecido en el modo que te meneas
why en verdad yo te haria donde quieras
Camina como si tuviera comezon en la espalda
Como quisiera rascarla
Ella me hare inios con la mano a la cadera
Con su mirada me encuera
Quiere que la haga respirar why que se lo haga en la mesa
why que la llame travieza
Dice que ella quiere ser mi dulce para mi ojo
why por esa razon la escojo

Akwid,"Siempre que te pregunto que, como, cuando y donde? 
No me contestas, que quieres que te ruegue? 
Ya sabes que yo no estoy pa' rogarle a nadie, 
Hasta cuando no?mira deja y te explico algo

Por que será que, cada vez que te miro 
Te haces del rogar y de coraje yo me trago mi suspiro, 
Estas bonita y eso no lo niego para nada 
Pero en veces me tratas como nada, 
Cuando tú quieres, sola te me arrimas, 
Me confundo por que el rechazo me lastima, 
Mis sentimientos siempre te los he dicho 
Y tu no más por andar con tu capricho, 
Me la pones muy difícil, la situación 
Por eso la razón que te escribí esta canción 
Para explicarte, y que entiendas muy claro 
Que el día que te decidas tú dime y yo te aclaro, 
No se por que lo tienes que pensar tanto, 
Dime, vale la pena si me aguanto, 
Te decides por que ya no puede más mi corazón 
Y ya no quiero tu razón. 

Siempre que te pregunto que
Como, cuando y donde
Tu siempre me respondes
Quizás, quizás, quizás

A dos bloques de mi casa conozco a una morena, 
Todos mis compas la conocen a ella, 
Con ellos, se porta un poco seria 
Y conmigo, tal vez me preste alguna feria, 
Me encanta, pasearme por su casa, 
De todas sus amigas ella es la que mas me pasa, 
Pero siempre, que le digo que ondas cuando? 
Sonríe, y me dice no es pa’ tanto, 
Te digo, si la miras te enloqueces 
Por que a esta nena la he tratado ya por meses, 
Y sus ojos, están como los quiero, 
Se me hace que esta morenita, cayó del cielo, 
Yo quiero, que ya me deje pasar, 
Y deje, ya de hacerse del rogar, 
Se que quiere, pues también se pone roja 
Le tendré que dar por otro lado a ver si no se enoja. 

Siempre que te pregunto que
Como, cuando y donde? 
Tu siempre me respondes
Quizás, quizás, quizás

Que mas quieres, ya la he tratado de todos modos, su manera 
Dios mío, no nada no quieres nada 
La lleve al McDonald, le compre un Big Mac 
Su soda y todavía no quieres nada
No seas Fresa, no seas Naca

Por elevarme te la pasas platicando 
Preguntando, que con cuantas otras ando, 
Eso no es para que tú te preocupes, 
Que tu traes otros colgando es lo que supe, 
Se me hace que contigo ya no puedo, 
Prefiero tener nada mejor solo yo me quedo, 
Por que no buscas a alguien más para hacer menso 
Y así, esto yo ya no lo pienso 
Cada vez al preguntarle, me sale con cada excusa 
Y yo imaginándome otra cosa más sabrosa 
Es difícil, pero con ella me comporto, 
A veces pienso, no será que tiene otro 
Que la anda enamorando y conquistando como yo, 
Pues un poco mas cuidado si la neta tiene novio 
Y si no, pues a ver como le haré 
Por que esta chica de nuevo tiene que caer

Siempre que te pregunto que
Como, cuando y donde?

Akwid,"Si, un tema muy diferente algo serio, no?
te recuerdas cuando estabamos juntos tu y yo?
teniamos un detallito, malentendidos
pensar que estariamos toda la vida juntos, solos sin despedidas
fue un engaño que yo mismo mereci
pensando que todo lo tuyo era para mi
decidiste jugar juegos y perdiste
y ahora te la pasas en la vida triste
cómo pensar hallar otro como yo
estas loca?, no existe en este mundo
fui el unico que te dio todo y te valió madre
y te awitas cuando me ves en la nave paseando
hoy lo que me admira es que quieres regresar
y me dices que soy yo el que quieres mas
yo te dañé tu corazón sin tratar
y por eso sé que no me puedes olvidar

Sé tu no puedes aunque intentes olvidarme
siempre volveras una y otra vez

Cómo he de hacer pa'olvidarte, niña mia
hoy te juro nunca mas volverme a enamorar
no miento sin recordar ningun momento sufrido
sigue con tu vida te lo pido
nada mas una vez se rompió mi corazón
tu decepción mi peor desilusion
y aquellos tiempos salieron por la ventana
mujeres como tu no valen nada
lamento pensar también que fuiste mia
y aquello que vivimos era solo una mentira
por eso mismo te conpuse esta canción
direccionada a tu falsa decisión
ya ves? cómo son las cosas
tiempo que pasé y ahora ¡todo me vale madre!
con este tema aveces siento que me quema
igual que cada trago que corre por mis venas

Sé tu no puedes aunque intentes olvidarme
siempre volveras una y otra vez

Si, cómo no? de ves en cuando
hay que hacer las cosas aunque nos valga madres
pero en esta ocasión se han volteado las cosas
y ahora.. qué sera de ti?

Mi intención no es de hacerte sentir mal
simple decirte todo lo bueno que perdiste
y no me hagas malas caras por decirte la verdad
te lo mereces y no te puedo esperar
ya no puedo ser el mismo o regresar contigo
eso con huevos te lo digo
por qué no buscas otro menso para hacer sufrir
y por el tiempo, asi te voy a dejar ir
que triste es recordar y no saber aprovechar
todas las cosas que siempre te quice dar
y ahora me ves cómo gozo de la vida
mientras que tu finges siendo la sufrida nada te queda
que mala suerte no lo crees?
porque las cosas se voltearon al revés
vive tu vida y déjame vivir la mia
crees que valió la pena tu mentira?

Sé tu no puedes aunque intentes olvidarme
siempre volveras una y otra vez",Tu Mentira,2004

Que tú juras que él es toda tu alegría, no te lo creo 
Lo haces pá que me den celos
Enséñame que es real 
Y el pasado borraremos

Anda y ve, intenta de sentir lo mismo 
Que tu y yo tuvimos, y el amor que compartimos 
Estas llena de ilusiones 
Nada más quieres pasar el tiempo 
Y escoder tus emociones 

Anda y ve, con ese que le diste más lana 
Arrepentida vas ha estar en la mañana 
Extrañaras mi caricias y te darás cuenta 
Que solo son tus fantasías 

Anda y ve, y dale tu cuerpo si tu quieres 
Pero hay un detallito que quiero que consideres 
Cuando estés feliz y me trates de olvidar 
En todo lo que hagas me vas a imaginar 

Pero lo dudo por que hasta veces me has llorado 
Con un beso, llorando de alegría y no de miedo 
Y dudo que te pase igual con él 
Igual con él

Acabo de leer tu carta y me destroza, me presumes 
Que ya tienes otra cosa, otro hombre 
Que te sabe comprender y hace que te sientas 
Com una gran mujer

Anda y ve, vete con él por que te espera 
Que lindos se han de ver los dos como primavera 
Pero lo dudo y eso tenlo por seguro 
Por que el tiempo es duro 

Anda y ve, comentale otra vez que conmigo 
Te sentias flotando entre las nubes 
No es para presumirte nada, me lo decias tu 
Con cada mirada

Anda y ve, dile que estoy sorprendido 
Por que apagas tus sentimientos como cerillo
Que sencillo era todo 
Me pedías lo que querías y lo tenías

Ande y ve, también dile que gritabas mi nombr, 
Sentias morirte, ahora dices que lo amas, lo dudo 
Con mi corazón te lo juro

Pero lo dudo por que hasta veces me has llorado 
Con un beso, llorando de alegría y no de miedo
Y dudo que te pase igual con él 
Igual con él

(Lo dudo, no creo que con otro vayas a sentir) 
(Lo mismo que sentias conmigo, bien sabes que a mi)
(Hasta me has llorado con un beso, pero sabes que)
(Si quieres calarle, vete, pero lo dudo) 

Anda y ve, pero quiero que sepas que de regreso 
No te quiero, que esáas escarbando tu agujero 
Por que cuando realices lo que tu hisiste 
Me buscarás pero pa' mi tu ya te fuiste 

Anda y ve, adiós y te deso mucha suerte 
No creas que traté de detenerte, solo dije 
Lo que siento, ahí tú si mis palabras 
Se las dejas al viento, ojalá 
Y siquiera hayas aprendido, y sepas 
Apreciar lo que tenias conmigo 
Se te hizo como nada, yo fui el único presente 
Cuando te sentías abandonada

Anda y ve, vete corriendo, dile que lo amas 
Pero conmigo en tu pensamiento 
Lo bueno es que los nombres no se dicen 
Pero con tanto amor los dos se consienten 

Pero lo dudo por que hasta veces me has llorado 
Con un beso, llorando de alegría y no de miedo 
Y dudo que te pase igual con él 
Igual con él

Akwid,"Uh, ¡que ondas wey!
Hoy sí que me la rifo neta
Tengo ganas de ponerme hasta la madre
Con mis weyes y mis weyas

Suena raro, pues, como crees
La única manera pa' bajarme el pinches estres
No sé si siento coraje o arrepiento
Quisiera regresar y detener el puto tiempo

No quiero nada más que compas y amigas
Chupe de lo que caiga pa' si te animas
Anduve mucho tiempo como perro del mal
Muchos de mis años fuero algo brutal

Creo que mi niñez, pues, no fue muy feliz
Y la vieja que ahora quiero, pues, me pinta de gris
A la gaver, pues, sé que es 1 poco tarde
Para reconciliar y pa' tratar de contemplarte

Estoy roto del pinche corazón
Estoy dolido y me dedico esta canción
A nadie más, más que a mí y solo a mí
Y sigo siendo el cabrón que siempre fui

Es lo que siento y te la dejo de tarea
Diviértete antes que suba la marea

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Se le acabaron los trucos y llegaron los jefes frescos
De la área 2 -13 pesados
Me tienen miedo los tramposos
Como si fuera 1 abogado

Cuando me echan la luz yo ilumino
Igual que mis discos de platino
Y ya llegue de donde andaba
Pa' calmarle el llanto a esas viejas que lloraban

Y no es que ande presumiendo soy orgulloso
Y disculpa si te ofendo 2 años y 1 par de meses
Avanzados como los pinches Japoneses
Este negocio está lleno de copiones
No comparan son puras decepciones
Todavía paseo bajo en mis asientos

Nomás que esta vez en un 600
Los odiosos me miran con coraje
Y por eso les hice este homenaje
Indio del rancho con Ingles
Y paisa así como me ves, wey

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Hey wey esta buena esa madre de
De ahí que echar desmadre ponernos locos eso
Es, esta bueno dilo, dilo pa' hay otra vez órale
Échale, wey, échale

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día
Pase lo que pase y que siga la alegría

Esto es para bailar de brinquito
Aganes a 1 lado que ya me puse pedo 1 poquito
Nos la pasamos de weyes con el cheko
Juntos no ni 1 viaje andemos secos

Me encanta a mí las viejas
No te encabrones y enderézate las cejas
Ya sabes cómo somos los machos
O sicones mentirosos y borrachos
Sin embargo esta vez me declare machín
No me agüito y lo grito esto no tiene fin

Y es que lunes a viernes me la rajo trabajando
Los fines de semana son de puro contrabando
Cotorreando haber con quien y pa' donde
S600 gris todo sabor de la única manera de poderme salir
Con el resto del mundo y poder compartir

Hay que tirar desmadre como no
Hay que ponernos locos todos y perder todo control
Hay que ponerle a todo y al [unverified]
Sentir la vida y sentir que si existo

Hay que ponerle toda la noche
Hay que perdernos sin guardar ningún reproche
Hay que vivir como el último día

So esta canción se las vamos a dedicar a ellos
Son historias, como nos las sabemos así que nunca digan
Que no hacemos nada para los niños

Escuchen he ahí les va

Desde niño yo he tenido cuentos pa' contar
Cosas medias atrevidas pero no vulgar
Algunas son mentiritas pero de a verdad
Déjame, te cuento dame otra oportunidad

Una vez en el bosque, me tope con un chavo
Era de palo con tirantes chapeados
Iba chiflando cargaba su mochila
Curioso yo le pregunte pa' donde iba

Iba de gira el cabrón
Se la había pintado por andar de mamon
Dijo que andaba en busca de una chinita
Porque caperucita le salió embarazadita

Me amenazo con sus pinches amiguitos
Son la pandilla de los tres cochinitos
Ya me conto que cuentearon al lobo
Que fue en defensa propia que fue por un robo

Sin darme cuenta olvide que era jueves
Tenía una cita con mi novia blanca nieves
Ponte las pilas me dijeron sus hermanos
Porque anda de caliente con uno de los enanos

Se me hiso noche y me puse a buscar
En el bosque donde me iba a quedar
Casa de citas bueno ya de menos
Era de pan con arcos de caramelo

Toque la puerta, salió una viejita
Tenía visita fumando una pipa
Me dijo joven que rollos no gusta
Tengo dos morros guisándose en la estufa

Desde niño yo he tenido cuentos pa' contar
Cosas medias atrevidas pero no vulgar
Algunas son mentiritas pero de a verdad
Déjame, te cuento dame otra opo

Hey, hey, hey, hey

Te la contaron mal guey
Pinocho no embarazo a caperucita
Ya todos saben que es flojita

A mí me contaron los enanos
Que es una bicicleta y le gustaban Mexicanos
Les pregunte que donde escucharon
Me contesto el mas menso que ya todos se la echaron

Que no sabiendo quien es
Iban a la clínica los jueyes a sacarse un test
Me quede medio espantado lo bueno
Que no saben que también me la había echado

Ojala y no me toque, ya la manosearon
Todos los compas aquí en el bloque
Y me contaron lo de la bella durmiente
Que es bien borracha y le gusta el ambiente

Según le hizo un hechizo a la viejita
Ni madres anoche andaba pueda agatitas
La vi en la fiesta con la cenicienta
Una morra pobre que antes era una sirvienta
Ahora pasa y ni le habla a la raza
Anda en un carro que parece calabaza

Son jaladoras y bonitas las muchachas
A mí se me hace que las dos son marimachas
Dicen que son amigas desde chiquitas
Y por eso se agasajan cuando se echan sus copitas

Es como me contaron a mí las historias
Y son exactas según a mis memorias
Nomás no estoy seguro del embarazo
A ver como chingados me va con este caso

Ja, ja, ja así es morros ojala y
Les haya gustado la canción
Que les dedicamos
Porque así es como nosotros
Nos acordamos de esas historias

Pero si ustedes se las saben de otra manera
O well, esto ya se acabo nosotros ya nos vamos
Guau bye, bye

            somebody want lyrics"" -- KRS-One

Verse One:

Here I go the lyrical specialist with the perscription
I give you the leagal drug addiction, nonfiction
I got the shank, to your memory bank
How sharp, don't be affraid of the dark
Come in to the light, you still can't see
It can't be, the historical, metaphorical, lyrical
Yes the S, you know the rest, fuck the spellin'
I'm tired of tellin' y'all who rule, cause you don't listen, fool
Your dealin' with a nigga feelin' fury
Surely, I purley destroy any toy with any game
That's why I never lose, I never play, I savaday style while I maintain mine
Same time  yet, differ-rent, mag-nificent
No quest unless it's the Tribe
So check that vibe twice
Cause I'm nice
Whoever got beef
Tell me the price
And I'll raise you a mill, days to a kill, some praise to a bill
Never, yea I'm as lyrical as ever

Chorus

Verse Two:

You want to start about, have you thought about
Consequences, sentences, come to your sences, on the fences
Cause I'm strictly throwin' hits
Knowin' it's, unfair
Gun here, throw in a extra clip
Cause I'm next to flip
Next time, bring in a next rhyme, cause I
Float like dead body, sting like a tazer
Sharper than a ... lazer
Open heart ... major
Surgery transplant cause you have none
there's one, shoot a fair one, that's a real one
Grannit, with a enough heart to start
But can you manage when I brandige your bandage
And your stitch is open
And your bitch is open
Is she, somethins' fishy
I don't like dis
When I'm like dis they try to ammulate my likeness
Clones
Microphones break from my intake
For phatter, mass matter, glass shatter
Becareful, I got a airfole
Listen, I got them lyrics that your missin'

Chorus 3X

Verse Three:

You're commin' with your new sound
You never threw dowm
Why try, try my tie and hang em' high, in the closet
Cause it, wasn't, I good idiea
Who should I fear
No one, the son of Jah
Gimmie some la, and I get mystic
Lyricdistic
But wait, your not great, your not good
I shot wood, put you out your misery history in the makin'
Fuckin' with a crazy Jamacian
See, they vanish when I brandish the hair trigga
Yea nigga
I'm goin hay wire
Might fire
Might not
But it's white hot
And with the right flow, the shit might blow
So I detonate, then evacuate, leavin' ash, don't even ask
Feel the blast, fast, I know you won't last
But you can still try
Somebody want lyrics
Then come see the eye

It would surely be a sin
Take the rain from April showers

Still the beating there within
I'll keep loving you forever

They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

I heard the mission bell

Some dance to remember 
Some dance to forget

Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

Pour des barrettes ils nous mettent 8 ans
Wesh, monsieur le président, dites leur bien que
J'représente les 3arbis et les niggas
Moi j'suis plus riche qu'eux, donc pourquoi j'irai fouiller leurs caisses
En pleine crise, moi j'suis en plein dans les 30 glorieuses
Mais j'sais que ma liberté bah, fait pas grand chose à leur yeux
Demande à Lacrim quand j'étais à l'école
C'est pour gratter les remises de peine
Du dispatching au disque d'platine
De l'affiche de recherche à la fiche de paye
J'ai pété tous les barrages, mais je n'ai jamais été odieux
Comment idolâtrer la vache, quand l'univers est à Dieu
Dites leur bien que, m'en bat les couilles de leur baratin
Que la j'suis en promenade, 3ème tour, Rabta dans un bar à tinp'
Nique l'État, ces schmetats rêvent que de nous mettre dans la de-mer
J'vais m'branler et même cracher sur leur putain système de merde
Woogata (ekh tfou) rap tah les fous
Ils préfèrent s'acheter une Rafleuse que d'faire du kung-fu
La Mecque, j'suis de ceux qui se baisse et Allah yaafo
Je t'ai déjà dis, nous on cotise tous pour la retraite à Clairvaux
Ils nous mettent des peines de pédophile pour des histoires de barrettes
Autant vendre de la cocaïne butez-nous pour qu'on s'arrête
Les 3ineurs montre pas l’œil, dites leur de niquer leur mère les chouettes
Moi, m'occupe de la vodka, woogataga gardez la schweps
Hey, d'après mon entourage moi j'reste un brave, 
J'reste un vrai c'est pour ça qu'il m'encourage
Après la pluie, y'a pas le beau temps y'a l'orage
C'est vrai que les petits sont hardcore, on était pareil à leur âge
À deux sur un scooter on vivez que de vol à l'arrach'
Puis on a connu la crave-bi et on a vite tourné la page
J'me suis mis à couper des barrettes, ensuite à vendre des plaquettes
Puis d'la coke et des galettes, jusqu'à ce que les keufs nous arrêtent
Un jour j'étais dans le 19, l'lendemain un hessess fermait ma porte
Un soir j'étais avec une meuf, l'lendemain elle était avec mon pote
La vie c'est dur, pas de peine nous tout ce qu'on porte c'est des flingues
Et y'a pas de vice de procédure gros c'est la loi de la jungle
C'est pas d'ma faute, darwah, j'crois bien que j'suis taré d'naissance
J'me reconnais pas moi-même des fois j'suis ravi de faire ma connaissance
Et quand je pars au shtar, bah t’inquiète pas que j'reçois des mandats
Et j'ai toujours la frappe, tah hollanda et bellanda
J'suis rabtah, zoogataga sous ma véranda
J'glisse mes doigts dans les cheveux tah Esmeralda
J'emmerde l'Etat, j'emmerde les stups, j'emmerde les gendarmes
Trafiquant de rimes, trafiquant d'stups ou trafiquant d'armes
Je suis, comment vous dites? 
Paranoïaque, ouais
Je m'en bat les yeuc', madame la juge baraneyek
J'te l'avais dit que j'avais des projets
Là j'graille des brochettes, j'insulte ta mère et j'touche des gros chèques
J’achète des trucs qui valent chères, rien qu'avant hier
J'me suis acheté 3-4 t-shirt, j'ai dépensé ton salaire
J'me suis roulé un gros sdeh, puis j'ai repensé à la misère
A cet été, à cet hiver, quand on était au val-d'Isère
Au mitar tah la Santé, les promenades en camembert
Au mitar tah Fleury, j'revois les toilettes j'me dis beurk!
A les bâtards, comment ils ont pu me faire ça?
Ils me l'ont mise j'leur est remise woogata vice et versa
Yaa zéh obligé de se faire remarquer, pas obligé de se faire embarquer déféré au parquet
Direction les grillages, bon, trêve d'enfantillage
Yeah, I speak a little English, motherfucking biatch!
Ould l'kahba what you gonna do Ok j'continue tout doux j'big up le rott' Mamadou
Yoogata yoogata gangz to gangz
Ouais, tu connais la musique, celui qui veux teste j'le baise

Ban-ban-bandit j'fait que du propre, j'effectue les sales tâches
Ça sert à quoi de jouer le pirate, si t'enquilles pas à l'abordage
Ils dopent en dopant, co on t'laisse le dos en deux
On est nous-mêmes en (?) exorciste avec un joint d'beuh
Tous les soirs j'dégrise, nos combines se développent
Mais des fois les quis' débarquent et dans les comptes ça fait des flops
Du crime ouais y'a la crème, Sta-ive c'est du vécu
Mon gros, chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Pas de X que t’achètes avec alcool et abus
De plus, j'baise ces nabots qui croient contrôler la rue
Les yeux cernés au poste, menotté à des barreaux de chaise
J'rêve d'Îles Vierges m'en fumer avec des barreaux de chaises
La nuit j'dors mal, éternellement tourmenté
En pensant que j'vais prendre cher si les keufs arrivent à tout remonter
Ceux qui sèment le vent, récolte du ons dans le ventre
A-L, futur ex-braqueur reconverti dans la vente

J'aimerais partir tranquille, les pieds d'vant
Un monde de fils de pute, j'suis obligé de vendre
Ah bon? 
Ça suffit pas alors on braque sa mère
M’en voulais pas dans le rap y'a trop de Zehmel
3 Quart, belle coupe, chico cassé
La vie c'est speed même mon ombre veut me dépasser
Oh, le sky est classé, j'suis chaud
Menacé ne sert à rien, j't'envoie 2-3 balles l'affaire est classé
Ramassé du biff, voilà dans quoi j'me suis perdu
J'sais c'que c'est d'avoir la dalle, j'en connais ces vertus
Hyper dur, fréquentation malsaine
Chiale pas sur mon sort, tu sais qu'ici personne nous accepte
On connaît le respect, Les valeurs et les principes
T'es le plus grand des hommes si tu te lèves pour bosser à Rungis
Malheureusement pas mon cas, au fond de moi je les envies
Nos vies, c'est faire du biff, mais resté en vie
Donc faut marcher armé, puis avoir la trique
Aujourd'hui t'allume demain t'es matrixé
C'est la vie du western, la vie d'moi j'suis réel
La tranquillité frérot est bloqué dans mes rêves
Impossible de l'avoir, je ne prend jamais de rotte-ca
Mais Belek au feu le couz si tu mets trop de bois
Beaucoup de salopes font les voyous, wallah que c'est pas une fierté
Dit moi qui sera là le jour ou t'auras vraiment merdé
J'ai l'orgueil d'un bébé, je m'énerve et je pète tout
J'assume les conséquences khey dans mes bras je prend le mektoub
Oui j'aime pas les poulets et je ferais recette sans eux
Une impression même jaloux de ma mère à 700E
Ils m'inventent des vies, le mythe ils veulent casser
Hum j'en ai assez, les traquer, les chlasser
Quand j'allais tu revenais, dans ta tête ça ne rentre pas
Je le ferais tout les jours, je compte l'oseille me dérange pas
Bien sur qu'on s'est fait tout seul, je sais très bien que tu sais
J'ai braqué des bijouteries quand les autres allaient sucer
Sans t'manquer de respect, dans l'rap dit moi ce qui est facile
Frérot on viens de la rue c'est des filles faciles

J'ai roulé ma bosse, j'en ai marre d'bouffer d'la merde
Coup d'crosse la vie t'assommes pire qu'un joint d'herbe
Tout ce qu'on a on finit par l'perdre
Étoile de mer 10 000 kilomètres
Perdu sur la lune verte
J'sui tellement loin des ""je veux être""
Berad d'aatay j'allume un Jaabouq à la fenêtre
T'es dans l'paraitre moi j'vais disparaitre
Les kheys passent au dispatching, une mère qui pleure c'est la faute d'un traitre
Y'a plus que des bras cassés dis-moi à qui serrer les coudes?
Six pieds sous terre quand j'me ferais bouffer par l'doud
Noyer dans le doute, j'suis toujours dans le hood
Les yeux rouges, oui dead casa negra j'suis pas un l'blood
Passe moi des feuilles ce soir j'fume mes dernières illusions
Sers moi un verre que j'tourne cette tragédie en dérision
11.43, Mortuaire sera la saison
Maintenant j'marche avec des rétros, dis qui va m'sauter l'caisson
Y'a y'a y'a plus d'rage que d'la fashionnerie
J'enterre l'espoir dans un parloir à Fleury
Ghetto youth langage, du whisky, les chicos pourries
Bonbon sauvage 0.4 roya sourit

Heh-hep-pep, Dieu seul est maitre de ma destinée
Moi j'me verrais bien à La Mecque avec mes rents-pa et ma dulcinée
La vie c'est pas un clip ni du ciné ou une bande dessinée
On va peut-être finir à Clairvaux, on va peut-être s'faire assassiner
C'est clair gros qu'on peut tout perdre sur un coup d'ker-po
J'te parle d'une boite ou pour rentrer y'a même pas besoin d'se faire beau
Le cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau
Quand j'ai fêté mes 16 ans c'est pas du plomb que j'avais dans le cerveau

J'ai 28 ans j'habite dans l'zoo je m'appelle Eddy Chabard
J'veux réussir, j'veux m'en sortir depuis que j'suis tout petit je chabarde
J'ai bicrave, j'ai fais plein d'conneries dont j'suis pas du tout fier
Comme les aller-retours à Fleury pour battre le fer faut du fer
Pour faire du flouze faut du flouze, des couilles et d'la gamberge
Surtout quand t'es seul contre tous y'a personne pour te tendre la perche
Moi Alhamdulillah j'suis pas comme ça j'préfère aider mon prochain
Car j'sais que Dieu me l'rendra ici bas ou dans un monde prochain
Lah yaalem bi kolchi, hata tkoun labes Gucci
Lmout tji ou tadik

J'arrive dans l'game avec You pour écraser tous ces chiens
Même s'ils sont plein on les baise tous kalachnikov à la main
Ca va péter dans l'quartier, dans tous les ghettos d'France
Ayat-al kursi 11.43 pour me souhaiter bonne chance
M'en bas les couilles de c'que tu penses, depuis ma tendre enfance
J'laisse la concurrence en transe lourde sera la sentence
Brulux on the flux toujours dans les bacs
Hier ils m'boycottaient maintenant ils veulent faire mes bacs
Prochain clip j'appelle Fredo il m'prépare le Maybach
Cette fois ci j'ferais pas l'gamin promis j'cacherais tes blacks
Ils m'ont pris pour une blague, des mesures il m'en reste quatre
Pour ma mère j'veux du 2.4 pour moi qamis, un RS4
Dédicace l'Algérie, le Maroc, la Tunisie
Faudra bientôt retourner chez nous car y'a trop d'crapules ici

Parce que tu manges du lion le matin devant moi tu veux rugir
Approche j'te mets une claque de roumain tu vas rougir
Plus tu vas monter plus les rumeurs vont surgir
Personne ne se fie d'personne écoutes bien tout ce que j'vais te dire
Tout ce qui est autour de moi, j'vais te l'exploser
La j'pète les plombs j'ai retiré la goupille j'fais exploser
A ma droite les frères mus' débarque pour nous faire des rappels
Pas la quand j'suis (?) les appelle
En primaire j'te frappais ouai j'me prenais pour l'king
A 10 ans au comico voiture péta dans un parking
Le quartier c'est une plaque tournante, ça défouraille de partout
Dans mon escalier j'tombe sur un sac remplis d'billets j'garde tout
Assis sur un banc toute la journée sa bibi
Dans les bois ça fais bep-bep ou cric-cric bim bim!
Au collège, lycée voilà les (?) moi j'casse des dents
Avec (?) ou pas leurs uppercuts te rentre dedans
On sais que la police nous surveille mais elle ne sait pas tout
Les malins savent très bien que l'argent ne fait pas tout
On a des avocats mais ils n'arrangent pas tout
Les médecins sont la mais il ne soignent pas tout
Pas de chance cette nuit la juge s'est fait mal baisée
Donc forcément des chance d'être acquitté on baissées
T'es pressé, t'accélères risquer sont les raccourcis
Kazou dis leur que cette est pute est plus de soucis que d'surcis

Posé à la tess j'ai rien vu, rien entendu
J'ves-qui les histoires tendu
Des fois c'est tes potes qui t'enculent
Avec du recul
J'ai fini par devenir solitaire
Pour l'Etat on a pas les critères
Donc on a fini sur le ter
J'vois des pères, des mères qui travaillent dur pour ceux qu'ils aiment
Wallah ça m'fait de la peine d'les rentrer pour rien dans nos problèmes
11.43 c'est le thème
La c'est Tirgo sur l'antenne
Poto dès l'début de l'enquête c'est possible que tu perds la tête
Envoie la frappe de Ketama dédicace à Khadama
J'suis obligé d'faire du sale y'a toute la cité derrière moi
Y'en a qui braquait des tabacs nous on bicravait du taga
Ouai continuer à taguer nous on à pas l'temps on tabasse
On va t'laisser aux aguets dé-ter comme l'armée du Hamas
J'savais pas que sur ce banc ouais j'allais fumer des kamas
Toute l'année tu fais des phases poto, c'est pas comme a-ç
Dans l'arène j'ai toujours la faille, flow qui tire comme un Fa-mas
Nous on est comme des hommes, on va toujours à la chasse
Y'a du biff' et des liasses obligé on s'déplace
Sa bicrave au fond de l'impasse
Désolé si ça dépasse
Dans ton bigo y'a les vrais et les boloss que t'effaces

We-wesh la racaille, les raclures la police en a ras-le-cul
Ma vie c'est un texte de rap remplit d'ratures
Nerveux l'sourire aux lèvres doté d'pouvoir céleste
J'ai perdu l'nord ma direction à moi c'est l'est
J'écris des textes de fou, beaucoup métaphorique
L'histoire d'un braqueur qui finit par taffer au Ritz
Rosny-sous-Bois, la Sambuy, les braquos, les sous-salles
Les sous-sols, les mouses, ceux qui moussent et qui s'débat ainsi qu'les douzes
J'rappe, je pense comme un mec de la ur
J'aime la pure qui branche les clients sur mon terrain tout les jours
J'ai pas d'bonnes habitudes j'descends et j'traine
J'truande j'ves-qui la justice dédicace à Fresnes
Les sirènes retentissent, les criminels se repentissent
La pisse du sheïtan, mes repentises, ma hantise
C'est vraiment pas la mort mais c'qui s'en suit
J'aime quand ça va que dans un sens (Oui!)
Quand c'est classé sans suite
Moi j'ai ramé, ramené la merde à mes rents-pa
Et j'donne tout à mes frères marlich s'ils me le rendent pas
La justice on s'la fait nous même, I'm so Hood!
Un dialogue de sourd entre moi et ma bouteille d'Absolut
Me parle pas d'la gloire n'y même du sommet (Nan, nan, nan)
Pour l'instant j'me bas pour finir la semaine
Mais guette moi j'suis la j'rappe sale vas-y acquiesce
De nos jours tu peux rater l'grand amour si t'as pas d'caisse

Sta-ive c'est du vécu
On comprend que chez moi le sang c'est vidé à cause du manque d'écus
Oui c'est l'cercle est vicieux bienvenue dans le cerceau

E poi la sera in questa vita mia con te.

Quel modo di vestire un po strano con le mani sul piano.

Sono sempre gli stessi

Poi respirò l'incenso quindi capì l'immenso

Della gente
Non aveva pietà.

Forse per sempre il tuo posto ormai l'ha preso
Il suo volto, il suo sorriso,

If you don't see it like I see it then you see it wrong
We October 3rd niggas like me and Kwe'
Life got me in a state on the interstate
And all I'm thinking bout is what's up on my dinner plate
Meanwhile I make your girls hyperventilate
Prolly cause I live the kind of life art imitate

Passport pimping like I'm going outta town to flip
The ass for a symbol with the cops hopping out of whips
Bath salt niggas with the zombies apocalypse
I'm blessed cause my afterlife is the studio
This rappers life is gangster's paradise like I'm Coolio
That's what a few believe like a doobie roll
We off of that Patrón, we sipping the Don Julio
You talking shit? we don't need the chatter
Opinions are like assholes, not everybody fecal matter
So they straining to push it out, put they foot in their mouth
That's when I'm letting the Brooklyn out when they pull it out
Better let it off cause you set it off
The music that's creating a movement like it's December 4th
Threw away the dark meat but they ate the white

Tired of saying I'm the best, I won't waste another breath
Heard lyrics coming back, I say it never left
Y'all just catching up, so slow to come around
Ice-T gave ya cliff notes, I ain't gotta dumb it down
Cause I read the book, made the movie and I edit this
All while I be living it, and set the precedence
And get the presidents, fuck all the chit chat
Might hear the click clack, and I'mma diss back
Married to the game get the rice out Riff Raff
Nice being self employed, ain't gotta kiss ass
I ain't gotta slim fast, smack a ho with a love handle
Dare you to say you ain't a fan boo, roll a bamboo

Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,1960

I've hung around you just like a fool
Falling head and heels in love like a kid out of school.

My poor heart is in an awful state now
But it's too late now to call a halt

So if I become a nuisance it's all your fault!

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Ican't help it if that doggoned moon above
Makes me need someone like you to love!

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!

Al Casey,"I never cared much for moonlit skies
I never wink back at fireflies
But now that the stars are in your eyes
I'm beginning to see the light

I never went in for afterglow
Or candlelight on the mistletoe
But now when you turn the lamp down low
I'm beginning to see the light

Used to ramble through the park
Shadowboxing in the dark
Then you came and caused a spark
That's a four-alarm fire now

I never made love by lantern-shine
I never saw rainbows in my wine
But now that your lips are burning mine
I'm beginning to see the light",I'm Beginning to See the Light,1974
