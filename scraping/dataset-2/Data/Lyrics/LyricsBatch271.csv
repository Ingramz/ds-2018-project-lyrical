Frank Sinatra,"A fine romance, with no kisses
A fine romance, my friend this is
We should be like a couple of hot tomatoes
But you're as cold as yesterday's mashed potatoes
A fine romance, you won't nestle
A fine romance, you won't wrestle
I might as well play bridge
With my old maid aunt
I haven't got a chance
This is a fine romance

A fine romance, my good fellow
You take romance, I'll take jello
You're calmer than the seals
In the Arctic Ocean
At least they flap their fins
To express emotion
A fine romance with no quarrels
With no insults and all morals
I've never mussed the crease
In your blue serge pants
I never get the chance
This is a fine romance",A Fine Romance,1961
Frank Sinatra,"In the still of the night
As i gaze out of my window
At the moon in its flight
My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When i say to you

Do you love me
Just like i love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill
In the still of the night",In the Still of the Night,1961
Frank Sinatra,"When i take my sugar to tea,
All the boys are jealous of me,
'cause i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take my sugar to tea.
I'm a rowdy dowdy,
That's me, she's a high hat baby, that's she,
So i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take my sugar to tea.
Every Sunday afternoon,
We forget about our cares,
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz,
With those millionaires.
When i take my sugar to tea,
I'm as ritzy as i can be,
'cause i never take her where the gang goes,
When i take my sugar to tea.

When i take, take my sugar to tea.",When I Take My Sugar to Tea,1961
Frank Sinatra,"You and the night and the music
Fill me with flaming desire
Setting my being completely on fire
You and the night and the music
Thrill me, but will we be one
After the night and the music are done?

Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight
Hearts will be throbbing guitars
Morning will come without warning and take away the stars
If we must live for the moment
Love till the moment is through
After the night and the music die
Will I have you?

Until the pale light of dawn and in daylight

Frank Sinatra,"Blue moon you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for 
Someone I really could care for

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper ""Please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper ""please adore me""
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold!

Blue moon! 
Now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own",Blue Moon,1961
Frank Sinatra,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Frank Sinatra,"The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out just like a dying amber
That September in the rain

To every word of love i heard you whisper
The raindrops seemed to play our sweet refrain
Though spring is here to me it's still September
That September in the rain

Frank Sinatra,"You made me what I am today, I hope you're satisfied,
You dragged and dragged me down until the soul within me died.
You've shattered each and every dream, fooled me right from the start.
And though you're not true, may God bless you,
That's the curse of an aching heart.

You made me what I am today, I should hope you're satisfied,

Frank Sinatra,"April skies are in your eyes, but darling, don't be blue
Don't cry, oh honey please don't be that way.
Clouds in the sky should never make you feel that way
The rain will bring the violets of may
Tears are in vain, so honey please don't be that way

Frank Sinatra,"Granada, I'm falling under your spell
And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell
Of an age the world has long forgotten
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wander along
Entranced by the beauty before me
Entranced by a land full of flowers and song
When day is done and the sun touch the sea in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Tierra Novada
Soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic and gay

And soon it will welcome the stars
While a thousand guitars play a soft carbinera
Then moonlit Granada will live again
The glory of yesterday, romantic, gay Granada",Granada,1961
Frank Sinatra,"I always thought that I'd prefer single-blessed-ness
Thought that I'd like to stay free
I never thought my time would come to marry,
No wedding bells for me, I've changed my mind after all,
You are the one made me fall, for...
I used to smile at all the songs that were popular,
Nothing but love in each song,
I used to think those kind of songs were foolish,
Now I admit I'm wrong.
Love songs are part of my plan, show me the minister man, for...

I never knew I could love anybody,
Honey, like I'm loving you;
I couldn't realize what a pair of eyes and a baby smile could do.

I never knew I could love anybody,
Honey, like I'm loving you.",I Never Knew,1961

Frank Sinatra,"Moonlight on the ganges, my little hindu,
When I whisper love's sweet melody,
All our dreams and our schemes came true.
Someday on the ganges, I'll need you once more,
And I'll kiss you and caress you
Where the waters kiss the silent shore.

Frank Sinatra,"Please don't talk about me when I'm gone,
Oh, honey though our friendship ceases, from now on;
And, listen, if you can't say anything real nice,
It's better not to talk at all, is my advice.

We're parting, you go your way I'll go mine,

Remember, please don't talk about me when I'm gone.",Please Don't Talk About Me When I'm Gone,1961
Frank Sinatra,"Are you lonesome tonight, do you miss me tonight, are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a bright summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart.
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep, and picture me there

Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?",Are You Lonesome Tonight?,1962
Frank Sinatra,"I can't forget the night we met how bright were stars above
That precious memory lingers yet when you declared your love
And then you went away and now each night and day

I wonder why you keep me waiting, Charmaine, my Charmaine
I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams be the same
I wonder if you ever think of me too ..
I am waiting my Charmaine for you ...

You went away on dreary day I knew you had to go,
Mid tears and cheers I heard you say ""Charmaine, I love you so""
Tho old years turn to new my heart keeps calling you

""I wonder why you keep me waiting"" Charmaine cries in vain
""I wonder when bluebirds are mating, will you come back again
I wonder if I keep on praying, will our dreams by the same
I wonder if you ever think of me too""
Charmaine's waiting, just for you.",Charmaine,1962
Frank Sinatra,"Before we say good-bye forever, come waltz with me, come waltz with me - once more
Before we let love die forever, come waltz with me, the way we waltzed - before
Before our little world, just crumbled and fell
And tumbled, like a house of cards - to the floor
Before I'm left to sigh forever, and haunt the past - give me this last - encore
Oh darling come and waltz with me - once more",Come Waltz With Me [*],1962
Frank Sinatra,"Indiscreet - it's indiscreet
To gaze at you - each time we meet
I've told my eyes - they must disguise - this yearning
Yes it's indiscreet - quite indiscreet

To find your touch - so bitter sweet
You're close to me and suddenly I'm burning
While I ask myself: ""Where is your pride?""
Irresistibly I'm drawn to your side

And (Yes) it's indiscreet - so indiscreet
But love is swift - and time is sweet
And oh my dear - I crave the nearness of you
To love you is why my heart must be
So love me - it can't be indiscreet",Indiscreet,1962
Frank Sinatra,"Oh, how I miss you tonight, miss you while lights are low,
Oh, how I need you tonight, more than you'll ever know.

But I'd rather be lonely, and wait for you only,
My dear, how I miss you tonight.

My dear, how I miss you tonight.","Oh, How I Miss You Tonight",1962
Frank Sinatra,"One little kiss, a moment of bliss, then hours of deep regret
One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

Into my dreams you wandered it seems
And then there came a day
You loved me too
My dreams had come true

And all the world was May
But soon the May time turned to December
You had forgotten
Do you remember?",Remember,1962
Frank Sinatra,"My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance
A moment of bliss we spent
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance
As into the night we went
And sang to our hearts content

The song is ended
But the melody lingers on
You and the song are gone
But the melody lingers on

The night was splendid
And the melody seemed to say
""Summer will pass away
Take your happiness while you may""

There beneath the light of the moon
We sang a love song that ended too soon

The moon descended
And I found with the break of dawn
You and the song had gone
But the melody lingers on",The Song Is Ended,1962
Frank Sinatra,"[musical intro]
I lost the sunshine and roses, I lost the heavens of blue,
I lost the beautiful rainbow, I lost the morning dew.
I lost the angel who gave me summer, the whole winter too.
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness,

Till you
I was a lonely one

I'm as helpless as a kitten
Up a tree
And I feel like I'm
Hanging from a cloud
I can't understand

Just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
This magic I hear
I get misty

The moment you're near
You could say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see just how hopelessly I'm drawn
That's why I'm following you
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty

And too much in love
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left

Frank Sinatra,"Alone from night to night 
You'll find me too weak to break the chains that bind me.
I need no shackles to remind me, 
I'm just a prisoner of love.

For one command, I stand and wait now 
From one who's master of my fate now.
I can't escape for it's too late now, 
I'm just a prisoner of love.

What's the good of my caring 
If someone is sharing those arms with me.
Although she has another, 
I can't find another for I'm not free.

And the promise to be near each time you call
And the only heart I own is yours and yours alone, that's all, that's all

I can only give you country walks in springtime
And a hand to hold when leaves begin to fall
And a love whose burning light to warm the winter night, that's all, that's all

There are those I am sure who have told you
They will give you the world for a toy
All I ask for these arms to enfold you, and a love, time can never destroy

Frank Sinatra,"London by night is a wonderful sight
There is magic abroad in the air
I'm often told that the streets turn to gold
When the moon shines on Circus and Square 

Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There´s romance in each cigarette glow
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau

Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He´s not alone, for it seems
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep her watch
While each Londoner dreams

My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast-fading light
Most people say they love London by day
But lovers love London by night",London by Night [the Frank Sinatra Collection],1962

She can look at the future and drive away all your fears,
Everything will come out right if you only believe The Gypsy,
She can tell at a glance that my heart was full of tears.

She listens and starts and trembles,
'Tis the first little song of love.

Roses are shining in Picardy,

But now that the stars are in your eyes, I'm beginning to see the light.
I never went for after-glow, candle light on the mistletoe,
But now when you turn the lamp down low, I'm beginning to see the light.

Used to ramble through the park, shadow boxing in the dark,
Then you came and caused a spark, that's a four-alarm fire now.

Frank Sinatra,"When I hear that serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know, many moons ago.

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory, serenade in blue
It seems like only yesterday, the small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away, I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but
Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark, serenade in blue.",Serenade in Blue,1962
Frank Sinatra,"Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by, senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run, but her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eye and chapeaux by Dache.
Tangerine, with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame.
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine
Where the label says ""From Macy's Mezzanine"".
Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl, but she's only fooling one girl
She's only fooling Tangerine!",Tangerine,1962

I've seen the look that the fellow by her side has

We are locked in a wondrous embrace
And there on that fabulous face
Is that fabulous look of love for me

Frank Sinatra,"Love isn't just for the young,
It's for all who may wish upon a star,
Love isn't just for the young,
For true love doesn't ask how old you are.
Doesn't matter if you're twenty or ninety two,
You only need a heart to share,
Then of course you need someone who feels like you,
And who answers every dream and prayer.
Love isn't just for the young,
Never fear, let the whole world know it's spring.

For love isn't just for the young,
And there's, oh, so much joy that it can bring.
Yes, the gold may have turned to silver,
But if you still have songs left unsung,
Just remember that love is for everyone,
Love isn't just for the young.

Add to these a nose that I can thumb, and a mouth by gum have I

Silly dreams I knew would disappear,
But it seems they left a souvenir,

T'was like a melodious plea, wee moon song that wasn't meant for me.
Why is it always reminding me of a love dream that never could be.
Wee moon song that wasn't meant for me.
It came gliding into my heart, riding on a moonbeam from above.

Come back to me.

Blast your hide, you recall, must I fight City hall
Here and now, damn it all, come on back to me,
Where on earth must I be, still I yell till I'm blue,
In control then when you come on back to me.

Have you gone to the moon, or the corner saloon
And to crack and to croon, oh my girl, where in hell can you be?

And the junkyards and the highways come between us

And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see

I can hear the sound of rain in my heart, of the tears that I hide,
And it tears me apart, 'cause I keep them inside,
I can't get away from the sound of the rain in my heart.
How could I know, my love, I was a toy, only a game to you?
How could you go, my love, without a thought of what I'm going through?
How can I forget I still love you so, it echoes each time that I hear

And she says hi, and I stumble to the breakfast table,
While the kids are going off to school goodbye.
And she reaches out and takes my hand,
Squeezes it, says, how you feelin' hon?
And I look across at smiling lips that warm my heart and see my morning sun.
And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say.
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime.
There's no such thing as Dr. Zeuss, Disneyland, and Mother Goose no nurs'ry rhyme.
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis when the winter comes.
There's no such thing as make-believe, puppy dogs, and autumn leaves and B.B. guns.
Sometimes I call her up at home knowing she's busy
And ask if she could get away and meet me, and grab a bite to eat.
And she drops what she's doin' and hurries down to meet me, and I'm always late.
But she sits, waiting patiently and smiles when she first sees me
Cause she's made that way and if that's not lovin' me
Then all I've got to say.(chorus)",Little Green Apples,1969

But lately I'm so downhearted, 'cause I can't get started with you
In Cincinnati or in Rangoon, I simply smile and all the gals swoon
Their whims I've more than just charted, but I can't get started with you

O tell me why am I no kick to you, I who'd always stick to you
Fly through thin and thick to you, tell me why I'm taboo

Frank Sinatra,"My lean baby - tall and thin
Five feet seven - of bones and skin
But when she tells me maybe she loves me
I feel as mellow as a fellow can be
She's so skinny - she's so drawn
When she stands sideways - you (would) think (that) she's gone
But when she calls me: ""baby"" - I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
She's slender, but she's tender
She makes my heart surrender
And every night, when I hold her tight
The feeling is nice - my arms can go around twice
My lean baby - she's so slim
A broomstick's wider - but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me - then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby - strange to see
And all that nothing - it belongs to me
And though she may be scrawny - she's OK
Because I wouldn't want her any other way
She's so skinny - she's so drawn
When she stands sideways - you (would) think (that) she's gone
But when she calls me: ""baby"" - I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
I chased her - and I caught her

But here is the twist - she wears it right on her wrist

The cigarettes you light, one after another
Won't help you forget her and the way that you love her
You're only burnin', a torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track, for learnin' the blues

Listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own.
Suddenly it hits you all those dreams WEREN'T worth a dime,
Cause no one ever tells you in time.
Long before the icy winds of winter,
Autumn tells the swallows, time to fly,
Why did she pretend till the bitter end
Till it broke my heart to say goodbye.

No one ever warns you when your heart begins to SING
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war,
But no one ever tells you before.

Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild

For the last time we have tasted 
Love's sweet tears by the fire's glow.
If our hearts are strong there'll be 
No long good-byes when it's time to go.
But the strongest torch is sometimes broken
As the deepest vows aren't always spoken,
And the greatest wounds, we hide inside ourselves 
Where they never show.

Dream away, child, let your dreams run wild.
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.
Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or the years and the tears shed might claim you.

When the Winter weds the Northern Wind 
The child they bear is snow.
And the branches bow like worried bridesmaids 
But the trees will grow.
Sun and Earth in time will come together,
God will give us back our summer weather,
But the mem'ries of that first sweet 
Taste of love pass away so slow.

Dream away, child; let your dreams run wild
Or a lifetime of worries might claim you.

For in my fancy I sweep away light,
And keep my image of the sky,
Just the way we like it, you and I.

All through the day I dream about the night,
I dream about the night, Here with you.
All through the day I wish away the time,
Until the time when I'm here with you.

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you,
The evening mist melts away,
Down smiles the moon, And soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day.","All Through the Day [From ""Centennial Summer""]",1975

So I haven't time to be a millionaire

It's something daring, the Continental
A way of dancing that's really ultra-new

It has a passion, the Continental

It's quite the fashion, the Continental
Because you tell of your love while you dance
You kiss while you're dancing
It's continental, ooh, it's continental

You sing while you're dancing
Your voice is gentle and so sentimental
You'll know before the dance is through
That you're in love with her and she's in love with you

That there's a rhythm in your heart and soul
A certain rhythm that you can't control

Half the time you never wanted enough, oh wake up, I don't make that a crime,
And while it's going along, you take for granted some love will wear away,
We took for granted a lot, and still I say, it could have kept on going,
Instead of just kept on, we had a good thing going, going, gone.",Good Thing Going,1981
Frank Sinatra,"She was Boston, I was Vegas,
She was crepe suzette, I was pie,
She was lectures, I was movies, but I loved her.
She was Mozart, I was Macy,
She was afternoon tea, I was saloon,
She was Junior League, I was Dodgers,
But I loved her morning, night and noon.
Opposites attract, the wise men claim,
Still I wish that we had been a little more the same.
It might have been a shoot out war,
If we had know each other more.
She was polo, I was race track,
She was museum, I was G.P.
She did her best to change me
Though she never never knew quite how,
But I loved her, almost as much as I do now.

[Piano Interlude]

She was Wall Street, I was pawn shop,
She was French champagne, I was beer,

But there was one thing she didn't know,
That I loved her, 'cause I never never told her so.",I Loved Her,1981
Frank Sinatra,"Long night, it's a long night, my friend
The barrooms and the back street's dead end
Sometimes I thought I saw the sunrise and good times in the air
It was just, it was just another big town with midnight's neon glare

Long night, it's a long night, I know
The bus rides and the ""nowhere to go""

I've seen what the street corners do to things like love and dreams
Seen what the bottle can do to a man with his hopes and his schemes

A long night, what a long night it has been
The wheelers and the dealers, they win
I've tasted the 90-proof gin and chased it away with the blues
I rarely paid debts that I owed but I sure have paid my dues

No daylight, just a long night for me",A Long Night,1981
Frank Sinatra,"I know there were a hundred ways to tell her I loved her
It's funny how they're all so clear today
And when her face was burning with sadness and yearning

But it's so easy looking at the game the morning after
Adding up the kisses and the laughter
Knowing how you'd play it if the chance to play it over ever came
But then, a Monday morning quarterback never lost a game

The room was so alive with all her feelings and longings
I saw the spark of danger in her eyes
Well, how would it have hurt me if I'd turned back and held her?
A moment passes, something lovely dies

Frank Sinatra,"I'd be glad to stay right here with you
Fact is, that is what I'd planned to
But from that fool look on your face
I think I'll head South to a warmer place

Thought I'd given you the best of me
I'd be glad to share the rest of me
But there's a chill in your embrace
So, I'd better head South, to a warmer place

Seems like yesterday we could kiss and build a fire
But now it's ten below
Seems like yesterday nights were warm with love's desire
But now it feels like snow

Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet

How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But, thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too

Hanging my stocking I can hear a knocking

Who's there, who is it stopping for a visit? 
Is that you, Santa Claus? 
Are you bringing a present for me
Something pleasantly pleasant for me? 
Then it's just what I've been waiting for

Is that you, Santa Claus? 

Yes, hanging the stocking, I can hear a knocking

Now stop teasing 'cause I know you're there
We don't believe in no goblins today
But I can't explain why I'm shaking that way
Bet I can see ole Santa in the keyhole
I'll get to the cause

On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone perhaps per chance be Mack the Knife?

From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag it is dropping on down
Yeah the cement is just for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Mackie's back in town

My man Louis Miller, he split the scene babe
After drawing out all the bread from his stash
Now Macheath spends like a pimp babe
Do you suppose that our boy, he's did something rash

Ah, old Satchmo, Louis Armstrong, Bobby Darrin
They did this song nice, lady Ella too
They all sang it, with so much feeling
That old blue eyes, he ain't gonna add nothing new

But with Quincy's big band, right behind me
Swinging hard, Jack, I now I can't lose
When I tell you, all about Mack the knife babe
It's an offer, you can never refuse

We got George Benson, we got Newman & Foster
We got the Brecker Brothers, and Hampton's bringing up the rear
All these bad cats, and more, are in the band now
They make the greatest sounds, you ever gonna hear

Hey Sookie Taudry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum, Old Miss Lulu Brown
Oh the line forms, on the right dear
Now that Macheath, I mean that man Macheath
Yeah he's bad, mercy mercy
Yeah he's badder than old Leroy Brown
You better lock your door, and call the law
Because Macheath's, that bum,
He's back in town",Mack the Knife [#],1990
Frank Sinatra,"Shades of night are falling and I'm lonely
Standing on the corner feeling blue
Sweethearts out for fun
Pass me one by one
Guess I'll wind up like I always do
With only
Me and my shadow
Strolling down the avenue
Me and my shadow
Not a soul to tell our troubles to
And when it's twelve o'clock
We climb the stair
We never knock
For nobody's there
Just me and my shadow
All alone and feeling blue
When the sun sets on the far horizon
And the parlor lamps begin to glow
Jim and Jack and John
Put their slippers on
They're all set but we'restill on the go
So lonely

Frank Sinatra,"And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way

For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

Yes, it was my way",My Way,1990
Frank Sinatra,"If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee, what a thrill each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case 
On Nancy with the laughin' face
She takes the winter and she makes it summer
And summer could take a few lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's Nancy with the laughin' face
Did you ever heard mission bells ringin'?
Well, she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singin'
Just hear her say hello
I swear to goodness you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy with the laughin' face",Nancy (With the Laughing Face) [#],1990
Frank Sinatra,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer show'are is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day
You are the one
Only you 'neath the moon 
Or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
No matter, darling where you are
I think of you
Night and day

Day and night
Why it is so
That this longing for you 
Follows wherever I go
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you
Night and day

Night and day
Under the hide of me

There was magic abroad in the air
There were angels dining at the Ritz
And a nightingale sang in Berkley Square

I may be right, I may be wrong
But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square

The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down

The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And, as we kissed and said goodnight,
A nightingale sang in Berkley Square

I saw that I was through
Oh, you crazy moon
What did you do
And when they kissed, they tried to say
That it was just in fun
Oh, you crazy moon
Look what you've done
Once you promised me, you know
That it would never end
You should be ashamed to show
Your funny face my friend

Frank Sinatra,"Once, once I Loved
And I gave so much love to this world you were the world to me
Once I cried
At the thought I was foolish and proud and let you say goodbye
And then one day
From my infinite sadness you came and brought me love again

That no matter what ever befalls I'll never let you go

Frank Sinatra,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around",The Second Time Around,1990
Frank Sinatra,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few
September, November
And these few precious days I'll spend with you
These precious days I'll spend with you",September Song,1990
Frank Sinatra,"I wonder what he'll think of me
I guess he'll call me the ""old man""
I guess he'll think I can lick
Every other feller's father
Well, I can

I bet that he'll turn out to be
The spittin' image of his dad
But he'll have more common sense
Than his pudding-headed father ever had

I'll teach him to wrestle
And dive through a wave
When we go in the mornings for our swim
His mother can teach him
The way to behave
But she won't make a sissy out o' him
Not him! Not my boy! Not Bill

[Chorus:]
Bill, I will see that he is named after me, I will
My boy, Bill! He'll be tall
And tough as a tree, will Bill
Like a tree he'll grow
With his head held high
And his feet planted firm on the ground
And you won't see nobody dare to try
To boss or toss him around
No pot-bellied, baggy-eyed bully will toss him around

I don't give a damn what he does
As long as he does what he likes
He can sit on his tail
Or work on a rail
With a hammer, hammering spikes

He can ferry a boat on a river
Or peddle a pack on his back
Or work up and down
The streets of a town
With a whip and a horse and a hack

He can haul a scow along a canal
Run a cow around a corral
Or maybe bark for a carousel
Of course it takes talent to do that well

He might be a champ of the heavyweights
Or a feller that sells you glue
Or President of the United States
That'd be all right, too

His mother would like that
But he wouldn't be President unless he wanted to be
Not Bill!

[Chorus]

And I'll be damned if he'll marry the boss' daughter
A skinny-lipped virgin with blood like water
Who'll give him a peck
And call it a kiss
And look in his eyes through a lorgnette
Say, why am I talkin' on like this?
My kid ain't even been born, yet!

I can see him when he's seventeen or so
And startin' to go with a girl
I can give him lots of pointers, very sound
On the way to get 'round any girl
I can tell him ...
Wait a minute
Could it be?
What the hell
What if he is a girl?
What would I do with her?
What could I do for her?
A bum with no money
You can have fun with a son
But you got to be a father to a girl

She mightn't be so bad at that
A kid with ribbons in her hair
A kind o' neat and petite
Little tin-type of her mother
What a pair

I can just hear myself bragging about her
My little girl
Pink and white
As peaches and cream is she
My little girl
Is half again as bright
As girls are meant to be
Dozens of boys pursue her
Many a likely lad does what he can to woo her
From her faithful dad

She has a few
Pink and white young fellers of two and three
But my little girl
Gets hungry every night and she comes home to me

I got to get ready before she comes
I got to make certain that she won't be dragged up in slums
With a lot of bums like me
She's got to be sheltered
And be dressed in the best money can buy
I never knew how to get money
But, I'll try, by God! I'll try
I'll go out and make it or steal it
Or take it or die",Soliloquy,1990
Frank Sinatra,"The summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
It lingered there, to touch your hair and walk with me
All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts and the summer wind

Like painted kites, those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
Then softer than a piper man, one day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you to the summer wind

The autumn wind, and the winter winds they have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on
And guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind
Warm summer wind

Frank Sinatra,"Wherever we may be along about this time of year, our
Hearts become sentimental pilgrims and head for home. 

Because home is where we all discover that 
Christmas is one time of the year when we don't have to be wealthy to be rich. 
Some of us remember Christmas as the time when Dad gave us our first gold watch. 
Others remember it as the time when a charity organization 
Delivered a Christmas basket to the doorstep before dawn, 
So the neighbors wouldn't see and Mother wouldn't be embarrassed. 

But whether the hearth that cheered your family was a
Fireplace of marble or a kitchen stove of cast iron, 
You'll remember that your home was the richest place on earth, 
Warmed by the richest spirit on earth, the spirit of Christmas.
 
And that's why I've chosen this next song to sing as a Christmas song. 
It's not a carol, it's just a beautiful pathway of friendly 
And understanding music up which our hearts may travel 
As they make their Yuletide pilgrimage goin' home.

Goin' home, goin' home
I'm a'goin' home
Quiet-like, some still day
I'm a'goin' home

It's not far, just close by
Through an open door
Work all done, care laid by
Goin'ta fear no more

Mother's there, 'spectin' me
Father's waitin', too
Lots of folks gathered there
All the friends I knew

One of the most precious gifts we have throughout the
Year is one we often forget, the precious gift of freedom. 
Freedom to work, to play, to worship as we please. 

Freedom to decided how we'll handle our own future, 
Cause we can make our future and that of our families a secure one though saving. 
We can buy Savings Bonds to take care of that new home or an education for our kids. 
No one says we have to buy 'em, we want to buy 'em, 
Cause they're not only an investment in our own future, 
They're an investment in the finest country in the world. 

So let me urge you sincerely, as we look toward a new year, 
To plan for making it a secure year, for the regular purchase of US Savings Bonds. 
So long, everybody, and Merry Christmas.",Goin' Home,1992
Frank Sinatra,"Wrong, would it be wrong to kiss
Seeing I feel like this?
Would it be wrong to try?
Wrong, would it be wrong to stay
Here in your arms this way?

With you forever?

Frank Sinatra,"When most us saddle up for the old trail for our last ride, we leave little
Enough behind to show that once we have camped here. Some leave more than
Others, some a memory and some a fortune, some a song. And a song can be as
Fine a memorial to a man as anything that can be left behind, 'cause you see

It's gold, and it's gold that all can share. We have a great song to
Remember Lorenz Hart by, that wonderful melody that he and Dick Rodgers
Wrote for the Connecticut Yankee, of course you know, My Heart Stood Still
I took one look at you, that's all I meant to do

And then my heart stood still,
My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk
And yet my heart stood still.
Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew

That unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew
I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment
When my heart stood still.
(That unfelt clasp of hands told me how well you knew, hmmmm)

I laughed at sweethearts I met at schools
All indiscreet hearts seemed romantic fools
(A house in Iceland was my heart's domain)
(I saw your eyes, now castles rise in Spain!)

Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew

Down and down I go
Round and round I go

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire

To sit by his side and listen to him talk and agree with the things he'll say.

To hold in his arms and know that she believes that her fellow is wise and strong.

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny - and his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a - stubborn streak

And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a pig

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He ain't got no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy - and extremely rude

But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a fish

A fish won't do anything but swim in a brook
He can't write his name or read a book
And to fool the people is his only thought
Though he slippery - he still gets caught
But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

And all the monkeys aren't in a zoo
Every day you meet quite a few
So you see it's all up to you
You can be better than you are
You could be swinging on a star

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights the star

And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine",All the Things You Are,1992

That I always have found it best, 
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,

And when you talk, you talk at me
And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing

And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you

Alone with the tide was he,
I looked and I thought as I watched him go by:
There but for you go I.

From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from Heaven's all gracious King

Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing

Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours, come swiftly on the wing
Oh, rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

Frank Sinatra,"(Wonderland winter, wonderland, wonderland)
Sleigh bells ring are you listening?
In the lane snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, oh, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He's singing a song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

Well in the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, are you married? We say, no man
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid of the plans that we made
Walking in a winter wonderland

(In the meadow we can build a snowman)
And pretend he's a circus clown
We have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down

Oh when it snows ain't it filling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' thru the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves wuz made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered thru the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
with sweat,
They're ridin' hard to atch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

Frank Sinatra,"You went away
I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind
Still, the magic of the night I met you

And high above
The moon was new
And so was love

She had a well-developed personality.
And what did Romeo see in Juliet or Hero in Perriet, or Jupiter in Juno? you know!
Or when Salome danced and had the boys entranced,
No doubt it must have been easy to see
That she knew how to use her personality.

Steals across the meadows of my heart

Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you

And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

Ev'ry time you're near a rose,
Aren't you glad you've got a nose?
And if the dawn is fresh with dew,
Aren't you glad you're you?
When a meadowlark appears,
Aren't you glad you've got two ears?
And if your heart is singing, too,
Aren't you glad you're you?
You can see a summer sky,
Or touch a friendly hand,
Or taste an apple pie.
Pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand?
And when you wake up each morn,
Aren't you glad that you were born?
Think what you've got the whole day through,
Aren't you glad you're you?",Aren't You Glad You're You [From the Bells of St. Mary's],1994

And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do, I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars

A boulevardier, the toast of Paris.
For over the noise, the talk and the smoke,
I'm good for a laugh, a drink or a jokeI walk in a room, a party or ball,
""Come sit over here"" somebody will call.
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all!
But how many times I stop and recall.

Ah, the apple trees,
Blossoms in the breeze,
That we walked among,
Lying in the hay,
Games we used to play,
While the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday, when the world was young.

2. Wherever I go they mention my name,
And that in itself, is some sort of fame,
""Come by for a drink, we're having a game,""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came.
The talk is quite gay, the company fine,
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine,
And beautiful girls and some of them mine,
But often my eyes see a diff'rent shine.

Ah, the apple trees,
Sunlit memories,
Where the hammock swung,
On our backs we'd lie,
Looking at the sky,
Till the stars were strung,
Only last July when the world was young.

Ah, the apple trees,
Blossoms in the breeze,
That we walked among,
Lying in the hay,
Games we used to play,
While the rounds were sung,
Only yesterday, when the world was young.

3. While sitting around, we often recall,
The laugh of the year, the night of them all.
The blonde who was so attractive that year,
Some opening night that made us all cheer.
Remember that time we all got so tight,
And Jacques and Antoine got into a fight.
The gendarmes who came, passed out like a light,
I laugh with the rest, it's all very bright.",When the World Was Young,1995

Frank Sinatra,"It's art that made the mold
It's the difference between the big and the small
It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Just as long as it comes from the heart

It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Just as long as it comes from the heart
Just put more heart into you voice
And you'll become the people's choice

Just make up your mind from the start
That the song's gotta come from the heart
Just make up your mind from the start
That the song's gotta come from the heart

Don't be afraid you'll make your grade
Why you can sing as good as Bing
That's why I say when you start
That the song's gotta come from the heart

It doesn't have to be witty or smart
Long as it comes from the heart
It doesn't have to be classic or rock
Long as it comes from the heart

I'll give 'em that
I'll give 'em this
I'll strut away
Boy! You can't miss!
Just put a star on my chart
they won't need this anymore!
Cause the song's gonna come from the heart

Don't work cheap!
On opening nights, your name in lights

Why we won't stop, 'til you reach the top

We'll order our meal a la carte
That's expensive!
If the song comes from the heart

We'll be tremendous!
If the song comes from the heart
Can't call up Gable
If the song comes from the heart!

Frank Sinatra,"All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm no good without you
Take my lips I want to lose them
Take my arms I'll never use them
Your good bye left me with eyes that cry
How can I get on dear without you

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me

All of me why not take all of me
Can't you see I'm just a mess without you

Frank Sinatra,"Time and again I've longed for adventure
Something to make my heart beat much faster
What did I long for, I never really knew.
Finding your love, I found my adventure,
Touching your hand my heart beat much faster
All that I want in all of this world is you.

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.
You are the angel glow that lights the star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.
Someday my happy arms will hold you,
And someday I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine.",All the Things You Are [From Very Warm for May],1995
Frank Sinatra,"There's nothing left for me of days that used to be,
I live in memory among my souvenirs.
Some letters tied with blue, photograph or two,
I see a rose from you among my souvenirs.
A few more tokens rest within my treasure chest,
And though they do their best to give me consolation,
I count them all apart and as the teardrops start,
I find a broken heart among my souvenirs.

Paris blues called Azure-Te,
How can I be blue in Paris?
Easy 'cause you're far away.
Can't lose these blues, this Azure-Te.
Side-walk tables filled with people,
Always happy, always gay,
Still I'm all alone in Paris,
Praying you'll return someday,
Can't lose this blues, this Azure-Te

Funny taxis, the kids at play,
Paris without you is lonesome,
Yearning more and more each day,

You'd come back to me to stay,
Having you with me in Paris,
Really is the only way,

Frank Sinatra,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine [From Jubilee],1995
Frank Sinatra,"These are the blues
Nothing but blues

Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can

They only had the rhythm
So they started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
This is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill way up on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
Until it was worn into a blue note

And then they nursed it
They rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the Southland gave birth to the blues

They nursed it
Then they rehearsed it

For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it
I'm all for you body and soul

I spend my days in longing
And wondering why it's me you're ogling
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Like to plant my feet on the Brooklyn Bridge
What a lovely view from
Heaven looks at you from the Brooklyn Bridge

I love to listen to the wind through her strings
The song that she sings for the town
I love to look up at the clouds in her hair
She's learned to wear like a crown

Where a little ball o' rhythm has a shoe-shine stand
People gather 'round and they clap their hands
