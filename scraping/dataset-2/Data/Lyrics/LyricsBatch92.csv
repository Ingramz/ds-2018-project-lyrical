Curt Patterson,"Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says,""Baby, uh, uh, it don't work""
You say your prayers though you don't care; you dance and shake the hurt
 
Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland
Sounds fly through the night; I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
""Boogie wonderland, wonderland""

Dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha, dance, boogie wonderland. Ha, ha
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
",Boogie Wonderland,1997
Curt Patterson,"Sexy mama

Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby

There's nothing to it
Just say you want to do it
Open up your heart
And let the loving start

Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby

Yeah, hold me tight
With all your might
Now, let your loving flow
Real sweet and slow

Oh, woman, take me in your arms
Rock your baby
Woman, take me in your arms

Curt Sheller,"The shadow of your smile
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams
And light the dawn

Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me

Our wistful little star
It was far, too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
And so did I

Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile",The Shadow of Your Smile,2002
Curt Smith,"Dear God
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can

Spinning round
Falling down
World just keeps on turning
Chaos breeds
People's needs
When we should be learning
And I want something more
For you and me to dream on
Oh I've been looking for something to believe
So now it's time for letting go
I've got to let my feelings show
I won't be coming back
I'm calling out around the world, calling out

Calling out around the world
I'm telling everyone I see
Time to take a chance again
And free the dream, the dream in me

Dear God
I'm doing the best I can

Love me now
Show me now
I forgot the feeling
Take me there
Anywhere
Hatred turns to healing
'Cause I want something more
That I can put my faith in
Oh I've been looking for
Something to believe
And now it's time for letting go
I've got to let my feelings show
I won't be coming back
I'm calling out around the world, calling out

Chorus

Dear God
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can
I'm doing the best I can




",Calling Out,1993
Curt Smith,"We've got to tell the government
That freedom is God sent

Where's the inspiration
Living like we do
Can't tell the devils from the angels
Faithless believers all over town
Where's the voice of reason just like the others.
Living underground

Come the revolution
Gonna burn this place down
Come the revolution
Gonna tear his kingdom down
Burn this palace down

Image of corruption
An outline of a life
Is he a devil or an angel
You say you're my brother, you're just another clown
Where's the voice of reason, just like the others
Living underground

Outlines, deadlines, anything for headlines
We get no respect 'cause we're all on the breadline
I know what it's like to be a survivor
You feed on greed when soul is my provider
Come the revolution, the fine decider
See how it feels when you're the the outsidre

Symptoms of survival, emotions underground
But come the revolution
Gonna burn this palace down
Come the revolution
Gonna tear his kingdom down
Come the revolution
You're gonna hear us shout
Put faith in evolution
And solution will be found

If you take away my rights, prepare for the fight
We gotta tell the government that freedom is God sent
Don't need no rifles when we have disciples

A peaceful revolution will bring the solution
So raise your hands-there's hope for this land",Come the Revolution,1993
Curt Smith,"Holding tightly on to something you believe
It's getting harder when we practice to deceive
But you know when right fails

I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold and guide you
Dark is the night that hides the light from your eyes

I will be there to hold and guide you
Come the morning life is keeping you in chains
But don't you be afraid to call out my name
I come to you in the blue rain
Let the tears fall

I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold and guide you
Dark is the night that hides the light from your eyes

I will be there to stand beside you
Now I can see the shadows over you
Thunder rolls but the light breaks through
And there are times in my life
I know love is true
And I need you to know

I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold and guide you
I won't let another night steal the light from your eyes
I will be there
I will be there
I will be there to hold adn guide you
When the dream inside you cries just lift up your eyes
I will be there...",I Will Be There,1993
Curt Smith,"Somewhere, sometime I became a part of you
And then in time, in time it seems like I got to
the heart of you
And inside my mind I could entertain
Almost anything you could throw at me
But does it feel like now one knows your name?

Somewhere, sometime you believe there's a price we pay
For anger in mind, in time it will always come
back your way
And nothing ever changes, no

It feels like no one knows your name
It feels like no one knows your name

Out of the doorway, into the darkness
I walk slowly out of danger
Nothing ever changes
Down in the basemen, I store the memories
Of a childhood spent alone
Nothing ever changes, no

It feels like no one knows your name
It feels like no one knows your name

Sometimes, it feels that I can't get enough of you
It takes a long time to make this work
I know for sure my mind stays bright with you
It takes a long time to make this work
And nothing ever changes, no

It feels like no one knows your name
It feels like nothing ever changed",No One Knows Your Name,1993
Curt Smith,"Here I am I've got to make it through
Another day with confusion all around me
I'm striking out. I've got to find a way
It feels like I'm starting out on my own
If I could find something to believe in
Something new, a love without a reason
It seems like when the lightning strikes
I need you in my life

[Chorus]
I didn't ask for rain
Didn't ask for sun
Didn't ask to be the only lonely one
When you believe in faith
There's no need to be brave
Never on your own
'Cause faith is what it's all about

If I could deal with any situation
Another day of losing and frustration
Then I could say there's one thing that is real
It's something like a love inside
And I need this high to move on with life

[Chorus]

Time after time I can feel a need to believe
I want to feel love, time after time
Time after time I believe in my mind",Rain,1993
Curt Smith,"I was born at the wrong time
A child lost on the skyline
When I felt a need to change
So I looked deep within me
Somehow touched by the real me
Had to find another way

[Chorus]
So take the heart of this man
Heal the pain with your hands
Shelter me from the rain
Help my eyes see again
Free me
Hold me close
And take my soul on board

Shallow waters we drown in
From the deep you are calling
And with your touch I drift away

[Chorus]

With fear and pride I live and die
A silver light in the blue night
You come to me

Take my heart be my guide
Lay your strength by my side
And cover me from the rain
Now my eyes can see again
Free me
Hold me close
Through dark skies you led my spirit home
You took my soul on board",Soul on Board,1993
Curt Smith,"I think I'll fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness it never ceases
Oh I'm still in love with you
And my head keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Oh darlin' darlin' darlin'
Is this the end?
I'm still in love with you

You know some people out there are saying
Time has its way of healing
It can dry all the tears from you eyes
Oh but darlin' they don't tell you about this empty feeling
You know I can't disguise it
After all that we've been through
I try my best but it's no use
Oh I'm gonna keep on loving you
Is this the end?
I'm still in love with you
And now it's all over
Woman I think there's something you should know
Hey maybe 'cause my baby she had a baby by me
She might think it over one more time before she goes
Call on me baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Call on me baby
Help me see it through
I'm still in love with you",Still in Love With You,1993
Curt Smith,"I don't need no one else
I get by by myself
These feelings I will hold inside
I listen to my heart
This world could fall apart
Could it be that I'm afraid to see the light

It used to be easy
Was it all in my mind?

Living like I do, searching for a clue
Looking for the wonder child
One thing I can hide this fear and
Hold on, hold on

I could convince myself
Don't need no one else
No reasons why I act this way
So hard to take sometimes
I've seen the danger signs
Caught up inside a world that no one knows

It used to be easy
Was it all in my mind

Living like I do, searching for a clue
Looking for the wonder child
One thing I can hide this fear and
Hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on
I'm on my own even if I could get near you
So confused I know hat I would walk right by you
Alone for days, even if I hold on
So out of phase, even if I hold on
Even if I hold on

Living like I do, searching for a clue
Looking for the wonder child
One thing I can hide this fear and
Hold on, hold on

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Living like I do, searching for a clue
Looking for the wonder child
One thing I can hide this fear and
Hold on, hold on

To go on, you hold on",Wonder Child,1993
Curt Smith,"To TV screens and complex books
My inner world of reason looks
To try to feel or touch the things you see

With a face and voice so serious
Words so detached in spite of us
You over justify how you feel

And every line makes perfect sense
You've long rehearsed this circumstance
Words don't say enough
Silence is your best defense
Words don't say enough

So many years the time has flown
The ups and downs the world we've grown
Accustomed to
Has given us our share

But I never thought we'd come to this
When face to face we can't exist
There's no use trying to find what's not there

You think you've had the final say
But that was over yesterday
Words don't say enough
Words come cheap so don't explain
Words don't say enough

Speak the language of love
Tell it straight from your heart
Take a chance and open up
Let the message ring clear
You've got nothing to fear
Tell it like it is

Open up your heart and mind
Thoughts and feelings realign
You've got yours and I've got mine

Enough's enough, enough's enough
Enough's enough
So take a chance and open up

Speak the language of love
Tell it straight from your heart
Take a chance and open up
Let the message ring clear
You've got nothing to fear
Tell it like it is

Open up your heart and mind
Thoughts and feelings realign
You've got yours and I've got mine
Word's don't say enough

What is wrong with your life
Take a look down deep inside
Love is going back in time
Words don't say enough

To TV screens and complex books
My inner world of reason looks
With a face and voice o serious
You over justify how you feel",Words,1993
Curt Smith,"Shut down, tangled up in your machinery
No sound, just the faceless press of words and wheels
Surrounds me like molasses on my soles and eaves
Come out, could anyone come out and play?

All I want is an aeroplane
Rubber banded with paper wings
All I want is to steal again
All I want is a wet dream, ice-cream
All I want is vanishing
All I want is God

Pushed down by an undeserving dumb man
No ground, just an empty room of words and steel
Why be down, drowning in the afternoon
Come out, could anyone come out and play?

All I want is an aeroplane
Rubber banded with paper wings
All I want is to steal again
All I want is a wet dream, ice-cream
All I want is vanishing
All I want is God

Come out, could anyone come out and play?

All I want is an aeroplane
Rubber banded with paper wings
All I want is to steal again
All I want is a wet dream, ice-cream
All I want is vanishing

All I want is an afterglow
A forty-five on my gramophone
All I want is a thick skin to crawl into
Everything's vanishing
All I want is God
",Aeroplane,2000
Curt Smith,"How can I be sure
When your intrusion is my illusion?
How can I be sure
When all the time you changed my mind?
I asked for more and more
How can I be sure?

When you don't give me love
You gave me pale shelter
You don't give me love
You give me cold hands

And I can't operate
On this failure
When all I want to be is
Completely in command

How can I be sure
For all you say you keep me waiting?
How can I be sure
When all you do is see me through?
I asked for more and more
How can I be sure?

I've been here before
There is no why, no need to try
I thought you had it all
I'm calling you, I'm calling you
I ask for more and more
How can I be sure?
",Pale Shelter,2000
Curt Smith,"My sutured mind post-op'd and dry
Keeps slowly does it time
Impaled by trust shot up with your
Four in the morning eyes

Where do I go
Where do I go

Where do I go
Where do I go

She's drifting round my barren ground
Breaks slowly cold or crazed
These dust dead eyes are focused far
Behind these summer days

Where do I go
Where do I go

Where do I go
Where do I go

And will I come of age make your day
Be precious and contrived
Or will I blow you all away",Where Do I Go,2000

Curt Smith,"Never mind the starting gun, cover's up, the curtain's drawn
Standing in the outline
Pin the medal to the floor, the hero to the open door
Skin is only outside

Don't cut me down, don't bring me round, don't break my fall
I'm coming out today
Don't take me back, don't change at all
I'm coming out today

Cut into decision day, we move ahead in different ways
Standing in the outline
We move the arrow to the cross, the building to the butcher block
Skin is only outside, I don't mind

Don't cut me down, don't bring me round, don't break my fall
I'm coming out today
Don't take me back, don't change at all
I'm coming out today

Everybody's gone again, falling out and falling into
His father's on his knees again reaching out for reason and truth

Don't cut me down, don't bring me round, don't break my fall

Don't take me back, don't change at all
I'm coming out today

Curt Smith,"Keeps a careful house
In his carefree heart filled minefield
Keeps a careful tongue
In his care filled headstrong
I feel like I'm backing down
I'm riding shotgun into

The greatest divide
The hardest act to follow
With nowhere to hide
She's cutting me down the middle

Try to make it stop
Try to break it into pieces
Try to shake it off
I'm broken in completely
I'm taken down
I'm riding shotgun into

The greatest divide
The hardest act to follow
With nowhere to hide
She's cutting me down the middle

I'm bruised and torn
You're tied and cleaned

You're still and cool
Below the fray
I'm stemmed and mapped
You're cut away

How will we raise or fall or will we try?
I'm halfway pleased to meet you
I'm halfway pleased to meet you

You're shrunk and left
I'm staid and grown
You're boxed and down

Looks down his crown on the bed

That you hold in your hands dear

This is the perfect day to blow myself away
This is the perfect time
This is the perfect way and everyone will say
Hey, it's a perfect day

Sunday king's out for a drive
I'm taking leaves from the fire
As the gold in his eyes screams

Forecast is lookout below
Slow dances crashes and God only knows
Where he goes to

Got to tell myself it's alright
Everything that I envied

Buried in the afternoon
Breathless and snowbound

Safe as the ocean
Shine like a motor car
Seven of Sundays
Of course you are

Coming down
Ice cream and a towel wrapped around
Flowing hair that swallows me
Follows me down

It's okay
Twisted sheets and endless rainy days
Channels flash across your face
Silence surrounds you

Safe as the ocean
Shine like a motor car

You're more than expected
Cool and confused
You're so easy and hectic

Tender and done for dazed and strong
I'm fine until you're gone
Against the wall you're holding onto
All that and more night and day
All that and more night and day

You're downward, you're smiling
The old man is crying
You're way too removed to
You're eager and flying

Tender and done for dazed and strong
You're fine until I'm gone
Against the wall I'm holding onto
You're all that and more night and day

All that and more night and day
All that and more night and day
All that and more night and day

Curtis Amy,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Or if I were a season,
I'd surely be Spring,

Curtis Amy,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before

Curtis Amy,"I look at you and suddenly
Something in your eyes I see
Soon begins bewitching me
It's that old devil moon
That you stole from the skies

Too hot to handle
Stars in the night
Blazing their light
Can't hold a candle
To your razzle-dazzle

You've got me flyin' high and wide
On a magic carpet ride
Full of butterflies inside
Wanna cry, wanna croon
Wanna laugh like a loon

I'm free as a dove

Deep in your eyes
Blinds me with love",Old Devil Moon,1967

I thought what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him anyway
But he found out and someone else gave him her hand to hold
And suddenly I find myself out in the cold

He trusted me all the time
I thought I could see another man and he would still be mine
Well yesterday I had a good thing worth more than gold
Today he's got a truer love and I'm out in the cold

I had a love warmer than fire
But I listened to my desire
Now yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's heart aches
I'm payin' for my mistakes
Now girl, take a tip from one who knows
If you open up a new door, you may find the old one's closed

So be true to your good man 
Take a lesson from the story I have told
Or you just might get-a left now out in the cold
You just might get-a left now out in the cold

And I'm without you once again.
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,
I wonder if you need me now.
We played the grams that people play, we made mistakes along the way.
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,
But then most of all, I do love you 
Still.
 
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,
Those feelings we can't put aside.
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand, 
But it's so heavy on my mind.
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.
But then most of all, I do love you
Still.

Hearts have healed and hearts have broken in the pain of yesterday
Gone are the shadows and vanished in the night
Let your heart surrender, let your soul take flight

And let bygones be bygones and troubles be long gone
And if I never told you how I feel about you, I'm telling you now

We gather here together, all of our friends
In a room full of love and laughter, the healing begins
And if this was my last moment, my last breath
I'd wanna be surrounded with joy and happiness

And some thrills I can't define.

Finding another world.

Here I slide again, about to take that ride again.
Starry-eyed again, takin' a chance on love.

I thought that cards were a frame-up, I never would try.
Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.
And brother rabbit of course you better kiss your, foot good-bye.
On that ball again I'm ridin' for a fall again.
I'm gonna give my all again takin' a chance on love.",Taking a Chance on Love,1962

Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms 
Our lips meeting soft and tender 
Love's all aglow 
Why shouldn't we surrender 
When lights are low

Like the ocean beats upon the sand

Seeing visions of a new bright horizon
Set the morning light

Curtis King,"Deep down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringin' a bell

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
Oh! The engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
People passing by they would stop and say
Oh, my but that little country boy can play

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, Johnny, go
Go, Johnny B. Goode

His mama told him, some day you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big old band
Many people comin' from miles around
To hear you play your music 'till the sun go down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' Johnny B. Goode tonight

Go, go, go, Johnny, go
Go, go, go, Johnny, go

I saw a girl almost as dope as me, she caught my eye
But before I could walk over to this girl and say a thing
I was interrupted by this nerd Curtiss King

OK excuse me pretty lady, don't want to come at you crazy
But if he gave you his number, I think you need to erase it
Oh no, I'm not a hater like that man is not a shaver
But look at his Instagram, he wearin' Adventure Time leggings

Now if Curtiss was a jedi, his lightsaber would be clear
That means nonexistent like his fuckin' rap career
Look his breath got your face melted, please make your choice
Do you want a Blake Shelton or a reject from a Royce?

Hold up, listen to his language, ain't he so damn offensive?
When I look inside your eyes, I see the loyalist missus
Do you really need a man to give you fourth and some inches?

This nigga got a Scion but me, I got a Kia
How he gotta charge his car before we even come to see ya?

Why you yellin', hot yellow ass nigga, baby, please
Ain't you tired of these flakey emo Drake wannabees?
You piss coloured dish scrubbers, still livin' with your mother
How you got the nerve to diss a real motherfucker?

Hold up, girl, I'm so cold I freeze a burn in a sauna
And Murs so old, he got a Walkman in his pocket
He probably even went to kindergarten with your mamas
Sweet Lord, I mean for real, is he even worth the problem?

Cool story, bro but let's state facts
Curtiss, you so light skinned, you probably hate blacks

Curtis Knight & The Squires,"The morning is dead
And the day is, too
There's nothing left here to meet me
But the velvet moon
All my loneliness I have felt today
It's like a little more than enough
To make a man throw himself away

And I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Alone

Now the smiling portrait of you
Is still hangin' on my frowning wall
It really doesn't, really doesn't bother me too much at all
It's just the ever falling dust
That makes it so hard for me to see
That forgotten earring layin' on the floor
Facing coldly towards the door

I continue
To burn the midnight lamp
Lord, alone

Loneliness is such a drag

So here I sit to face
That same old fire place
Gettin' ready for the same old explosion
Goin' through my mind
And soon enough time will tell,
About the circus in the wishing well
And someone who will buy and sell for me
Someone to toll my bell

And I continue
To burn this old lamp
Lord, alone
Darlin' can't ya hear me callin' you?
So lonely
Gonna have to blow my mind

That you were meant for me

Around the campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
With hair as dark as night
Her eyes were like that of a cat in the dark
That hypnotized me with love

She was a gypsy woman,
She was a gypsy woman

She danced around and round to a guitar melody
From the fire her face was all aglow
How she enchanted me
Oh, how I'd like to hold her near
And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

I love you, gypsy woman
I love you, gypsy woman

All through the caravan
She was dancing with all the men
Waiting for the rising sun

Curtis Mayfield,"Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood

Get down, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Get down, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

We're all children of the world
A hungry man in search for a hungry girl
It's strange, so plain we're all cannibal
The most wasted and two faced of all animals

Get down, get down
Get down, get down

Take my soul, baby
When you reel I can feel so much desire
Take my soul, baby
Life unfolds from my soul when you start a fire

So get down, just get down

Get down, baby
As the rhythm should follow through your able soul
Get down, baby
Play the part like a pro in a perfect role

Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood

One can never point out the actual path
Of the mysterious need in a female's heart
Man can only follow not knowing how
His faith might erupt [Incomprehensible]

So get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down

Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural move

Take my soul, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Take my soul, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down

Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down

Curtis Mayfield,"Everybody gather round and listen to my song
I've only got one

We who are young, should now take a stand
Don't run from the burdens of women and men
Continue to give, continue to live
For what you know is right

Most of your life can be out of sight
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light
Where everyone's free
At least that's the way it's supposed to be

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Before we dismiss, one thing I insist
When you have your young, remember this song
And our world surroundings, its leaps and bounds
Ups and downs, is reality

Teach them to be strong, and when they are grown
They can proudly imply that we were an alright guy
For all the wrong now is right
This nation's people are now united as one

And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Keep on keeping on, y'all
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keeping on
(Keep on, keeping on)

We got to move on up, y'all
(We got to move on up)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

Some years back I remember
Still in my mind so well
My mama made this ?
And I found it never fails

Never worry too long
(Worry too long)
About what goes on
(About what goes on)
Today it's sorrow
(Today it's sorrow)
Look like joy tomorrow
(Look like joy tomorrow)

Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Keep on, keep on
(Keep on, keep on)

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

We're gonna move on up
(We're gonna move on up)

Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Move on, move now

Curtis Mayfield,"Familiar music, familiar sound
Does mute your thoughts for the underground
Lonely sight for any turning light
Future prophesy for the [Incomprehensible]

There'll be equal stay and equal play
The underground where none can betray

The underground

They'll all turn black so who's to know
As a matter of fact, color, creed and breed must go
There'll be no light, so there can be no sight
And you'll judge your fellow men on the stand
By what is right

Curtis Mayfield,"Eddie, you should know better
Brother, you know you're wrong
Think of the tears and fears
You bring to your folks back home
They'd say, where did he go wrong, my Lord?

We planned and worked hard from the very start
Tried to make him better than all the rest
But the brother proved to be so much less

Eddie is everybody's friend
But sometimes you wonder now and then
The only time he'll choose you

When there's something to lose through
His personal loss
And the friend pays the cost all the time

Must be something that's freezin' his mind
That has made him, through greed so very blind
And I don't think he's gonna make it this time",Eddie You Should Know Better,1972

Ghetto child
Thinkin' he's been had

In the back of his mind he's sayin'

Curtis Mayfield,"I've met many people over the years
And in my opinion I have found that
People are the same everywhere
They have the same fears
Shed similar tears
Die in so many years

Now our lives are in the hands of The Pusherman
We break it all down

How The Man take your money
He's shrewd as he can be
In such a way you'll never see
It's a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
The weaker turn to dope
And put all aside their hope

Your conscience is only teased

Curtis Mayfield,"If you had a choice of colors
Which one would you choose, my brothers
If there was no day or night
Which would you prefer to be right

How long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Do you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks, not of kin

People must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation, would make a better society

Now some of us would rather cuss and make a fuss
Than to bring about a little trust
But we shall overcome our beliefs someday
If you'll only listen to what I have to say

And how long have you hated your white teacher
Who told you, you love your black preacher
Can you respect your brother's woman friend
And share with black folks, not of kin

I said, now people must prove to the people
A better day is coming for you and for me
With just a little bit more education
And love for our nation, would make a better society

Though I vow never to hurt her in the past
Will she be there waiting for me?

That's all we ask in our country dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear

We as the young wish to say in this song
God bless great America
We give thanks to the old for acheiving their goal
It is now up to us and we know we must build up a trust

And we want the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country dear
The sick and the hungry are unable
Protect them and those who may live in fear

Power for the people

Hardening crimes is a part of the times nd it's rough for some people to live
Disease can move fast but it don't have to last
It is now the nation's turn for all to be concerned
We can be freer still, it is the people's will

And bring back the power for the people
That's all we ask in our country dear

Protect them and those who may live in fear

Tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill

And if you think your going to fall
All you have to do is call

And I give my self to you

Keep the fire burning everyday
Save all the warmth for you

Understand there will be no other man

Picking up passengers coast to coast 
Faith is the key, open the doors and board them

There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner whom would hurt all mankind 
Just to save his own 
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner 
For there is no hiding place against the kingdoms throne

Girl, I'd rather die
Than see you with somebody else

Hey, don't you understand 
What you're doing to the man

And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool
And I know their intentions have all been good
Some of them would help me if they could
But I'll never give you up 
Never, never, never, never let you go

Curtis Mayfield,"I remember, my first love affair
Somehow or another the whole darn thing went wrong
My mama had some great advice
So I thought I'd put it into words of this song
I can still hear her saying it

Boy, oh, I see you're sitting out there all alone
Cryin' your eyes out
'Cause the woman that you love has gone
There's gonna be, there's gonna be
A whole lot of trouble in your life
So listen to me get up off of your knees
'Cause only the strong survive

That's what she said
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
You've got to be strong, you'd better hold on
Don't go, all around with your head hung down

I wouldn't let that little girl
No, I wouldn't let her know
That she made me feel like a clown
There's a whole lot a girl
Lookin' for a good man like you
Oh, but you'll never meet them if you give up now
And say, your life is through

Then she said it
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
You've got to be a man, you've got to take a stand

So I am telling you right now
Only the strong survive, only the strong survive
You've got to be strong, you'd better hold on

Oh you say you're tired & you're uninspired

The last time you felt that way 
Girl, you left me for a whole day 
Then you called me on the telephone (hey baby) 
In your sweet & your softest tone (hey baby) 
Askin' me ""What should we do?"" 
When you know all the time that I'm crazy about you

We had the same conversation 
Well it couldn't have been more than a week ago 
I said ""Darlin', you're breakin' my heart

Walked on down to the corner store (hey baby) 
& by the time what I said took in 
I turned right around & came back again

And kiss and forever whisper in her ear

So you say you've tried but just can't find the measure

Try to resist, all the bad things all around you

So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
I know we can, I know we can, I know we can, I know we can
Ah, get away, let's leave today, let's get away!
What ya, what ya, what ya, what ya know?
Watch all the stars, they lead in the right direction
Not to heed them is a bad reflection
They'll show you the way to what you have been seeking
To ignore them you're only cheating
 
So come, take me by the hand, we'll leave this troubled land
Why don't you get away? Get away
Lay awake at night till the sun comes up in the morning
Never excited; it all seems boring
Make up your mind which way to go about it
Choose your road, just don't doubt it

But I'll never get used to living without you

Without you the sun still rises, without you the rivers run

I accept the notion that there's things you can't control
The changing of the seasons or the fact we're growing old
And I know I'm the reason that you had to go away
But I will keep believing that's the price I have to pay

Curtis Stigers,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love

One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

Was born in a small town (?), California
Where them gangstas bang ghetto life thuggin on the corner
Youngest child of six
When I came pops split with momma
Used to visit on the weekends
Till he moved to the north side of Cali
14 he died, 15 my moms died
Alcoholic diabetic forces were my life too
Moved with my older brother taught me discipline
But I wasn't ready though still shocked and holding pain in
So I skipped school got F's got the posters on my wall
takin down no TV times I felt like ya'll ain't want me around
Set up in my room developing the mind of a loner
Writin rhymes rappin out my days instead of homework
Through it all my three sisters placed the place like one time
As I was like this rap thing is gonna pay I know that I was triflin
But still set in my ways livin for better days
Until I die I'm startin if I'm broke or with that cheddar check

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

purest purest
purest purest
purest purest purest purest!

Love

The two realest cats I know? My two older brothers
The most beautiful woman in the galaxy? My mother
The strongest black women raising kids alone? My sisters
The best part of my future is my present love interest
The most important time? Right now and ever after
The greatest expression is love, happiness, and laughter
See life is a book and this song is just another chapter
I'll stay down to earth and real if you speak I'll speak back
I'm not a preacher or a scholar I'm merely just a rapper
I probably don't fit in to the current state of -
- what you consider that to be So you ask how can I rap
if I ain't thugged out, pimpin, flossin my ice, packin a gat
Man if this is what I got, I want dough I can't lie
But never sell my soul 'n front inside mainstream's eyes
The purest love is how I'm driven, sent, and reach for my goals
If nothing else I'll leave the world some songs that speak from the soul

One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing

I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick

And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid

Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing

Spit fire, make you first to bit, try me
Like Osama, odoma', I'ma cause trauma
And homicides when I collide I get kamikaze

Kane baby, walk hard, the p-jects
On streets of Brooklyn I'm a crew of d-cepts
On streets of l.a. I'm a whole e-set
On tracks with Jurassic I be the T-Rex

Cause man to compress a nigga mean one less a nigga (uh-huh)

All I want is my liver all polluted with remi
Duel with any, bring it, I face-off
Son you out your league like Jordan was with baseball

Yeahhh, your majesty, word flash photography
Third class economy, blade slashed your artery
Nerve gassed anatomy, blurred past dramatically
Herbs hashed, my word splash packed agility
Never predictability
Maneuvers of mind fully designed cause I'm true to the rhyme
We do the sublime, crackin' yo' backbone
Attackin' you wack clones
Vernacular right and exact, capital rap zone

We fight like Stokely Carmichael
Nope! we just like you
We broke and ain't no tellin' what we might do
Ain't no joke
Provoke the right to reverse to seek mercy
With the king Asiatic and Percy P
Ain't heard the worst of me, until your chest 3-d
Spit venom and burn your body like a std

Put a twenty on the next brother steppin' to me wrong
I mess around a lick cause you done cheat on my theme song
This might seem wrong, but this is a mean song
Crushed like king-kong, and just like ping-pong
Back and forth, I spit knowl' and toss, it's time to floss
My verbal affirmation is to always go off
When syllables slide you'll be enjoyin' the vibe
When consider it pride, it's J5
When another deadly medley, camera action yo we heavy
Aim steady slash machette Maserati engine ready
Good and plenty don't be petty count the fetti and we jetti
Off to another city where we do our nitty grity

Yo, this is a lesson in friendship
The depths of a kinship
What women and men begin with, and then slip
My pen drips
As I scribble my thoughts on thin strips
Of emotion
A fraction, seduction, attraction
Eruption of passion
Corrupts if a lasted friendship's involved
But love to cross the line
But that's why we built these walls

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado]
We been friends for a long time, a very close friend of mine
Love you like you was mine, but respect a thin line
I love you like you was mine, think about you all the time
Very close friend of mine, but respect a thin line

[Akil]
Opposite's attract
When the female and male come in contact
Sticky situation in fact
Trying not to let the feelings catch
But there's a thin line between both of y'all
So you respect that
And entertain the idea, but get brought back
To reality, and could you really live with that?
Decision, based on intuition
You love and keep your distance
Hug and kiss in friendship

[Marc 7]
An ongoing kinship, we was people to begin with
Disrespect was not intended
But your feelings sparked the sentence
Sometimes you're too intense in your quest to invent
The perfect man, please understand, my rhyme is your repent

[Chorus: x2]

[Soup]
Man, too bad that we became friends first
I'm not on expert on how relationships should work
But, (echos) from the minute it as known
It changed the whole tone on how we spoke on the phone
Yo, it was cool but I felt it wasn't enough
And I was stuck when your moms would pick it up
Over you, all my buddies would swoon
But I felt we were in tune, you let me up in your room. (Damn)
But to me girl, you're still off limits
No matter all the times that I hinted (Yo, what you doing after this?)
Infatuation was authentic, but yo I just pretended
So I wouldn't lose the friendship
Maybe, I should spill all my guts
Or write a letter, then tear it up
Or do a song, just to say what's up
I want, just, a touch

[Chorus: x2]

[Nelly Furtado]
I can't do this anymore
See my heart just spills out when you walk in the door
Friendship turns into lust and this only tip
That I can't comprehend even if I knew it
Can't do justice to these things that I'm feeling
You got someone else, don't want to be caught stealing
Hell if she knew she would never leave us alone
In the room

This was a lesson in friendship
I stress in this sentence
Should women and men be friends first?
And then slip?

Opposites attract
And best friends make a perfect match
If you only knew that
Once you cross, ain't no turning back
The minute you let him in it and he hit that
That's that

So primitive, ? a figurative

And lately Ive been havin' visions of infinity
I'm the horizon, apple prizin' when my tales be survivin'

So much pressure in their cell 'till their dome blew up

Avec les étudiants qui brodent des ""Peace and Love"" sur le futal
Pour que cesse la guerre du Vietnam

Depuis les idéaux sont morts, fosse commune
Aux antipodes de la pleinitude
Comment ralier le peuple, si on incendie ses véhicules

Any rainbow I'll save for you

One more to tie to the whipping post
Papers that peddle the holy ghost
Once more the victim of circumstance pays

if paper plates serve the final feast
Sharpen your knives for a front page piece
Sitting safe in the front row seats

you make a big noise
Big fire
Big noise
You and the big boys are playin' with fire
Big noise

you'd take me down to a peeping show
Frame me in photos in old soho
Now who's gonna give me a second chance?

you make a big noise
Big fire

You and the big boys are playin' with fire
Big noise

Straight from the heart

Like a blind man takes pictures
We pretended we could see
But it took all of our money
And it took you and me

there's a space in between us
But it's not inside my head
You can feel it all around you
Welcome to the wedge

'cause it's black and it's white
But invisible
So don't sign your name
It'll take all your trust if you let it
But never the blame

feel the wedge
You can look in its face but you can't see its eyes

from a dark and vicious circle
We were trying to break out
So sick and tired of second guessing
Dancing to the steps of doubt
The changes were blowing
Do you remember the hurricane?
But when big john took his final swin
We knew that nothing stayed the same

with a whambamagram it started
The saddest of days
Don't dare to ask was it worth it
I'm too broke to say

feel the wedge...
I could take all the bullshit but never the lies

over turns to under
Truth becomes a maybe
Six and five will still be ten
I'ts black and white and
It's not here tonight
It could be my friend

But you can't see it's eyes

To see you cry

Help me father, help me father

Cutting Crew,"I'm rockin' tonite - I'm walkin' on air
Gonna find me some trouble - gonna grab my share
I want ya tonite - I want ya with me
Make me guilty of love in the first degree

You want it all right... we're goin' in style
Say you walk right - you talk right - and your hair's so wild
Snow-white - hey that's not what I mean
We go down in the shadows and crawl between

Moonlight in the city brings the magic to your eyes
Freezin' a moment - leave me paralyzed
Breathe an emotion - set it dancin' in my ear
Bring on the rhythm when I hold you near

Take me in your arms - roll me through the night
Take me to your heart - rock me tonite

You do it all right - you're passion to see
You been schooled in the art of romancin' me
Hold tight - you're in for a ride
Can you feel the blood poundin' way down inside

No one's stoppin' us now -
We go down, down where the music's loud
If it's all night - hey that's all right by me
Go and play on my love - play it all for me

Life's never easy - we can make it if we try
Takin' our chances - face 'em side by side
Live for the moment - on that we can agree
Come and take me where I long to be

Chorus

A time for all... and all in time
To slip beyond the border line
Of who we are and where we long to be...
When every night you hear the sound
Of wakin' up and breakin' down
You find a chance and heave it all away

The scattering
(All the children say)
Will come again
(It's taken them away)
No seeds to fall
(All the children say)
No sons to blame
As one by one they left home

Tired old men
Spin tales of when
A man could work
And hold his head up high
Ghosts roam this town
With pockets full of rye they'd all fall down
But soon their jars all ran dry

[Chorus]

The scattering
(All the children say)
Has come again
(It's taken them away)
No seeds to fall
(All the children say)
Like better days

But if skies could fall
(All the children say)

Then one by one,
They'll come home",The Scattering [Edited Version][Edit],2004
Cutting Crew,"Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

I keep looking for something I can´t get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don´t see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits on the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would´ve thought that a boy like me could come to this

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must´ve been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must´ve been some kind of kiss
I should´ve walked away

Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface I´m a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I´ve lost and found, it´s my final mistake
She´s loving by proxy, no give and all take
´Cos I´ve been thrilled to fantasy one too many times

Oh I, I just died in your arms...
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it´s over the moment has gone

Cutty Cartel,"Uh, I keep it playa while some choose to play it safe
Boy check the resume, it's risky business in the A
And I've been a witness to this history
Ever since the the tenth grade
We went from rockin' braids to temp fades
I twist my A hat to the side just for style
Or throw on the Gucci bucket with the flowers superfly
Wow, the southern pride been known to shut it down
But it ain't so country my nigga this ain't no Gomer Pyle
I'm Sergeant Slaughter
I keep my shit cooked to order in order
To satisfy my people in Georgia and across the water
And across the boarder the essays are getting smarter.
They got flour for tortillas and lettuce for enchiladas.
If you follow wink wink no doubt we don't speak.
In a blink them folks could have you sleeping in the clink.
I'm shittin' on niggas and pee'ing on the seat.
It's the nigga the B-i-g B-o-i out

And throw the deuce up in the sky just for the shutterbugs.
I'm double fistin' and if you're empty you can grab a cup.

Let me dap you up.
Baby, baby you're in my system.
Baby, baby tell me your listening.

Boy, it's after twelve, club's like a hive bee,
A bee hive cause not everybody buzzin' around me.
Could it be the way the verse is sounding?
Came up on the Gheto Boys and the Underground Kingz.
Toys, I had a brougham, called it pretty brown thing.
Paint look like root beer when the sun was shining.
Known to keep a bad bitch. No niggas beside me.
Index finger on the trigger in case niggas is clowning.
Not to flex but to protect my neck like the Wu-Tang.
Self-preservation is the rule when you do aim.
Or get in something more sinister.
You gotta be the finisher
To make it sure the doctors, they can't replenish him.
Or bring him back to life.
Back to reality.
Gone get on some hoes leave it alone.
Triple O-G status A town's very own.

Bendin' 'round corners in the 'lac.
Cut a rug, playa, now cut a rug.
And throw yo' deuce up in the sky for the shutterbug.

What you want? You make me wanna breed.

Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon

Let's love, baby

With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we've got to be here
Let's live
I love you

There's nothing wrong with me
Loving you, baby no no
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong
If the love is true

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me
I ain't gonna worry
I ain't gonna push, won't push you baby
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby

it's only there trying to fool the public
but when it comes down to fooling you 
now honey that's quite a diff'rent subject
Don't let my glad expression 
give you the wrong impression really I'm sad
Oh, sadder than sad, you're gone and I'm hurting so bad
like a clown I pretend to be glad
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah, baby,
 
Now if I appear to be carefree, 
it's only to camouflage my sadness
in order to shield my pride 
I try to cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But Don't let my show convince you 
that I've been happy since you decided to go,
I need you so, I'm hurt and I want you to know
but for others I put on a show
 
Now there's some sad things known to man 
but ain't too much sadder than
the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around
 
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
smiling in the public eye
but in my lonely room I cry 
the tears of a clown
Oh, yeah baby
 
Now, if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you a wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear

Cuz Lightyear,"Early morning riser reefer chiefer
You paid the most but me, I get it cheaper
Strong rapper reefer, wrap it in a big Cohiba
I get so high I close my eyes and swore that I saw Jesus
I take another toke and God damn I feel comatose
I double cup and that's what up and then I'm leaning fool
I'm talking any given Sunday, Willie Beamen ho
My bitch say that I get too high it might kill my brain
I tell her that she talk too much and she should give some brain
We used to fuck a lot but now you just fuss and complain
What a fuckin' shame, hit the door and hit the block
Avoid the walking dead, the zombies still hunt and rob
My days of wasting time, slanging dimes is way behind
I'm still tryna be a mover with a Mason's mind
I will get a mil, ain't nobody taking mine
You sorry suckers, see you saps at the finish line
You know I steady grind

I stay higher than Messiah, I ain't never grinding
You see them Jewel runners coming, boy we body body
We bout that LPP we diggin' other people's pockets
Keep it cool, Run the Jewels, ain't no other way around it
I want the rings and the chains, Run the Jewels
I want the watches and the bracelets, Run the Jewels
We at the table eating everybody food
Invasion of the chains, snatchers better not bust a move

I’m a dummy I’m running with more than fucking scissors
I’m the Cadillac, of fuck you back open you bitches
You the Cadillac of “Fuck, I just suck at this rap shit""
I’m the Cadillac of ""Suck it, I’m fucking disastrous""
We the Hardy and Thom of the plant a bomb game
The lead em all to the mall and set ‘em off game
You wanna hang like Hussain
Eat a mile of my shit, then put your lips to my true brain
And get the hashtag fartnoise
I used to give a half-fuck, now I just laugh
I barely blink when it gets bad, maybe I’m class
I pull the ducts out my eyes, I don’t cry, I just can't
Killer Mike brought the fire pack
Light it off the sinners of the city where the riots at
The living fuck boy eraser
Carve initials in the wet cement right where you died at

I stay higher than Messiah, I ain't never grinding
You see them Jewel runners coming, boy we body body
We bout that LPP we diggin' other people's pockets
Keep it cool, Run the Jewels, ain't no other way around it
I want the rings and the chains, Run the Jewels
I want the watches and the bracelets, Run the Jewels
We at the table eating everybody food
Invasion of the chains, snatchers better not bust a move

Who wanna run a summer with the jewel runners?
Got your girlfriend hotter than two saunas
Everybody tough 'til they see them tools on 'em
Then they do a number two in they True Religions
""Lord please don't shoot!"", they get too religious
Truth is we go vicious on these stool pigeons
Pistol pointed at they misses like I killed these bitches
We Run the Jewels and when we talking pimpin', pay attention

Run the Jewels we a bit odd
We bad news, you barely get a fat chance to slim odds
You barely get a short plank for long walks, taught like a sawed-off
No laws when I taught, nah
And I'm Kalashnikov spitting
We always take the time to smell the rose when it wither
I'd say better luck tomorrow
