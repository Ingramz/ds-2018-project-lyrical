"Elliott, Eugenia","Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?",Skylark,1999
"Elliott, Eugenia","Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1999
"Elliott, Eugenia","It seems we stood and talked like this before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again

And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when",Where or When,1999
Elliphant,"Appreciate it
Touch me like you know what you do and what you don't
But I'm feeling jaded
Know your own love, I don't fuck with no glove
So why complicate it?
Let me be your guide when you eat my pussy out
'Cause I've had one or two, even a few
Yeah, more than you

It's Charli, baby
All the girls stare at me, drop lip
Dripping in harmony, like Fifth
Lay 'em down, feel 'em up
And they slide away, so easy
So easy, so easy, like, yeah

Bitches, I don't trust 'em
But they give me what I want for the night
Bitches, I don't trust 'em
But I tell 'em and they do what I like, why
Bitches, I don't trust 'em
But they give me what I want for the night
Bitches, I don't trust 'em
But I tell 'em and they do what I like, why

They can't fake it (no, no, no)
Drying off the seat when they getting up to leave (so wet)
So they getting noticed
I'm better if they blunt, I don't really wanna hunt
So why complicate it?
I call it respect when you givin' what you get
So, baby, spread your legs, I'll do the same, already cumming

But they give me what I want for the night
Bitches, I don't trust 'em
But I tell 'em and they do what I like, why

B is for balance, I for intelligence
T stands for tough, trouble, truly terrific
C for courage, H, bitch, holy
Rise high, pollinate, Aphrodite, right
Turn my touches into neon light
Chat it up, now, doggy, come suck my A titties
I'm a free-headed goddess from the full moon land
Venus hit the bong, gon' sing it straight
We tough it out, we stand strong in the storm
We don't back down, we don't take shit no more
We don't back down, now we ahead of the game
It's a new day of bitches that no man can tame, yeah

Bitches, I don't trust 'em

Elliphant,"We are waking up in a pile of shit
The whole bay is full of it
And it keeps growing out of our ears
But we keep swimming in this wide oceans of salty tears

I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight
I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

Down the central of your sensual sense
Freak more freaks now while I got the chance
But keeps on cool dubs, don’t waste the odds
The day is soon to come when you’re gone
Need it all
I say

I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life
I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

I need you to take all my shadows for a walk tonight

Like leaves
That days are falling not tell me why
The breeze will carry for a while but it will fall to the ground
Please stay, life is a calling
Life not a waiting life is running away
But long after you’re gone, your question would still be answered
If you’re here, now you’ll be a god forever

I could use a break, me need to go down, down, down, down on life

Elliphant,"We flying in space, one zero make a thousand numbers
Leaving no trace, my hair a billion wonders
Now I'm riding away, the moon penetrate me
Whisper sweet, in my ears, words made of reasons

Sown in the sand, smelt like the first kiss
A touch with no hands

I'm living life golden, got no need for gold
Got a wicked time comin', man these stories untold
I'm living life golden, never getting old
While my pocket's stay empty, my heart is full

It's perfect for me, but looking like a wrong direction
Now make up your mind, if you win or lose in rough affection
The summer's stay young, fresh like a frozen flower
Slowly I wake, crack my brow, see the dirt break

Sown in the sand, smelt like the first kiss
A touch with no hands

I'm living life golden, got no need for gold
Got a wicked time comin', man these stories untold
I'm living life golden, never getting old
While my pocket's stay empty, my heart is full

And I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true
But what else can you do 
At the end of a love affair

So I talk a little too much
And I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud
When I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care
That it's only 
That I'm lonely
And low as can be
And the smile on my face
Isn't really a smile at all

So I smoke a little too much
And I drink a little too much

Sweetheart, my love is still untold
A kiss that is never tasted
Forever and ever is wasted

For all we know, we may never meet again
Before you go, make this moment sweet again
We won't say, goodnight until the last minute

While heaven's giving us the break

Don't break the spell like this

You would laugh to beat the band

I can't win

More than glad to be unhappy

Unrequited love's a bore

I've forgotten you just like I should
Of course, I have
Except to hear your name
Or someone's laugh that is the same

What a fool am I

Could kid the moon
What's in store
Should I fall once more

To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known

Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

It's easy to remember
But so hard to forget

To have your hand caress me
Fingers, press me tight
I'd rather dream
Than have that lonely feeling

Is clear before me
And though it brings me regret

Ellis,"You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Ellis Larkins,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little moon starts to climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wandered down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by

Sometimes I wonder why I spend
A lonely night dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
Now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Beside a garden wall
When stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairy tale
Of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

Now the life of the local beauty queen is 
Tied to the captain of the baseball team 
They got a baby on the way at least that's 
What the kids are saying and the wedding 
I'm told, well it must take place
To save both families from disgrace 
But the whole town knows you see, it ain't like she's not showing 

There is nothing to do in this town at night 
But sit in my car and watch the streetlights
Or stare out the window at the pizza joint 
What's the point? I wish I could buy my ford a sail

For his girl down at lucky's diner 
They're at the end of the loop and he's drinking soup

Even the clerk is checking her out 
She's unaware that she owns the scene 
Though everyone goes out of their way for her 

And all her life reads like some fairy tale

Height of the backside swing
Arms reaching beckoning me

But I am the thin man
All skin and bones
Am I qualified for the job?

Scarecrow where all the birds are thieves

I'm from Eau Claire, Wisconsin
I've been living out of a 
suitcase now for fourteen days

I caught a Vegas show that was no good 
Met a dancer there that starred in a broadway play
But it's a lonely world from this Greyhound
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days
Three thousand miles
I've been here fourteen days
Three thousand miles

Now twenty-one is as good a guess as any age that I'd confess to
Let's just say I'm old enough to get away
Back in school, I found the only written truth 
On bathroom stalls and telephone booths
I studied awhile, but college got in my way
I've learned much more from the back of this Greyhound
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days

Three thousand miles
I've come a long, long way
Three thousand miles

Have you seen? 
The world outside is turning 
And it's yours 
we were put here for the learning
People talk to themselves on Greyhounds
Even the driver strains to hear 
They tell the same forgotten story 
Will it fall on forgetful ears?

Down in Houston on comes this woman 
With two kids and a bottle of booze
And she cracked them both like match heads 
Whenever they ventured too close to her fuse
And I sat with a girl from Boston
Playing cards for cigarettes
I lost her name with the poker game
But her name I will never forget

You never forget the view from these windows
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days

A card carrying member of the NRA,

But he left me out in his car one day,
And now the finger on my trigger hasn't seen it's sixteenth birthday. 
Some things they never tell you when you're riding the assembly line. 
Like who'll be the hands to hold you and what's their state of mind 
Hey, I'm not much bigger than a pointed index finger. 
So who am I to lay the blame? 
I'm only here to cause some pain

""When the sun sets, I get upset

Darkness fills me and I want to light up the world""

You're my best friend, 
And if it's tonight will these walls hold our secret? 
Don't breathe out loud  
It's like breaking glass, 
And the walls must hold the moments fast

We're still fifteen years old. 
Naked in blankets, 
The angels would thank us 
If they knew how the future was told.

Ellis Paul,"If you could paint her, she'd be a Picasso. 
She's got a few things out of place.
Like when she smiles, it's slightly out of line. 
It's half awkward, yet half grace.
While you're unraveling this mystery 
Of where she fits in time and space, 
She'll drag you into this lover's tale,
Though she will not give a reason.
And if you fight her tooth and nail,
She won't give up until you lose
She wants the last word, the last dance. 
She thinks it's absurd that you believe in second chances. 
You're a lost cause, yet here she is. 
And that's the mystery. Here she is

She's a poem by Ferlinghetti.
She's the angel from a nursery rhyme 
She'll set you a place at your table,
Then fill your cup till you're drunk on red wine.

She don't believe in stars or in miracles,
But she reads your horoscope daily.
And if your response is too cynical,
She'll say, ""Who are you to know?""

Ellis Paul,"King of 7th Avenue 
I can count all the lights in the city from the ledge on the twenty seventh floor.
There must be ten thousand window or more. 
It's a hobby I can count on, helps me forget about the cold. 
And I get to meet the neighbors for as long as the ledge will hold. 
In the window across from me, a man is committing a robbery. 
It's another form of the New York City lottery. 
His ears must be burning, he drops the bag and he stares. 
I'm the man out on the building. 
Yes, there's no net down there
And there's a woman below that I see.
Her silhouette is quite beautiful.
It plays tricks on my memory.

Puts a face on the shadows in front of me. 
A crowd below is forming, beneath this window ledge, my throne. 
I am the King of Seventh Avenue, 
New York City is my home. 

I think the sirens have come for me, 
Their searchlights reach up to the balcony. 
They bathe me in light, blind me so I can't see.

I hear the crowd all ask for jumping,
While the cops all ask for calm.
Even the pigeons think I'm something,
The whole city is in my palms.
My daughter Lisa says to me,

""Dad the world is yours, and it's beautiful. 
Don't throw it all away on memories.

You've got to meet new people""
Yeah, that will be good for me. 
Good for me. 
Good for me. 
So I watch the lovers behind their shades. 
I've seen them embrace after their furious fights. 
I've watched them mend their fences, make their love all night. 
Only to tear them down again,

Change the limits, change the boundaries. 
The same beginning, the same end.

Yet the story still astounds me.
The whole world now is watching.

I'm the King of Seventh Avenue 
And tonight I'm not alone. I'm not alone.",King of Seventh Avenue,1994

I'm the one who's last at the table,
I'm the one who never gets the gold.

You're the one who says I'm able,
But you turn your words with lies and fables...

I sat through Tarzan swinging through the jungle, 
And Godzilla crushing buildings and all. 
The light from this TV can make it all look so easy. 
It makes this room feel incredibly small.

Now I've heard it all. 
The excuses get weaker as the stories get tall.
You step off with the wrong foot, the drunk fool at the ball. 
Well, I'm not up for dancing.

It says, ""Fool go to bed -- 
Why waste the words, they've already been said.""

Now I'm left with the thorn and the stem. 
I'm out looking for my friends, looking for my friends. 

She left the note in the sleeve of my coat, that was not nice -- 
I called her on the phone, the voice that spoke, it was cold, it was hard as ice.

I tried to speak, 
the connection was weak 
'Cause I was talking to a machine. 
She said, ""If this is you, we're totally through,""

Once we're inside, it's a carnival ride
That brings a white knuckle kind of dizzy

She takes me up on her rooftop,
Framed by a backdrop of watertanks and chimneys
She's wrapped round a cigarette,
Lecturing etiquette, while I look in the windows
Beneath me

And when nighttime came the skyline just swallowed
The moon

And 60 million lightbulbs telling new york that
It's noon

Could you tell in this whole damn town who'd
Believe you? ""

Just spin
It was like holding up the world in a tablespoon
And we drank it down,m every light in town

She laughs at me, says I'm suburban bound
But the truth is I live on a highway

Every window tells a story in cold hard truth
As the world spins beneath me, I ask it for proof
That I'm living my life in my own way
Or will time just have it's own say

Then he blamed us for the weather,

It was cold and rainy -

And throw down tourists to us?

We'd probably have to find a tour bus 

And man, how do we find a tour bus 
Without finding another day 

We took the M across the Seine 
And headed for the Eiffel tower 
And there the street merchants 
Called us out by name

And then they told us, ""Every Yankee looks the same""

When we told the waiter there what we had done, he said,
""Only an American would attempt Paris in a day...
Only an American would do Paris in a day..."" 

We did Paris in a day 
What would Marcel Marceau say?
We put up our feet at the Fountain Cafe 
And toasted the bond between us 

We drank sherry with an Englishman 
We caught up like long lost friends 
Under the Arc we watched the sunset end 
And laughed at the miles that had passed beneath us 

The miles that passed beneath us 
You said, ""That's kilometres, baby""
But I wouldn't let it come between us 

Nothing will come between us 
Nothing will come between us...",Paris in a Day,1996
Ellis Paul,"I tried to frame my own self portrait 
Into a three-minute one-act play 
But I'm a carnival of voices 
It's hard to pin me down that way 
Without my subconscious saying 
""I'm not in love with you,
But I'd be willing to make a change.
It's these profound fits of sunshine 
That bring on subsequently rain."" 

""If I could make a suggestion""
I say, 'Oh, this should be nice'

Now take my good advice,
Nobody's out here throwing rice yet 
But me and the voices inside of your head 
All agree""

You think I'm afraid of you?
Well, I'm afraid I think you're right
I've never been good at crowd control 
Your voices keep me up all night' 'Now, I'm no psychiatrist

Ellis Paul,"It's a snowy night, the cops shut down the freeway 
Big men in plows are out carving up the streets 
Below them, jammed on a subway, 
I'm with two hundred over-dressed strangers

Kicking snow off dress shoe feet

You live six miles down this trolley car's trail 
Up above the red line, where the street musicians wail 
Where Baby, we used to chase down coffee 
On the sidewalk take in tunes 
We'd drink in the waning hours 
Till we polished off the moon 
Who knew the moon would fail 
Above the trolley car trail 

""Park Street, next station""
Says a voice with an accent I've heard 
And I see shoppers on the platform 
Where green and red lines diverge 
I fight my way through the packages and the bows 
To a pay phone, the operator knows 
She says to me, ""Your nervousness shows""
I say, ""'Nervous' is too kind a word"" 

I think snowfall should be measured 
By how much it takes a city by surprise 
By how far back old timers go to remember 
The last time a blizzard stung their eyes 
Last time I rode a subway 
You had summer in your eyes 
You did 

Your phone rings, but it only brings your voice 
On a message machine, ""I'm not here, the tape is clear""
Me, I'm off the hook it seems 
""I called,"" I say, ""to say 'hello'
To coax you out where the snowmen grow 
But you're not home, and hey, I gotta go,
It was good to hear your voice.""",Trolley Car,1996

Ellis Paul,"So you found yourself a corner apartment
With a view of the town all your own
All your friends say 
The city's gonna kill you or cure you
Five flights of stairs to your home

And even now,
It's changed how you walk in the street
Past cabbies and chimney sweeps
Be careful with strangers you speak to

[Chorus]
What has this city done to you?
Has it taken the small town out of you
And turned you into someone I never knew?

When we were kids
In the warmth of a porch light
You'd smuggle out twin cigarettes
We'd blow smoke in the air
With typical hometown flair
Two futures we could not predict

And look at you now,
The dreamer with the back porch plan
For the writer and the music man
Our faces on magazine stands

[Chorus]

What has this city done to you?
Has it taken the innocence out of you
And turned you into someone I never knew?
Did I ever know you?

Do you know how you light up these buildings?
You can turn the head of a man whose grown old
You're a candle when the streets grow cold

I can hear a cricket in your fifth floor apartment
It's 3 AM
Back home he'd put me to sleep
But he's fighting to be heard
He can't get in a word
'Cause there's a fool
Laughing outside in the street

Where are you now?
I lost you outside on Montague Street
To the city that never will sleep
Is it the sideshow in you
That it speaks to?

Ellis Paul,"Tell the man who repairs the wings for angels
That one has fallen among the mortals on Bleeker Street

The hard part's avoiding buildings and concrete""

A Tuesday afternoon
I hailed a cab, a crowd gathered as it pulled beside us
And somebody tore at her wings, but I helped her safely inside
""I'm much obliged,"" she said, but the driver he looked shaken

He said, ""You're fakin', lady, who's taking who for a ride""
But then we floated up over the traffic, she turned the radio to static,
And she sang to him in Billy Holiday's sweet voice

Call out the paparazzi and the the television crews
Hey if you choose 
Would a little Faith come to harm you?

It was just another day
What will the mayor say?
""Good afternoon""

We flew down the length of Fifth Avenue
She threw out miracles, it was a hysterical ride
And if the crowd on the sidewalk looked skeptical
She took the blue right out of their cynical eyes
""It's all in what you feel inside""

She shook the mayor's hand, and he declared
That he'd hold a press conference,
The fans and protesters blocked the stairs to city hall
""I'd like to thank you all,"" he said
And when she stepped before the cameras 
It felt like a trial, but she smiled as the questions were called,
""What do you say to detractors, who claim you're just some actor?""

She said, ""The question here, is 'Do I believe in you?'""
It was just another day
Like any other, other day

In front of paparazzi, in front of television crews

You just turned and watched the buildings pass by
And said, ""I wouldn't have him any other way""

Are those the ones blocking out the ultraviolet rays?

Ellis Paul,"I judged the distance
To where you ran your hand through your hair
You were startled for an instant , you said,
""take me home,"" and I paid the fare.


And you laughed the laugh of the innocent
As the cab cut a path in the street
As the world swept by with it's violence
I thought of the shelter we'd find in the sheets¡­
In the sheets

Chorus
I never asked you for nothing like changing your name
I believed we had something here, but nothing ever came
Were you thrown by the language, by words that we said
When I told you I loved you
Did it get in the way? get in the way?

You lit a candle,
Then you poured me a glass of port wine
I pulled the oven handle,
The air felt warm, the scent felt kind

And your kiss could heal like medicine
There ain't nothing that it can't overcome
But I could not lean on this evidence,
For fear you'd take the cure and run.
You would run...

Chorus

Cause love won't stop to
Think about the consequences
Turns a fool to stumbling
Over people's fences.

And the moon cut a frown over windy town
But you smiled as you pulled down the shade
And we turned a corner onto holy ground
And got lost in the love we made, that we made...

Chorus

Get in the way...

Ellis Paul,"I'll respond to you in letters
Sorry so slow, sorry so few
In a nutshell, I'm much better
So far the complaints I hear are few
So how have you been? Have you been to the races? Did you take my mother 
Is your sister in braces? I wish I could've been there to see you through
Hey, are all those things you told me once still true? 

Do you remember that time 
It was cold in the park 
You were running a race, I was there on a lark 
Who would've thought that New York could be such a small town

Into a starry sky upon Jupiter,
With it's cold moons
Making their weary rounds.

Did he know that the Pope
Would claim that he ran with Lucifer
And a prison cell
Would be where he'd lay his head down?

Was he wearing a thorny crown?
When he plotted the motion of planets,
Was Mercury in retrograde?
But he found the truth when a lie was what was demanded.
When the judges asked him pointedly
He was a' trembling that day.

""Tell Ptolemy, tell Copernicus,
That the Sun is at the core of us

Can't deny the Milky Way

And every flower that follows the sun,
Has known all along
What God had done
They whisper truth
As the seasons each give way.

Don't shoot the messenger,
The postman delivers Truth today.
And Truth will march in Birmingham
It will block the tanks in Tiananmen.

As God has conceived it.

Falling like a thief from a roof. 
She's asking for proofâ??â??Are you staying?â?? 
Outside you hear mission bells. 

Welcome to Maria's beautiful mess, 
In a cluttered apartment on the West Side. 
She pulls the blinds while, 
You watch how her dress falls round her. 

And the world slows, a clock shows 
A wrinkle in the flow of time 
And she steps close, her eyes glow, 
Lips pop open like a bottle of wine 

And she'll love like it's thirst 
Like she's never been hurt, 
She's dancing just like nobody's watching. 
Is this love? Is this cursed? 
It feels like the first time falling 
Nobody's watching, Nobody's watching, 
Nobody's watching, watching 

She puts on some music, 
She asks you to choose it 
You sang her back a Gershwin line. 
Now Ella is singing holy, soulfully, 
Bringing up better times 

And beneath the tunes, 
She's smiling on an unmade bed 
She saysâ??â??What's in the middle that scares you? 

Does it dare you 
To take a moment and just slow down?â??

With rose petal kisses
Smother me
With wet perfume
Hover over me,
Like you're pulling at the ocean
Tugging at the sand
Oh, sweet Gravity's hands
Fill me like the light fills the moon.

Headlights in the driveway
Somebody's in a car, a door slams
Clip clop your man's come home
There's a tumble, there's a shakeup
A knife falls to the floor
God damn, that turns marrow to bone

There's a man inside the parlor
His heartbeat paints the floor
A voice on his shoulder is whisperin' his name
In the heart of a desperate hour
Love knocks down all doors
Knowing too well it's too late to lay blame.

Baby let's live in the moment
Cause it feels like life is taking the moment away

She poured coffee in my favorite cup

Ah, but who needs perfection?
I like the tension when there's room for doubt

A postcard, a blanket, a bottle of Merlot

Will it fall on forgetful ears?

With two kids and a bottle of booze
And she cracked them both like match heads 
Whenever they ventured too close to her fuse

Playing cards for cigarettes

Shaking the walls of every kid in the suburbs

I lifted my thumb up to the old highway
Carved their names across the USA
Chasing a rock band
Chasing the ghost of the King in Graceland

There's nothing but highway in front of me
Louisiana bayou, thunderstorms in Tennessee
Set me free
There's nothing behind me but history
Every town I greeted
Everything I needed to know
Was breaking through the radio

I hitched a ride down to Tupelo
With a caravan of gypsy souls
Dancin' in moon shine
Every song pulled me in like a life line

Set me free
There's nothing behind me but history
Every town I greeted
Everything I needed to know
Was breaking through the radio

Ellis Paul,"It was a summer night 
I took off in my old man's car 
I rolled the windows right on down 
I cranked up the radio 
And chased the meteors 
On a dirt road out of town 

Tonight 
There's a bonfire in Walker's field 
Tonight 
In the firelight our dreams revealed 
Tonight 
You can chase away your high school years 
Shadows dancing wildly at the scene 
But I never knew right then 
Just what it means 
To be eighteen 
To be eighteen 

The voice of Jimmy Aberdeen 
Still washes over me 
He had a laugh like a thunder cloud 
He was holding blue spray paint 
Jimmy was no saint 
But he could always draw a crowd 

That night 
We climbed the water tower in Walker's field 
That night 
Above the lights of town our fates were sealed 
That night 
Jimmy fell down through the darkness 

An ambulance brought silence to the scene 

And carried off the life 
And broken dreams 
Of Jimmy Aberdeen 

Now the years have passed 
The cabbie taps the glass 
We're outside 
My reunion hall 
He leaves me to the night 
I count the satellites 
I see the tower 
Looming tallâ?¦ 


Tonight 
I'm taking on my memory 
Tonight 
I climbed the water tower for all to see
Tonight 

I painted steel 
With cobalt blue 
Spelling out 
My graduation year 
Above the highway 
That took me out of here 

And I finally think 
I really know 
What it means 
To be eighteen

Ellis Paul,"My name is robert wilson,
I'm from eau claire, wisconsin.
I've been living out of a
Suitcase now for fourteen days...
I walked the boulevard in hollywood,
I caught a vegas show that was no good --
Met a dancer there that starred in a broadway play.
But it's a lonely world from this greyhound,
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days.

Three thousand miles,
I've been here fourteen days,
Three thousand miles...

Now twenty-one is as good a guess as any age that I'd confess to,
Let's just say I'm old enough to get away.
Back in school, I found the only written truth
On bathroom stalls and telephone booths.
I studied awhile, but college got in my way.
I've learned much more from the back of this greyhound,
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days.

Three thousand miles,
I've come a long, long way,
Three thousand miles...

Have you seen?
The world outside is turning --
And it's yours --
We were put here for the learning.
People talk to themselves on greyhounds,
Even the driver strains to hear
They tell the same forgotten story --
Will it fall on forgetful ears?

Down in houston on comes this woman
With two kids and a bottle of booze,
And she cracked them both like match heads
Whenever they ventured too close to her fuse.
And I sat with a girl from boston,
Playing cards for cigarettes.
I lost her name with the poker game,
But her name I will never forget --

You never forget the view from these windows,
Believe me, I've been here fourteen days...

Three thousand miles,
I've come a long, long way,
Three thousand miles...

Has it faded now unspoken?

Elly Rosenthal,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,2000
Elly Stone,"The old folks don't talk much
And they talk so slowly when they do
They are rich, they are poor, their illusions are gone
They share one heart for two

Their homes all smell of thyme, of old photographs
And an old-fashioned song
Though you may live in town, you live so far away
When you've lived too long

And have they laughed too much, do their dry voices crack
Talking of times gone by
And have they cried too much, a tear or two
Still always seems to cloud the eye

They tremble as they watch the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks dream no more
The books have gone to sleep, the piano's out of tune
The little cat is dead and no more do they sing
On a Sunday afternoon

The old folks move no more, their world's become too small
Their bodies feel like lead
They might look out the window or else sit in a chair
Or else they stay in bed

And if they still go out, arm in arm, arm in arm
In the morning's chill
It's to have a good cry, to say their last good-bye
To one who's older still

And then they go home to the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old folks never die
They just put down their heads and go to sleep one day
They hold each other's hand like children in the dark
But one will get lost anyway

And the other will remain just sitting in that room
Which makes no sound
It doesn't matter now, the song has died away
And echoes all around

You'll see them when they walk through the sun-filled park
Where children run and play
It hurts too much to smile, it hurts too much but life goes on
For still another day

As they try to escape the old silver clock
When day is through
It tick-tocks oh so slow, it says, ""Yes,"" it says, ""No""
It says, ""I'll wait for you""

The old, old silver clock that's hanging on the wall
That waits for us

All I did was call her name
A thousand times since half past ten
Madeleine, she never came

Madeleine's my ''Tis of Thee'
She's America to me
It's true that she's too good for me
That's what her brother always says

I waited for Madeleine
It's always been the same
Waiting here since who knows when
Madeleine, she never came

She is much more than pretty
She is all that you know
She is my whole life to me
I love my Madeleine so

So I'm gonna wait for Madeleine
In front of the picture show

Elly Stone,"I loved all games and fairy tales
As strangely odd as that may seem
I loved firelight and witches' tales
You see, you were there in my dreams

I lived in a tower, cloud-top high
To stop your love from passing by
For this I simply had to do
You see, I was waiting for you

I loved the rocks, the ocean breeze
And the hissing of the foam
The wild, wild kiss of the roaring seas
Now you had brought me home

You leaped buildings in single bounds
Although I well may ask you how
You bayed the moon just like a hound
I knew I adored you now

You laced the night with raging storms
You threw the lightning 'cross the skies
You kissed my mouth with promises
You burned me with your lies

You loved me like a poet loves
My nights were made of stars and fears
Thinking that you would go away
And leave me only with my tears

I loved the towns where we made love
And the hotels where we played games
You thought I'd never live it down
Yet you see, I've forgotten your name

",I loved (J'aimais),1974

A patient girl who knows the score
Whistle for her

At the funeral of my youth

And the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as all love is bright
Who loves for us
Amd the passing time
But whatever is behind the door
You know, there's nothing left to do
Angel or devil, Idon't care
For in front of that door
There is you
My death waits beneath my pillow
To catch my sleep in endless tableau
So lets freeze
The passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's drink to that
And the passing time
My death waits in your arms
Your thighs
Your soothing fingers will
Close my eyes
But let's not talk about
The passing time
But whatever is behind the door
And whoever waits for me
Angel or devil
I don't care
For in front of that door
You will be
My death waits among the fallen leaves
At my coffin where they greive
And now lets nail the passing time
My death waits among the rows
Where the blackest shadow goes
Let's cast blooms upon the passing time
My death waits in a double bed
Sands of oblivion at my head
Pull up the sheets against

Elmo,"Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and grandpa we believe
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,
And we begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
and she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas morning,
At the scene of the attack,
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,
And incriminating Claus marks on her back

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Now we're all so proud of grandpa,
He's been taking this so well
See him in there watching football,
Drinking beer and playing cards with cousin Mel
It's not Christmas without Grandma
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder
Should we open up her gifts,
Or send them back (send them back)

Grandma got run over by a reindeer
Walking home from our house Christmas eve
You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and grandpa we believe

Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched the hair on grandma's wig
I've warned all my friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves,
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves

Yo, niggaz can not see me, can not be me or
Capture the metaphoric phrase blasted off stage when I tour
I am but a messenger born to blow up
My niggaz knew it all the time, lyrically I was a dime
At the age of nine, shorty Black, could rhyme
On the mic I never wasted time, I'm, the exquisite wizard
When I visit shorties I hit it I'm cool as a blizzard
Nigga what? You wanna bust your fronts, with the butter, my
Black paper chase ya and then erase ya rhyme
Sucker, MC's how I hate it when you waste your time
My state of mind, shine like it's diamond studded
I'm rhyme budded on stage, word is bond, when I'm on, I rage
Got the twelve gauge had the reci-play, inter-terrestrial-ly
My everyday M.O. is gettin' dough cause times is rougher
Than a mother for brothers to scuffle shuffle your cards kid
Cause the odds is, niggaz'll hustle and live, foul
This wild environment hostile produce, the music in me
So my style's the blend of what is and was
You could get a buzz from it, but enter too deep
And reach a summit you fall and then plummit beyond real
Where you're killed if your raps ain't ill
Another crab motherfucker 'nother cap to peel
Through these amps, I motivate camps to dance
Niggaz too advanced, I warn, I'm just tellin' you what goes on

The signs appear, the shit's not clear
What if I flipped, would you know how to maintain your edge
I'm takin' heads because, there's no fuckin' ledge
I pledge allegiance to my cosmic guide
I couldn't fit in three dimensions if I tried
Civilizations I can delete, so crews don't bother me
Battle with Jehovah gaining universal sovereignt
Niggaz run around like ?, I got planets and thrones
Throughout the galaxy my name's well known (my name's well known)
I'm all alone in my zone, you wouldn't understand
Stare in my face, fuck around and catch a scar man

Here on this agenda, there is no pretenders
So when we begin to assassinate your cast members
They shall ?, wavin' white flags, man we surrender
Those half-assed negroes know they're no contenders
In syringes, I can shoot up lyrical vengeance
And my grammar, might do a mandatory life in slammers
You should regret it, thinkin' about steppin' to me
Niggaz forget it, you'll get gassed with lyrics leaded
Most energetic, I never snag I'm tightly threaded
I flip scripts like pattern twistness in calisthenics
Black Thought, Elo and me a trio
Tellin' the the strong, word is bond
I'm just tellin' you what goes on

Élodie Frégé,"There's nothing left for me to do
Just like time and time and time again
What else is left for me to prove?
But when it comes around
I can't help falling down
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just the weight of stones & feathers
I'm not myself
Maybe I'm never
Just like tear that fades away
Just like a word I can't express or can't explain
A thousand voices in my brain
I wish they'd comfort me
Instead it's torturing
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just the way I'm made to measure
I'm not myself
Maybe I'm never
When all is said and done
I confess I've had enough
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just a chill that lasts forever
I'm not myself maybe I'm never
Is this the state of so-called pleasure?
Or just a break in heavy weather

Harry, ce soir, écume la ville, pour oublier sa mère

Warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace
Rising to a snowy height
Each star it's on Aurora Borealis
Suddenly you held me tight
I could see the midnight sun
I can't explain
The silver rain that found me
Or was that a moonlit veil
The music of the Universe 
Around me
Or was that a nightingale
And then you arms miraculously found me
Suddenly the sky turned pale
I could see the midnight sun
Was there such a night
It's a thrill
I still don't quite believe
But after you were gone
There was still some 
Stardust on my sleeve
The flame of it may dwindle 
To an amber
And the stars forget to shine
And we may see the meadow in December

Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why

Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.

Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.

Eloy,"Back into the present, it's different since I've been away:
War and desolation, it's getting worse with every day:
Even back in thirteen fifty-eight
People had to fight to keep things straight.
Waiting in the disco, tell my friends just what I've seen,
They won't believe my story when I tell them where I've been:
Smoke and lights and music blow my mind
Must go somewhere quiet to unwind.",Back Into the Present,1975

Eloy,"I'm sitting here in my empty cell 
It's dark and drab and damp: 
They throw me crusts to eat 
Drink water from the well. 
I was playing my part in this dreadful war 
When someone ran me through: 
They bound me up in chains, 
And that's the last I knew. 
The guards are watching day and night, 
And they observe each move I make: 
I wonder if they'll let me out alive 
I know there's no way to escape 
I know the feeling of dejection: 
To be imprisoned for no crime: 
So God please take me out of here 
You are my one hope at this time. 
Why are those people shouting? 
Is the battle lost or won? 
Now the footsteps of the guards 
Will my chains be tightened or undone?",Imprisonment,1975
Eloy,"Though I don't want to play with magic
There's nothing else to do:
I wish that I was home again, sitting there with you:

The wise magician , he alone
Can find a way to take us both back home

Gain wisdom from the astral world
Look inside the eye of the mind
And find deliverance at last

You found your sanctuary now

Emanating this new found might
Days that once were grey are shining
Dormant emotions awake
Tasting sweet to your mind
You see your goal way ahead
Shining like a beacon in the dark
Forever is here and now
It's not a trick of the light
You hear a silence within
Peace and love reunite
In everlasting burning light
You feel your aura expanding
Bathing in virginal joy
Just like a flower in bloom
Still in embryonic state

Free from anxiety now

On some hair-brained scheme,
He lives in a dream
But he can't do much for me know
But he can't do much for me know
I've spent all my life eating knowledge at school
Driven hard to pass exams like a fool
And now they're all behind me
Success has come to remind me
Where do I go from here?
Hey, what's this, I'm disappearing
Seeing strange things, hey what's happening?
I don't understand what it's meant to be
Is it something in my drink or is it me?
What are these things around me
I'm coming down, I'm coming down
And who's that smart chick over there?
But they're old fashioned clothes to wear!

April, 1358...Paris...I don't understand any more... my name is
Jamie...and mine is a strange story... one which even I don't fully
Understand...my father is a scientist... and he has been
Experimenting with time-eroding drugs... I was sitting in his
Workroom..it was late at night...and I was thinking... you know,
About me and my future...I've just left school...and I don't know
What I want to do...I must have somehow have taken the drug... and
Landed up here.
Jeanne:
My name is Jeanne . . and let me tell you my story . . my father owns
Many acres around here ... which are farmed by peasants ... whom he
Rules with an iron hand .. the neighbouring landlord's even worse
... and I'm supposed to marry his son ... That's not my choice, you
Know, 'like father, like son'.
Jamie:
Well I see we've both got our problems ... perhaps we can help each
Other ... I've got something here... lots of my friends smoke it...
I don't suppose you know it... try it, it helps at times like these...
Jeanne:
Oh what a beautiful feeling... everything shimmering in the
Twilight... look at that sunset... I've never seen such colours
Before... it all seems suspended in eternity... I wish moments like
These would last forever... I'm not worried any more... what are you
Thinking?
Jamie:
I can't think at the moment... but I feel as if we've known each
Other for years... let's just enjoy it.
Somehow we must stay together, lifelong friend, my lifelong friend,
Love like ours will last forever, never end, and never end:
We'll somehow wipe away our fears,
And find a way bridge the years.

Smoke, drifting slowly away with the music

Who outside could claim that they've got happiness like that?",Madhouse,1996
Eloy,"Your father told me I can stay,
But he mistrusts my unfamiliar ways:
He want's to use the things I've learnt
Six hundred years of knowledge sorely earned.
But if we can stay together,
I don't mind the things he tells me:
Of defending him in mutiny,
I don't care if you're there, I don't care
One the farms they've made a stand,
Against the hated iron hands, they're uniting
They're backed by everyone in town,
And I must ride to beat them down, how they're fighting:
But I understand their cause
To fight against the laws, they're right:
I promised to defend
Your father to the end and fight
The hatred's there in their eyes,
They'll break his might it's no surprise if they do it:
But I must take the other side
And somehow learn to stand and fight, and come through it:
Though there's little chance
That I beat bow and lance, I must:
Our love drives me on
For you're the only one I can trust.

Only fake and mendacity

Based on lies and dishonesty
Useless and in vain
Only a burning shame

Rigid guards of morality

Or to wallow in resignation

returning to our true values

Growing reckless rapacity

There is just one thing I need

Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer play

I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for (yes I)
I just want to see my baby

Elsa Garcia,"I lost at love before,
Got mad and closed the door.
But you said try just once more.
I chose you for the one,
Now I'm having so much fun.
You treated me so kind,
I'm about to lose my mind.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

The others were untrue,
But when it came to lovin' you,
I'd spend my whole life with you.
'Cause you came and you took control,
You touched my very soul.
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at.
You made me so very happy,
I'm so glad you came into my life.

That you're even in my dreams.
I hear you calling me.

Well I had talk with the AEC*
And they brought out some maps that looked good to me
And one showed me a spot that he said he knowed
So I straddled my Jeep and headed down the road

I reckon I drove about 100 miles
Down a bumpy road out through the wilds
When all of sudden I bounced to a stop
At the foot of a mountain, didn't have no top

Just like I'd read about Vernon Pick

On the second day, I made the top
And I'm tellin' you, Steve, I was ready to stop

Was the bones in my back that had gone astray
