Tanya Tucker,"If your heart ain't busy tonight
Maybe it would like to get with mine
If your heart ain't busy tonight
Well I could keep it occupied for a long long time
If your lips ain't got something pressing to do
If your arms aren't held up, well their invited too
If your heart ain't busy tonight
Maybe it would like to get with mine
Anytime

Well its kind of you to lend me an ear
Well that's a start but I believe
If I could only get the rest of you over here
Then all of you might fall in love with all of me
If your heart ain't busy tonight
Maybe it would like to get with mine
Anytime - Oh-yeah

If your feet are restless for somewhere to go
And your eyes want something more to see
Why don't you let them lead the rest of you to my door
So all of you can fall in love with all of me

If your heart ain't busy tonight
Well maybe it would like to get with mine
If your heart ain't busy tonight
Well I could keep it occupied for a long long time
Yes I could

If your lips ain't got something pressing to do
If your arms aren't held up, well they're invited too
If your heart ain't busy tonight
Maybe it would like to get with mine
If your heart ain't busy tonight
Maybe it would like to get with mine

Tanya Tucker,"Late one night, I heard a knock on my door,
No surprise, it was my landlord.
Notified me I was late with the rent.
What can you do when your last dollar's spent,
You got trouble.
Some kind of trouble.

I called up my baby for a little advice,
'Cause my sugar baby always treats me so nice.
I had a funny feelin' that he wasn't alone,
I heard another voice whisper: ""Hang up the 'phone.""
I got trouble.

There's never any trouble for me to find,

There's never any trouble for me to find,
Some kind of trouble. (Oooh, some kind of trouble.)

I got trouble.
I was down around as low as a body can be,
So I talked to my preacher about prayin' for me.
He smiled and he said: ""Child, you're not alone.

Tanya Tucker,"She's fifteen and he's barely driving a car
She's got his ring and he's got the keys to her heart
It's just a matter of time
They'll spread their wings and fly

Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams
And faith that can move anything
They've heard it's all uphill
But all they know is how they feel
The world says they'll never make it
Love says they will

There's a baby crying and one more on the way
There's a wolf at the door 
With a big stack of bills they can't pay
The clouds are dark and the wind is high
But they can see the other side

Like two sparrows in a hurricane
Trying to find their way
With a head full of dreams

Tanya Tucker,"That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

Daddy said, ""Now come girl
We're heading down the road to Augusta""
An thinking through his clenched teeth
He called mama's name, then he cursed her

He said, ""Girl, you're young, but some dude has come along
And stole your mother""
Ah, but you can't steal a willing mind
Whose mom is always looking for a lover

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

With dusty teardrops on his face
My daddy cried and big steps he was taking
And halfway running to keep up
My shorter legs were so tired and shaking

Where did I go wrong, girl?
Why would she leave us both this way?
At times like these, a child with tears
Never knows exactly what to say

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

We searched in every bar room
And honky-tonk as well
And finally daddy found them
But Lord, you know, the rest is hard to tell

He sent me out to wait
But scared, I looked back through the door
And daddy left them both
Soaking up the sawdust on the floor

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down

That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
That Georgia sun was blood red and going down
",Blood Red and Going Down,1993
Tanya Tucker,"Same dancers in the same old shoes
Some habits that you just can't lose
It's no telling what a girl might use
After the thrill is gone

The flame rises but it soon descends
Empty pages and a frozen pen
You're not quite lovers and you're not quite friends
After the thrill is gone, oh
After the thrill is gone

What can you do when your dreams come true
And it's not quite like you planned?
What have you done to be losing the one
You held him so tight in your hand?

Well, time passes and you must move on
Half the distance takes you twice as long
So you keep on singing for the sake of the song
After the thrill is gone

You're afraid you might fall out of fashion
And you're feeling cold and small
Any kind of love without passion
Ain't no kind of lovin' at all

Same dancers in the same old shoes
You get too careful with the steps you choose
You don't care about winnin' but you don't wanna lose
After the thrill is gone, yeah

Tanya Tucker,"Years ago he was the handsomest devil in town
Well I know 'cause I've seen his pictures laying around
But he's gettin' old and can't ride them Broncos no more
It makes me sad my old man just hit sixty-four

Years ago his home was the wild rodeos
But his scars are the only trophies that he's got to show
Now he's gettin' old his spurs are all rusty and brown
Oh it makes me sad my old man is fast slowing down

He's my father, my friend and I love him, 
That was hard to say just a few years ago,
Funny but I guess I have mellowed 'cause my cowboy's getting old

As he stepped on board the 8-0-2 he could hear his daddy say

Tanya Tucker,"I never thought the time would come,
When I would want to have someone
To take your place, and love me while your gone.
I promised I would stay with you,
And that's just what I want to do,
But a woman can't spend this much time alone.

There'll always be just one more hill,
You'll have to climb, I know you will.
And I would never try, to change your way.
But just this once, lets think of me,
Now try to listen closely,
There's something on my mind of got to say.

While you're out there riding rainbows,
I get awful lonely on the ground.
So I was thinking, maybe, 
We could have a little baby,
That I could love, when you're not around,
Not around.

Sometimes my hearts an empty place,
And I need love to fill that space.
Those lonely nights, a smile could get me through.
Each time I'd see that silly grin
And smaller image of your chin,
I'd be content to hold a part of you.

While you're out there riding rainbows,
I get awful lonely on the ground.

Well I was up all night well wonderin' what to do
Thinkin' that I oughta just forget about you
But it's a little too late
Well it's a little too late
When you walked in I shoulda walked out
Well it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Well the whole town told me you're a heart break king
Guess I oughta pay attention when they say those things
But it's a little too late
Well it's a little too late
I know all my old buddies wanna help me out
But it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Turn the jukebox up throw some sawdust down
I'm too far gone to turn this heart around
I may be wrong but I don't want out
Well it's a little too late to do the right thing now

Counting the hours till daybreak
What can you do now, where can you go?
When you're about at the end of your rope - you can

Drive out to the edge of town
Where the world is cold and dark
Look for the flicker of a neon sign
In the shape of a broken heart
You'll hear music that will give you chills
Coming from that run down bar
You can slow dance with the ghost of love
To the cry - of a blue guitar

It's where the lonely people go
When they just can't take no more

You pushing me on that tire swing
Up so high I could almost touch the sky

The picture fades to you and me
Caught stealing a kiss behind the tree
It's so real it's like you never said goodbye

Every night I turn the lights down low and take out that old video
I hold your pillow close in the TV's glow and let the good times roll

The road moves on and it always will
But I can make time stand still
I can turn it back and make things just the same

And though you're gone, you're still here
You're far away but always near, I can see your face
And hear you call my name , freeze frame

Every night I turn the lights down low and take out that old video
I hold your pillow close in the TV's glow and let the good times roll

When it comes to an end, I can play it all again
You went away but the good old days are here to stay

Every night I turn the lights down low and take out that old video

Soon I'll be telling you know who the facts of life
I want you to be my wife and our dreams will all come true

So she calls his caller phone just to hear his voice
She knows that it's useless, but she does it anyway

Soon, you'll hear a beep and you know how to play this game
Leave your number and your name, and I promise I'll call back

We put our Christmas things away
Now here's another Christmas day with you

When you're in love, how time does fly
And this year that's just flown by
Has been one happy holiday for two

Christmas to Christmas, wrapped in your arms
Love is always in the season, and always so warm
Till my days on earth are through
I will spend Christmas to Christmas loving you

Yes, the giving season's here again
Yuletide smiles are in demand
Time to love your fellow man, well, it's true

But the love we share is for all time
We'll feel its glow right through July
To melt the cold when winter flies anew

They were young and love was new
And every day that feeling grew
Between the two of them
When work grew scarce and times got bad

And hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them

The fifties came and the sixties went
A mortgage note replaced the rent
And they made the most of each day spent
Between the two of them
The children all turned out just fine

Left with oh so little time

Today I braved the graveyard rain
And placed a rose between their names
Now that's the most that ever came

And the pleasure of just growing up

She wouldn't know me if she saw me
And you'd turn your head if you did
She'll never know how much you loved me
Or what kind of love we had
Or what kind of love we had

You threw away all our pictures
But the memories won't go away
She's asking questions that you don't have to answer
It's written all over your face, yes
It's written all over your face

I bet she knows when I'm on your mind
I bet she sees it in your eyes
What's in your heart you can not hide
I bet she knows when I'm on your mind
I bet she knows when I'm on your mind

Late in the midnight hour
When you're doing what lovers do
There's still a desire deep down inside
That's just between me and you, yea
It's just between me and you

Now don't you ever feel guilty
Giving just half of your heart
Holdin' on to your foolish pride
Is just keeping us apart.
Yea, it's just keeping us apart

In the cool of the night
When the howling wind calls my name
You can run to her arms
But it's not the same

On a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield
There's a storm moving in

That he never should have been
And the thunder rolls

In a house across town

In her faded flannel gown
Askin' for miracle

When he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him
Thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain
A strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes
And he knows that she knows

On a sleepless night
As the storm blows on

To the bedroom door

To the county jail
Just because he asked a little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel's worth of candy if she'd tell

A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward
So the county had to claim
Inside the old mans ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green

Tanya Tucker,"Sometimes you can be like a stranger 
In moments when you're so far away 
In the night when I reach out to hold you 
You just turn away, why do you turn away
 
Oh, I love you so when you're smilin' 
But your smile has faded overnight 
Will we stay like this for a lifetime 
Gettin' nothin' right, gettin' nothin' right 

Why do we always have stormy weather 
Why do we have it so rough 
Is it so hard just to stay close together 
Why can't we ever have love 

Oh, I knew from the first time I saw you 
I just had to make you mine 
Felt so sad when you told me 
About your troubled life, all about your troubled life 

So here we are just a few years further 
Still tryin' to make it work 
I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl 
Is just a little love, oh baby, just a little love 

Why should we always have stormy weather 
Why should we have it so rough 
It's not so hard just to stay close together 
Why can't we only have love

Tanya Tucker,"If you've got a road map of Texas
You can see that it's a wide open state
From Amarillo down to Boulder
You can bet that it's a honky-tonky place

They might like to rock 'n roll in Dallas
Or disco down on Galveston Bay
But when God made those West Texas cowboys
He gave them the Pecos Promenade

Lead off with the Cotton-Eyed Joe
Buckin' winged and heel and toe
Hold me close for the Pecos Promenade

Big sign hangin' by the door
Sawdust on an old dance floor
Tip your hat for the Pecos Promenade

When the sun starts goin' down on the prairie
And the starlight falls on the state
That's when a cowgirl needs a cowboy
To do the Pecos Promenade

Tonight's the first time I saw him
We can hear those twin fiddles play
Well Houston starts to feel like Lonestar Heaven
As we dance the Pecos Promenade

Lead off with the Cotton-Eyed Joe
Buckin' winged and heel and toe
Hold me close for the Pecos Promenade

Tanya Tucker,"When I was a child
Down in south Caroline
Soon's the Saturday sun went on down
My folk's and sister would go
And leave me home all alone
Goin' to that big square dance in town

Well my old radio
Would play that ol' Opry show
So I never got lonesome or blue
I'd fall asleep in my chair
And dream that I was right there
Just singing the whole night through

When my folks would come home
They'd be humming a song
Mamma'd smile and say, ""Child don't you know
There ain't a thing in this world
To make you fall in love girl
Like the San Antonio stroll""

Well the day finally come
When my momma said, ""Hon'
It's 'bout time you came with us as well""
Well, I had me a time
Yes, I danced all night
Till they rang that old cracked midnight bell

Then the lights went down low
The fiddler picked up his bow
And he played something stately and slow
And my sister Eileen and her husband to be
They held hands and began to stroll

I've been away for a while
But it still brings a smile
When I think of the way that it goes
Now I'll sing it to you
Just so we both can do
That ol' San Antonio stroll

Now I'll sing it to you
Just so well all can do
That ol' San Antonio stroll",San Antonio Stroll [DVD],2004

All day long in the field a hoin' corn

And read the Bible by the coal oil light

So you can feed the chickens and you can milk the cow
This a woman's liberation honey is a gonna start right now

Late in the winter, it's maple syrup time.
You need warm and sunny days but still a cold and freezing nighttime
For just a few weeks, maple syrup time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long,
Till ninety seven percent of water evaporates just like this song
And when what is left is syrupy don't leave it too long
Watch out for burning! Maple syrup time.

I know it's not the quickest system but each year I can't resist it.
Get out the buckets, and tap the trees in time
Making it is half the fun, and satisfaction when it's done.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.
My grandpa says perhaps it's just a waste of time.
Ah! but no more than this attempt to make a happy little rhyme,
So pat your feet or swing your tail, but keep in good time.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.

I'll send this song around the world with love to every boy and girl,
Hoping they don't mind a little advice in rhyme.
As in life or revolution, rarely is there a quick solution,
Anything worthwhile takes a little time.

Tapemasters,"Where's my coffee?
Good morning doctor carter (hey sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day. (another one what we got?)
Your first patient (yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (uh-huh)
Originality (ugh)
His flow is weak (another one)
And he has no style (ugh)
What'cha got for um?

OK, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.
Dr.carter to the rescue. 
Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace.
One, uno, ace and I'm tryin' to make your heart beat like bass,
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break. 
Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture what I say. 
All I need is one mic. 
All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun-play like.
No kidding, no kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. 
Gotta watch what we say. 
Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3k.
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensei.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
Think I think I lost 'em

Good afternoon doctor carter
Nurse
I don't know about this one 
His confidence is down 
Vocab and metaphors needs work 
And he lost respect for the game
Ah let me see
Think you can save him?

OK.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
Now hey kid
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or re-reciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides, Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Arthritis in my hand from writing.
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the titans.
Fast and exciting.
My passion is frighting.
Now let me put some more vocab in your i.v.
Here take this Vicodin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget 
So pay me no mind 
I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running 
I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency unit
God damn it I've lost another one

Good evening doctor carter its been a long day 
But this one looks much better then the others 
His respect is back up 
Concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement 
All he needs now is some swagger
OK let me take my gloves off then

Swagger tighter then a yeast infection.
Fly go hard like geese erection.
Fashion patrol police detection.
I stay tight like Chinese connection.
I stay tight like p**** at night.
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that p**** right.
But I'm too wrong to write.
Too fresh to fight.
Too paid to freestyle.
Too paid to freestyle.
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice.
And don't ask me s*** unless it concern a price.
And I don't rap fast I rap slow.
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes.
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats.
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat.
Wait, as I put the light down his throat.
I can only see flow.
His blood starting to flow.
His lungs starting to grow.
This one starting to show.
Strong signs of life.
Wheres the stitches here's the knife.
Smack his face his eyes open I reply what a night.
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life.

He looks good
His vitals are up
He's looking good
He's looking good
I think we got one
Doctor carter I think we got one
Yup we got one
We saved him 
He's good
He's good
We got one
He's good
He's good 
We got 'em
He's a go
He's good",Dr Carter,2008

Many die on streets of concrete, blasted from the heat
From under the seat, niggaz just tryin' to make ends meat
Trying to eat, day to day livin' with no religion

Will you run from what you see?
Will you see me in the light?
Hope you do, I hope you stay!

Once it's never, nothing,
I heard you say,
Once it's never, nothing,

And woke you in the night.

I see you walking,
You're turning blue,
And hear me say,
I'll be holding on for a day!

Will you see me in the light?

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

Right now I'm breaking inside

A long ride wishing for your life

Too late I hope not for this

The end of days,
A forceful change,
I've tried my best,
You were never there for me;

You broke my back and played me,
You won just by driving me crazy,
You know I'm gone but maybe,
There's still another breath of life out there for me;

I played the same, but you changed the game,
I'm not gonna take it!
Sitting,
I'll be the man, the better man,
The bitter is sweet when you taste when!

Has been denied,

No love could possibly withstand

And I'd never say
It doesn't mean that much to me
Glad anyway
To see you struggle free

Pinned down but unexamined
Though you kept right on looking
At static there behind my eyes
Keep pushing one-way vision

I guess at least it's something
Since everything is so compromised",Static,1993
Tara Blaise,"One night when I was asleep
I had a dream I could fly
I felt the cold on my skin
Then I opened my eyes

So I jumped out of bed
Went down the fire escape
Now I'm laid out on the street
I wasn't running away

From something I could control
It was inside of me
I didn't know where to go
But I decided to leave

I still remember that night
I've never been the same
Still wonder if I can fly
Was it just a dream?

I wasn't happy for so long
So many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape

But now, it's too late to say I'm sorry
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around

One night when I couldn't sleep
I heard a knock at the door
She put her hand on me slow
Then she opened my heart

I asked myself is this real?
I've never felt this way
She said I need to escape
I said I know a place

So she laid down on my bed
I said confide in me
She looked deep into my eyes
And she invited me

She must lived for her sleep
She never said goodbye
Her angels took her away
I guess now she can fly

I wasn't happy for so long
So many times I walked away
Think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape

But now, it's too late to say I'm sorry
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around
Turn around, turn around, turn around

I wasn't happy for so long
So many times I walked away
I think I was searching for something
Not knowing what I had to face
Until I found out the reason
That's when I made my great escape

But now, it's too late to say I'm sorry

This is my song, these are my words
This is my story
This is my song, these are my words

Dear Lord,
I really, I don't even know how to ax this
You know, I can't, this this this is not an act
I must, from the bottom of my heart, ask forgiveness for my sins
But you know what
I ask that you give me the strength to be able to reach 
all of those peoples, on every street corner, every block, every ghetto
All of those people, that we sometimes think are not worthy of blessings, 
they're worthy to me
And I think that as a man given the blessings you have given me
The opportunity to speak, that I need to speak the language 
of those people, and I need to reach them
You know, because there's are a lot of good people on this Earth, 
but there still some people that need a talking to
And I ask you to give me the strength to reach out to those people
You know because I believe everybody is worthy of your blessings
So I ask that you give, you give me, my family, my crew, F.O.S, the circle
All of us, all the babies that are being born
You give us the strength to be able to deal with it how you see fit
because you give all of us the power, as much as some people might not believe it
You give us the strength to reach out and touch a lot people
So Lord I ask you give me the strength to go out in the world and start the fire
You know, start your fire, you understand I'm saying
Lord, just please be with me, be with me 
and give me the strength and let me do this

And murmured their obscenities

Whose name I never could pronounce
Said pretty please to the ones who served
Who only get what they deserve
And the rich relation hometown queen
Married into what she needs
With a guarantee of company
And a haven for the elderly
Never those who win the game
Those who love assault and gain
Endebted us in quality
And dubious integrity
The small town eyes will gape at you
And act surprised when payment due
And see accounts received
At seventeen
To those of us who know the pain
Of valentines that never came
Those whose names were never called
When choosing sides for basketball
It was long ago and far away
The world was younger than today
And dreams were all that came for free
To ugly duckling girls like me
We all play the game and when we dare
To cheat ourselves at solitaire
Inventing lovers on the phone
Repenting other lives unknown
To call and say come dance with me
And murmur their obscenities
To ugly girls like me
At seventeen",At Seventeen,1999
Tara MacLean,"There's a fire on the mountain
A path through the sea
You were blinded by the flames in me
There's a broken land I've seen it
Here to swallow love
I can feel my fingers slipping
Maybe I don't know what love is
But it isn't this,
No, it isn't this
There's a truth long forgotten
A trust long denied
And a child somewhere hungry and crying
And maybe I don't know what love is
But it isn't this,
No, it isn't this
There's a path through the mountain
Fire on the sea
You were blinded by the flames in me",Blinded,2000
Tara MacLean,"Check your weapons at the door
You don't live here anyore
For a heart cannot repent
When it doesn't know it's spent

It's lifetime beating itself to death
There you are as still as stone
Stretching skin over bone
Well they say I've lost my will

But I'm just standing still
In a world that swallows cowards
For the crime of killing time
I'll be checking out the scenery

From as high as I can be
Come let faith be your garden
Always changing always still
Still breathing

There you are in my mind
Pale from living underground
Divided and divided
Until no one can be found

Nothing left to break down
I'll be checking out the scenery 
From as high as I can be
Come let faith be your garden

Always changing always still
Still breathing",Divided,2000
Tara MacLean,"Looks like something's coming
Looks like there's gonna be a storm
Looks like everyone's running
Looks like everyone is torn

Hands to blades
As daylight fades
Hold this shaking hand

Swimming from dry land
Swimming from dry land

Looks like everyone's broken
Looks like everyone's lost
Look at all the money we're making

We don't even see what it's cost
Hands to guns
As night time comes
Hold this shaking hand

Swimming from dry land
Swimming from dry land
Looks like war in the valley
Looks like war in the sky
Looks like war on the playground

First thing you learn is to lie
Hands to skies
For morning's rise
Why can't we start again

Tara MacLean,"If I could spend my life in awe
Of everything I ever saw
You'd be the one to lift me up
Higher than I am
If the sky came crashing down
You'd be the only star I found
Of all those scattered on the ground
I'd hold you in my hand
Higher
Higher
Higher than I am
So this is where I want to be
From now until eternity
A shepherd of the soul to me
And I will be the lamb
Higher

Invincible and golden

Tara MacLean,"It seems so far to go
It took so long to get here
Now I'm saying things I swore I'd never say
And I'm afraid again
I thought I had it in me
I used to be so sure
There I was stronger than ever
And here I am blaming the hurt
And if I fall, 
I will find a way back to my hands
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet again
Sweet little fighter
Sweet little scar
Sweet little fire
In my heart
It seems so easy now
Everything I dreamed about when I was a child
It looks like a good thing's here
And I think I'll stay for a while
And if I fall, I will find a way back to my hands
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet again
You came in screaming
And never stopped to listen to your one and only prayer
A place for you somewhere
Sweet little fighter
Sweet little scar
Sweet little fire
In my heart

And if I fall, 
I will find a way back to my hands
I'm the only one who can help me find my feet again
And if I fall,

Tara MacLean,"March around
Jericho loved the music and fell
Into your arms breathless
Heard a sound

Shut my eyes so tight
Heard the whisper of a storm coming
Oh, funny how
I spent this time waiting around

It's a lie
Everything you felt until now
Saw her dancing
The floor gave way

Opened its mouth
To say her name
Saw her falling
Cast away, cast away

She learned to fly one day
Oh, funny how
I spent this time on the ground
It's a lie

Everything you felt until now
Same place I've always been
I'm just lost on these roads again
Just as I got near the end

I keep falling in the holes you left in me
Oh, funny how
I spent this time lashing out
It's a lie

Everything you felt until now",Jericho,2000
Tara MacLean,"Have you been the broken one
Lying by the side of the road
Waiting for a good Samaritan
But no one has the time to ask,
Why are you bleeding?
And are you going far?
All the rest has left
This burden on my chest
Can you see the air is angry
Collapsing into nothing
For the soul has risen
But never has forgiven
So we stay and starve the heart to make a living
Have you seen the hungry ones
Digging in the sand
Once a sleeping passenger
Awoke into this tired land
Last chance to find out where I am
All the rest has left
This burden on my chest
Can you see the air is angry
Collapsing into nothing
For the soul has risen
But never has forgiven
So we stay and starve the heart to make a living",Passenger,2000
Tara MacLean,"Poor boy
No one on his arm
He's got tongue for talent

Hungry now and begging for my skin

I feel good all over
You said You said
There's never been another

Like me Like me
There's nobody like me
Baby it's a shame
That you can't say the same

You wrap me in
Take a look Take a lick mmm
It's the cure for anything
You want my deepest thoughts
Want to catch me hot
Well, everything's got their going rate

You said You said....",Poor Boy,2000
Tara MacLean,"Why did you look the other way
When I told you I had something to say
Can you imagine that
Can you imagine that it could be

Why do you scream at everything unfair
Tell me would you know the truth if it were there
If you would reach for me
If you would reach for me it could be

Something real
When your faith has left before the morning
Someone there softly breathing
A body to awaken

When the time comes to tear you
A cruel enemy
You could hold on to me
What is there that strips you of your pride

There is nothing left of you inside
If you would reach for me
If you would reach for me it could be
Something real...",Reach,2000
Tara MacLean,"Am I real, Am I true
Am I borrowed, Am I blue
Is it just the dust of leaving you
Settling
Am I fair, Am I strong
When I'm there do I belong
Is it only skin I touch when I reach for you
The leaves they fall
They go so far sometimes
Do I blame the wind
Or the tree that let it go
Or do I wave goodbye
Settling
Do I stay and do I fight
Is it wrong when nothing's right
Or is it just the closet light
I leave on for you
The leaves they fall 
They go so far sometimes
Do I blame the wind
Or the tree that let it go
Or do I wave goodbye
Settling
So many times I've needed you to be strong for me
But you bend beneath the slightest breeze
You have no leaves
No leaves
No leaves
Settling
Am I real, Am I true
Do I stay and do I fight
Is it just the closet light
Is it only skin I touch
Or is it just the dust

You in my life

That I belong with you
Because of you in my world

I have everything and now

About the times, I won't have to say

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'Neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed
In the wells of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets

Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.""

And your eye upon the rail

Til we reach that blissful shore
Where the angels wait to join us

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1999

Then you moved to L.A.

Where you used to play

So you hurry on back there
Even leave your pool and your car
Only to find you no longer belong
Fool, don't you know what you are

Yeah, hit the streets at midnight
Still dancing after dawn
But something seems to be missing
Just what are you running from

Do you like your love in the dark
Or laid out in the sun?
When you can't make up your mind
Don't you know what you've become

Bi-coastal, California's fine if you're pretty

You can always hear me singing
Oh, say can you see?
From the towers of Manhattan
To the hills of Beverly

All those boys on Broadway
When you can't make up your mind
You know you go either way

Dressed down in a winter coat
Did turn your ear
Talking backwards
Words written in a sullen tone
Short and sincere

As light hits Brigadoon
The stolen interlude
Torn and battered
Thin and shattered

Spotlight on Eloise
Softly in between
Sweetly haggard
Darkly lacquered

A caution blows
On the good things
And the fine things
Impatience flows
If you take time
It's a fine line

Throw stones in the wishing well
What's next, you can never tell
The outline of what we've lived through

Sleep well but when you die
I'll say it serves you right
The outline of what's around you
Won't haunt you anymore now

Dulcinea never settled for simple crap
But I had no choice
Careening madly
It wasn't long before the sun went down

And I lost your voice
Night falls on Araby
Spoken ineffably
And these ankles, so newfangled

Dipped in Erigeron
Basil tarragon
Lost in chatter
Caught in fetters

Silence slows
As the light falls
It's a tough call
And so I fold
Would it take me
To know me?

The whole population of London looked on
But for all his fine powers he's wishful like me
To be where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea

With beautiful shapes nature never designed
With lovely complexions all roses and cream

I think I'd die

But don't dare let those bastards
Carry you down

For spending the evening doing anything

Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your, booty, booty I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Look, don't approach me in a physical manner
'Cause the cannon I'm holding ain't a digital camera
And I don't care less about women and glamor
Or which one of you rappers is lifting his hammer

I'ma get loose like a pair of pajamas
I speak through those switches, spit like Obama
Trying to get rich without guns and the scanner
Thats A to the K with a fucking bandanna

Seize your empire, believe in no lies
Squeeze the deserties like Jesus inside her
Spit like the shit on my teeth is barbwire
Make your girl suck cock till her knees are on fire

That's it though, no more games
This one right here is gonna blow your brains
If you in the club you better hold your chain
Cause I'm bugging and I just might stomp your frame

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuff
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Find us in the back of the club
Squad deep and we all got snuffs
Hold the fort down, we ain't gonna budge
Bother nobody less you fucking with us

You can bring it to us however you want
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck
Especially the shorty with that big butt
Shake your booty, booty, I'm ready to fuck

Realizing livin' life for me, I done found another hustle

No matter how much we try to make peace, gun shots still rangin' (rangin')

'cause I done seen this type of thing before
Just hangin' out by the corner store
Stick up kids wit them guns galore
Layin' there, body down, stretched on the floor
I thought about it, man I'm way too fly
To have a fella robbin' me outside
That's why I keep that thing by my side
And down every blessin' while I'm screamin' out

I hate to say it but the people that surrounding me
Are way too shady
The only people I can trust is my family and my lady
All my dogs got guns
Ready for action
They wont betray me
Your the type to run
Or to hold my tongue
When it gets crazy
See I been through this type of thing before
Even had trouble with the law
On the couch when the smash my door
But they wont find the cash stashed under the floor
I never could understand the problem
I was the one to pull the shoulders drop
Couldnt live this type of life no more
So I had a part of me screamin out

Walkin on lean, while mind chain hangs
Drivin' somethin, pronounce mad strange
Never mad cool, 'cause I been through flames
Walk wit a limp, 'cause I been through games
Now shes a ho, 'cause she been through gangs
Beef wit ghats for a small chunk change
I'm rich now, that's more chunk change
The cops know slang
Man get the picture before u out the frame
Call me heart throb, 'cause I'm so fame
Couldn't come close if u sat in my Range

Owls go by and they give me the eye

And snuggles her head on my chest
We start in to pet and that's when I get

After I kinda straighten my tie
She has to borrow my comb
Once kiss then I continue again

She's afraid of the dark so I have to park
Outside of her door till it's light
She says if I try to kiss her she'll cry
I dry her tears all through the night

Right from her doorway we roam
Eats and then it's a pleasure again

Softly, her inner voice has learned to speak

Erhöre einer Jungfrau Flehen,
Aus diesem Felsen starr und wild

Ob Menschen noch so grausam sind.
O Jungfrau, sieh der Jungfrau Sorgen,
O Mutter, hör ein bittend Kind!

Ave Maria! Unbefleckt!
Wenn wir auf diesen Fels hinsinken
Zum Schlaf, und uns dein Schutz bedeckt
Wird weich der harte Fels uns dünken.

O Mutter, höre Kindes Flehen,
O Jungfrau, eine Jungfrau ruft!

Von deines Auges Huld verjagt,
Sie können hier nicht bei uns wohnen,

Der Jungfrau wolle hold dich neigen,
Dem Kind, das für den Vater fleht.

There is nowere that I can't look that isn't blurred 
Wirh all the righteousness and all the holy words...ooo

When the heart sinks lower 
And the healing slower 
Let us all come over

I need a hand for 
A thread of peace and a send of hope 
I will raise my eyes to see more 
Speak a truth and we shall know...ooo 

In the light of one choice 
We will sing with one voice

And all our clothes lay scattered on the floor 
Something's gotta give but no one's gonna leave 
Cause your body is just about to explode

Allow yourself some room
Let down your hair

Learned to take to lick what beats we takes
Dropped the in London funding low

Am I not right? Am I not right?

And wisdom, what's it know?

I have a knack for setting fires

From the things I hold close

Dressed down in a winter coat
Did turn your ear
Talking backwards
Words written in a sullen tone
Short and sincere

As light hits Brigadoon
The stolen interlude
Torn and battered
Thin and shattered

Spotlight on Eloise
Softly in between
Sweetly haggard
Darkly lacquered

A caution blows
On the good things
And the fine things
Impatience flows
If you take time
It's a fine line

Throw stones in the wishing well
What's next, you can never tell
The outline of what we've lived through

Sleep well but when you die
I'll say it serves you right
The outline of what's around you
Won't haunt you anymore now

Dulcinea never settled for simple crap
But I had no choice
Careening madly
It wasn't long before the sun went down

And I lost your voice
Night falls on Araby
Spoken ineffably
And these ankles, so newfangled

Dipped in Erigeron
Basil tarragon
Lost in chatter
Caught in fetters

Silence slows
As the light falls
It's a tough call
And so I fold
Would it take me
To know me?

There's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street

At least when I asked them that's what I was told
So I took me a hand at this digging for gold
But for all that I've found there I might as well be
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea

You remember old Peter O'Loughlin of course
He's here now at the head of the force
I saw him today (while I) was crossing the strand
He stopped the whole line with a wave of his hand

And as we stood talking the days that are gone
The whole population of London looked on
But for all his fine powers he's wishful like me
To be where the dark Mournes sweep down to the sea

There's beautiful girls here oh, never you mind
With beautiful shapes nature never designed
With lovely complexions all roses and cream
And O'Loughlin remarks with regards to the same

Of all these fine flowers you venture to sip
The color might all come away on your lip

Awaiting the trumpets

Then I can't stand waiting
While the lights are changing on me

Tell it to my own free will
If I lost this thorn from my side
I think I'd die

Albert Camus said, ""Living is anguish""
But don't dare let those bastards
Carry you down

And if this is so then I see no reason
For spending the evening doing anything
But going down town

And if only time will tell

And it's all action
You're tearing out your hairpiece
Too much stress and angst to bear

But you are two toned
And faking this emotion just to
Keep your ankles bare

You tell your heart to tell you

You're thinking 'bout your navel

Or do they want to dry my tears ?

Tarnation,"You wait, but the sun has told you lies, 
It sits laughing in an empty sky
There's one thing that I can't do without, 
But I can see through those sullen eyes that have turned away from me
It's wise to say that I don't care 
It's wise to say but I don't mean a word
I'm only asking why must I pretend to not see 
Through those sullen eyes that have turned away from me",Wait,1997
Tarnation,"There goes the other side,
And it goes on without us, it goes on.
And soon you'll know just how I feel
When you know, you'll understand.
There's the way you are your own
And what is lost and what is gone.
I hope you'll see some happiness
When you see, you'll understand.
Holding on to words that no one can hold on to,
Leave the words behind you.
I hope you'll see some happiness
And when you see, you'll understand.
You'll understand, you'll understand
And soon you'll know just how I feel.

Tarnation,"Which way can we go, only the moon casts a shadow.
When we look far below the path is sharp and narrow.
Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.
Are the stars very bright in the place where you are sleeping?
Can you hear this song and this song that I am keeping?
Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.
And this story it goes as we move along the shadows.
And this story it goes along the sharp and narrow.
Your thoughts and mine, are far away from this moment, from this moment.

Taro Hakase,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

Well look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away

Said goodbye and I closed the door

Here to take away the hurt

No more lonely days, baby, you're the best
Took away the stress, I can't take it now
It?s a brighter day since you came my way

Doctor, doctor can you make a house call?
Do what you do, make my heart fall
Felt like I never been loved at all
Never been kissed till you came along

Whatever?s wrong you can make it right
Shoulda found you first, wasted so much time
Gave me your heart, so I gave you mine
Told me everything will be alright

No more lonely days, baby, you're the best
Took away the stress, I can't take it now
It?s a brighter day since you came my way

So turn the a.c. up cause it's hot tonight!
And til the bright early morn' we be rockin' you all
Don't stop, the body rock!


'Cause I'm next to flex, and I'm technically advanced
To turn you on like cybersex, so in less than two sec's
I blind MC's like Thomas Dolby with the science that'll leave
They braincells fryin' slowly (fire!) so slowly I flow and
Express written consent, from the undergroundin' niggaz
Coast ii coast I represent cause gettin' bent, I do
But I'm doper than sherm plus the way I put it down
Could burn the perm off big worm, so peace and pipe this greeting
Of the last action hero that be freezin' rappers dead in they tracks
Like sub zero (zero), 'cause Rico ain't no joke
I eat your flows and yo' beat up rappers even feel my presence
When I'm home with my feet up

For what you skied up or treed up
Relax and pull a seat up, make your landlord turn the heat up
Got the opposition shook like tiger woods about to tee up
So niggaz no competition with the clear mos definition
Mc's screamin' now for years can't rhyme without they mom's permission
You just a young 'un comin' out, gettin' gassed to run your mouth
Wildin' on the runabout, baby pah you comin' out
Barkin' that you want a bout but son you know the come about
When mos def blow up and, you don't, nuttin'
Don't you know nuttin', my crew go huntin'
We keep it on the norm then we transform som'in
And while, we do it, you bounce to it
The cops want to stop the body rock but don't do it

Dy-no-might!!! like Jimmy J.J.
Swap down pen-ny, somewhere in L.A. (a)
Now we got to bond like voltron (tron)
Tash you the bomb, mos you the won ton (ton)
Q will pick the lead, I must drop on thee (thee)
A-be-s, I bust down, facility (ty)
T-are-a-see-t is the mc (cee)
It's the ll, inside the place to be (be)

Tash love...are you ready to rock the mic?
Q-tip...are you ready to rock the mic!
Mos def...are you ready to rock the mic?
We got the universal brothers that you got to like!
Now ain't nobody steppin' up when we got the mic
So turn your a.c. up cause it's hot tonight!
And til the bright early morn' we'll be rockin you all
Don't stop, the body rock!

All my people out in queens that know you're hot, you say
Don't stop, the body rock!
All my people out in Brooklyn and you know we're hot, say
Don't stop, the body rock!
Shaolin to l-I and you know we're fly, said

All the people on the greens and the land in between said
Don't stop, the body rock!

Tash,"Let's dive right in they ass quick fast an' in a hurry
Tell 'em what, tell 'em, what?

While you was fallin' off, CaTashTraphe was fallin' on
Ask the niggas in the streets, I hold it down for Californ'
Born to be the livest nigga, so you know it's soul survivin'
On the mic, I move the crowd like Big Pun stage divin'

I been around the world, pullin' girls
I pull 'em three at once, that's why I said it wit a plural
I'm like Earl the Pearl, straight pimp referral
Y'all niggas can't win, it's like you sword fightin' Zorro

Y'all bummy muthafuckers can't pull my card
I smack the fuck out y'all niggas while I'm tryin' to be hard
But like my nigga at the Grammy's, CaTash is for the children
My style be standin' out like gang writing on a building

I build an' destroy ya, destroy your employer
If y'all niggas ain't on Loud, they wasn't doin' nuttin' for ya
Pot lit the wick to the dynamite stick
So when it blow up in your grill, watch how ugly it get

We got L dot A dot, rock that spot
We here to take it all, fool, what the fuck you got?
You can't stop the plot 'coz this is how it's goin'
While you was fallin' off, CaTashTraphe was fallin' on

'Coz this the hip hop that Crips rock
The hip hop the Bloods rock
The hip hop the thugs rock
The hip hop the clubs rock
Don't hate on it, don't hate on it, don't hate on it

So while you waitin' an' debatin, concentratin' on hatin'
That nigga Tash be up the street on this deep dish dance
Blowin' indo out the window, clownin' niggas wit my ices
In a black SS, California on the license

My name is hella famous but it's time you learned about me
Even though I'm rockin' solo, I'ma always be a Alki
J, Tash an' Swift, we work the night shift
I'll be fucked up when I rap, so sometimes my eyes drift

I could push you off a cliff an' catch you right before you land
I'm the Million Dollar Man, you better get this while you can
I been in this fo' a minute, CaTash be winnin' pennants
Every time I grab the mic, it's like I'm speakin' to the Senate

But I'm not a politician, more like a rap magician
Presto chango, Bermuda Triangle
Pull a album outta hat, CaTashTraphe'll fire circuit
My style be comin' off too hard to interpret

We got L dot A dot, rock that spot
We here to take it all, fool, what the fuck you got?
You can't stop the plot 'coz this is how it's goin'
While you was fallin' off, CaTashTraphe was fallin' on

'Coz this the hip hop that Crips rock
The hip hop the Bloods rock
The hip hop the thugs rock
The hip hop the clubs rock
Don't hate on it, don't hate on it, don't hate on it

So while I smack you wit the force to knock your ship off course
If this funk don't move your wife, you better file for divorce
'Coz that bitch you treat to eat, got two left feet
I seen y'all dancin' 'cross the street an' y'all was both off beat

So I'ma end it wit a blaa an' jet immediately after
Can't kick wit y'all niggas, y'all might be the Gay Rapper
CaTash, the lion trapper, number one for big consumptions
In the function in conjunction wit my nigga on production

You better recognize, nigga, we on the same boat
We be both be gettin' loc'd when we off that smoky smoke
Hit you wit the okey-doke, you better do the Hokey Poke
An' turn yourself around before I gotta choke some folks

I never go for broke, I break it down for major wage
I be rappin' wit a gauge, Likwit Crew'll flip your page
Confusin' as amazed, comin' at you like a storm
While you was fallin' off, CaTashTraphe was fallin' on
An' on an' on an' on an' on an' on

",Fallin' On,1999
Tash,"[Tash]
Mm.. sing that shit for daddy baby
Pump this motherfucker up.. richochet, ricochet
RICHOCHET (ricochet, ricochet)
RICHOCHET (yo homies, one two yo)

Mmm..
My style is too cold for words, it's like a bullet gone stray
Ease off, I'm bout to speak and hit the wall and ricochet
I rock the Cali way (for sure) I'm only in it to score
Niggaz say I'm owed one, but it's more like four
Hardcore entrepreneur, strainin like a champ
Rollin out in sixty-three's, that hop without a ramp
Young Tash Vamp'll kick your door in while you're snorin;
now where's that salt you was pourin?
I send the bullet soarin, yo ayy, let you slide?  No way
If you a -- ""Why do niggaz shoot?"" -- (""Alright, okay"" - Mos Def)
I gotta buck you down for that shit you was poppin
Now look how rotten the whole situation's gotten
Tash showed you love you shoulda showed me some back
If they catch me they gon' stretch me like Geronimo Pratt
Cause I gotta lay you flat no matter what you say
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..
""Called the cops, said they heard mad shots"" -> Notorious B.I.G.

[Tash]
I tried to warn you killer, my rap style'll have you sprung
like a girl gave you head with a earring in her tongue
Since Tash come from less than zero, my splurgin's urgent
My mouth so foul, you couldn't wash it with detergent
My Likwit niggaz swervin, mergin, like a rally
Rearrangin niggaz grills like the '99 Denali
	Where the fuck we at Cali?  --  You motherfuckin right!
I want to see some action, burn somethin or fight
cause see it's Tash night tonight, it's Tash night tomorrow
I'm lookin for the hoes that got some sex I could borrow
I'll gladly pay you back next Wednesday the 3rd
(Why you laughin at me baby?)  That's my motherfuckin word
(word word word) Then it's words for nerds
Tryin to rap as fly as Tash is totally absurd
So everybody duck or catch the A.K. spray
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

	Richochet..

Newsflash on the screen, what the fuck does this mean?
It say, ""Tash is takin over the world, behind the scenes
Just drinkin beers spacin, Likwit sweeps the nation
But leave that man alone, cause you know his reptuation""
Brutalize the wicked world, I pump one verse of curse
to beat you down, beat you up, then take your girl or vice versa
You rap too commercial, you just cheat to compete
I done paid a gang of dues, I even kept the receipts
So you owe me homey, these corny niggaz outsold me
So write that blank check to Tash, the one and only
The only man standin when it's time for gunplay
Homey thought he got away til he caught the ricochet

Tash,"Smoke this blunt
Yo, everybody grab a seat, welcome to Smoke Fest '99
I'm glad you all could make it
As you can see admission was free this Smoke Fest this year
All the weed you see is free, but the blunts cost sixty bucks baby (Sixty bucks?)

CaTashTraphe, I shoot it through, dipped in twenty-four karats
If why'all niggas don't feel me, then I blame it on your parents
'Cause Tash fuck it up, don't twist it up wit luck
My style is cold like I bought it off the icecream truck
Listen here, Tash be crashin niggas wit my beer
Tash be partied down as fuck swingin' off the chandelier
Tash be here, Tash be there
Tash be everywhere it's poppin'
I'm here to let you know fuckin' wit me's not an option
'cause Tash is my name, Tash'll start it wit a bang
Tash'll end it wit a, that's not the same thing
Tash'll split your frame, Tash swings like gold chains
I be rollin' wit King T, and we all in the same game
But enough about CaTash, let's talk about some skrill
You know it's bout to pop if Likwit Crew is on the bill
You can ask my nigga Phil how real this is, the weed
Smoke Fest '99 burn something to the beat

Yeah yeah yeah
I was lookin' to get my skull blowed up like Kid Dynamtie
The time is right
Be ridin' the track so fiercely that it seems I'm already high tonight
But I'm not though I'm just on them Black & Mild's
And people thinkin' I'm the wild one 'cause I be flipping
And rippin' the track and verbally attacking on yo' style for fun
Higher soul but to please myself I gotta be composing that fly shit
And you notifying Alkaholiks daily
So punk mufucker you better dub bitch
What do you need boy, rap and some my boys are still in the trap
I mean the dope spot, but the slanging got my snapping like the rope hot
I can be the player you want to bust wit 
Or nigga you don't even want to go fuck wit
Or nup with, you suck dick, so why y'all up on my nuts quick
I hold the microphone and that's wit a vice grip
Really tightly, and I'm keepin' the words crystal clear
So you gon' correct when you try to bite thee
Very nicely, Aquemini my nigga, not a Pisces
But I likely, gon' fetch a sack of that green stuff
While I write G, yeah yeah right

Yeah, check this out yeah
Hard life, now picture this
A nigga in jail, rapping while his folk in the next cell
Tapping wit some spoons, we do rank the boom boom
Fresh off a planet wit sand dunes and maroon moons
Soaking wet wounds, titty tangling tunes
Musty under arms, soul shlong charm
Bump off in the drums, rhythm on the one
Stankonious under smelling where I'm coming from son
The day you bone is when you start to die
The time in between us will mean the most, I toast my high
See shit gets so bad, I know it make you want to cry
But suck it up, buck it up, go ahead and do your thing
For I'm already high

Yo yo yo
Whenever I'm writing, you can call me Philly Titan
Reciting to you an interview like Phil Donahue
Me and my crew, translate Los Angeles
Scandalous, like Watergate
Phil on the break, Phil on the break
Fill in the blank, it feels bad like getting shanked
File up your taxes, I'm writing exact on my axis
From my head down to my Air Max's
Phil waxes and relaxs
Phil also fills up mental food up in your deadly baskets
My name is Jason when I fill out my application
To the nation, niggas is gonna get in filled what they facin'
Feel the ration, feel the adrenaline
I penetrate like penicillin, niggas be like ""Phil is illin!""
Phil is willin and ready
Phil is raw like Eddie
Phil be cuttin up like machetes and confetti
Deadly, feel the pain when I walk through the rain
Niggas be like ""He saying Phil again, Phil again, Phil again""

Hey hey hey
Peace rap world, I'd like to make a special announcement right about now
We have a special guest that just stepped in the house
You know this man, he the smokiest cat in rap music
He goes by the name of the Doctor Greenthumb, smoke 'em out

Now I be, rolling and smoking
And holding the golden sack
When my lungs be getting swollen, hitting the bong folding
For chronic ironic, growing the hydroponic
We got it, robotic hits you on melodic tricks of sonic
Smoke Fest, expanding your chest
Buddah bless best, for you to step back 'cause your lyrics are like cess weed
Yes indeed, the session you need to retrieve it
It's ten niggas in a circle smoking a spliff, believe it
Retrieve it, over the counter, can you conceive it
I give you Doctor Greenthumb digits, but don't repeat it
The Brew Crew and the Buddah Masters together
Getting you higher and fucking you up that much faster
Six sacks, blunt leafs, pipes and bong-bowls
All be getting smoked at the Buddah head shows
Excuse me if it seems too complicated
The herb I hold is platinum while yours is nickel plated
Let me mash out, I'm breakin' the stash out, the hash out
I'm rollin' to the studio to smoke my nigga Tash out
Wit that Doctor Greenthumb shit, know what I mean?",Smokefest 1999,1999
Tash,"Uh-huh, ahh
I feel like it's time for a new nigga
And I feel like that nigga should be me
Hello boys and girls!
My name is CaTASHtrophe
Peep my slide out

Check it out it goes SLIDE, SLIDE, SLIPPEDY SLIDE
I'm here to give y'all niggaz a NEW dick to ride
Cause Tash is like the flyest nigga standin on the planet
I pimped the beat so tough I had to slap it back-handed
A single-handed, thought that's how I planned it
I didn't leave my group it's just time we all expanded
Tash made an atom bomb, disguised it as my solo
Now all the D.C. niggaz bump my shit instead of go-go
Whattup loco?  It's Tash on the micro
Xzibit hold it down with the rifle, what?
Standin on the Eiffel droppin pennies, cause Tash ain't friendly
They tried to pay to shut me up, but they knot too skinny
And, gimme mines, that's my ninety-eight motto
Can't walk around the city lookin rahlo
So if y'all niggaz follow I lead, let's smoke this weed
Put away your guns punk so we can ALL get keyed

""Who's the man"" (sample echoes) ""My man T-A-S-H"" -> Mos Def (repeat 3X)
""With that West coast rhymin""	
""My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great"" -> Mos Def

So to the pimps players hustlers high rollers dead pres folders
Better hold on to your funds, while this Alkie mic control it
Takin over, CaTASHtrophe he rollin like a boulder
Like Master P told ya, you a soldier; I'm posted
like a vulture on a branch on a hunt for grands
My circumstance, I went from snow ball to avalanche
And now Tash is the nigga that all the hoes chose
My style is hella flashy like Busta Rhymes clothes
I'm All-Pro, the top selection for elections
Sneaking guns on the plane with no detection
With no recollection, of how the fuck I got this deal
But now I got the motherfucker so it's on for real!

""Who's the man"" (sample echoes) ""My man T-A-S-H"" -> Mos Def (repeat 3X)
""With that West coast rhymin""	
""My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great"" -> Mos Def

My style is odd, like a gift from God
That's why I hold more microphones than Ahmad Rashad
But it's time you know my name so tell the DJ to loop it
Grab a pad and pen, write it down if you stupid!
I break it down for major weighter, CaTASH'll fade ya
You just a waiter I'm a caped crusader
But I didn't come to save ya all I came to do is chill
Scoop y'all niggaz hoes and take some 40's to the grill
I pops a pill, but all it was was Golden Seals
No need to go to Blueberry Hill, to get y'all thrills
Just fly directly over the Bermuda Triangle
Where I'm runnin rappers over in a Ninety-Eight Durango, like that

""Who's the man"" (sample echoes) ""My man T-A-S-H"" -> Mos Def (repeat 3X)
""With that West coast rhymin""	
""My man T-A-S-H with styles glory great"" -> Mos Def",Bermuda Triangle,1999
Tash,"[tash] yo, ro'gram where you at homey?

[j-ro]
At nighttime I'm on the prowl, and I'm livin foul like blackula
Got a microphone made out of chrome shaped like a spatula
Cause I'm flippin rhymes at three times the speed of lightning
You dare to compare to the golden bear it's kind of frightening
You can meditate, til you levitate, but never rate
Higher than a seven/eight, yeah I had to set em straight
I know you feelin these, I ramsack yo' facilities
I'm ill at ease, with these mc's, who ain't got no abilities
(get at me) I make mc's, run out like batteries
I roll the bleeze and then I blow like cannonball adderly

You try to get with likwit but yo' brew ain't cold enough
Cold enough
You try to get with likwit but yo' brew ain't cold enough
Cold enough

[tash]
Ahhhh, y'all ain't even gotta clue what my clique gon' do
Fast money, fast cars, niggaz sleep until two
My likwit niggaz roundezous, we cop kung-fus and split em
When ""the freaks come out at night"" catash be right wit em
Stone-faced, but only when I'm loaded wit funs
Big guns, I'll make you do the nestea plunge
I only came to have some fun but I get caught up in the rapture
I don't even write lyrics no more, I manufacture
Cold shit, you know that old gold shit, that raw shit
That drunken alkahol shit that make you say, ""ahhh shit!""
Them motherfuckers is too slick for michael
We be creepin up on you like police on bikes

It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight
It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it..

[e-swift]
Me and my niggaz out lookin for a party to crash
Mashed out to long beach but we stop for some gas
I pull in first, catash pulled in last
J-ro steady rollin blunts of the moroccan hash

[tash]
Since it's all about the cash, we ? ? on that smash
Hit up four-five and carson, scoop xzibit and brad
The sounds beatin so hard it's vibratin my glass
Blast, plus we drivin way too fast

[e-swift]
Slow down, you can't crash the whip
Slow down and hit a dip
Cause I paid a lot of money for this ? ? kit
We runnin late for a show, we got this money to get
The nightlife'll have you caught up in all types of shit

[tash]
Like what?
Like this, like that, like that like this
I drink st. ide's, I don't be fuckin with crist'
Cause we the type of clique that need to drink somethin stronger
When tha liks is in the house, the party last longer

[e-swift]
I dedicate this song to, bitches and thugs
Who party down at the club and show tha liks love
Even with creatine, injected in your spleen
You couldn't compete with my all-star likwit team

[tash]
Cause tha liks reign supreme of all hip-hop scenes
We heard about your bougie party, bumrushed it in jeans
And still pulled the hoes most likely to succeed
Where that nigga j-ro? -- most likely smokin weed

It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight
It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight

[j-ro]
Yo, check it out (uh-huh)
Turn up the level more so I can hear the shit forever more
I came out of nowhere, like predator
That's a metaphor, if you rap-impaired, you might say what happened there
While the be-boys clap and cheer, bring that beat back in here!
Nighttime is the right time to write rhymes
Why you wanna bite mine? I blow you away like white lines
I think you better let it go, get yo' ass off my pedestal
Before you need attention, and it's gonna be medical
If rap was basketball I'd have the earl the pearl handles
I drink everything but jack daniels
Rap scandals, don't interest me, I don't get dressy
Tha liks rock the shows but leave the whole crowd messy

It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right
My likwit niggaz keep it -- tight, tight
Rowdy niggaz wanna -- fight, fight
It's the middle of the -- hype, night
All the ladies looking -- right, right

Pull out my pistol, and put it to his chin

You's a b****, and that's all you'll be
An' I don't give a f*** to let a n**** hear it from me
You got calibers, I got cali-co

Treats me the same
Treats you the same
Ohh, treats me the same
Treats you the same
Ohh, nobody
Ohh, nobody

[tash]
You know what? it's hella lonely at the top when you rich without a girl
It's me against the world, but that's how my world twirl
So let that shit spin cause I'ma play it to the end
Sometime you gotta make decisions: your woman or your friends?
My friends come first
My females is secondary
The last girl I had was this bad ass secretary
Her name was yvonne - that bitch thought she was the bomb
But I knew it wouldn't work, I never took her home to moms
You know havin a ball not givin my all
Holdin hands down the hall at the crenshaw mall
She used to look at me and saw no flaws at all
We was close - she walked around my house in her draws
But after all the good times you know comes the rain
I had to cut that bitch off for some shit I can't explain
I blamed it on her trip and she blamed it on my fame
I got cupid lookin stupid
But that's a part of the game

[carl thomas]
Ohh the game owes nothin to nobody
So I'm tellin you this from the start
If you find you've been deceived by another
Then you better just trust in your heart

[tash]
So all the ladies wave your hands if you down wit your man
I know them two kids you got wasn't part of the plan
What this world is a twist; if it ain't that it's this
I like the kinda girl that tatoo niggaz names on they wrist
Tash on your tit
That's the kinda girl I need
After work, feeds her seeds then smokes a little weed
Low key; that's how my girl gon' be
But I ain't found her yet and she ain't found me
So I'm lookin
For all the sexy hoes that ain't tooken
Carl put me down with this bad broad from brooklyn
But all I do is hit - no spark, no flame
I got cupid lookin stupid
But that's a part of the game

Chorus

[tash]
I know this love song I'm writin ain't flashin your excitement
But when you least expect it love will strike you like some lightning
That's why I'm here to warn ya
These girls in california, they'll take you to the cleaners
If you let 'em put it on ya (put what? )
You know the little wifey deluxe
That'll have your friends and family rentin a tux
That's why you gotta keep it p.i.
So even if your buck stop
You got the type of girl that'll walk you to the bus stop
True love-
That's kinda hard to find when you rhyme
I'm 27 now and it's 1999
But I'ma find mine; matter fact, what's yo name?
-trust in yo heart- but that's a part of the game

Tash,"Ya know we peepin' y'all
Slow-motion-style
Pacific Ocean-style (Wh-what?)

[Verse one]
I'm in a rowdy-ass club
There's hella-bitches all around me
This girl walks up
She says she's glad that she found me
I told her she was trippin' 'cause the girl ain't even know me
Then she told me
She want to introduce me to her homies
I said ""Well, baby girl, go get your kemo sabes""
""I'll get my Liquid niggas""
""We'll meet you in the lobby""
She walked wit' a smile I ain't seened in a while
So we mobbed through the crowd--
Killer-Cal-style
Walkin' wit' a limp, 'cause see, we pimp to perfection
For us to catch a date don't take the Love Connection
Fuck Chuck Woolery
You want a date for surely
All it take is fine jewelry
A wink and a drink and what the fuck you think?
I mack a baby doll down, she in a long black mink
We straight standin' in the lobby straight face-to-face
Then she said ""Cut the chase""
""Let's bounce to my place""

[Chorus]
'Cause ladies
We wait for nightfall
You thinkin' that we sleepin' but we peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, baby doll
You can't walk before you crawl

[Verse two]
Still close to gettin' toasted by the be	-a-are
About to bounce wit' these bitches 'cause they don't live far
Niggas all up in my grill, lookin' hella-bizarre
I poured my drink on the ground for my dead homey Par (Rest in peace)
Grabbed my car keys
My doctah function
Burnt a little rubber
Made my outroduction
Pumpkin' and her friends pushed the two-door Benz
I pushed the E420 so we looked like twins
Swervin' through the night
Everything is right
Swift rolled a blunt, but he can't find a light
Just when we 'bout to blaze it up and get high
I peeped the one-time out the corner of my eye

[Chorus]
'Cause one-time
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin'
But they peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, killer-cops
You can't walk before you crawl

One-time
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin' but they peepin' all o' y'all
want to throw a nigga up against the wall
But slow down, killer-cop
You can't walk before you crawl

[Verse three]
I rolled past the cops
I'm on my cell phone blown
Doin' 60 miles-a-hour in a 35 zone
Just when I thought it was about to be on
The girl pulled into the gate of a million-dollar home
Fly landscape and cavi' decorations
The living room was bigger than the Club United Nations
Place was to the point I kicked my shoes off the secko
30 percenters--
When I talked it made a echo
Rolled up the fat perfecto
They want to skinny dip but I ain't want to get wet though
So...
Let's go
That's what she told Tash
She led me to her room, lookin' like Stacey Gash
Baby got it pumpin'
Can't help but to feel it
Then she told me that she married to a killer drug dealer
Should I:  a) stay
Or:  b) bounce immediately

[Chorus]
'Cause haters
They wait for nightfall
We thinkin' that they sleepin' but they peepin' all o' y'all
Even all o' y'all up against the wall
But slow down, baby pa'
You can't walk before you crawl

Can't do it
Ya can't do it
Ya can't walk before ya crawl

Tash,"I get drunk and I stumble to the mic
Stay drunk all week, I'm at my peak like pike
I'm never at my peak, I'm killin' fifth after fifth
I drink mo' 40's than Tash and E-Swift

Uh, huh, I drink more than both of y'all
I hold more liquor than a bank on Crenshaw
And Tash you can't drink brew, you know you the nigga who
Be all on yo' nads after just a swig or two

Nigga you trippin', must be that Zima you was sippin'
Yo' accountant couldn't count how many bottles I be grippin'
And flip it in the trash 'cause I downed 'em with ease
While you on yo' knees
(About to pass somebody yo' keys)

I even had to pay the taxi the last time you asked me
You start off on yo' feet but always wind up on yo' back G
Bro you should know you can't drink with Rico
While you down yo' shit slow, I'm on my ninth Cuervo

Aiyyo at every single show, you be layin' on the flo'
Swearin' up and down, you neva' gonna drink no mo'
But I get to' up, from the flo' up, and never throw up
One little wine cooler and you wanna beat yo' hoe up

I never call it quits, I don't know my own limit
This Alkaholiks shit is for real, it ain't a gimmick
You might fuck around and catch a liver disease
Fuckin' with these Likwit MC's, hip hop drunkies

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Curvoiseir, coke and rum
Alize and one five one
Heineken, Hennesey
Juice and gin, brass monkey

Yo, yo, I pledge allegiance to the bottle, the cup and the can
In front of the bar, that's where I stand
And to the alcohol for which I fall
And the cold porcelain in the bathroom stall

One drunk nation under God inebriated
With liberty and justice to anyone who's faded
Drink drink drunk until I can't hack it
Until the little man fall off the horse on my polo jacket

When I get drunk once again
I spent all my yen on ten bottles of gin
Likwit 'til I'm stiff, damn I love this riff
The Ro gotta go, I pass the mic to E-Swift

I drink a lot of beers, my life's a black version of 'Cheers'
Everyday sit at the bar and take shots with my peers
I've been doin' this for years, ain't no amateurs here
I've been drinkin' 40's longer than most niggaz careers

I've got the bitches grinnin' while the whole world is spinnin'
You suffer from double vision and I'm just beginnin'
You always pass out, wake up and don't remember me
You could write a book with all your hangover remedies

I thought you knew, I've been drinkin' since high school
While I down this Olde English, you sippin' your O'Douls
I'm makin' beer runs at ten minutes to two
While you still sippin' on your first motherfuckin' brew

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Curvoiseir, coke and rum
Alize and one five one
Heineken, Hennesey
Juice and gin, brass monkey

A lot of niggaz can't drink, but hoes is even worse
They order three drinks but can't finish the first
I see 'em reachin' in they purse about to roll that sack of weed
Knowin' that's the combination that they really don't need

'Cause girls take a sip, get fucked up quick
Pass out, wake up
(What's this?)
It's a dick
Baby girl, you lookin' sick, you lookin' plastered like a poster
You was talkin' all that shit, now you need some Alka-Seltzer

You wobblin', weeblin', fuckin' up your evenin'
That smoke that you breathin' got that ass on spin
While yo' homegirls is like
(Where the fuck you been?)
In the girl's bathroom, fucked up since ten

Yeah, I seen her, she thought she was a graceful ballerina
Now that ass is too drunk to drive herself to the marina
So she comin' home with me because, I don't give a fuck
Might fuck an ugly bitch, but only when I'm drunk

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' drink on? Whatcha wanna do?
Don't you think it's 'bout time
To get yo' fade on with the Likwit crew?

I'm still the same nigga, light skinded, curly afro
What's up though? I'm still the same nigga, a superfreak

So everytime we puff it's twenty dollars out the window
But what is friends fo'?  We gonna blow that dough regardless
My niggas live the life, and they ain't even rap artists
Rap money, we get that shit and blow it

So this gon' be the night..

While you trippin off yo' car, yo' girls is trippin off ours
If we want, what you got, nigga reach for the stars
This is it y'all, everybody ride wit us
I devised a masterplan to take out the counterfitters
I'ma start with the west coast, show em how we rock it
Keep it pumpin through the summer, stuff them chips up in my pocket
Super-saki gin'll keep my style all in your grill
Every where you turn catash last seen in baldwin hills
On the phone makin deals, for x amount of scrill
Nine-nines is mine, it's time to recognize the real
Then I swing it through the bay where all the homies wanna blaze
Rap life, the goin craze, smoke an ounce in two days
When phase one complete it's fifty states to invade
Catch a flight to a-t-l, link up with rico wade
Outkast, goodie mob, bangin out the stereo
Smokefest, nine-nine, peep the whole scenario
Tash rock material to make your girl jump up
Never touch the mic until the soundman pump the ? ? up
Yo yo, roll that dub up, three 6'll ""tear da club up""
There's no way to describe how tash'll fuck yo' mug up

Chorus: lv

Movin around from coast to coast, money ain't no joke
We're havin it our way (all day everyday) everyday (all day everyday)
Land my feet on solid ground, no time to fuck around
We're doin it our way.. ooooooh yeahhh

[tash]
Tash rules everything around you, bread, get the money
I gotta keep my whole team fed
Cause like pmd said, we gotta take it to length
Cause if you hang with nine broke friends, you're bound to be the 10th
So on the strength of makin dollars, tash'll touch any scene
Catch a flight to new york city, cause all money is green
Let em see supreme west coast in up-close
And if there's any beef I'll roast and crack you with a golden molson
Bottle, the mass will throttle, what a rollo
Tash come in peace but y'all won't let the beef die though
I lost my black movado in that bullshit fight
I got drunk and laughed about it up in washington heights
With my homeboy dee (what) my homeboy ooze (uhh)
I spent the night in jail off that hennesey and juice
Cause new york city that's a wild ass town
That's why guiliani ass tryin to lock shit down, right now

Tell em l..
So lights, camera, action -- you're on
Get it ricky ric' -- what's wrong? my weed gone!
Who stole it? -- I don't know, y'all motherfuckers tell me
I broke it up and left the room to get a light from lv
I came back and like poof! everybody's lookin boggled
It only took a sec to get rollo'ed, by chicago
But everybody know at a chi-town show
They like to keep it, g-h-e-t-t-o
This time I let it go, but next time I'll have to blast ya
Cause tash be checkin shows from alaska to nebraska
So if somebody ask ya - who the tightest on this?
Tell them niggaz big tash, and his homies tha liks

Love my nigga Com Sense when he bang dents all up in they wallets

One false move, and we gon' beat you like you stole something

Yo these style I kick should be called ? rap
Drawing the pussy out the nigga after my prize, cause I want it
They stomach what I throw, they know I'm right for they diet
They librarian flow keeps the party real quiet 
The love I lost outweighs the rhymes I gain
But the fact that I spit 'em makes me cherish the name
So pass the mic so I can put in my share
I rip it from home to L.A.
With connecting flights to rip it elsewhere

Yeah, we flat out classic, separate the real from the plastic
And I gotta say no names
Play no games, hit the switches, crack the frame
Show no shame or fuck it all up, take the blame
Brand name fresh out the box type hustle
Manpower success is mind over muscle
Grind til the wheels fall off, accept the loss
I never been soft, whatever the cost, addicted to floss
Nailed to the cross it's time to return
My only concern is making sure that Hollywood burn,
Hollywood burn, burn to the ground, trick-ass niggas
Is all up in the game and don't deserve to be down

Niggaz gettin' knocked out is part of my show
Let 'em know who they fuckin' with yo, a rhyme wrangler
Tri-angular push-up the hillside strangler
Dangle a, nigga by the ankle off the balcony
Now let his punk ass go, look out below (Below)
It's a tale of two cities, come out when the sun go down
We officially not fuckin' around
Stuck in the ground, fitted with a suit in a pine box

So heatbox all day in a nigga face
And all you bitches see the dick that you shoulda' ate

Got the spot blown, boom Oklahoma
Watch the aroma, catch those who love me
My underground dirty cats on dune buggies
I be the type to take your watch and flaunt it
Kidnap T. Lewis and Jimmy Jam on it
Yo, I bang a nigga head till his neck pop
Do a KRS-One to a ""Black Cop""
X and E's, out for cream
Get the money, while you stay broker than Al Bundy
Uh, give it to y'all, in ""Any Given Sunday""
With J. Foxx name the spot, make it hot

I leave you stiffer than that fool on my basketball trophies
I'm in the room with 10 G's, countin' ten G's
Cause we need a bag of weed (Can you smell it)
Now we need ten dimes, to blow on deez like wind chimes
Time to close the blinds cause you all in mines
I bought a bottle for the session, and did not share it
Drink so much Captain Mo' all I need is a parrot
You took the Alkaholik challenge, and lost your balance
You underground, we under water drinkin' liquid by the gallons

Slurred words, double vision, brain bustin', head rushin'
Since I'm too drunk to walk, I rock a party on crutches
And still rush the roughest MC who want to get it
Forget it, it's Likwit, Tha Liks and, Xzibit
Ca-Tash on the blast the final piece to the puzzle
I slap bitches on the ass I slap tits up out the muzzle
I shuffle with the microphone, bang rhymes consistent
You wack and I'm Ca-Tash and that's the motherfuckin' difference
For instance, ""21 and Over"" set your clocks back
(Tick tock tick tock) Still standin' where the rocks at
Two-thousand-one, we still young guns that's Restless

Behold, the look on my face stone cold
With a rare cowboy style that never grow old

Time for me and mine, but for any kind I can't care
Stormy weather rain liquid 
Defari con Tony Toca, Tash, and Xzibit

Break necks bounce with it when I spit it
Knockin this jam is a form of calastenics
Let it knock when you mashin down the block
Rims spank with the car wash

Watch the bitches stop
An look, always stay five steps ahead
Hard at work, while you tricks lay in bed
Dead to the world but ?Hayru? he be the sun

Run from one time I rather dump an AK

Impact is all of the sudden, vehicular homicide
But I ain't stoppin for nothin
Me and my cousin, strong buzzin, and playin a dozen
Pushin and shovin', leads to gettin sucked and rolled up
Like a nigga with a mask and a gun, hold up
Rappers act like they ain't gon' die for small fry
Try to reply, don't touch what you ain't gon' buy
I ain't gon' lie, motherfucker love to get high
Barely get by with scraps and pennies
Now we winnin Grammy's and Emmy's
And party with the henni and remi

Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)

To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right

And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep

Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride

Yeah, that's my down bitch
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan

On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens

Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs

Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style

Got a rock, rocket in my pocket
For to knock ya head right out the socket
Turn teardrops to smile, been graced this spare child
Spray a gallon of mace in your face, burn off your 'brows
No phone home, you dribbling, we stone ya sibling
Get my bloods from Tilden, to burn your building
Poison tip dagger sword, chop through your collar bone
No, you don't got a fucking chance to holler home
Nice dream, your sliced spleen, cut through your ice bling

The other's a ape, he turn a rainbow straight
Get you trapped in the jungle now you can't escape
War it is, that's the biz, glock pop, plops the feds
Split your wig, crack your whip, smack your wiz, blast your 'quip

And bricks, munch, clothes and kicks, you know it's

It was based on the rules that my mother and father taught me
Press the iron when it's hot

And find my sourness so very hard to define
Got my soul all twisted, all tangled in a noose

""Hell, what's the use?""
I keep skipping stones like a child with broken bones
And my mother always told me
""You gotta leave your bags at the door""

But I didn't wanna talk it through
Say things I don't really care about
No, I didn't wanna be next to you

Baby girl, why don't we slow it down?
We've been killing each other for months now
Baby girl, why don't we slow this down?
And don't go walking away from me right now
Don't go walking away

Call it lady marmalade, yellow mellow

Can you tell me, what is that song?

I am real
Do you seem satisfied within yourself?
Still wish sometimes in my life where I have to go to extremes
I didn't know what to do
I couldn't see the beautiful world
That was in front of you
And I was back and forth forgiveness, but I couldn't forgive myself
And I was screaming out for help

And where it stops nobody really knows
And I throw my hands up, I surrender to the night
Kissed the boy away, I know I never wanna see your face again
But I was thinking about, thinking about, thinking about a dude that's
Trying to find myself I emerge from up all this
Six months gone I don't know where the time has gone
But I tell my mother, do you think she'll be proud?
I tell my father put two feet on the ground
'Cause I was only screaming out for help

It was murder to the mind
It was blood on my hands

Tonight?
Oh yeah, you and your three friends can come play with me 
Tonight, and you and your three friends can come pay with 
Tonight, you know what I'm sayin?
Big Syke, you know what I'm talkin' about.
Erotic, exotic, and a little psychotic.

Picture a room where a con lives, it's dark inside
Newspaper clippins on the wall, from vics that died
Blood everywhere, you can tell the psycho went through
He had darts in their faces up to number fifty two
Psycho Uh, stalkin niggas, butcher knives stays handy
He would sit inside the park, and laugh and give kids candy
They say he was weird, but the bodies he killed
He always scratched off the names of the people he killed
Real slow, Pysch torture style, pass me the scissors
And cut off microscopic pieces like a mirror
Terror screams, let me know the spinal was crumbled
By the gestures they made and the words that they mumbled
Maybe I can slice a throat when I'm ready
It takes practice, training to keep a nail gun steady
You should yell when it clicks, 'cause blood finna seep
And bring a hundred thousand mourners and children to weep

[Chorus: x8]
Erotic and exotic
And a little psychotic

Graveyards in my slaughter house 
Mutilation and bacteria to straight cats ?
You can bet that yours is full of healthy humans and mice
Kinda lookin' like a fleshy big pot fulla rice
Twenty people dead, strangled, uh that's my hobby
When I die you think I'm dead, but I really switched bodies
I'm standing there, watchin', they put him in the ground
Blow a sweet when it's over, I'll go kill downtown
Cops don't understand, they thought he was bluffin'
They say the officer went crazy when he murdered a dozen
Other cops and didn't ? 'cause life ain't fair
They put his body in the chair, but his mind wasn't there
Soul snatcher, got cha, hit him with a heavy right
Hold him, hug him, hit him with a heavy pipe
Burn him, scorch him, you can bet the people saw it
Leave him there for thirty minutes, you'll see the birds ?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed that the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

These folks is killing for less money than they can borrow
Create and you will sorrow for families left feeling hollow
Then the son of a gun victim fleshing out his anger
Coloring cartoons of strangers who getting strangled
And the daughter let a stranger, the school call him a counselor
Do some dirty things, but he promise that he would counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low down dealer that she always get her pills from
And the son is getting older, streets is making him colder
But his momma's out cold, cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister's 15, but you probably think that she grown up
'Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching
McDonalds selling poison, got people working for cheap an
The military, drug's, or prison only way to eat, man
It's cold in the streets, let the track bring the heat in

We live in a cold, cold world [x4]

This world's cold like no clothes and snow blown
Like when the devil take the breath out of a baby's nose
And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of stripping, she need hope up in my words, man
She pull up to the mall where she valet her little Mercedes
Wishing she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's accepting her plight, she's a lady of the night.
And she saw 'em in the park with his daughter, they holding hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance,
One woman gets the man, the other woman gets the dance.

It's a cold world, real cold world
Jermaine called that thing, man where is we going turn
A lot of people thinking I'm on an hopeless endeavor, nah
I know someone who can change the weather forever, ever

Havoc is wreaking through all my limbs.
My chief is gone; he won't come again

Over the fog and through all the trees.

So she sharpened the blade and blew my skull
Apparently no one had ever told her before
Mistaken a unicorn, this one was a bull
Now i cannot continue to push and to pull
Maybe now is a good time.

The day after that, my daddy died.
His heart burst in air like the fourth of july
Walked into an ambulance, his very own stride
Could not make it home even though he tried
In my black satin sheets, i laid there and cried
Maybe now is a good time.

Fought to the death; now we live with the ghost

He was stealing our youth; he was eating our roast.

Is ready to watch you die

Your days are so cold
That you curse just something to cry

That you should be living in fear
When you cry out
Your friends just don't want to hear

And you dream of the day
When the great mastertime
Will call us to his side

And you watch your brothers
Shake with fear as they watch
His serpentine eye

And you can smell their fear
As they stand and curse
The fact that they're alive

That some day you'll do just fine

You know that you live through a lie
You'll only find out what went wrong

It was only a matter of time
Before I got tired of your ways
I tried to make you fire,
But you were only ice
And you didn't seem to want to change

So then I looked at someone new
And he was looking back at me too
Saw that I was hurt
Knew just what to say
Knew just how to push the pain away

You know I need stability
And you know you can't give it to me

[Chorus]
My sun may never rise the way it did with you,
And he may never kiss me the way that you'd do
But at least he makes me feel like a part of his life
At least he doesn't make me cry
I know I can call him mine

Though when I call him on the phone
I never feel butterflies
I know that I can trust
He'll always give me love
And I know mine will grow for him in time

He tells me that I'm beautiful
And I never ever heard that from you
He doesn't cause me pain
Tears falling like the rain
And though I'm still in love with you
You know I need stability

[Chorus]

It wasn't easy letting go but I know that I had to think of the long run and say goodbye
And find someone who appreciates me even though even though.....

My sun may never rise the way it did with you
And he may never ever kiss me the way that you'd do, that you'd do...

Never stopped to play
'Cause there was no attraction

But in my heart you start to grow on me

Love came over me

Is it to much to ask for?

And like the stars above
They shine, let it shine over me
Set me free I believe in you
And that our love is true
Oh I believe, I believe

I see that people dancing
Boys and girls romancing
They want this to last forever
'Cause underneath the moonlight
Everything is alright

We're reaching our hands up in the air
To where the souls alive
Heaven knows, that it shows oh
If this love, will last for eternity

And like the stars above
They shine, let it shine over me
Set me free I believe in you
And that our love is true
Oh I believe, I believe

How could I doubt, what was meant to be
Everything I needed was in front of me
Your healing touch, will lift me up in the sky, so high

We never knew how to communicate

So I close my eyes, realize
I belong to you
And I can't help but just give in

Tata Young,"Uh oh
Your kiss makes me go
Uh oh
Your love makes me go
Uh oh
Your body makes me go
Oh oh oh oh

So, you likin' the way that I rock my jeans
And your eyes are buggin' out, checkin' out my baby t 
Even though you're just a little bit scared of me
I can tell that your likin' what you see
You're steppin' I'm stepping in the danger zone 
(so close) I can even name your fine cologne 
I can tell, that ya wanna wanna take me home 
But ya better be better than a normal joe

Boy can you read my lips
Boy can you handle it
Boy get up to it
Better rise to it
Better stay with it

[Chorus]
Uh oh
Your kiss makes me go
Uh oh
Your love makes me go
Uh oh
Your body makes me go
Oh oh oh oh
Uh oh
Your smile makes me go
Uh oh
Your touch makes me go
Uh oh
Your body makes me go
Oh oh oh oh

Can you look me in the eye if I blow a kiss?
Can you keep up with the groove when I move my hips?
You gotta go long if you wanna hit and miss
Cause it ain't good enough if it's hit and miss
If your man enough go ahead and make your move
If your steppin' up then you got a lot to prove
Take a took at the hottest chick in the room
It you can't last that's watcha gonna lose

Boy can you read my lips
Boy can you handle it
Boy get up to it
Better rise to it
Better stay with it

[Chorus]

Boy don't you know what's happening to me
I didn't know that I can fall so easily
Boy, I'm not sure what I'm feelin'
Boy I don't care 'cause you're the one that's making me go
Uh oh

[Chorus]",Uh Oh,2006
Tata Young,"Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch

You think you know
When you see me in my videos
How the story goes
But that's just the side that I expose

Look through the lens
You see my body, not who I am
So don't pretend
And try to act like you're my boyfriend

You wanna get somewhere
Then boy don't touch me there
Just get up close and personal, personal

Zoom Zoom in under my skin
Gotta slow down now to begin
Baby don't rush
You can look but don't touch
Zoom zoom in? to my head
Gotta want me and not my bed
Boy, prove your love
You can look but don't touch

You won't behave
Your hands are all over the place
Barely know your name
You're tryin' to score but it's not a game

Boy, get a clue
Yeah, you gotta spend the time, pay your dues
Following the rules
If you want me to want to be with you

You wanna get somewhere
Then boy don't touch me there
Just get up close and personal, personal

Zoom Zoom in under my skin

Tatanka,"Parava no café quando ela estava
Na voz tinha o talento dos pedintes
Entre um cigarro e outro lá cravava a bica
Ao melhor dos seus ouvintes

As mãos e o olhar da mesma cor
Cinzenta como a roupa que trazia
Num gesto que podia ser de amor
Sorria, e ao partir agradecia

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Um dia numa sala do quarteto
Passou um filme lá do hospital
Onde o esquecido filmado no gueto
Entrava como artista principal

Compramos a entrada p'ra sessão
Pra ver tal personagem no écran
O rosto maltratado era a razão
D'eu não aparecer pela manhã

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

Mudamos muita vez de calendário
Como o café mudou de freguesia
Deixamos de tributo a quem lá pára
Um louco a fazer-lhe companhia

É sempre a mesma posse o mesmo olhar
De quem não mede os dias que vagueam
Sentado la continua a cravar
Beijinhos as meninas que passeiam

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar

São os loucos de Lisboa
Que nos fazem duvidar
A Terra gira ao contrário
E os rios nascem no mar",Loucos de Lisboa,2017
