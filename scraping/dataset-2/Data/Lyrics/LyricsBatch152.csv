Here's a lil story bout some niccas like we
Never should have been let out the penatentury*
Tity Boi and I would like to say
That I'm the slickest hustla from around my way

Verse 1: Tity Boi
Ay yo. since I was a youth, I pumped weed out and I been had cash money fa real
Off
Wit expectations and fare time faces
When I was hangin' wit this kid named Jason wit an accent from Jamaica
Our only concearn was diggits and comsumers 'cause we had athis lil city down in
Alabama Boomin' so we just do it
Did it like Nike
And even wit this wifebeater on
I still got somethin up my sleeve
It sounds so hard talkin bout guns
'cause I got a 3-5-7-9 and a Mac11
Get drilled, tip toein by the minute
When 6 wit the clip showin
Nicca where ya click gone
They spreadin out like bugshots
Ain't nobody dyin still alive around here but caught
Exscure me your honor, can ya holla at my nicca

Chrous:
Here's lil story bout some niccas like we never should have been let out the
Penatentury*.
Tity Boi and I would like to say that I'm the slickest hustla from around my way

Elementary*
Dolla Boy and I would like to say that I'm the hardest nicca from around
My way

Verse 2: Dolla Boy
Well I'm the dolla boy got gam gallure*
You may have a lot of game but I got much more
And it all brew coo parked run and shoot
Or late night throwin rights, shootin
Dice wit tru and that diamond in the back
Sunroof top, I'm hangin out that bitch
Bout to shut down the block MMMMMMM
AK music, bombass trap wit put the deadanator to it
Niccas get rolled put the mask on and shoot
Street court nicca tell his fam that we sued 'em
Used to run the trap 1-5 on the ruler
But now I'm droppin off like I'm down wit the Cubans
Straight A grad in the Hard Knock Schoolin
Intern work year round brick movin
Get to this money shit real in this music
So get it how you want it lame nicca don't confuse me

Chorus:
Here's a lil story bout some niccas like we

Verse 3: Dolla Boy
Niccas wanna know how Dolla does it
Bangwell gram need all of my 'causeins lame nicca?

Didn't think a nicca come to cop wit a oven
Got enough heat to cook the hams and the stuffin'
Take 22's knock the berries out ya muffin
Momma said her son was 6 short from a dozen
Message to my peers man get to this money

Verse 4: Tity Boi?
A hundred miles of runnin ain't no stoppin us
My communtiy service is pickin paper up
If the drought end its glocks and mad men
Tracks and glass mixed wit a macs and mac10s?
I play the playpens and
Stayed in the statepen
Don't think I ain't bigger
'cause my weight thinner
On 22's is how I carry myself
I'm like EWWW I might marry myself, YUP

Disturbing tha Peace,"[Shawnna]
Shawnna kick hot shit for bitches that got they baby daddies locked

Run up on the cops and he hit 'em with the glock with his wig gone
Sellin rock on the big phone
In the projects niggaz run up on your set with the tech' out
Leave you wet with you chest out
Killer niggaz realer niggaz have a nigga fill a never realer nigga
Drill a nigga fuckin with a villain never spill a nigga
Fuck that! Nigga bust back, we in the 'Llac
Me and my bitches all strapped
Puffin the sack and we be sippin on 'gnac
Fittin to react, and pop a nigga for them stacks (OOH-OOOH!)
Niggaz I'm with they put the fifth to your whole melon
Now with the murderers are known felons
I gotta pop a nigga drop a nigga rock a nigga shock a nigga
Lock a nigga fuck a nigga, cop the floppin nigga
Roll for my bitches that be droppin in the strip clubs
Tryin get 'em a lil' somethin
If you gotta take it off, take it off like a boss for the big ones
Then you get you a big gun
Motherfuckers from the Chi like to put it yo' eye if it's on bitch
Put it straight to yo' dome heads
Now you fuckin with them gangsters, ballers, hoes, hustlers
Bangers - niggaz that with them real motherfuckers like whoa!

[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]
It's real real - on the block I been up for days
I gotta keep the steel steel - in case a nigga want to get in the way
So now what's the deal deal?  On the street you got nothin to say
So when I see him I'ma get him (WHAT!) drill him (WHAT!)
Fill him fill him (WHAT WHAT!)

[Twista]
Twista kick hot shit for hoes and thugs
in ghettoes and clubs that get crunk; for my homies locked down 
to whoever hurtin in the hood and ballers with 22's on big trucks
To my thugs that call over to they mob
And to the hustlers that be servin hydro and cocaine
To my niggaz that ain't hoes; if they have to
they will steal a nigga touch a nigga check a nigga cut a nigga
Pull the trigger bust a nigga, yellow motherfucker nigga
Ready to fill and spill a drink, I'm drunk go and weed it up
And I'm talkin about go like I'm smokin the bone
full of some shit that damn sho' wouldn't seed it up
Got you fillin the hole then go see your body 
probably reanimated with all my Legit Ballaz rollin up
Up the streets stuffed the beats
So you see them Navigators, Escalades, Benzes,
Beamers, Excursions - bumpin systems TV's and them 20's spinnin
Mob for them niggaz that done up off them hard times
K-Town, West side, South side
Murder us for the money that's why I'm known to kick a hard rhyme
Whatever set you represent throw it up
If you buck or crunk then take yo' motherfuckin shirt off
Dealers get your work off; you want to party 
full of hustle niggaz killer niggaz gangsta niggaz chill niggaz
Baller niggaz thug niggaz player haters real niggaz

[Chorus]

[Shawnna]
I'ma kick hot shit for bitches up in the industry tryin to compete me
I'm from the hood South side, West side
where niggaz'll put a motherfuckin slug in my enemy
Motown, Pucketown, do or die
The difference between a motherfuckin thug and a gangsta
One's thug in a chamber
Get a nigga stick a nigga put him in a ditch and then forget a nigga
Hit a nigga puck a nigga little with the rocker nigga
Puff that say you love that
We in the 'Llac and put the lemon in the 'gnac
Remy and sacks that got me scummy in the back
Puffin the raps that got me layin out slacks
and it's speakin like, ""Wow, that, blunt let me hit the weed""
Cause I been feelin like
fuck a nigga bust a nigga Shawnna never love a nigga
Chi about to show the motherfuckers how to rush a nigga
Crush that put it on momma
On everything I got e'rything for the drama, puff marijuana
To the Shawnna and put it on ya
Flows who you froze in a comma
We so relentless, you know Chi up in the business
Flows in yo' dome in an instance
Hoes and them folks and the Mo's and the ki's and the fo's
and the BD's and lows and the fiends and the hoes and God!

I'm smokin dro, choppin O's
Beat knockin with the big blaze choppin nigga
I'm smokin dro, choppin O's
Ridin dirty, candy paint lookin purty

[Tity Boi]
See I'm addicted to this fast life, it's hard to slow me down
When ya, momma on the crack pipe and ya daddy ain't around
You hear the sounds of the wildest gunshots from a large clip
When we started choppin O's off in this empty apartment
See I was, standin in the track, and my back is the target
With a hammer on my side lookin like I'm layin carpets
See you flip it 'til you get it nigga, we hangin like this cable
On my way, to I-20 nigga I gotta play in Decatur
See I'm ridin and I'm blowin on twenty dollar bills
Cause we, only got that gold; you can't buy regular around here
Stayin true to the prestige and the, economic status
I still stacked 100 G's stayin in my momma's attic
Stackin under Kraft-matics, Willie sleepin on the cheese
See we got ki's and the D's and the P's and TV's
And I'm ridin in C.P. with a glock-40 as my tooley
On the block, with the top back, blowin out that

[Chorus x2]

[I-20]
You know I-20 ridin Regal's - cuttin cutters
Since my wood grains got no stains; be in some other shit
A big body Chevy on the, chrome lookin pretty
If it's dro, or the sticky I need, I'm hittin Tity
On my system knock so loud (loud) they call the cops on me
Ladies show that ass proud (proud) and make it drop for me
This is how a nigga ride (ride) in A.T.L.
And if the twelve drop pull me over (over) I hide the scales
Blowin dro out the song booth, with windows tinted
Ridin clean down Old Campbellton Road, y'all know who in it
Got my seat pushed way back, arm out the window
Niggaz quick to pull a car-jack, when they in ya
I push a Range and my brother Fate in S.S. Impala
Ludacris, with the Escalade, and Tit' quickly follow
Gettin ready for the summer get your cars out and fix it
When it comes to that ridin and smoke, look I'm addicted nigga

[Ludacris]
Yo, gotta get that monkey off my BACK.. sir
I'm smokin dro and choppin O's up in my 'LLAC.. sir
Where the fuck you at when them little bitty ""Animals ATTACK"".. sir?
I'm in the TRAP and when I get caught up in a rapture RELAX.. sir
It's like cataracts to me, actually it HAS to be
A factory of SMOKE and clouds I'm chokin proud
And rhapsody, the SACK of trees is WROTE and now
So potent now the TRACK is squeezed
So CLAP and be happy to be nappy and snappin
Just keep on rappin but nobody comes after me
POP...one hit from the blunt then I stop drop, ROLL!!
Really really want to fuck with the glock glock? NO!!
They so simple better hit that block, SLOW!!
On yo' mark, get get ready, set, GO!!
You could watch this Georgia tech' BLOW!!
If I don't get some of that wet wet wet wet DRO!!

All the time,it ain't
Nothing on my mind but - Georgia
We ain't playing with you

Country name , Country slang,
Fiend at the liquor store,
Lac' cruisin' , crap shooting,
50 on the 10 to 4,
Overcast the forecast,
Shows clouds from plenty dro,
And we ready for war in the state of Georgia
Dirty words , dirty birds
Its mean in this dirty south
Ever disrespect it and we'll clean out your dirty mouth,
Bulldogs clocking,these lookout boys is hawking,
You gotta be brave in the state of - Georgia
I got 5 Georgia homes where I rest my Georgia bones,
Come anywhere on my land and I'll aim at your Georgia dome
If you get in an altercation just hop on your mobile phone,
And tell somebody you need help in the middle of - Georgia,
We some ATL thrashers,
Scope your pumpkin and smash ya,
We'll come through your hood worst than a tsunami disaster,
Don't know who they gonna get or who them robbers gonna hit

My small city's called Albany - Georgia
Pecan country like catfish with grits,
Candy yams and chitlings,
Grams homemade baked biscuits,
The land of classical caprices and impala super sports,
Ingredients in this peach cobbler called Georgia,
I love the women out in L.A.
And the shopping stores in New York
The beaches in M.I.A
But it ain't nothing like that G.A red clay,
Look on your map we right above Florida,
Next to Bama,
Under the Carolinas and Tennessse you'll see - Georgia,
Where Gladys knights and the midnight train - Georgia,
THE BIRTHPLACE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING
Where ass so plump and hips are thick,
Where Lac' trucks sit on 26's,
Know where you going or you'll get lost,
Found on these plum trees in the south,
These choppas will tomahawk your top down here in - Georgia

Where the wet paint drip jelly on pirelliz an the chrome on The chevy when I'm choppin in the trap,

Lookin' for me boy, ya find me, down in Dougherty County in a Small city called Albany - Georgia
Where they use to call us some mammothz,
An now they jocking the grammar
Watch your mouth unless you out for some mannar,
Bunch of hustlas run on every corner like the waffle house in Atlanta,
Or I be camour flag out in sa'avannah - Georgia
Now you might come for Vacation,
Leave on Probation,
Home of the strip club,
Known for the thick gulz
Where the chicks put tips in the tip cup,
Of thick chick in a thong with a big butt
When it gettin' on, won't be cheap when it on like peach tree,
Make a chick take it off like freaknik, down here in- Georgia
When you see them confederate flags you know what it is,
Your folks pick cotton here that's why we call it the field,

I'm from G.A , G.A - Georgia

So Ching-a-ling, why don't you go ahead

This at the Billboard's I seen for real name in the pager
Say what, most of these balls they can't fade her
She stay fly, Dolce Gabbanna and Marc Jacobs

Don't have to ask for which she gets what she needs

She can run it, run it at the same time standing in place

And got a long list of giving me
And who will be buying tables man, I'm out of here
But it's to late now, she can see I'm paid now
That I can make it rain now, say now I think I lost a girl

Everywhere that I've been, the selection or celebrity chicks to see
I see Meeg and I see Mia, I be wantin' to meet 'em
I can see them in the sheets when I imagine me between 'em

I'm straight up off the streets the MC
And I've been waiting to see Heaf
So I could shred it to him rough ride
And I leave it to the back seat of the Beamer

And hear that heatin' and give lil' mama the reason
To send papa to a region, as hot as a pot steamin'

Ditty Bops,"It was six men of Indostan
To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried, ""Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""'Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree!""

The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: 'E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a rope!""

And so these men of Indostan
Disputed loud and long,
Each in his opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!

Diva,"Once there was a wicked witch in the lovely land of Oz
And a wickeder, wickeder, wickeder witch there never, never was
She filled the folks in Munchkin land with terror and with dread
'Till one fine day from Kansas way a cyclone caught a house 
That brought the wicked, wicked witch her doom 
As she was flying on her broom
For the house fell on her head and the coroner pronounced her dead
And thru the town the joyous news was spread
 
Ding-dong, the witch is dead! Which old witch? The wicked witch
Ding-dong, the wicked witch is dead
Wake up, you sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed
Wake up, the wicked witch is dead!
She's gone where the goblins go below, below, below, yo ho
Let's open up and sing, and ring the bells out
Ding-dong! the merry-o sing it high, sing it low
Let them know the wicked witch is dead

Diva,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995
Diva,"You stepped out of a dream
You are too wonderful to be what you seem!
Could there be eyes like yours, 
Could there be lips like yours
Could there be smiles like yours, 
Honest and truly?
You stepped out of a cloud
I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream, 
Safe in my heart

Diva,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1997
Diva,"I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string
I'd say that I had spring fever
But I know it isn't spring

I am starry-eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be spring

It might as well be spring",It Might as Well Be Spring,1997
Diva,"Once in a while will you try to give
One little thought to me
Though someone else may be
Nearer your heart?

Once in a while will you dream
Of the moments I shared with you
Moments before we two
Drifted apart?

In love's smoldering ember
One spark may remain
If love still can remember
That spark may burn again

I know that I'll be contented
With yesterday's memory
Knowing you think of me
Once in a while

For the moment I saw him I fell
 
""Chug, chug, chug"" went the motor
""Bump, bump, bump"" went the brake
""Thump, thump, thump"" went my heartstrings
When he smiled, I could feel the car shake

He tipped his hat, and took a seat
He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
He asked my name I held my breath
I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death

""Buzz, buzz, buzz"" went the buzzer
""Plop, plop, plop"" went the wheels
""Stop, stop, stop"" went my heartstrings
As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand

And as if it were planned
He stayed on with me and it was grand
Just to stand with his hand holding mine

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way

So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits

Turn on, turn on the ignition

Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition
Come on, come on and turn on the ignition

Your sleep walking
I'm sleep walking
Your sleep walking
I'm still talking
Come spark the parts in me that all but died
Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside

Hush little baby baby don't you cry

Last night you had a dream you was the homecoming queen
Today you're 18, happy birthday Irene
Quit school you had to drop out to raise your little child
Doesn't seem to be anyone around
You got to reach up to touch rock bottom
The powers that be keep you downtrodden
Daughter of Zion, I heard your prayer
Just cast your cares and please beware of snakes
They come in all shapes and sizes
Tempt you, put scales on your eyelids
Don't waste your sorrows
They'll give you strength for tomorrow
Your Calvary's about to come so
Keep your head up, don't you ever let up
This storm will pass you be ready for the next one 

Hey little girl with the pressures of the world on your
Shoulders
Don't say that it's over
I heard your prayers, just cast your cares
And I'll be there so don't you fear

Irene I carried you when you was too weak to walk
I took to you when you gave your heart to God
Faithful and true, that's what I'll always be to you
Believe in you, believe in Me 
And these mountains have to move,
You have dreams and aspirations
I knew you before creation
Your foundation's solid
I will give you a palace, restore your soul
You'll be up for any challenge
Many storms are on the way better sharpen your faith
Count the cost, take up your cross
And wear it every day
Rest in Me and I will give you strength
Blessed is she, Irene who seeks my face

Father God, I am clay in your hands

But they don't know that who you are is not what you do

Yo before we part from the start
Where's your heart?
You a pimp, hustler?
Tell me what's your title
America has no more stars, now we call them idols
You sit idle, While we teach prosperity
The first thing to prosper should be inside of me
We're free
Not because of 22's on the range
But Christ came in range, we said yes now we changed
Not the same, even though I made a fall
Since I got that call, no more Saul, now I'm Paul

So rip the knob off the volume when you give this a shot
And raise your hands as the slam starts to thicken the plot
Openin' eyes to the lies of the enemies' lot
So run like the wind from the sin of your past
Keep your eyes on the prize when they put you on blast
It's the Christ on the cross, it's humanity's shot

Waist high in the water, never short on words, he said
Repent, the kingdom of heaven can be yours
But he stopped in the middle of his words and dropped
Down to his knees and said, behold the Lamb of God

He rose on the third

This native love is restless
And I'm just not satisfied.

And I'll never get enough
Of that native love.

(chorus)

My car is my Ferrari and my body's Jack LaLanne
My clothes are by Armani and my hair is by Elaine
Tiffany and Cartier are telling me the time
This native love is restless and I'm just not satisfied.

And I'll never get enough
Of that native love
Dance ride feel the heat
Rock your body to the body heat.

What it looks like
What it is
Say pungra, jungra
Say damn to the thungra

(chorus)

This native love is restless
And I'm just not satisfied
This native love is restless
And I'm just not satisfied

Hey GQ man, here I stand
For everyone to see
And if I'm not your type, well that's alright
Cuz that don't matter to me.

Got the rhythm and the rhyme
I'm right on time
I'm gonna blow your mind
This native love is restless
And I'm just not satisfied.

And it don't take much dough
Where you can really do your thing
Got a ""men only"" sign outside

You'd be surprised at what you find

Screaming guitars and
Strobe lights gettin' down
People come in there
From all parts of town

Move, move, move to the beat of the jungle groove

Psychedelic Shack - that's where it's at
Psychedelic Shack - that's where it's at
Psychedelic Shack - that's where it's at

Stranded in the jungle, and I got no place to hide
The jungle is so dangerous; there's evil in their minds
Witch doctors are cannibals; the rhythm drives you insane
Medicine man has something to take away the pain

Move, so move, so move to the beat of the jungle groove
I said, move, move, move to the beat of the jungle groove

[Chorus]

I'm a lover, not a fighter
Teacher, not a preacher
Singer, not a swinger
So move to the beat, c'mon!

Move, so move, so move to the beat of the jungle groove
I said, move, move, move to the beat of the jungle groove

A ring in your nose, a diamond in your ear

The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,

And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""

But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the ""F's"", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.

Keep bringing you back to me

Met at a party in June
Wasn't really tryin' to notice you
You looked at me with your sweet brown eyes
You walked up and said ""Hi""
Who would have known
That a love affair like ours would grow
Then slip away

Still miss that old skool love
Not quite that do-right love
Your love was fine, never old time
You're steady on my mind
Still miss that old skool love
I don't want you back
But I'll never ever love the same way again

Now here I am startin' over with a new love
He's a real man with a good heart
He's more than enough, laid back and smooth
With a warm and gentle touch
Near or far, his love is never, never too far

Thinkin' about your lips when I'm kissing him
(There you go again)
Throwin' me back, makin' me reminisce
And I know it's wrong, me holding on

But I'll never ever love the same way again

Didn't ya tell me that ya never tell me lies
And didn't ya tell me that you'd never say goodbye

All that I know, just can't let go

I say you should lay it on the line

I'm here for you whenever you call
But now it's time for you to speak your mind

Ooh baby, it's been so hard
Holding back everything inside
To be honest I've been a little scared
Of losing you, I can't lie

Now I got to let you know
I've been feeling you all this time
And now I'm ready to take a chance

Divine Maggees,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2006

Divine Regale,"Startled one more time
Out of another restless night
There's fear and terror in her eyes

She'll hide the tear stains
Where she used to 
Find her dreams
There will be no more 
Sleep tonight

To close her eyes would 
Be to face him
Replay a past
She thought forgotten
So today I'll watch the sunrise
Hoping to catch
A glimpse of the morning dove
And carry her prayer to heaven

Crying to heaven
Hoping her voice will be strong
Crying to heaven
She's hoping it won't be too long

Shadows reaching out to her
The days are getting colder
She's trying to hang on
To every minute of every hour
Tossing and turning the night is 
Tormenting her
And I'm helplessly 
Watching over her
So today I'll watch the sunrise
Hoping to catch a 
Glimpse of the morning dove

I tried to hold you close
So close within my arms
Trying to keep you save from harm
I used to believe that
Things happened for a reason
Now I'm not so sure anymore

Staring outside her window again
Her weary eyes upon the sunrise",Cry to Heaven,1995
Divine Regale,"Fairy tales my father told me
When I was a child
Of evil dragons that filled the sky
Engulfing the land in flames

But in every tale there was a hero
Who like me, was a child
He would find his courage stand alone
And see the dragons slain

Once upon a time
A time we know today and yet another tale
A boy and his father traveling 
Through the city
Detour pulls them through a hidden reality

Wide eyed horrified
The child's eyes nightmare awoken
The fantasy's broken
Decaying buildings and crying children
Frozen hands surround the burning cans

I said father can you tell me
What is this place I see before me
This is the underworld my son
This is the land beneath the city
It will disappear just close your eyes
It isn't real it's not alive
This is the underworld

Now years later
The memories still strong
The day I witnessed what the dragons had done
My father's tale had come to life
Am I the child that makes it right

I've seen the magic dragons and 
Their many evil forms
So rich and unfeeling they've all become
I'm just a child so young
I'm no army I'm just one",Underworld,1997
Divine Styler,"Yo the rhyme excursions touch minds like brain surgeons 
Feel the lyric tear gas even on clean versions 
No profanic goddammit hard like granite to the utmost 
I'm butter on rye, always high but play the low post 
I stretch to go the distance yo my lungs are mad elastic 
I'm dope on plastic like Flex, and always keep it, classic
Expressions in the facial, I'm on rachel from Caribbean rhythms 
I hit 'em wit' a battered flow pattern then circle Saturn twice
I'm nice on ice The line slice your dome and separate rhymes from poems
My life, ain't tryin to see no Grammy or Oscar 
Best believe the styles will rub off like pastas
On people, yo check Dilated, Evidence 
The influential rock rhymes in sequential format 
You see the doormat if you acting dis-accordingly 
Something to the effect of Fat Boys in Disorderly's

I'll take you from He-Man to She-Ra 
Battle Cat to Cringer 
Medieval messenger, west coast avenger 
Take you to the street, battle me that's a fuckin' sin 
Go one round wit Madchild, you'll be suckin' wind 
Snappin' handcuffs just from deep concentration 
Then I broke out the bus, the mental hospital patient
On the weekend pass, but I still come sick 
Psychopathic, you're dealin' with a deranged lunatic 
Soon to kick ya teeth in and then go berserk 
Even Van Gogh looked at me, 
And said ""You're one piece of work"" 
So I said ""Lend me an ear"" 'cause I'm the state of the art 
First I'll feast on your brain and rip your body apart 
There's a part of your heart stuck in between my fangs 
Wrap a rope 'round your neck and you still couldn't hang 
'cause you're way off track you need realignment 
Murdering masterpieces in solitary confinement

I keep your backside open like the English Channel 
I rock the sure shot, I keep it hot like flannel 
I'll survey your panel, put my foot up in your anal 
You think it can't happen, kid 'cause I'm rappin'
Ain't no gun clappin', cut the jaw-jackin '
Let the joints get shot and see who wear this knot 
Then kick off your shoes jump off my jock
And check the new style Whitey Ford's prone to rock 
'cause once upon a time, not long ago
Before hip hop was made for the radio 
An MC show had to cold rock the masses 
Used to wear a Kangol wit the clear Gazel glasses 
So bang bang boogey, up jump the party 
Someone clapped off, and scattered everybody 
Drunk off Bacardi, high off the trauma 
It's death from above, the livest dive bomber 
In the squadron
I break formation 
I get New York love like my name's King Sun 
I T La Rock Bells till they break the dawn 
Steady puffin L's, I fight hell like Spawn 
My moves are animated, my crew's reinstated 
While you cats suspensions are up in my dimensions 
We can ease tensions or we can get rowdy 
So I'm a keep it on the love and do my duty like Howdie 

Direct your short term plan, rigidalize rhyme boards wit the hoards
I'm Satan dynasty killer reveal the cause wit the sling on down 
Venom spit regurgitate death scripts I sound 
Cylinder never python, Prevail Madchild 
Physical justice can't rush this for now 
Move faker the game time set back so don't sweat that 
God don't test that, too much infinite to get at 
Face the fields Swollen Members got the iller drills 
And if you wit the rhyme steel 
Bust the revealings in my feelings of these dealings 
I went to represent shield 
I build three phases of death,
The illusion is the sweat that you reflect 
When you feel the veil Divine Styles circum navigate nine circles of hell 
You keep on you don't stop 'cause a nigga never stay still

Tengo herida el alma why el corazón

Porque tú no estás


Ay fueron noches de pasión

Cuando le entregué mi corazón

Cuando yo le dí mi vida entera

why bajo la luna pasabamos la noche en vela

Yo te amaba

Llegue a quererte más que a todo más que a nada

Eras tú la que en mis sueños siempre estaba

why de besos mil caricias te colmaba

Por favor regresa

Veo como pasan las noches las mañanas

Como se ha quedado vacía mi casa

Reina de mi alma dueña mi cama

Te fuiste why no dijiste nada

Poder recuperar este romance Volver a vivir en la luna 
Como los tiempos que nos vivimos 
Y darnos el amor que no nos dimos Yo contigo me sentía 
Que podía conquistar el universo 
Converso con dios 
Y le escribo versos A ver si me responde 
Me diga la hora 
Del lugar y donde 
Pa’ llegarle volando Donde tú te escondes 
Que yo sé que muchas veces 
Siente que se vira el mundo 
En el amor todo te sale al revés Yo sigo aquí esperando 
Y muero por solo un segundo 
De poder tener tu cuerpo otra vez 
Y tan solo verte  
Quiero tenerte

Sentir como se paraliza el mundo Cuando tú me tienes cerca de ti 
Yo te tengo cerca de mi cuerpo 
Ciento que los problemas están resueltos Me conoces hace tanto tiempo 
Y hace tanto siento 
Que pa’ seguir solo 
Prefiero estar bajo del cemento Que descanse en paz mi alma 
Con todos mis sentimientos 
Desde las nubes 

Voy a chequearte en todos tus movimientos Yo tu ángel guardián 
Y tú la reina de mis días 
La dueña de mis noches largas 
En mi fantasía Mientras canto 
Voy a seguir alucinando 
Con tenerte 
Esperando que un día tenga la suerte 
De tan solo verte  
Quiero tenerte  
Conmigo siempre  
Solo dame otra oportunidad 
De tan solo verte

Y disfruté las cosas que hicimos
Mi corazón se convierte en un almacén
Cosas bonitas que vivimos

Pero todo se acabó, se convierte en hielo
Tan frío este amor
Y los recuerdos se van desapareciendo
Ya todo terminó

Y yo no sé
Qué pasó, para mí todo era tan perfecto
Mi corazón ya no quiere, se da por vencido, lo siento
Y yo no quiero que me veas como si para mí esto es un juego

Recibo un texto que me dice te quiero
Y yo fingiendo le contesto igual
Me dice que me ama y sé que me está mintiendo
Lo noto por su manera de besar

Para qué seguir, si ya no la pasamos igual
Para qué fingir, ni siquiera te puedo hablar
Es que ese amor ya se va desapareciendo
Te mata el miedo de quedarte sola

My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams, my heart it bleeds

From desert plains I bring you love

Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last

I'd set my foot on a steamboat and sail the ocean 'round 
Sailing 'round the ocean, sailing 'round the sea

I am a beggarman and a beggin' I have been 
For three score or more on this lil' isle of green 
I'm known from the Liffy on down to Segu 
And I'm known by the name of Little Johnny Doo 

Of all the trades a-goin' sure a-beggin' is the best 
When a man gets tired he can lay his head to rest 
He can beg for his supper when there's nothing else to do 
Or go sit 'round the corner in his ol' rigadoo 

We slept one night in a barn in Clairebon
We went naked all night and slept until the dawn 
Holes in the roof and the rain a-pourin' through 
And the cats and the rats they were a-playin peek-a-boo 

Who should awaken but the woman of the house 
In a white spotted apron and a calico blouse 
She began to frighten and I said ""Boo!"" 
""Don't be afraid ma'am, it's only Johnny Doo!"" 

Over the fields with a pack on my back 
Over the hills with a creak in me sack 
Holes in my shoes and my toes peekin' through 
Singing ""Shinkle and a wrinkle it's only Johnny Doo!"" 

Well, it's getting late at night and it's time to go to bed 
And the fire's all out and whoops goes the light

Laying rubber and spewing rust

Believing that I'd set him free

Saying he couldn't get enough of her
You go by land, you go by air
You go by sea, hell I don't care
You can go any way you choose
Wearing out the soles of your traveling shoes
And a road is just a road and a feeling's just a feeling
No matter where you go, from Bangor, Maine to Bakersfield
A road is just a road that the one you love is leaving on

And every sleepless night I see him
Screaming by the scenery
Not noticing another mile

I want to feel the wind in my face
A thousand miles from all the city lights

Dixie Chicks,"Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

Well, it wasn't two weeks after she got married that
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well, the weeks went by and spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
We need a break, let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch, and stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Is that alright?  Good! Let's go for a ride, Earl, hey!
Ooh hey hey hey, ummm hey hey hey, hey hey hey",Goodbye Earl,1999

Kissed your mama goodbye
Baby in your arms and a tear in your eye
Twelve hundred miles and you never asked why
From me

Me and the baby and you side by side
We all knew we was in for a long hard ride
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide it seemed
We honked the horn when we crossed the
State line
Woke up the baby and she started to cry
She must've known
What we were going to find

This ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town
Square people in a world that's round
And they watch you dancin' without the sound
It ain't nothin' no nothin'
You take your number and you stand in line
And they watch to see how high you're gonna climb
Pat on the back and better luck next time
It ain't nothin' no it ain't nothin' but a heartbreak town

Stardust well it's a funny thing
It can make you cuss
It can make you sing
And the need to touch it gets hard to explain some days
I've seen 'em rise
I've seen 'em fall
Some get nothin'
And lord some get it all
Some just run
While others crawled away
Hold my hand baby don't let go
I've got some front money
And I've got a next show
And I'm, I'm gonna need you
Down this yellow brick road

They think they'll be happy

Be still for just a minute
Try to open our hearts

Don't know why

Dixie Chicks,"Well there was a little falter at the altar of confession 
Down on its knees true love did fall
After 31 days of sleepless nights, she woke up to end it all 
With ""I love you"" on a fresh tattoo engraved upon his chest
She tore her name right off his heart 
So here's to the unblessed 

Oh love, oh love you fickle thing 
Such pretty words and golden rings 
It was a broken dream right from the start
Bless their tortured, tangled hearts

Well a blast of confusion coupled with delusion
Makes the best made plans sometimes fail
They wined and they dined, had peace of mind
She bought a gown and he rented tails
But the mighty cloud of destiny came driftin' through the gates
And busted up what could have been a perfect, hopeless case

Oh love, oh love you fickle thing
Such pretty words and golden rings
It was a broken dream right from the start

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H club, both active in the FFA
After graduation 
Mary Anne went out lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town and all she found was Earl

It wasn't two weeks after she got married that 
Wanda started gettin' abused
She'd put on dark glasses or long sleeved blouses 
Or make-up to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce 
And she let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order 
And put her in intensive care

Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta 
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they worked out a plan 
And it didn't take 'em long to decide

That Earl had to die, goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas, they tasted alright to me, Earl
You're feelin' weak? Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl
Ain't it dark wrapped up in that tarp, Earl

The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats and said, thank you ladies
If you hear from him let us know
Well the weeks went by and spring turned to summer 
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land and a roadside stand 
Out on highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham and strawberry jam 
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause

Earl had to die, goodbye Earl

Knowing you'll always live on in a song

Farewell to old friends
Let's raise a glass to the bitter end
Farewell to old friends
Will you be the same when we see you again?

Remember the days
When we'd laugh as you played
Who would have known
The water would come and just take you away?
Oh, where'd you go?

It's not alright
I can't sleep tonight
Knowing you should have played on
On and on

Will you forgive me when I see you again?

Drinking all of our wine

We all rode the wave

Oh, where'd you go?
What happened to
The ones we knew?

Accidents and accusations
Messages and misperceptions
Paralyze my mind

Buses, cars, and airplanes leaving
Burning fumes of gasoline
And everyone is running
And I come to find a refuge in the

Easy silence that you make for me
It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay

Monkeys on the barricades
Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify

And anger plays on every station
Answers only make more questions
I need something to believe in
Breathe in sanctuary in the

Watching war made us immune

Shut up and sing

We didn't know how hard it was
Living on nothing
But what the wind would bring to us
Now we've got something
I can imagine fighting for
So why is fighting all that we're good at anymore?

And sometimes I don't have the energy
To prove everybody wrong
And I try my best to be strong
But you know it's so hard
It's so hard

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard

It felt like a given
Something a woman's born to do
A natural ambition
To see a reflection of me and you

And I'd feel so guilty
If that was a gift I couldn't give
And could you be happy
If life wasn't how we pictured it?

And sometimes I just want to wait it out
To prove everybody wrong
And I need your help to move on

It's so hard

It's so hard when it doesn't come easy
It's so hard when it doesn't come fast
It's so hard when it doesn't come easy

When all these clouds open up for me to see
And show me a vision
Of you and me swimming peacefully

Last night you told me
That you can't remember
How to feel free

It can get pretty lonely when you show yourself
Guess I could have made it easier on myself

But I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

Well, I never seem to do it like anybody else
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
If you ever want to find me I can still be found

And the microphone smells like a beer

One that they could croon

And that is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that 
The start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down hearted frail
And they played that 
As part of the blues

From a whippoorwill out on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn
'til it was born into a blue note

Dizzee Rascal,"Everybody wants to be famous,
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless,
People act shameless
Tryna live like entertainers,
Want a fat crib with the acres,
So they spend money that they ain't made yet,
Got a Benz on tick that they ain't paid yet,
Spend their paycheck
In the west out on a weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend.
But they don't care cause their life is a movie,
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly,
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks,
Can't keep up with the cover notes,
So they got bad credit livin' on direct debit in debt
They still don't get it
Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Huggin' the high when livin' it large
And they all say

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
(That's right)
Now and then it seems like life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase
It's one big rat race
Everybody's got a screw face
So many two-faced,
Checkin' their high sayin' they're ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the city's like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a mourner
Mr. Politician can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it a mirage
I see youngsters die because they tryna live large
And they all say

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on all of you
Sometimes I feel like saying “Lord, I just don't care”
(That's right, that's right)
But you've got the love I need to see me through
(Check it, check it, come on, come on)

You got the love

You got the love

You got the love
(That's right, that's right, that's right)
You got the love

You got the love
(Who's got the love)
You got the love
(Check it)

We are living in the days of the credit crunch
Give me the dough
I'm tryna have a bunch
But I can't have rice for lunch
It's not there ain't enough to share
It ain't fair never dreamed that he could be rare
Who cares who dares to make a change
Everybody's in the club trying to make it rain
But not for famine just for the sake of having
15 minutes of fame and everywhere's the same
Again and again I see the same thing
Everybody acting like they play sailin'
But I see rough seas ahead maybe a recession
And then a depression in whatever profession
This is my confession I can't front I’m in the forefront
Living for money ready to start like a bungee jump
With no rope but I ain't trying to see the bottom
Because that's where I came from, I ain't forgotten,

Baby, baby I love you, baby, baby I love you.

I got this jones forming in my bones (from a man)
Who indeed took over my soul, (understand)
I couldn't breathe if he ever said (he would leave),
Get on my knees till they bloody red, (baby please)
See I don't know if you get it yet, (just don't know)

(Didn't know) can have the power to take over mine,

Ya name, got me sayin' baby, baby, baby,
Baby, baby,(baby I love you) baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.

See, I could never feel alone with you (in my life),
I gave up everything I own for you (won't
Think twice), almost a shame how I'm mesmerized (such a shame),
I loose my thought looking in your eyes (I know why)
Because your kisses make my lips quiver and (that's real) and when you
Touch me my whole body shivers. (I can feel) now,
I can see how another life(nother life)could
Have the power to take over mine cause your my.

Baby, I can't see my worth (I can't see) living here on
God's green earth, you don't know what
You've done to me, (done to me) I never thought
I'd need you desperately,(desperately) it's kind
Of sick how I'm stuck on you(stuck on you)
But I don't care cause I'm needing you (I'm needing you)
And how I feel will remain the same (remains the same)
'Cause you're my baby, (cause your my baby)
Listen and when the world starts to stress me out,
(Where I run) it's to you boy without
A doubt (you're the one) who keeps me sane and I can't complain
(Can't complain) you're like a
Drug you relieve my pain (may seem strange)
You're like the blood flowing through my vain, (oooo)
Keeps me alive and feeding my brain,

She used to love him, he used to love her, she used to kiss him, he used to hug her, call it
Deep love or puppy love, they bunked off school.
Now there's no flame, things ain't the same,
Look's like she's change, thinks it's some game, he's left in the rain, trying to point blame,
Talks for a fool.
She moved on quick, he's still love sick, she's not having it, thinks he's some prick, he won't
Believe it, wants it just how it was in school. 
He keeps calling, night or morning, break of evening, break of dawning.
He keeps ringing up, she
Keeps hanging up, oh what a fool.
She is the best friend, of a ex girlfriend, of a old school friend, who is the close friend, of
This best friend, best friend likes this boy called BLUE.
Best friend loves him, best friend needs him, but the ex girlfriend, of the old school friend,
Who is the close friend, of this best friend, likes him too. 
So the ex girlfriend, of the old school friend, who is the close friend, of this best friend,
Sits with best friend, who by now has slept with BLUE.
Now the ex girlfriend don't want to pretend that she ain't slept with that boy blue, coz we was a
Friend of an ex man too. Listen

Dizzee Rascal,"Hey, listen, take nothing
I don't want to hear anymore talk, you get me, no more talk
I've heard their talk, that Dizzee Rascal's so rude
People talking don't even know me
I do what I want, you get me (and ask no one for nothing)
I ain't everyone's friend
Ok, I don't want to get vexed
That's why I'm just trying to keep my cool, you get me
I don't want to lose it, I can't believe I got people chattin' shit
I'll never watch what I say
I say what the fuck I want, I don't care who you are
I don't care who I offend or nothing
I won't be silenced!

I'm showing you my life's more deep than you think (uh huh)
At nights, I get a little less sleep than you think (really)
Something keeps me up, I can't even get a wink
And there's no point in trying, so I lay there and blink

I'm showing you, I feel more stressed than you see
But my business is my business and I keep it all to me
I've done a lot of work for you to see me where I be
But lately I sense you don't want to set me free

And lately, there's been controversy seen around my name (ok)
But fuck you cause I ain't playing your game (naw)
I ain't chewed my language, they ain't used to it (ok)
But I ain't, you can't get me so (get me) get used to it

Cause I was raised an only child, not a brother, not a sis
And raised around hate, not a hug, not a kiss (naw)
Before this I was just a failure in the mist
And I made it through the front, I can't let you take a piss, so...

I don't want to get vexed
And I don't want to lose my cool
But I ain't gonna let that boy come around, try take me for no fool
I ain't gonna let that boy come around, I'm reaching for my tool
I ain't gonna let that boy get flash, I'll smash his head on the wall

So, I don't want to get vexed
And I don't want to lose my rag
But I ain't gonna let that boy come around try to take me for no slag
I ain't gonna let that boy come around and run his gums you're mad
I'll probably have him thinking I'm fake, I'll make his family sad

I do the fuck what I want, that's how I got here
And I'll be damned if I let you fussies interfere
And if I had my way, you wouldn't even get near
I don't need your help, do I make myself clear?!?

I know it sounds rude, that's because it's meant to be (okay)
I plan to be the rudest boy in this industry (okay)
Ain't two-faced, and I ain't known to gloat (okay)
If I don't like you, then I'll tell you to your throat

I don't know what you want, I don't know what you expect
But if I don't know you, don't ask me for respect
I don't give it easily, I don't give it much
And I ain't got a heart, so don't ever try and touch

All these pigs runnin' â??round like I owe them (okay)
Before I got big, I didn't even know them (okay)
I'll be doing this for a whole lot a' years (okay)
And I'll be standing tall and straight when the smoke clears
So

[Chorus]

Yo
I'm the type of boy that takes the bump with the grind (okay)
And I'm the type of boy to take your girl from behind (okay)
I'm the type of boy your girl wants me to be (she told me)
So don't act a prick, cause it don't suit me (okay)

You could boil me up and you can even shoot me (okay)
But if your girl's lettin' up, then it's my duty (okay)
I ain't trying to keep your wifey, truthfully (okay)
But it ain't my fault your girlfriend's a groupie

Be careful what you ask for, you could change your mind (okay)
And what you're looking for, you won't like what you find (okay)
If you're looking for the pussy, if you're looking for the chat
I'll remind you that curiosity killed the cat (okay)

Plus
Girls are telling lies, and they spreading like the plague (okay)
What else can I do except keep myself made (okay)
I don't know why these girls are trying to attack me, (okay)

when you said that she forgot other boys

I love raising conscience but there's jus too much violence uh
I can't stand no nonsense uhhh

Yo, MC's better start chattin about what's really happening
Because if you ain't chatting about what's happening
Where you living, what you talking about

And you know what it's gonna be an even hotter winter
And I ain't even talking about the whether

[Verse - 1]
Looks like I'm losing friends there's a lot of hostility in my endz
We used to argue always make enemy friends
Now we settle disagreements with the skenz
Looks like I'm losing mates there's a lot hostility near my gates
We used to fight with kids from other estates
Nine eight millimetres settle debates
Looks like I'm losing site cause I'm looking at the future it ain't bright
So I look out my window and pray every night
I thank God for my friends but they ain't tight
Looks like I'm losing hope cause I climb this mountain without rope
But I know I'm the captain of my boat so I steadily sail and hope not to float

[Chorus]
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say
I plan to make my pay but put some away for a off key day

Pay money pay respect don't insult my intellect
Demand collect, cash up front and direct

[Verse - 2]
When we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Like fighting for anything anytime and acting without a care and where
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Like bank scams, street robbery, shotters plotters or H.M.P
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Pregnant girls who think they love useless mans with no plans
And when we ain't kids no more will it still be about what it is right now
Cause negative signs just keep showing up
Some of us beter just start growing up

[Chorus]
But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say

When I look at my life I can't help but think
Cause I could of resulted to drugs and drink
Everyday was the same as the day before
But we where never quite sure of what's in store
Every day I wake up I can't help but feel
I'm certain of life I mean this is real
Mad thoughts skip around my head like dance themes
I know it's long to question but I need answers
The who's, the what's, the how's, the when's, the why's
You can at look in my face and see the pain in my eyes
Tears ready to fall like the rain in the skies
So hold back put my feet down and rise
Cause guys want to test my words
So I can't just cater for second or third
Plus I know predators only go for the weak
And that's long so I gotta stay strong, you get me

But it's a brand new day, new opportunities what can I say

Oh, It's real out here like no one understands sometimes
People can really see what's going on
Like people are just, just going mad infront of me, you get me
Everyone's growing up too fast, I swear
Feds don't understand us, adults don't understand us
No one understands us
We just live do what we do like, It's real
It's raskit, shout out to all the mad dem
Yo, I'm repping I'm trying listen, Yo

[Verse - 1]
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for ever
I spend my whole life tryna' pull myself together
Tryna' reassure myself that I ain't going mad
I've gotta come to a conclusion it's now or never
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for years
I've been through anger pain blood sweat and tears
You think that any kid in my position would be glad
Its quite the opposite more worries more fears
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for days
It's like I've lost the love I'm only in it cause it pays
I find myself back on road things are getting bad
More and more I'm going back to my old ways
Sometimes I wake up wishing I could sleep for good
And if I had the guts to end it all believe I would
It's getting boring always being miserable and sad
Shit I would love to be polite I really wish I could
But lifes pressures often get me down
Sometimes I feel there's not a lot to smile about so I frown
And I talk a big whole heap of badness
Because my life's a big whole heap of madness
I've seen a lot maybe more than I can take
Under pressure everyday trying not to brake
But I'll survive cause it's what I do best
I'm a challenger put me to the test

[Chorus - 2X]
Sleep tight everything will be alright
By the end of the night, will be the day, just
Pray that you see, strong you got a be it
If you want to get through it, stretch your mind to the limit
You can do it

[Verse - 2]
It's almost like I've got no world on my shoulder sometimes
Yo I struggle sometimes, you know I'm hating petty crimes
But we live in hard times
No one to turn to and no one to talk to
Life's like a door way everybody walk through
Everybody's talking but nobody's listening
Everyday some new shit, week out and week in
All this negativity, why you tryna get at me
All up in my life rahhh, where do you get the energy
I don't feel well, but you still bother me
Your giving me a headache man you might aswell just clobber me
Blud lately I've been lonely, but you only fone me
When you want a favour then you wonder why I'm moany
Don't really ask much so I don't own much
Don't receive a lot of love, so I don't show much
But that little that I do I put it in a song for you
Handle your business cause I do, listen

[Chorus - 2X]
Sleep tight everything will be alright
By the end of the night, will be the day, just

I've heard the gossip from the street to the slammer
They're trying to see if Dizzee stays true to his grammar
Being a celebrity don't mean shit to me
Fuck the glitz and glamor
Hit em with the Blitz and Hammer
Because they're talking bout rushing
Talk behind my back but to my face they say nothing
Stand up in the dance, keep a firm steady stance
Keep the beanies touching, keep the beanies hot flushing
Flushing MC's down the loo
If you don't believe me bring your posse, bring your crew
Feel free to hate cos I ain't tryna be your mate
Be serious, you wouldn't last an hour in my shoe

Its probable they'll stop me, probably never

Come to me with an attitude, come a cropper

And a First Aid kit and some antiseptic, this could get hectic

fifteen, she's underage that's raw
and against law 5 years or more
and she wants a score and half of a draw
some kind of friend that you try and ignore
that whore got you pinned down to the floor
but its your own fault you said three magic words (i love you)
when that's the one for the birds
when you said that she forgot other boys
its over you better start buying the toys
there was no intention in front of your wife
that she knows this that she's ending your life
its a real shame you got hacked by the whores
its a real shame that kid probably ain't yours

They call her Jezebel
You might find her in your neigbourhood
Always in some shit
Up to no good
Constant boasting, bragging to her friends
Juiced every boy in the ends
Gettin' outta school
She would truant every day
Always on the link
Different boy every day
Missed mathematics, she was doing acrobatics
But not gym class
She was gettin' doggy fast

Yo, they call her Jezebel
Friends call her sket behind her back
She never knew the plot
She was born of track
Tight top, short skirt, thinks she's too nice
Hates love but she's been deep in twice
Pass with, ho's can't keep her legs closed
Always on the creep
Now she's in too deep
Now she faces neglect, abuse and rape
Man said that he'd kill her if she tried to escape

I've seen you about
I think your tromp (Boom ting)

For the fifth time
She's gettin' whammed from behind
Had a bit to drink
So she's acting kinda slow
She came with Natasha
But she's leavin with Joe
Ricky loves jezzy but jezzy loves willy
Ricky means well but Ricky ain't got a thing
Joe's got a name
And jezzy loves fame
She wants a man to show
So it's all about Joe

They call her jezebel
On her way to get wocked out
Get battery
And get kicked out
Jezzy weren't expecting more then four
But what could she say
She just did it anyway
Messed up, caught a kinda STD
Gonorrhoea, Herpes, No VD
Left bitter, left angry, left vexed
But still loves sex
Passed it on to the next

[Chorus]

Pretty but
Ain't got a brain
Got no shame
Got juiced on the train
Went from daddy's little girl
To daddy's heart attack
House reck a side
She could never go back
Raised in the church
Not knowing anything
Then, Learned about boys
Ruined everything

Aged 16
She was never full grown
She was in a family
Now she's got one of her own
Two kids
Even worse
Two little girls
Two more of her
That's two jezebel's
Two fatherless kids
One single mum
No longer young
But the boys still come
Yo, wishin' she could take it back to the old school
And make better choice's
Oh what a fool
Bottle by her side
She wonder man
If only she was six years younger

And I hit MC's like croquet
If a boy pet then a boy must pay
You can start answer on a lay lay
Please feel free you can bring it any day
Anyway get wet like perry-ay
Better hope there's a ambulance on the way
OK if you wanna fight just say
We uppercut MC's like sugar Ray

Hot like Cairo, hot like Mars
But I want houses and I want cars
So I spit verses and I spit bars
I don't care what they say man I ain't play
Hot like lava hot like hell
Move to your sister move to your girl
Charmane Cheri line or Chantalle
You better hide your wife, protect her well

Killer instinct, instinctive killer
Run dear life can't get no bigger
Young guns flapping their guns with no fear
Females, money and guns its all here
Top shotters big cats street gats
Bent coppers aim for your knee caps
Some pay a visit to jail without bail
Some stay on top of the game without fail

Guess who sneaked in through the back door?
Born with a hacksaw through a trap door
Dizzee got a cheek and not much more
What's that violence what's that war?
Put him in a head lock see if he's raw
I cause arms that's on the dance floor
Set trend set standard set score

Spin that bottle, nah dash that bottle
Talk tough but you ain't got no bottle
Get strangled get hold get throttled
Dizzee come old school like Aristotle
Blue bottle flying about with six holes
Ice dry hockey stick brake collar bones
We check girls with broken holes
Big battys big breasts light skin toes

I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just think
And my eyes don't move left or right they just blink
I think too deep, and I think too long
Plus I think I'm getting weak 'cause my thoughts are too strong
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just gaze
I'm looking in to space while my CD plays
I gaze quite a lot, in fact I gaze always
And if I blaze, then I just gaze always my days

'Cause it's the same old story, shutters, runners, cats and money stacks
And it's the same old story, ninja bikes, gun fights and scary nights
And it's the same old story, window tints and gloves for finger prints
Yeah it's the same old story, police investigate around the area
'Cause it was only yesterday we was playing football in the streets
It was only yesterday none of us could ever come to harm
It was only yesterday life was a touch more sweet

I really don't feel like moving so I cotch
I watch all around, I watch every detail
I watch so hard I'm scared my eyes might fail
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I just smile
It's funny 'cause I haven't bust a smile for a while
I'll smile for a minute, and I'm smiling for an hour
I'm scared 'cause it's sweet, but it could turn sour

'Cause it's the same old story, chung intelligent yaps in hospie flats
And it's the same old story, benefit claims and cheques in false names
And it's the same old story, students truent, learn the streets fluent
Yeah it's the same old story, strange, there's no sign of positive change
'Cause it was only yesterday, we was standing firmly on our feet
It was only yesterday, girls were innocent they kept us calm
It was only yesterday, there was less bobbies on the beat

I'm vex at humanity, vex at the earth
I keep getting vex, till I think what's the worth?
I'm just sitting here, I ain't saying much I feel to cry
I'm sitting here depressed and I don't know why
I try to pull myself together, tell myself fix up
And I keep myself from bawling but my eyes they erupt

'Cause it's the same old story, crazy boys keep getting on my nerves
And it's the same old story, police don't give me no peace
Yeah, it's the same old story, friends slowly drifting from the ends
Yeah, it's the same old story, I've sussed, there's nobody I can trust
'Cause it was only yesterday after school we'd come outside and meet
It was only yesterday, it was all love back then
It was only yesterday, every sunny day was a treat

Dizzee Rascal,"Yeah
What up man, what are ya this week?
He thinks he's rough, and he's always got a screw-face
He's stush and he thinks he's heavy
I've heard, I've heard it all man
Same thing, same shit
I can't believe it
I'm just being me
I work... I'm not doing 'cause I got the money or 'cause I'm famous
This is what I was, you get me?

[Dizzee Rascal]
You can say I'm too rude, you can say I think I'm heavy
You can say I think I'm all that, I've heard it all already
You can say I think I'm rough, you can say you can't wait
Till the day you meet me face to face and swear to set me straight
You can say I sideswipe, you can say I'm overrated
You can slag me off to every female I've ever dated
You can say I'm kinda meek, you can say I'm just a prick
Just say you what you want and what you will but say it quick

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
'cause I'm flyin, I ain't got time
You must makin moves, why you watchin mine?
You got so much to say about my grime
You must be UP THERE, I see you up there

[Dizzee Rascal]
You can I'm arrogant, you should probably say I'm vain
You can say my head swole since I see a little fame
You can say I left the hood, my success was a mistake
You can say I'm under pressure, you can say I'm bound to break
You can never say I'm fake, 'cause I always keep it real
You can say ""so wot?"" I can say ""so chill""
You can say I'm too cheeky, you can say I make you sick
Just say what you want and what you will but say it quick

[Chorus]

[Dizzee Rascal]
Fellas acting bitchy lately quite unsurprisingly
They would love to cut my face but they just cock their eyes at me
Like little ladies would you wish you could express yourself
But violent silences from ya, stops ya so keep your feelings stealth
And wondering if I'm gonna laugh I'm saying don't worry
I weren't invited here, I ain't leavin in a hurry
So any preconceptions that you've got of me, forget them
Please don't let em, confuse you-- I'm gully
And rude, and blatant, no time, in a hurry, impatient
Don't make no more inquiries, fuck you is my only statement
The only answer I'm about to give you:
Fuck you and whoever came with you
Fuck them and anybody related, fuck if I get me frustrated
'cause I ain't the type to hype and rare
Hope I scare em, make 'em fear me
I'm pretty certain you're not near me
There's no need for that
I'm taking time, away from the ? and ? and grime serious grime
Leave the microphone alone, strap and spray some verses with the 9

Dizzee Rascal,"we grew up in the ghetto where summertimes short
straight action, you don't stop for a fool
most use crime as a way to pay the bills
the un-lucky ones end up gettin caught
we grew up in the ghetto where the growing gets rough
moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible
there's not a lot sweet so most look misarable
most cave in to the devil, took the wrong puff
son kick the face but still pray for a miracle
soccastars emerge from the curb
up n coming mcs struggle to be heard
boy.... the next jailbird ??
*censored*s talk murder and they live by there word
shotters keep the money going round
kids goin stray most never get found
iv noticed there a ghetto in every town
the skies are empty because the stars are on the ground

(chorus)

we grew up in the ghetto saw real life pain
real life struggle with real life strain
real life kiddies with real life guns
and real life mothers lose real life sons
gang wars are ruftin on the darf flur on the seeser ??
beef after beef just to be the top geezer
big arms gas, the stratford recs
ghetto high murders gotta maintain reps
what's it all about i ask myself before i swing
more time I'm beefin over any little thing
beefin any area,region or vincity
my ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility
to my bredrons locked up, to my young baby mothers

Yo as a hustler in the city before I came to stack Lord knows I got the devil on ma back so call

What's da word on da street
Did he really slap her?!?
Is true Wiley skipped da country left him?!?
Did he punch Mega in da face for tryin' to test him?!?

I know he won a mercury award and brought it back to da estate
I know some broad's in da manner hate and frequently debate
Da way he makes moves
How's he steppin' is he reppin'

'Cause dey know he goes to Hackney
And dey wonder what he's getting'
Plus I know he had dat Wall St. gat

He got a new era cap wit his logo 
My bredrin's saw him tryin' on tracksuits in soho
I'm buyin' jackets from Benenni in LA

I heard he went to broadway
Limo drive him through Queens 
Is he livin' out his dream is he ballin' be truthful
'Cause he ain't sittin' on da wall like he used to

He used to peel on Volvo to take da flows to Bethal Green
Next thing I hear him on da pirate radio scene
He used to do deja writ an evil flavour

Bought records off target and mix an a-Dub

Dizzee Rascal,"Imagine if I showed you one day I was leaving the hood
Would you call me a sellout?  Would you say it's all good?
Would you follow if you could?
Or would you just tell me get the hell out?
And imagine if I showed you that I found another way
of getting dough without doing dirt-- let's blurt
Would you love me for giving me some hope
Or resent me 'cause your pride got hurt?
Imagine if we never grew up on a council estate
And was country manor raised with a spoon in our mouth
Would we still be making fuss about the East and the South
Would we shiver at the robberies, murder and the crack
And thank god that we didn't have to live like that
Just the image on the TV as we're comfortably sat
Sipping wine, room lit by the summer sunshine
Not a worry in the world as we casually chat
Oblivious to how we would be living on the flipside
No experience, not a clue about a rough ride
No harassment, no boy dem (?) on our backside
That would be *amazing*, still
I know you wonder would make you any less real?
What's the corresponding standing in (?), offering
If you had a better offer would you go for the kill?
Snap out of your daydream, how do you feel?
Does it all seem worthwhile for ya?
Try and put it in perspective
Retrospective of your profile and your honor
Do you want to hang about, or are you a goner?
Come along, think fast, decision time
You've been living in the grime, don't you want to climb?
The ladder of life, the wall of enlightenment
Or are you looking for the hype and excitement?
'cause with so much drama in the LDN
It's kind of hard to find legal money to spend
Generation genocide looks possible
The rate at which we draw for this game and pretend
But we don't know who the real enemy is
Who should be held responsible, instead we defend
A couple square meters of pavement, in the end
What will be achieved my friends?",Imagine,2004

Knock knock who's there? Dizzee

And I kick ass
Kill a MC fast
Knock knock who's there? Bad
Bad who? Boy

Take away your joy
Knock knock who's there? Jack

What you gunna do
Knock knock who's there? Big

I'm exactly what your parent don't want to see on your tv
I nicely, precisely intimadate anyone that I choose
Refuse to to lose
Express unlimited contriversial views
Your average boy or girl on the street might be familiar with my beat
And/or familiar with my sound, I'm formerly from the underground
And its clear, for a year, I've been turing up the heat
Made you get up and out of your seat
Shake your fists and shuffle your feet
And now I'm here
Lets make another thing clear [Overlaps here on previous line]
They didn't bun me up enough I'm still here
So what was the perpose of your little charade, your little charade was whack
Just about hurt me
You should of merked me
I was on a rampage now I'm back
Five stab wounds
Couple scratches, bruises and some pains
Four half-hearted fassies
Four poor is no brains
Did it
Two weeks before my album came out helped me sell double
But lets not dwell on that, its the least of your troubles
[Chorus]
Eh yo considering
The part I play, you wouldn't expect for me me to say I prefer the day to nights where I gotta
turn up and play
I rip-off, dusty, sweaty, clotter raised
And the audience, all screw faced, and promoters don't want to pay
And half of the boys in the croud want to blast me
And half of the girls want to show how little they care about standing right there at the front,
tryin t? look right past me
It gets depressing thinking bout it even more
Knowing that I'm gonna face the usual hassle at the door
Because as well as lippy hags, I hate cocky bouncers
I ain't here to rave I'm here to get paid look
You search me up rough like I'm any common crook
My names on the flyer man, forget the guest book
Abusing your athority you look like a fool
You faulty standard, underdog, you know your own tool
I ain't wearin certain shoes so you don't think I look right (what?)

Dizzee Rascal,"we grew up in the ghetto where summertimes short
straight action, you don't stop for a fool
most use crime as a way to pay the bills
the un-lucky ones end up gettin caught
we grew up in the ghetto where the growing gets rough
moneys been around but its never been enough
most ain't givin no choice but to hussle
some break down when the going gets tough
deep in the manners all kinds of different people
mines over east still struggle to be equal
so many characters, 4 main types
the good, the bad, the ugly, and the evil
deep in the manner where the povertys visible
there's not a lot sweet so most look misarable
most cave in to the devil, took the wrong puff
son kick the face but still pray for a miracle
soccastars emerge from the curb
up n coming mcs struggle to be heard
boy.... the next jailbird ??
*censored*s talk murder and they live by there word
shotters keep the money going round
kids goin stray most never get found
iv noticed there a ghetto in every town
the skies are empty because the stars are on the ground

(chorus)

we grew up in the ghetto saw real life pain
real life struggle with real life strain
real life kiddies with real life guns
and real life mothers lose real life sons
gang wars are ruftin on the darf flur on the seeser ??
beef after beef just to be the top geezer
big arms gas, the stratford recs
ghetto high murders gotta maintain reps
what's it all about i ask myself before i swing
more time I'm beefin over any little thing
beefin any area,region or vincity
my ghetto frame of mind makes me prone to hostility
to my bredrons locked up, to my young baby mothers
each and every creed and colour, ghetto sisters and brothers
if you know your from the slums keep reppin no doubt
stay ghetto if you must just remember to get out",Showtime,2004
Dizzee Rascal,"I'm not gunna pull this off man without signing the dots
This is too sensible for me man
How you gunna have a dream come true ?

[verse 1]
I used to dream about crazy little things like fame
In the days hanging outside the off licence
We used to run around the steets reckless with no shame
Mainly up to no good the whole world would ask us
And when the girls would walk by we would try to catch their eye
And if they didn't show face we would act immature
Had a thing for south and hackney girls since I was a kid
A couple of west girls on my radar I was raw
And I was dead sure that I knew it all
The whole world got my attitude I nearly blew it all
I find it a real big struggle gettin through ot all
I swear I didn't want to listen cause I sure didn't care
Not knowing for reality that I'd have to prepare
'cause money don't grow on no stick, well it's rare
Me and boy was still looking less and less the lick
Plus I was growing up, life was looking as a scare

[chorus]
I like the talky talky happy talk
Talk about things you like to do
You got to have a dream
If you don't have a dream
How you gunna have a dream come true

[verse 2]
I used to love music it was like my hidden hobbie
But I couldn't get on on local radio back then
So I went to north london and trot to tottenham to be precise
And got some air time on heat fm
And then it esculated I was getting ratings here and there
And carried on until eventually I was everywhere
I started doing all the hot spots ministry ceasers palace p area taminin v
I did the grim and the glam
I done the poor and the posh
I didn't hang around I wanted my money in a rush
Mind frame in the studio at this stage
No time to chat I didn't want to n-gage
I found myself a new hustle it was beautiful
A none like the one before a bit more suitable
The more challenging it got the more I thought it
Made an album over 100,000 people bought it
Thank you

[chorus]

[verse 3]
To all the youngers cotchin on the staires in the flats
With the superstar sockalings Beckham in the making
You can go far if you put your mind to it
Your a star, don't wait to be told, just do it
Try to keep school in your plans don't be worrying about your mans
They'll be there in the end if they're real, if they ain't
don't be making no effort to impress
cause you'll find out where you are just do what you feel
Young babymother I got your back aswell
Young babyfathers hold it down for your girl
I ain't trying to preach but for what it's worth
Back is the next generation planet earth
Big shout to the world cause I've been all around
And when I'm gone I'm always thinking about my home town
I'm from the LDN there's no forgetting that
And the big UK I stay reppin that

Yeah, one two, yeah, yeah, clear, clear, yeah.

I'm a young ragga brother from the LDN, 
In my Nike air bubbles and they cost one ten.
Got these beanies on ma lap, and they all want the length, 
I'm a ghetto superstar, come straight from the ends.
An I walk it like I talk it, brother ain't just hype, 
Makin' moves for the money everyday an every night.
Best to believe I keep it tight, best to believe I'm movin' right, 
Keep my business on the low, you best to believe I'm outta sight
I like money money money, girls girls, cash cash, 
I'll let the champagne splash.
Yo, I'm not a gang banger but I'm good with a mash, 
Make you scratch your head an wonder is he really that flash
But it really doesn't matter 'cause you know I keep it movin, 
Middle of the dance floor, lean, I'm grooving.
Baby cocked her bumper out, you know I gotta wind it, 
When we leave the club I'm really gonna get behind it.

[Chorus: x2]
Nike air bubbles on my feet, lookin' fresh, 
Got my brand new garms on, dress to impress.
Got my phone line poppin, all these beanies gotta crush, 
Keep something in my pocket case these fellas try an rush.

Brown eyes, five ten, dark skin, Mr Dizzee rascal, why you even askin'.
Under cover lover, girls call me buff ting, but, 
Used to keep a balaclava restin' on my chin.
An it's the ends here, hustle hustle, bling bing, blow it in, 
About to hear the fat lady sing.
Don't matter what I'm sayin, it's the answer within, but, 
Life's a jungle, everybody wants to be the king.
But it's alright though, I got my eyes on the prize,
Money in my draw, bigger picture in my eyes.
Hands around my testicles, little finger risen,
Every step that I take is a step with precision.
I'm precise, precisely why my future's lookin' nice, 
The penthouse is lovely, it's a shame about the price.
But you only live twice, that's on the real, 
No matter where I am I'll always be the real deal.

[Chorus]

Education starts with discipline, I'm listenin', 
But conversations kinda muffled since I got rich and tings.
Double turn, indirectly spoke, I never heard a thing, 
Under ground or overground, what's the difference I'm the king.
Learnt devine right, its my heinsight. 
I see it all, 'cause I ain't that fake to spread my wings an fly, you're a fool.
Talkin' like you're mighty and you're high, 
But I know you're small, there's no logic in your gossip, 
Just the writings on the wall.
Over ignorant, you ain't got it, you just play far,
Far from the realist old dog, menace, you're a mark.
If you're deep, why you gotta roll fifty to the club, 
Blood, who d'you think your foolin' with that fake crew love.
The streets don't cater for no long term plan, 
These roads don't give a damn about any man.
I try an show these brothers, they refuse to understand, 
So I'll just keep doin' what I'm doin' while I can.

Dizzee Rascal,"Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Can somebody tell me what this world's about?
Can somebody tell me what this life's about?
I just can't work it out

No sense, no logic, I can't get a grip of it
I do my best to understand it but I've never got it
I watch the people slug it out and struggle in the system
But the end result's the same, whether a Muslim or a Christian

There's so much hate in the world we're fightin'
What are we fightin' for?
When the rich keep gettin' richer
And the poor keep gettin' ignored, Lord

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

I took it there and now it's time to take it further
If a policeman kills somebody, is that policeman still a murderer?
He's got a worthy cause, I guess that gives him some immunity
Or is he just another lost soul in the community

To take a life's a serious thing and only God can judge it
Would He look at it, like it's for the safety of the public
And if you don't wanna pay the price, you really shouldn't thug it
I know I'm playin' with fire but fuck it, I love it
'Cause

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Sometimes I think the whole world's gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Fuck it, ya get me?
I don't give no sh
Is it me? It must, it must just be me
You know, know what I mean?
There's no point even goin' through it, man
It is the fuck what it is, I guess
You know what I mean? Fuck it

Who's in charge of this stupid place?
I wanna punch his stupid face
Yeah, it ain't right but it's a shame
Gotta be someone I can blame

Someone's gotta have answers
Someone's written a master plan
'Cause I can't see no sign of God's involvement
This has gotta be man

So much madness in the world
So much evil and confusion
But there's so much good as well
So there's got to be some solution

So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution
So that means there must be hope
Maybe room for revolution

Sometimes I think the whole world?s gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Sometimes I think the whole world?s gone crazy
The shit I see, it don't cease to amaze me
I get baffled every time I try and suss it
And now I've had enough, so excuse me please, fuck it

Dizzee Rascal,"Summer in the city
Such a very special time
If you put aside the traffic
Air pollution and the grime

You be pleased to be reminded
That the girls are looking fine
And apart from money
That's the only thing that's on my mind

Short skirts, belly tops, fake tan
String vests with the bra underneath
So the man's getting hard off
Of half of a glimpse

I got plans to be scooping up
A couple buff tings if I can
If I can't then I'm still live
I go and check
My little yappy by the seaside

Cause I know she's live
Plus she's a dealer
She gives me hospitality
She treats me right
That's what I need right?

And if not, then I'm on
A little mission to Los Angeles
To check my Beverly Hill honey
To see I she can handle this

Pimping ain't no easy thing
And some of these chicks are scandalous
But I'm a player and I say
I gotta be the man for this, I love you

I don't believe in fate
Life is what you make it
Make it great, I'm tryna elevate
Concentrate on getting
My papers straight

Survive the great escape
From the ends I use to congregate
Until I could no longer wait
I had to find the bruvas

Otherwise I would have been worthless
Making fast on the estate
Ignorant to what the earth is offering
When I should take

Every chance and every opportunity
To try and make
Every second and every breath
Of life something to celebrate

So I been around the world now
Close to the occasional boast
Different folks, different strokes
Black, white and asian

All these ladies look incredible
Still got me gazing
Riding jet skies, on power boats
Feel so amazing

Club popping in Ibiza
I got Pacha on lock
Pull up right outside the entrance
In the Hummer, people glare

Then they stop, stare and wonder
Who I am and who I'm not
I just take it in my stride

Dizzee Rascal,"Hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

First up, it's important that you keep your shit original
Try and keep that copycat shit to a minimal
People want somethin? that they never heard before
If it's been done, leave it, they don't wanna hear no more

Secondly, here's another clever thing that you can do
Find yourself a good manager who's really got a clue
'Cause there's so many to choose from, they all look the part
But it's difficult to come across the ones that's really smart

And can stand firm and steady when the label's talkin? shit
Will respect, it keeps it gangsta but does everything legit
And dependable, you can trust to handle your biz
And can really make you sure of what the situation is

Next up, find a record label that ain't full of pricks
One that let's you breathe artistically but makes you come with hits
Congratulations now you've got your deal, you're set to go
Lemme fill you in on just a couple things you need to know

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

Next up, change your number
Change your phone and change your chip
'Cause there's gonna be a lot of people ringin?, talkin? shit
Whether bredrens wantin? money 'cause now suddenly you're rich
Or some dumb hatin? fassies tryin? to take you for a bitch

Yeah, I know it's minor and you can handle it, it's nothin?
But eventually you're really gonna wanna do somethin?
And that's counter-productive, beefin? over bullshit
You can never stop them dumb bredrens tryin? to bullshit

Plus you're in the limelight, well-paid verbalist
Which leads me onto my next subject, journalists
These are the people that could put your name about
So be careful what you're sayin? when you're talkin? out your mouth

And avoid bein? ignorant, tone down the thug-shit
Come to interviews buzzin?, tone down the drug shit
Keep your eye on the ball, mind on the job
And before you know you'll have the whole world on your knob

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

You need a hardback, stern face
Play your position and know your place
Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

Here's somethin? that I shoulda stressed early on
Don't go spendin? all your money till it's gone
'Cause the taxman's gonna want his paper when it's due
And there's nobody above the taxman especially you

And another thing, buy your house before you buy your car
Don't tell no one where you are, even better if you're far
Everybody knows you're gangsta and that Porsche looks great
But do you really want it sittin? on that council estate?

Differently, watch where you choose to socialize
Keep an eye out for trouble, watch for devils in disguise
And please don't be fooled by no pretty females
Play it safe, never let 'em know your full details

I ain't sayin? be para', I'm just sayin? be sure
You can never know if that bitch will be braggin? what she saw
And aside from makin? money, keep lovin? what you do
I ain't saying nothin? more because the rest is up to you

I got a hardback, stern face

Only move when the money's callin?
Take my advice, you'll be ballin?

Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

Sometimes when I'm on my own
And there ain't no one around I feel all alone
Laying in my bed I'm a nervous wreck
And I wind myself up until I'm vexed

Keep telling myself they're out to get me
And I ain't sure who, so I make it up
Come to my own conclusions, I'm crazy
Start thinking up all kinds of stuff

Like, fuck my girl, I know she cheating
That gold-digger bitch just thieving
Act like I don't care but I'm grieving
Start switching up for no reason

Told myself I ain't got no friends
Fuck my people, fuck my ends
No rational fool, I'm low
I'm paranoid, all I know is they wanna

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

And then I think about beef
Over the years I've had so much grief
Whole lot of drama in and out of East
Won't let anyone take me for a chief

And mans say they got my back
But it's really all just chat
?Cause when it all gets on top
They leave me alone to scrap

And I went to the ends, heard whispers
Old friends chatting ?bout kidnapping
Now, they hurt my pride and ego
I don't care about rap, I'm strapping

But the olders told me, ignore it
?Cause I really ain't got time for it
And the ghetto, I already saw it
I'm in the world now, I gotta explore it
I can't let 'em

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

No guts, no glory, no get, no gain
No love, no pain, I'm going insane
It's all too much for the brain
I'm so paranoid, I feel strange

And it's so long-range
Been too long, I gotta make some change
Fuck the world, I'd rather take some blame
Or I could just buy a platinum chain

Diamond rings and other shiny things
Maybe the bling'll help me maintain
Or at least that it help to explain
What's my path, am I in the right lane?

Why I feel so left out in the rain?
Why's it hard, it should be simple and plain
All I see when I'm in this game
Everybody wanna

Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up
Rinse me out, use me up
Cuss me down, fuck me up

They wanna rinse me out, use me up

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

That's that bredder always frontin' like he's strong
Sneaky fake fuck always runnin' to his brother when it's on
Hardly backs the beef, last one swingin'
First one runnin', makin' up stories, he's a chief

Bringin' bredders to the ends, actin' up
Puttin' on a show, tryin' talk funny to his friends
But he's really not a don, they know it
And you know it, so something must be seriously wrong

'Cause you're parrin', his mum calls you darlin'
But his brother has got you shottin' with no way of stoppin'
I heard you both had beef with an older brer
You took a spark and he just stood there

Now that boy's a pussy'ole, say it ain't true
It started because of him and ended with you
And that's the kind of shit that's gonna continue
But I guess it don't matter if that's what you're into

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him

The sun the biggest star in the sky
But naturally it's gotta make room for the moon every night
Everything's got its time limit, even relationships
Everything's sunny when the friendship's tight

A friend in need is a friend indeed
But a friend with no money and no weed
Can flip the script at a ridiculous speed
And make a best friend an ex-friend for the P

A couple of years ago in my road youth days
I was into pirate radio, I guess it was a phase
There was this one particular MC man
Was a older in my ends and I thought he was the don

So I started rollin' with him kind of like a little brother
My cousin used to say he was a pussy undercover
I didn't think that it was nothin' more than jealousy
But I wish I would've listened every time he told me

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He's a pussy'ole, he's a chief, leave him
Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?
Movin' with that pussy'ole?
You know that he's a pussy'ole
I showed you he's a pussy'ole

He's always been a pussy'ole
So he'll always be a pussy'ole
But you're still with that pussy'ole
You must be a pussy'ole

Pussy'ole, pussy'ole
Pussy'ole, pussy'ole

Stay away from them pussy'oles, you can have it all
Live endlessly, tremendous, forever ball
Stand up for something or for anything you'll fall
But differently, know when not to lose your cool

'Cause it ain't what you show, it's what you're concealin'
Put a smile on the deepest negative feelin'

Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'
Stand tall even when they're hatin' and they're schemin'
Then watch your money rise right to the ceilin'

Stop rollin' with that bredder, you don't need him
He ain't got your back, if it's beef leave him

Why you rollin' with that pussy'ole?

Dizzee Rascal,"Gotta keep my head above water
Gotta stay head-strong, keep rolling on
No point getting caught in the hype is long
Like I don't know right from wrong
So I gotta be real
Nothing to prove, I'm still
Big in the hood, I feel
So in control, I'm chill
No one ain't knocking off Dill
So I stay top on the bill
I'm the main event, the headliner
Went from jungle DJ to rhymer
Never thought I would be the big timer
But I still par it like, yo, it's a minor
Cause I still rep my ends, still check my friends
Can I keep it up? I guess it all depends
If I can keep my mind right
Don't get tempted by the limelight
I think I'll be alright

Temptation leads like your naughty mate
The one that used to get you in bother
The one you can never bring yourself to hate

Can't avoid the temptation
But I know I gotta change my ways
And keep my nose clean, gotta fix up
Take a look at my life cause I ain't sixteen
And I ain't no boy, ain't no kid
The world ain't flat and the picture's big
Certain things that I gotta get rid
And a whole lot more that I gotta get with
So I gotta stay and roam on my own
Gotta move on, I can't stay at home
Cause I know what's there is all the same
Crack, cocaine and ghetto fame
Cold hard cash and a bit of a name
And I've see it all, so I need a change
Lost too many bredrens to the game
And you could say temptation's to blame

Me and my naughty friends
Caused pure madness in the ends
I mean day and night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, joyriding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction
No sign of correction
But then I switched it up, changed my ways
Got in the area like, ""Oh my days""
But not my naughty friends, they're not fazed
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just wrong
But it's hard to fight the temptation, son

I don't wanna hear no talk about streets and all that thug from way back when
Been a bad boy, I'll destroy your joy, gotta toy that'll put that shit to a end
That and I walk the walk cause I talk the talk, you got a problem, step to me then
Otherwise don't pretend, stop, breathe, count to ten
Keep on chatting or get the leng
I stand up tall, I don't bend

You got a problem, don't excuse it
You got a 9mm, it's your prerogative, use it
You got a temper, lose it
If not just bounce to the music
That's a better choice anyway, choose it
Cause you know that you can't refuse it
Watch the beat, how I bruise it
Wild out and nod your head, stupid
I ain't cupid, no love lost
I get paid in the end whatever the cost
I'm the boss, still work with me
Don't stand looking pretty like Kate Moss
Put your hands up like you couldn't give a toss
Either way you know I'm gonna get my point across

These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before

Finally, fuck who's listening
The world don't owe me shit and the feeling's mutual
I just wanna be neutral but I ain't no prick
So no, I don't smile when I see you, grin when I greet you
If it weren't business I'd beat you
And I'd rather be a asshole than a pussyhole
You're a bitch and I see through
So fuck you and fuck your ego
Cause I really was a poor little negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback
I'm really from the streets and you know that
But I really would rather be touring
Cause most players on the roads ain't scoring
But now it's Maths & English, I'm focused
And it's Dirtee Stank, so take notice

You're no dealer, you're not balling, you just get yourself in debt
You're a fan of hip hop, wanking when you hear them rappers talk
Love to sit and listen but we know that you don't walk the walk
What's with all the fake aggression, I can see that it's not true
I know killers, I know gangsters, and they never heard of you
You ain't robbed nobody, shanked nobody, you ain't bust no gun
You ain't seen no ghetto action, who do you think you fooling, son?
You should pull your trousers up, you know it ain't your type of look
You're no playa, you're no pimp, I think that you should read a book
And seckle, find yourself a pretty girl and settle

Show me your workers, show me your shooters, lemme see the neighborhood you control
Lemme see if you a boss, and if motherfuckers is scared of you

Are you ready to go to war? Are you ready to shoot to kill?
Are you really gon' man-up or bitch-up? Just tell the truth for real
Are you ready to take a life, walk up to 'em and squeeze the trigger

There's a world outside of tha ghetto n I want you to see it
I can see, I I can see it, I can see it
",World Outside,2007
Dizzee Rascal,"Cause I've been through madness
'Nuff madness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've done pure badness
'Nuff badness
You can't tell me nothing
And I've had a lot of drama
'Nuff drama
You can't tell me nothing
Just look in my eyes, it's all too clear
But it don't matter, cause I'm still here

[ Verse 1 ]
D-the-I-the-zz-the-e-the-e, straight from the LDN
I don't wanna hear no talk about streets and all that thug from way back when
Been a bad boy, I'll destroy your joy, gotta toy that'll put that shit to a end
That and I walk the walk cause I talk the talk, you got a problem, step to me then
Otherwise don't pretend, stop, breathe, count to ten
Keep on chatting or get the leng
I stand up tall, I don't bend
So if you got a crew, go get your men
We can meet up, say where and when
I'll be on time like Big Ben
Couldn't ever take me for a speng
And I ain't saying it again

[Hook]

[ Verse 2 ]
I like to move it, move it
You want beef prove it
You got a problem, don't excuse it
You got a 9mm, it's your prerogative, use it
You got a temper, lose it
If not just bounce to the music
That's a better choice anyway, choose it
Cause you know that you can't refuse it
Watch the beat, how I bruise it
Wild out and nod your head, stupid
I ain't cupid, no love lost
I get paid in the end whatever the cost
I'm the boss, still work with me
Don't stand looking pretty like Kate Moss
Put your hands up like you couldn't give a toss
Either way you know I'm gonna get my point across

[Hook]

Get me? 
I'm still fucking here
I don't give a shit
I don't answer to none of you pussyholes
I live my fucking life, yeah
I live my fucking life 
Fuck you

(Oi rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?)
These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before
(Rudeboy, what's all the hyping for?)
These pussyholes don't want no war
They are just acting, I've seen it before
They are just acting, I've seen it before

[ Verse 3 ]
Finally, fuck who's listening
The world don't owe me shit and the feeling's mutual
I just wanna be neutral but I ain't no prick
So no, I don't smile when I see you, grin when I greet you
If it weren't business I'd beat you
And I'd rather be a asshole than a pussyhole
You're a bitch and I see through
So fuck you and fuck your ego
Cause I really was a poor little negro
Don't need no chain or a throwback
I'm really from the streets and you know that
But I really would rather be touring
Cause most players on the roads ain't scoring
But now it's Maths & English, I'm focused
And it's Dirtee Stank, so take notice

[Hook]

You can't tell me nothing!
You can't tell me nothing!
",You Can't Tell Me Nuffin',2007
Dizzee Rascal,"[Chorus]
Blud, when you hear the sirens coming
I can hear the sirens coming
Better run when you hear the sirens coming
I can hear the sirens coming

One to da two to da three to da four
Line my street, knocking at my door
Twelve black boots on my bedroom floor
What they want with rascal I'm not sure
Took me to the station 8:30
For a fight that I had recently
Say they got me on CCTV
And the black boys told on me
Can't understand why these boys keep snitching
Can't understand why these boys keep bitching
Now I'm hot tempered feel like switching
Can't stand still trigger finger itching
Gotta stay calm, gotta keep my cool
If I go down I'll be a dam fool
Gotta rise up, gotta stand up tall
Can't let em see the end of Dizzee Rascal

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Yo, let's take it back to that old school story telling shit
Get me!
One day I was with my bredwin 'A dot' roaming the streets
On the main road hungry looking for something to eat
Not no burger and no chips that's easily digested
That shit that if your caught, you'll be easing arrested
We was on the robin street I forgot to mention Kate
There was this Breda rolling with us he was scared it was blait,
And he was high
But, back to the story 'A dot' spotted the man
Straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
So we followed him through this little alleyway into the flats
And we thought the time was perfect so we crept up and we attacked
I took the first swing unexpected causing panic
We was ruthless causing agony in public it was tragic
Me and 'A dot' lost the plot, acting like we were from hell
Beat this Breda to the floor beat his wifey up as well
Clayton stood back shaking, wishing that he never came
When from out of nowhere there was Alisha screaming my name
She went my school
She saw it all

To make it worse I'm hearing sirens, I ain't even trying handle

[Chorus:Repeat x2]

I can hear the sirens coming [Repeat x2]

I break the law; I will never change [Repeat x3]
Step into my soul get your whole face rearranged

See me on the tele but I ain't no actor
Running through the streets brave face it's a jack one
Real day light no shame like a lunatic
Rain, hell, sleet or snow I ain't new to it
Show me what you got betta give it up quickly
Lay them on their back if they try and fight swiftly
Better mind out when they come through the manner man
Keep em on their toes like hammer man
It's no joke man woman and child I'm seeking
See no skets no age I'm creeping
Anything through the door cold on the wheelers
Duck from the feds and I roll with the Dealers
Smile with your heart and stand on a senteence,
My last day wasn't like Eastenders
Step into my soul get your whole face rearranged
I break the law I will never change",Sirens,2007
Dizzee Rascal,"Well, it's big Bun Beeda, I built the track
With girls with tens and the bitches back
It ain't nowhere, fans a bunch with these sluts
Just shake your butts and bring back that stack

The mack is back and he's sittin’ on chrome
With a piece of chain or Herringbone or nugget
That don't mean him a real live hoe
You ain't ready to roll then go on then, fuck it

Out them ducats, hoes better recognize
Niggaz better recollect, Bun finna regulate
I hit yo' town, find me a hoe stroll
Leave that bitch dry and head to another state

Me and my brother can't wait when it come to the red
’Cause we about that cash, cash
So if we can't convince ya, we'll take your sister
Hit the highway and mash

'Cause you got bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got bitches that can and you got bitches that can’t
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch

Some girls suck, some don't dare
Some girls fuck, some don't care
I like the girl with the pussy hair
My partner Mike Mo like the pussy bare

Some girls scream, some girls moan
Swang Big Dick, swang Sweet Jones
Go and get the myth out the cobra head
Girl got down, you niggaz scared

I got a young yellow bitch, I'ma sing it loud
With a four-inch corner of jet-mink hair
Between her legs is where it great
And get the money out the nigga when she go on a date

I stay caked up, rocked up
Magnum rubbers stay socked up
I ain't tryin’ to get the wet dick
Hold my good but she ain't that slick

I know you want this high-dollar cum
Bitch know I got money, wanna get her some
Bitch, you must, done lost your mind
The trick's niggaz over there, you better get on the grind

You got bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got bitches that can and you got bitches that can’t
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch

Bitches not flexin’ ain't much good
I should and I would keep clear if I could
But when I do, I just can’t get away
’Cause I gotta fuck all day every day

That leaves me vulnerable for real
All these chicken heads lie about deal
Ain't gotta do it up to make me chill
Find a good spot on the floor and kneel

Know that my heart's in between my fires
Though I can't take when they look in my eyes
Lookin’ for love, that's no surprise
Comin’ up off, that's family ties

Then I hit it from the back, all the way
Slap that back and just lock 'cross, say
Not freeze out without no delay
Girls in the chat, I ain't got shit to say

You got, bitches that will and you got bitches that won't
Man you got bitches that do and you got bitches that don't
Man you got bitches that can and you got bitches that can’t
You got bitches that know they are and bitches know that they ain't
No down bitch

I'm still shady, fuck you pay me
If you don't like it fuck replace me
Oh my God are you fucking crazy
I seen it all no fuckin' face me
Sleep on me, you're just fucking lazy

I'm so heavy, I'm on point all day

Wake up and slap yourself
Better still get a schrap and prep yourself
You ain't heavy yourself
You can't catch yourself
Keep running your mouth, just relax yourself
Doing over class, rest you're ass you're too fast
Can't carry on like that you won't last
What the rass, who's the rass, there's no rass
Over here hits on the MC do ask
Like sippidy do da, I bust a lil' groove and take a plane to Aruba
I got next moves like Lex Luger
But there ain't no cattin' for free, I just do ya
No leg drop just a head drop
I don't care if the bulldog dreadlock
Afro, blonde, ginger or red top it's all the same,
All y'all see is the red dot

Ah forget it, you just don't get it
I got pure figures I don't need street credit
I can pay with cash or I can pay with debit
Or I can do it the old way and leg it
Big up the Bow E3 I still rep it
I still name check it
Nothing but L.O.V
You can't dead it
But big up the KNT cause I said it
Nah I don't leg it, I ride on it
Super sonic, buy land on it
Spend a few hundred grand on it
Still ride around with a v on my bonnet
Making her vomit cause I blew up like tiptronic
We smoke cheese round here we don't smoke chronic
It's no joke, when you talk you choke on it
Tie a rope on it, but don't hold on to it
Puff puff pass but don't loaf on it

Let's Go
Everybody wants to be famous
Nobody wants to be nameless, aimless
People act shameless
Tryna live like entertainers
Want a fat crib with the acres
So they spend money that they ain't made yet
Got a benz on tik that they ain't paid yet
Spend their pay cheque
In the west end on the weekend
Got no money by the end of the weekend
But they don't care cause their life is a movie
Starring Louis V, paid for by yours truly
Truthfully, it's a joke, like a bad episode of hollyoaks
Can't keep up with the cover girls
So they got bad credit livin' on day rate
Livin' in debt when they still don't get
Cause they too busy livin' the high life, the night life
Lovin' the high when livin' it large
And they all say

Money talks, mmm-hmm-hmm, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh
Money talks, money talks
Dirty cash I want you, dirty cash I need you, woh-oh

Let me take you down to London city
Where the attitude's bad and the weather is shitty
Everybody's on a paper chase
It's one big rat race
Everybodys got a screw face
So many 2 face
Checkin their high just like their ready to ride
I'm on the inside looking at the outside
So it's an accurate reflection
City wide, north, east, west and the southside
Everywhere I go there's a goon on the corner
Guns and drugs cause the citys like a sauna
And it's getting warmer, and out of order
Tryna put a struggling mother to a morner
Mr polititian can you tell me the solution
What's the answer, what's the conclusion
Is it an illusion, is it I'm a thug
I see younger die because they tryna live large
And they all say

I've no excuse, I just want you to use me
Take me and abuse me
I got no taboos, I'll make a trade with you
Do anything you wa-ant me to

You need a holiday, come see me
I know you're tired of the same old scenery
And I could change all that so easily
Don't worry 'bout a thing, girl, take a chance
I'll take you to the south of France like Cannes
And if anybody can, I can
We could both shop in the Milan
I just hope you understand
I hope you see it clear
It really don't matter how far or near
'Cause there's no distance that could stop my persistence
Just a few days of the year
Plus I've got clout, so let's ride out
We ain't gotta fly, we can just drive out
We can have a rave or we can hide out
Won't tell nobody, let them find out

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away
Drive away, get away
We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby
If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away

Don't watch my passport photo, I know I look a bit loco
And I know that my Spanish is so-so
But let's try keep that on the low-low
'Cause we're going to be far
I've got friends that really wanna meet ya
With champagne and a whole lot of love
It's all good darling, a Blue Marlin will please ya
And I'll never let your belly get empty
Even when your belly full you're still sexy
We can ride speed boats, we can ride jet skis
I'll show you the time of your life if you let me
I just want to put a smile on your pretty face
If I didn't it would just be your pretty waste
You do look like a girl with a bit of taste
So I couldn't take you just any place

If you ain't doing nothing let's fly away

We can go to the club or hide away
We can do what you want to, baby

I know you're really busy and I know you got plans
But are you really too busy for a sun tan?
I ain't talking about walking down the high street
I'm talking about laying on a bright white beach
With a Pina Colada or whatever you'd rather
White wine, that's fine, just give me a lager
Then after we'll take a truck to the night spot
The hot spot, the top spot, party around the clock
And when we get there it's strictly VIP
No need for ID, security know me
No waiting in line, no high entry fee
Don't worry about nothing when you're beside me
I'll get you lively and loosen you up
Have a bit of champagne it'll boost you up
I wanna move you up, I wanna take you away
So have a word darling, what do you say?

Yo
Alright let me just cool this right now quickly

Super trippy riding through the gritty inner city roll with the committee
Handle your business or handle the pity all I see is lots of titties
I know bunch of hippie chicks that's ready to show me tricks
They doing the splits I'm all up in the mix, a choir out the mist
I'm taking trips, I'm in the Ferrari looking sick, I'm in the Ferrari looking slick
Letting the engine rip and getting a tire
A' grippin' ah slippin' and slidin'
Turning the music up I'm vibing now I'm flying
Lord strap me if I'm lying I ain't perfect but I'm trying
Going super sire and buying anything that catches my eye
Cause I'm a provider getting it in from here to China
It's so minor I'm a survivor, never retire
I'm a black tiger ready to blaze to the fire, live wire
Now I'm rolling through the shires blazing the green to get me higher
Now I'm inspired putting the pressure on the back tires
Making a hasty get away having a better day in every way
Than yesterday, I guess there’s nothing left to say

Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)

Wind in my face, chilling in Versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of gaze looking like car just been paid
Stupid I don’t play no games switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out dames simple and plain
No I can't be contained plus I'm raw and untamed
I'm so far from mundane getting ghost is my aim
I suggest you do the same taking a trip out to Spain
With my girl Mary Jane and she stays on my brain
Like a big gravy train paparazzi on my case
Giving chase cameras flashing in my face
All up in my space gotta pick up the pace
Singing amazing grace I'm in an amazing place
With crazy papes, I ain't like them other lazy apes
I used to blaze the tapes so now I stays hoping for my break
Making no mistakes now I rolling with the breaks
But still book time for my original mates
So we don't bubble with hate we just get on with it
You brothers are constipated and your shit is over rated
You should save it

Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)

Dizzee Rascal,"Today's the greatest day of my life 
Today they're gonna know I'm a star 
They better know I ain't having a bar 
I'm gonna take it to the next level foot on the pedal 
I'm goin' for the gold medal got my hand on my heart 
And I swear down I'm gonna go hard 
Until I'm dearly departed, I'm so excited 
I think it's bout time I had a little celebration and you're all invited 
I couldn't give a damn not even the slightest 
My swags on point and my flows the tightest 
I'll never sell my soul god helped me write this 
Plus I know what a fight is 
I been through the struggle 
In and out of trouble 
Couple of close calls 
But you can't hear the pain anymore in my vocals 
It ain't even because of the pro tools 
In total I feel so complete with life its sweet 
You gotta scream 

Scream it from your heart 
Feel it from your soul 
Scream it from your heart, if you mean it 
Feel it from your heart 
Scream it from your soul 
Feel it from your heart, if you need it 

I feel like rocky on the steps 
I coulda drowned in the blood and the sweat 
But instead I show the world I don't pet 
A world wide athletic champion on deck 
Nobody can't mess with my rep 
Nah I'm a seasoned vet 
And I'm the best I'm as good as it gets 
I'm the champion now 
So I don't care who they call next 
I've earned my respect 
Now they're loving the way I flex 
Run up in the offices they're writing a major check
So it doesn't matter about the butterflies in my solar plex 
Never the nervous wreck, cool and calm 
Keep sharp and focused and stay out of harm 
Plus I can't be rocked 
You know I'm far too hot to be given the drop 
Stay better then I'm never gonna give up the top spot 
I'm keeping the spot locked 
I'm throwing the keys now everybody sing with me, scream 

Scream it from your heart 
Feel it from your soul 
Scream it from your heart 
If you mean it (scream) 
Feel it from your heart 
Scream it from your soul 
Feel it from your heart 
If you need it, ha ha ah, ha ha ah

Boy it's lonely at the top 
But it's overcrowded at the bottom 
And where I come from's overly rotten 
I'm from the east side I ain't forgotten 
But it's bigger than that 
World wide peoples livin' is wack 
It's bigger than grime and bigger than rap 
People living in crap 
No fresh water out of the tap 
Plus they're being attacked what kinda living is that 
Look anywhere in the map 
Too many young boys stuck in the trap 
Too many young boys running round strapped, ready to clap 
Too many young girls fall in the gap 
They're fallin' for chat from dumb cats that need to fall back 
Think about life cause there ain't no re run 
No DVD no second season 
When you're the future flame maybe you could be one 
Till then let chorus be sung, scream",Scream,2012
Dizzee Rascal,"Every single morning
Wake up in the afternoon
Cover up the mirror
Just to get a better view
Been around the world and never even left the room
And I, I can't figure out
Why? So I just scream and shout

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Everybody's looking at me, but I don't see them
Living for the weekend, caught in the deep end
Tryin'a tread water, do it for my unborn daughter
Lamb to the slaughter, life's getting shorter
Tryin'a get high off a quarter
I'm fly in a saucer, my life is a corker
Star, pop bottles, date top models
Middle finger in the air, not a care, going full throttle
Where's the love though?
Nobody cares about that, where's the club?
Where's the drugs though? Front row
Follow the flow, Megaupload
Feel the adrenaline rush, who's the mug though? I don't know

I, I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Living in a bubble, my life is a puzzle
I'm caught in the rubble, now pass me a shovel
Now pass me a shot, and make it a double
I'm a whole lot of trouble and I don't do subtle
It's all or nothing, I don't wanna juggle
No crabs in a bucket, I don't wanna huddle
I've got my own name, tryn'a figure out the whole game
Going insane, 150 in the slow lane
Getting ahead of myself
I'm already thinking how can I better myself
Should I be somebody else? Should I be pacing myself?
I'm high as a rocket, and if I get too carried away
There would be no one to stop it

I, I can't figure out
Why?
So I just scream and shout?

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind

Tryin'a get a hold of
Tryin'a get a hold of you
Tryin'a get control of
Tryin'a get control of me

I believe, I believe, I believe
I believe I'm going crazy
Going crazy, going crazy
I believe I'm losing my mind",Goin' Crazy,2013
Dizzee Rascal,"[Chorus]
All I do is flex, I don't need a reason
All I want is sex, I don't need a reason
Fly out on a jet, I don't need a reason
Every day's a never ending summer season

160, blink and miss me
Super nifty, riding swiftly
Rolling through the sticks
Leather extra crispy, effortlessly
Power steering, accurately, ready for action, actually
Mellow, relaxed and cocking my snapback
Not taking no God damn back chat
Just racking up fat stacks
No ring, no chain, no fat chaps
Can't get no sleep, no cat naps
And everybody wanna be on my black sack
But I don't slack
You don't really wanna see me get abstract
I'll switch up the place like have that
Don't care about none of that rap crap
Steer clear of the rat trap
Some say that I lack tact
But I'm on the map
And I'm setting the pace, I'm on track
So get out my face, I'm on slapping
I'm on scrapping, so stop yapping, what's crackalacking?
Don't follow fashion, just keeping it G
With these hoes, macking, and that's what's happening
What?
That's what's happening

[Chorus]

God bless me, nobody can't test me
Everyday life can't stress me, stay on the ball like Messi
Money and women are the only things that impress me
I stay fly and sexy
Life is a game of chess, and all the girls wanna check me
How much do you wanna bet me, that I never ever let a female sweat me?
Get me
I ain't gotta talk no more, cause soon as I walk in the door everybody stops doing what they're doing, don't know what they're pausing for, don't know what they're gawping for
Bad boy from the LDN, what the world's been calling for, been balling for
And your girl gets wet, stays up in the morning for
Don't know what you're stalling for
Get with the programme, I got the flow and I've got the dough and money to blow
And, this ain't a slow jam, ready to rock and I'm ready to roll, I'm gripping at the Trojan
Never gonna get caught slipping, never gonna get caught tripping
Never too soft on the women
If it ever gets too hot in the kitchen, I'm dipping, I ain't gonna stand there dripping, I'm missing

[Chorus]

International, flex and go
When I'm at home, I stay low
Yo, lay in the cut, they can't see me bro
And I'm living it up, they can't be me though
Get on the mic, I get easy dough
When I'm cutting the cheques, cause I'm C.E.O.
Keep on fronting, like you don't know
I stay repping the Manor, and that's E3, Bow
Stay with a brownin', get around the town, you better hold it down
I'll leave you breathing slow
Overstand, cause I ain't even clowning, I'll leave you drowning from head to toe
Wet, why you trying to put me in check?
I play for keeps, you better know I don't pet
Knock your head off your shoulders, no sweat, watch your step

Play the right cards, I ain't afraid to work it
Brush em right off, when they say I don't deserve it

Ooh it feels so crazy when you scream my name
Love it when you rock me over every day
When I think about it I could go insane
Here we are as beautiful, I'm blown away

I spend about an hour looking in the mirror
As I should, as much as I've been through
It's a wonder I look this damn good
I could probably make it out any situation that you try to put me into
If I swim with the piranhas, guarantee that I'mma probably have a fish dinner
I meet a young girl with a sexy shape
Look like Jessie J, we escapade
Where its extra shade, she make me want to give in
Not take in like collection plates
Wow, all these wars, bras, cars, wall to wall, was all a mirage
And I could lose it all tonight just to show the world I could do it twice

Rascala? Double the dollar
I'm a jet-settin' bredda, more hits than a white collar
But I can't be boxed, flow tight like Bob Marley's locks
I can't be dropped, I'm at the peak and I can't be topped
I'm wilding out, I've lost the plot, I can't be stopped
Pull up in a gnarly 'Rari, barmy, what
Opposite of calmly, I bet I’ll get the party hot
I can't be blocked, 10 years plus running the game
You breddas just come in the game, but now I'm coming again
To get the people going dumb and insane
Hundred thousand people going bonkers in the mud and the rain
Women on shoulders, tops off, shouting my name
I'm all in their brain, why would I complain?
I thought I was the Boy in da Corner
But I'm in a penthouse, now your boy is a baller
I'm living

I was out of my mind
Turned up I was high as a kite
A jolly fellow
I was showing my bright whites
And getting trippy under the strobe lights
I'm loving the nightlife
And getting jiggy keeping the vibe right
Setting my mind a light
Getting the party hype
Pretty little thing in my eyesight,
She's my type
Something's telling me
She ain't uptight
She's giving me the eyes like
What are you waiting for
I'm looking at her back like
Cool say no more
I save my jaw but I ain't playing
Are you fucking me?
I'm saying it raw
She didn't take no offence
I was straight in the door
I guess I hit her with an offer
That she couldn't ignore
It all happened so fast
Like I met her before
But I was so damn high
How could I be sure
Now we're in my hotel room taking a tour

Pour a couple more drinks
Put some Jodeci on
Put a towel under the door
And put the privacy on
We're stinking up the whole place
The weed's overly strong
We should be getting undressed
Now take off your thong
I'll help you with your bra strap
And then I hit you with the long and the strong
And you can make as much noise
Till your vocals are gone
It feels right coz it's totally wrong
But we're just living the good life
Like everyone should, right?
I'm giving her good pipe,
we're having a good night
I'm pretty sure one day
She'll be a good wife
And that's a good luck
But it's not in my foresight
But that don't matter now,
We're gonna fuck till the sunlight
I hit her from the back
Now I'm gripping the bumper tight
Whole lot of banging
I ain't bragging
You would think it's a gunfight
I'm happy that you've come

And you ain't gotta go home

And if it's all the same
I'm really glad you came
You kept me entertained
I weren't doin shit
I got a couple things
That I gotta do today
But I'm great and I'm really glad
I woke up with you today
I probably said a couple things
I don't usually say
And I know you're not a hoe
You don't usually play
You would never just leave
You would usually stay
Never had a one night stand
That's okay
Ain't got to explain
Nothing wrong with sharing long
It's just an exchange

Runnin the game like I was born gearless
Deeper guy, I got the beat to live em earless
Still I know that they still hear us
Only rap, we make an appearance
So I shout, shout, let it out
Remain tear less ‘cause I’m careless
Doing it for the man dem in the hoodies and the new eras
Young ragamuffin, can't tell me nothing
Miss me with that huff and puffing
You ain't ready to buck and get stuck in
You're just doing a lot of chuckin
I’m just doing a lot of talkin'
Are you sick or something?
Are you thick or something?
You should think of ducking
Hit you with that nunchukka
I Bruce Lee your fly kick
Jump up and Tom pop and I’ve got something
Nigga they comin hard for they food
Don’t wanna see me switch and lose my cool
‘Cause I be up with that fool, hard but you have to smooth, I be actin a fool

I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ve been down, I’ve been out and I bled
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ll never back down

When the bumper clean shake the earth right underneath
Kickin' out the devil, size eleven call me thunder feet
If you want a war I’m not the one to meet, I’m not the one to sweet
I’m like a tropic in the summer, come with heat
Not to blow my own brass but I’m having a blast
Gettin' my paper fast
Think I’m givin' a rass, you're havin' a laugh
Competition’s lookin' over bars 
And I'm the last nasty bretheren reppin' the underclass
Miss me with your problems 'cause I can’t be asked
Call Jeremy Kyle, I'm wicked and wild
Your style was kinda mine
You like to profile, you just a child that’s in denial
Now you’re on trial, you should run the mile
Meanwhile I'm flexing crocodile with nothing but a swagger and a crooked smile
Pimp tie could never get rinsed out 'cause I stay freshed out
No doubt, don’t save no hoes
I’m giving her proper, keep her bitched out
And failure I don’t think about
Black tie, I’m suited out
It’s amazing what you can achieve when you pull your finger out

I will fight till I take my last breath
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ve been down, I’ve been out and I bled
I got the heart of a warrior
The heart of a warrior
I’ll never back down

Now now I was way through the fire
Yea yea I got the eye of the tiger
So tell me, what’s gonna stop me now
God knows that I put in the hours
I can’t lose now, I got the power
We at the top blowin smoke in the sky
But I’mma take it just a little bit higher

I will fight till I take my last breath

I’ve been down, I’ve been out and I bled
I got the heart of a warrior

I love all these places, but there's no place like home
I love my city

I go hard in the city of London
I get a lot of love, all smiles when I step in the function
I'm a local boy, I'm from the east side
Now I'm jet settin', I'm reppin', I'll do it worldwide
When I was a kid there was a rough ride
Barely had the money for a bus ride, now I'm on the upside
Having a ball with all the breders I grew up with
A couple of women I'm in the club with
Bottle the bubbly, feeling lovely, women are hugging me
Nobody could tell me nothing and nobody can never trouble me
It's all good, pure positive vibes
For the most part everybody's just tryna live their lives
We're not afraid to die, only the strong survive
You don't know if you don't try, the stakes are high
And it's the city where I earned my crown
God knows that I love this town

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town
Let me buy you another round
And show you how my peeps get down
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

It's just one big melting pot
Every creed color and race, we got the lot
And I love to shop, there's not a brand that can't be copped
No more than a couple of stops
Where should I begin?
Might see me in the west side getting it in
Might see me on the north side getting a trim
South side of the river in a race car having a spin, I just win
And I'm never gonna lose with the city to guide me
Got the vibe of the city inside me and the streets are lively
Got a whole lot of love and I'm connect it
It's 7 million people behind me, don't try me
'Cause right now we're gonna rave it up
Set the roof on fire and blaze it up
And we're in it to win it
There's no limit so we raise it up
We got the dancefloor shaking like, woo

The city lights are extra bright
They shine for us tonight
The streets are so alive right now
I fuckin' love this town

And show you how my peeps get down

On the champagne dance shoot

Saw the rise and the decline
The extortion and the devils on the sidelines
Bitchin' 'cause they couldn't get the shine
It was deep and I could peep
They tried to creep up from behind
Talkin' 'bout they want a piece
So I went and bought a piece
It was a (nine)
Told myself nobody's ever takin' mine
I'll go blind if they ever cross the line
But I never wanted pressure from the swine
Got me thinkin' 'bout my struggles
And the mountain that I had to climb

Why can’t you just let lose and have fun like them other guys?

With their sparklers
And their champagne all publicised
Why you always gotta sumarise
Why can’t you just live life in the moment?
And act like this glamour life ain't just a bunch o lies?
But I’m wide awake I can’t fake no more
Wide awake I can’t take no more
It was fun while it lasted
But it’s the kind of shit I can’t rate no more
Kind of shit you get carried away and start movin’ lose
And get posted up on your Instagram and fans hate you for

Never had a Bimmer

Back then, man wore bubble coats into school and Timberland boots
Talkin' about back when man had the cowboy ting
And the middle bit would spin
And if you made it bang near anything metal
All you would hear was ping, ping

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms
But don't blame me.

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

Don't blame me for falling in love with you
I'm under your spell but how can I help it!
Don't' blame me!

Can't you see when you do the things you do!
If I can't conceal the thrill that I'm feeling,
Don't blame; me.

Dizzy Gillespie,"Black cats creep across my path
Until I'm almost mad
I must have 'roused the devil's wrath
Cause all my luck is bad
I make a date for golf and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life 
Just catchin' colds and missin' trains

Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing
I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

Everything happens to me
At first my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned
I send an ""Airmail Special"" too
Your answer was ""Goodbye""
And there was even postage due
I fell in love just once
And then it had to be with you

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1953

The mystery of their fading light

Across the sands so I may keep

Resting in my arms
Thrill to the magic, the magic of your charms
You beside me here beneath the blue
My dream of love is coming true
Within our desert Caravan

Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

Here I slip again, about to take that trip again.
I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.
Um - I'm in the groove again, takin' a chance on love.

I walk around with a horse shoe, in clover I lie.

But now it's too late.

I thought I'd found the girl of my dreams, 
Now it seems, 
This is how the story ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
I thought for once it couldn't go wrong, 
Not for long, 
I can see the way this ends:
She's gonna turn me down and say, 
""Can't we be friends?""
Why should I care though she gave me the air,
Why should I cry, 
Heave a sigh, 
And wonder why,

Dizzy Gillespie,"When I was a young man courting the girls
I played me a waiting game
If a maid refused me with tossing curls
I'd let the old Earth take a couple of whirls
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls
And as time came around she came my way
As time came around, she came

When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring
You court them in song and rhyme
They answer with words and a clover ring
But if you could examine the goods they bring
They have little to offer but the songs they sing
And the plentiful waste of time of day
A plentiful waste of time

Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December
But the days grow short when you reach September
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame
One hasn't got time for the waiting game

Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few

And these few precious days I'll spend with you

To see you through
Till you're everything you want to be

One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part

Through years of endless springs,
The murmur of a brook at evening tides.

My heart and I agree,
She's everything on this earth to me.

I can't help it

In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend.
But soon the night will bring the pains,
The pain, oh the pain

Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no no
And I go to the place where the good feelin' awaits me

Just for all the lovely people that you see in the road
We'll sing them a song in Jeruvian mode
If I can have a pref'rence, I'll even make ref'rence
To why you write a song like Jeru, just for you

Then if you'd be kind enough to tell me why you
write these extended bridges
can it be romance that always
haunts me in my reverie?

So why not come on over 'bout a quarter to eight
If you can come early I'll never be late
And now you're all invited, I hope you're delighted
To sing a little song like Jeru, just for you

Maybe it's new, maybe it's old, listen my friend

Blowin' away, doin' alright
Plain' all day, workin' all night, listen again

Movin' along, coverin' ground
Singin' the song, lovin' the sound, listen and then

blow together birds of a feather
Out playin' the blues and ""I Got Rhythm""
All at once a moment came without a warning
Got so hot we had to cool it

Go for glory, tell you the story
Out payin' our dues until we found we were
assisting at an unexpected borning
'twas the birth of the Cool

So now I can tell you why I'm always
Trying to tell you, listen, come with me,
New York, and we're together in my reverie

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

High was the sun when we first came close
Low was the moon when we said adios
Perdido, since then has my heart been perdido
I know I must go to Torido, that yearning to lose perdido
I look for my heart it's perdido
I lost it way down in Torido

Dizzy Gillespie,"Tangerine, she is all they claim
With her eyes of night and lips as bright as flame
Tangerine, when she dances by
Senoritas stare and caballeros sigh
And I've seen toasts to Tangerine
Raised in every bar across the Argentine
Yes, she has them all on the run
But her heart belongs to just one
Her heart belongs to Tangerine

Tangerine, she is all they say
With mascara'd eyes, and chapeaux by Dache
Tangerine with her lips of flame
If the color keeps, Louis Philippe's to blame
And I've seen clothes on Tangerine

Yes, she's got the guys in a whirl

Dizzy Gillespie,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows

Honey, I'm so keen on you
I could come to lean on you
On a random bay, give you your way
Do what you say

Gee, it's all fine and dandy
Sugar candy, when I've got you

Then I only see the sunny side
Even trouble has it's funny side
When you're gone, my sugar candy
I get so lonesome, I get blue

But when you're handy
It's fine and dandy
But when you're gone

Dizzy Gillespie,"I've got you under my skin.
I've got you deep in the heart of me.
So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
I've got you under my skin.
I'd tried so not to give in.
I said to myself, this affair never will go so well.
But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
I've got you under my skin?

I'd sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
And repeats, repeats in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
But each time that I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.

I would sacrifice anything come what might
For the sake of havin' you near
In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
And repeats, how it yells in my ear,
Don't you know, you fool, ain't no chance to win
Why not use your mentality, get up, wake up to reality?
And each time I do just the thought of you
Makes me stop just before I begin
Cause I've got you under my skin.
And I like you under my skin.",I've Got You Under My Skin,2003
Dizzy Gillespie,"It seems like a dream, yet I know it happened
A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye
Romance was the theme
And we were the players
I never think of this without a sigh
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street
 
Lover, one lovely day
Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
On Green Dolphin Street

Dizzy Gillespie,"Just you, just me
Let's find a cozy spot
To cuddle and coo
 
Just us, just we
I've missed an awful lot
My trouble is you
 
Oh, gee!
What are your charms for?
What are my arms for?
Use your imagination!
Just you, just me
I'll tie a lover's knot
'Round wonderful you!","Just You, Just Me",2004
Dizzy Gillespie,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
