The Specials,"It's too late now
It's twenty past two
I spent the night just watchin' you
I watched you dance

I watched you move
Can't breath and still I watched you move away
Now I think quite a lot as I stare at my shoes
About all these things that I put myself through

Now there's nothing to say
And there's nothing to do
You're just too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to

You're too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to
The Radcliffs wouldn't come after you
I glance but you just stared me through

Felt such a fool I felt you knew
But you might tell me to go away
Now I think quite a lot of my own point of view
Is that all I have that's in common with you

EMOTIONS SO GUARDED
My heart is retarded
You're too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to

You're too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to
This evening hasn't gone like I planned

Should I take the situation in hand
Can't go on but I can't seem to dance
You chain my feet
I stamp and stamp and stamp

Because nothing I do ever seems to be right
The same dance of mine
Every Saturday night
Out the window

You might say I'm out of of my mind
But you're too nice to talk to
Too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to

Too nice to talk to
You're too nice to talk to
Too nice!",Too Nice to Talk To,1999

Why must you record my phone calls?
Are you planning a bootleg L.P?
Said you've been threatened by gangsters
Now it's you that's threatening me.

Can't fight corruption with con tricks
They use the law to commit crime?
I dread, dread to think what the future will bring
When we're living in gangster times.

Don't interrupt while I'm talking
Or they'll confiscate all your guitars.

They won't make me an overnight star.

Don't offer us legal protection

And only children's lives can break this spell

One day when you replay the slide show we know
Pictures won't show villains and heroes
It's just me keeping time with you
Butter knife dull but it still cuts through

We never were
We'll never be

Strangers kissing in the pouring rain
Chasing after your leaving train
But we know that's not how our song goes
Oh
You're a waitress in a cocktail bar
And I'll save you cause I'm a big rock star
But we know that's not how our song goes
It goes like this

You didn't like my friends and your mom didn't trust me
I thought I was slick but my moves were rusty
Bought you a 12 pack promised you sushi
Sorry if I wasn't straight out of a movie

We never were
We'll never be

Strangers kissing in the pouring rain
Chasing after your leaving train
But we know that's not how our song goes
Oh
You're a waitress in a cocktail bar
And I'll save you cause I'm a big rock star
But we know that's not how our song goes
It

Be kind when you rewind the story of the two of us
Sometimes you wish it was a little more mysterious
When you look at me with your cinematic eyes
I wanna play the part but I'm messing up the lines

We never were
We'll never be

Strangers kissing in the pouring rain
Chasing after your leaving train
But we know that's not how our song goes
Oh
You're a waitress in a cocktail bar
And I'll save you cause I'm a big rock star

The Spinanes,"It's all fighting 
My sides are careening 
Boiling past the point 
At where she crashes 

Heard a tale of lore 
Body is a garden 
See the wrong after it's gone 
All along she's spitting 
Here comes the word so understanding 
And folding her up 

Spitfire 

Buring fingers that's branded into here 
Pass it off to the cut of glass, frozen flash 
She's just asking for what she won't say 
Here comes the world so understanding And sucking her

The Spinners,"Wake up, Maggie,
I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,1998

It's a rare occasion to be able
To see young mothers like the ones
That were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory
To quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated
To those who cherish that memory

Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, ""boy, hurry to Sunday school""

Filled with a load of glory
We learned the Holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring

Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?
Place no one above you
Sweet Sadie, well, well, well (living in the past)
Sometimes it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in a while, she would break down and cry

Sometimes she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds with just a simple song

Oh (Sadie) Sadie, baby
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) she'll love us all in a special way
Well, well, well (place no one above you) sweet Sadie
Living in the past
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love she's always winnin', yeah

(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) my, my, my, I love you, mama
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) I just can't forget
How you gave me love, oh, Lord (living in the past)
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) it's a mean world without you
All the love you showed
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) oh, how could anyone ever doubt your lovely word?
(Living in the past)
Ain't it funny that in the end, it's not money
It's just the love you gave us all?

(Sadie, don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) Why, why do the good leave so soon?
(Place no-one above you, sweet Sadie) oh, I don't know (living in the past)
And though the people say they love my songs
Oh Lord, I'm all alone, I miss her so

Let me just try, just try one more time and say, I (living in the past)

Have you ever, have you ever met Sadie? (don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?)
(Place no one above you, sweet Sadie) oh
The premier of ladies (living in the past)

Oh, sometimes I feel so alone
But I know that I gotta on
(Sadie) that's what she wanted for me
(Don't you know we love you, sweet Sadie?) I know it's gonna be hard some time

Her memory still lingers dear, ah

And from everything, I had ever known
I was sick and tired living in a town
Filled with narrow minds and hate

They used to laugh at me and children called me names
I would run and hide feeling so ashamed
Just for being born, I was just a boy
Punished for a crime that was not mine

Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
Oh babe, life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child

No one tried to understand
Papa did the best a man could do

A child's reality is paid for by his folks
Fancy fairy tales are bought and sold by those
Who can well afford time to make believe
Childhood dreams, can still come true

So I've been wondering, traveling all around
Guess it ain't my style to live in just one town
Still I'll never know why a child is blamed
Ridiculed and shamed, we're all the same

Life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child
I'm witness that life ain't so easy
When you're a ghetto child, yeah

I think I got something to say to you.
It's late September and
I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused,
But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts.

The morning sun, when it's in your face,
Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes.
My love you didn't need to coax.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul, and that's a pain I can do without.

All I needed was a friend
To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

I suppose I could collect my books
And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,2001

Than this commotion

Tell me what to do
And if she wants to argue
I'll remind her that were through

A late reminder
And Post-it notes and marker
Were it not kinder
Her black eye would be darker

And all these brown boxes
Haven't helped me move one bit
In half empty rooms they sit

Stay that's where they will stay
I could never say
I would never say, ""This is over""

Humble from woolen sacket
It's pretty stupid but nonetheless I'll pack it

And this box cutter?s too dull
Other wise I'd end it all

To like it as I danced around

But if it's not them they're grabbing
That would make me wanna shout

And I'd love to tell you
Everything I know and say it?s alright
It's alright, it's alright, that we're alright

And I can't sleep without no one else
But you so don't let me leave me
When I say our love is true
And even if we got no money
We've got love and love is plenty

I'm never letting go, if this ain't 'bout pleasing me

Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1997
The Spitfire Band,"At last, my love has come along
my lonely days are over, and life is like a song
At last,the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover
Every since the night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to,
A dream  to call my own

I found my love at last",At Last,1998

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas
Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

It was the sweetest melody

Am I too late to make amends?

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,1998
The Spitfire Band,"You see a pair of laughing eyes
And suddenly your sighing sighs
You're thinking nothing's wrong
You string along, boy, then snap!

Those eyes, those sighs, they're part of the tender trap
You're hand in hand beneath the trees
And soon there's music in the breeze
You're acting kind of smart, until your heart just goes wap!

Those trees, that breeze, they're part of the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice
You hurry to a spot, that's just a dot on the map

You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the tender trap
Some starry night, when her kisses make you tingle
She'll hold you tight, and you'll hate yourself for being single

And all at once it seems so nice
The folks are throwing shoes and rice

I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina

Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack

Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

I'd surely be Spring,

Say, if I were a bell,
If I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".",If I Were a Bell,1999

Somewhere along the Rio Grande
Sadly I'm reminiscing, madly again I'm kissing
Someone along the Rio Grande
 
It happened in Monterey, a long time ago
I met her in Monterey, in old Mexico
Stars and steel guitars
And luscious lips, as red as wine
Broke somebody's heart
And I'm afraid that it was mine

Without thinking twice
I left her and threw away the key to paradise
My indiscreet heart, longs for the sweetheart 
That I left in old Monterey

That's why my baby has gone from me.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""I took your baby from you away.""
I heard a voice cryin' in the deep,
""Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep.""

Ran in the water, heart full of fear,
There in the breakers I saw her near;
Reached for my darlin', held her to me,
Stole her away from the angry sea.
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say,
""You took your baby from me away.""
My heart cried out, ""She's mine to keep.""
I saved my baby from an Endless Sleep.",Endless Sleep,1964

The Spotnicks,"An old cowpoke went riding out one dark and windy day,
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.

As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

The Spotnicks,"I was born on a farm out in Ioway
A flaming youth who was bound that he'd fly away
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone
Can't read notes, but I play anything by ear
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear
When I'd start to play folks used to say
""Sounds a little Goofus to me""
 
Cornfed chords appeal to me, I like rustic harmony
Hold that note and change the key, that's called ""Goofus""
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools
But the folks just dance like fools, they go ""Goofus""
 
Got a job but I just couldn't keep it long
The leader said that I played all the music wrong
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own
Got together a new kind of orchestree
And we all played just the same ""Goofus"" harmony
And I must admit we made a hit

Down, down, misty lane
Willow weep in the summer rain
Down, down, misty lane
I wish that we were there again

The gentle grass that rests beneath us
As we lay where no one saw us
On and on our lips together
Each one hoping that the other felt the same

Though now you're gone and summer's passed
The echoes of our love will last
Seasons change and time erases
Other people, other places, you remain

Our days were days of love and laughter
Keeping joyful memories after
You had gone and laughed no longer
Love was strong but time was stronger, so it seems

The secret places that we discovered
Now when winter's rains have covered
Still I find my heart will free you
As I lay to sleep I see you in my dreams

They'll come a day when dreams come true
And I will be embracing you
The love that time has torn apart
Will stay alive inside my heart

He prayed to God every morning noon and night
He cared not for the kings decree he trusted God to set him free
And he prayed to God every morning, noon, and night

They cast him in the lion's den because he would not honor men
He prayed to God every morning noon and night
The jaws were locked and it made him shout, and God soon got them
Safely out

North Carolina I did go
There I courted a fair young maiden
But her age I did not know

Oh her hair was dark and curly
And her cheeks were rosy red
On her breast she wore a lilly
Where I longed to lay my head

Molly dear, go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no, come back and tell me
And I'll run away with thee

No I'll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best

The ocean's deep and I can't wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I'll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o'er the tide

I'll go back to East Virginia
North Carolina ain't my home
I'll go back to East Virginia
Leave old North Carolina alone

I don't want your green back dollar
I don't want your watch and chain

At my gate I'll always greet you

To meet the deeds that I have done
Where there will be no setting sun

To be a child of God each day
My light must shine along the way
I'll sing His praise while ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul

The only life that will endure
Is one that's kind and good and pure
And so for God I'll take my stand
Each day I'll lend a helping hand

I'll help someone in time of need
And journey on with rapid speed
I'll help the sick and poor and weak
And words of kindness to them speak

While going down life's weary road
I'll try to lift some travler's load
I'll try to turn the night to day
Make flowers bloom along the way.

Amanda Gilbraith I then called my wife
But her brother stabbed me for some unknown reason
Just three months later I'd taken Tom's life

I went to old England to France and to Spain
But I thought of my home way back in Roan Country
I boarded a steamer and came back again

I was captured and tried in the village of Kingston
Not a man in the county would speak one kind word
When the jury came in with the verdict next morning
A lifetime in prison was the words that I heard

When the train pulled out poor mother stood weepin
And sister she sat alone with a sigh
And the last words I heard was Willie God bless you
Was Willie God bless you, God bless you, good bye

   Back to the girl you love 
   Treat her right, never wrong 
   How mountain girls can love 

Riding the night in the high cold winds 
On the trail of the old lonesome pine 
Thinking of you, feeling so blue 
Wondering why you left me behind

Our hearts were gay and happy then 
You whispered to me as I held your close 
You hoped this night would never end

As I sit in jail and hang my head in shame
With a smile I try to greet each early dawning
But they've given me a number for my name

Many a little raindrops are falling close to me
Makes the streams and rivers just as muddy as can be
It's raining, raining, raining here this morning
As the Mississippi flows on to the sea

How I wish that I could see my little darling
And hold her in my arms just as before
I used to tell her every day I loved her
But now she doesn't love me anymore

She knew that I was guiltless of this one crime
And said that she'd be waiting there for me
But she has found somewhere else to wander
Where the Mississippi flows on to the sea

Its raining, raining, raining here this morning
And I am just as weary as can be
I wish that I could follow all the raindrops
Down the Mississippi toward the silver sea

But there's no way to prove that I'm not guilty
So I will have to suffer all the shame
Go and tell her for me little raindrops
That they've given me a number for my name

Take Jesus as your daily guide
Though you may feel pure and saintly

You'll surely need him on that day

With a dram glass in her hands
She's drinking away her troubles
She's a courting some other man

A shining in the moonlight
Like two diamonds in the sky

Last time a saw little Maggie
She was sitting on the banks of the sea
With a forty-four around her
And a banjo on her knee

Lay down your last gold dollar
Lay down your gold watch and chain

Pretty stars were made to shine
Pretty women were made for loving

Oh how sweet (oh how sweet) is the rest (is the rest)

And I thought as I looked on those cold marble slabs
What a dark lonely place that must be

And in silence I stood by her tomb
And her voice seemed to say in a low gentle tone

This tragedy occured near the little town of Danburry in Stokes county in the state of North Carolina.  It's absolutely true.  This man murdered his family, his wife, and himself.  His name was Charlie Lawson, and this song is entitled, ""The Story of the Lawson Family.""

It was long last Christmas evening
The snow was on the ground
At his home in North Carolina
The murderer, he was found

His name was Charlie Lawson
And he had a loving wife
But they never knew what caused him
To take his family's life

They say he killed his wife at first
While the little one did cry
Please papa won't you spare us
How it is so hard to die

But the raging man could not be stopped
He would not heed their call
He kept on firing fatal shots
And there he killed them off

They say he killed his wife at first
While the little ones did cry
Please papa won't you spare us
How it is so hard to die

They did not carry him to jail
No lawyers would be paid
They'll have his trial in another land
On the final judgement day

They all were all buried in a crowded grave
While the angels watched from above

To the land of peace and God

With pearly blue eyes and with chestnut brown hair
She promised to love and said she's be mine
But I went away leaving her there behind

I'll tell you the reason why I left her there

Hugging and kissing as true lovers can

Packed my belongings determined to go
For many long years this old world I did roam

A stranger came in and he chanced to sit down
While talking of loved ones I happened to find
That his sister was that old sweetheart of mine

Now I am the man who you saw that fateful night
Wrapped in the arms of my sister so tight
She waited so long for the day you'd return
And why you had left her she never did learn

Lifted up his voice in prayer

Steer me on the righteous pathway
Help me humbly to abide
Hold me to your precious bosom
Let me walk, Lord by your side

Several silent moments followed
Seemed that no one in the room
Then a voice it roared like thunder
Look for me I'm coming soon

Steer me on the righteous pathway
Help me humbly to abide
Hold me to your precious bosom
Let me walk, Lord by your side

Such a change I've never witnessed
Tear filled eyes were plainly shown
Gathered there around that stranger
Saying God bless you, welcome home

Steer me on the righteous pathway
Help me humbly to abide
Hold me to your precious bosom
Let me walk, Lord by your side

The Stanley Brothers,"After traveling through this world of sorrow
No one on earth to call my friend
I'm on my way back to old Kentucky
Where I met and loved but could not win

I've always loved you, little darling
My heart will always feel the same
I could never do one thing to hurt you
I'd rather die than bring you shame

When that cold dark shroud is wrapped around me
They lay my weary head to rest
Will you stand around and gaze upon me?
For I'm the one that loved you best

When your golden hair is turned to silver
The master calls your soul to heaven
Where we can be free from all our troubles
I'll meet you there at journey's end

The Stanley Brothers,"On a dark stormy night the angels called mother
The love that we had shared for such a short while
She called us around and said she was leaving
Then closing her eyes, she went with a smile

Mother's at rest in a lonesome old graveyard
On a hill far away there stands her white tomb
With the grass covered o'er, seems so neglected
When the spring seasons come, sweet flowers will bloom

I'll never forget the love mother gave us
As children we played around our old home
I know her reward is a mansion in heaven
While her children on earth all scattered and gone

The Stanley Brothers,"Come pretty young girls give me your attention
To these few lines I've tried to write
About a man who I won't mention
Who courted of his charming bride

And when her parents came to know him
They tried so hard both day and night
To separate here and her own true lover
Her and her own true hearts delight

She turned her back upon the city
She viewed the fields and meadows round
She came upon a broad river
And in the shade of a tree sat down

Her true love being not far behind 
He heard her make a mournful sound
And looking on her lifeless body 
As she lay cold upon the ground

He then took out his silver weapon
He pierced it through his tender heart
Sayin let this be a dreadful warning
For all true lovers that have to part

Is at the old home, awaiting him there

Had an old pair of shoes he used to wear
Empty now the cradle, he used to love so well

Let your teardrops kiss the flowers on my grave

Was always spreading comfort, hope and cheer
And when she used to sing to her eternal king
It was the songs the angels loved to hear

She used to pray that I, on Jesus would rely
And always walked the shining gospel way
So trusting in His love I seek that home above.
Where I shall meet my mother some glad day.

Her work on earth is done, the life crown has been won
And she is now at rest with Him above
And some glad morning she I know will welcome me

who was that brave girl so sweet?"" I covered the crushed broken body and said
""The bad girl who lived down the street.""

And about him all along you know I'm, I'm living a life that's not the same

Why don't you just give me water, and I want you, tell them Albert

And I'm numb with pain because I only have tears to taste

This song goes out to you
As your counselor wishes that I could prove
Everyone travels in twos
Is it the end of the beginning?

Baby burned the house
Daddy found the pills
Monkey bought a church

Jesus called it Earth
There's no one else to blame
So evil was the tort
The toaster and a fork

Everyone will say
The monkey couldn't lie
The jury wouldn't buy
The perfect alibi

Forget about the lies
Your thoughts, your food
Eat them up, they love you
If you cross and you count
Oh, you try to move
This will come back, back to you

As the stone eats the circle
The litigation of your favorite pen
Has the whole world gotten the blues?
There's question marks aimed at you
Is it the end of the beginning?

It could be oh, so gay, Junior

You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people, who
wants people?

The Starlighters,"When they begin the beguine 
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendour,
It brings back a memory evergreen.

I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing 
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.

To live it again is past all endeavour,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play 
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""

(There can be no doubt about that.) Please listen to me and don't scoff. 
All his inventions are off his own bat. there's no such cat in the Metropolis: 
He holds all the patent monopolies, 
For performing surprising illusions and creating eccentric confusions.

The greatest magicians have something to learn
From Mister Mistoffelees Conjuring Turn.
And you'll all say: 
Oh! well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

He is quiet he is small he is black,
From his ears to the tip of his tail.
He can creep through the tiniest crack, 
He can walk on the narrowest rail.

He can pick any card from a pack,
He is equally cunning with dice.
He is always deceiving you into believing that he's only hunting for mice.
He can play any trick with a cork,

Or a spoon and a bit of fish paste.
If you look for a knife or a fork
And you think it is merely misplaced;
You have seen it one moment and then it is gone,
But you find it next week lying out on the lawn.

[Chorus: x2]
And we all say: Oh! 
Well I never was there ever a cat so clever as Magical Mister Mistoffelees.

My manner is vague and aloof,
You would think there is nobody shyer,
But my voice has been heard on the roof
When I was curled up by the fire,

And I've sometimes been heard by the fire;
When I was around on the roof
(At least they all heard that somebody purred)
Which is incontestable proof

Of my singular magical powers,
And I've known the family to call
Me in the garden for hours
While I was asleep in the hall.

And not long ago this phenomenal cat
Produced seven kittens right out of a hat!

And shut out the light
Joseph

Just give me a number
Instead of my name
Forget all about me
And let me decay

I do not matter,
I'm only one person
Destroy me completely
Then throw me away

If my life were important I
Would ask will I live or die
But I know the answers lie
Far from this world

Close every door to me,
Keep those I love from me
Children of Israel
Are never alone

For we know we shall find
Our own peace of mind
For we have been promised
A land of our own",Close Every Door [From Joseph and the Amazing Tehnicolor Dreamcoat],1995

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

And soon miss fanny bright, was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot
He got into a drifted bank and we got upset

O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago, the story I must tell
I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way
O what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white, go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight, and sing this sleighing song
Just get a bob-tailed bay, two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack, you'll take the lead

Say it isn't true and
Don't it make my brown eyes blue

Give me no reasons, give me alibies
Tell me you love me and don't let me cry
Say anything but don't say goodbye

Didn't know just what I had

I remember the things that we used to do
a kiss in the rain till the sun shined through.
I tried to deny it, but I'm still in love with you.

I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,
ever since you went away, every hour of every day.
I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy.
No matter what I say or do, there's just no getting over you.

I can see the love shining in your eyes,
and it comes as such a sweet surprise.
It seems believing is worth the wait,
so hold me and tell me it's not too late.
We're so good together, we're starting forever now.


I miss you like crazy, I miss you like crazy,
ever since you went away, every hour of every day.
I miss you like crazy,I miss you, baby.
Love like ours will never end, just touch me and we're there again.

Just one night, and we'll have to find the feelings like we used to do.
Hold on tight, and whatever comes our way, we're gonna make it through.
It seems to believing is worth the wait,

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

Night time sharpens
Heightens each sensation...
Darkness wakes
And stirs imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defences
Helpless to resist 
The notes I write
For I compose 
The music of the night...

Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it -
Tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing
Music is deceiving
Hard as lightning
Soft as candlelight
Dare you trust
The music of the night...

Close your eyes
For your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth
Isn't what you want to see.
In the dark
It is easy to pretend
That the truth
Is what it ought to be.

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you...
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you...

Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which
You know you cannot fight - 
The darkness of 
The music of the night...

Close your eyes
Start a journey through a
Strange new world!
Leave all thoughts
Of the world 
You knew before!

Close your eyes
And let music set you free...
Only then 
Can you belong to me...

Floating, falling

Savour each sensation...

Begin
Let your darker side
Give in

Can make my song take flight -

Couldn't stay all my life down at heel
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun
So I chose freedom, running around trying everything new
But nothing impressed me at all
I never expected it to
Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence
I kept my promise. Don't keep your distance
And as for fortune, and as for fame
I never invited them in
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired
They are illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be
The answer was here all the time:
I love you, and hope you love me
Don't cry for me, Argentina...

Don't cry for me, Argentina
The truth is, I never left you
All through my wild days, my mad existence

The Starlite Singers,"Night time sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender
Turn your face away from the garish light of day
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light
And listen to the music of the night

Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar
And you'll live as you've never lived before

Softly, deftly music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Let your mind start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before
Let your soul take you where you long to be
Only then can you belong to me

Floating, falling sweet intoxication
Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I write
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night",Music of the Night [From Phantom of the Opera],

And your temper starts to rile up,
That's the time a fellow needs a song.

You can be a merry maker,
If you'll keep on singing all day long.

If you're hanging in suspense from eight till five,
And you want to keep the sense of humor alive.
Just, whistle while you work (whistle)
Put on that grin and start right in, 
To whistle loud and long.

Just hum a merry tune (hum)
Just do your best,
Then take a rest and sing yourself a song.

When there's too much to do,
Don't let it bother you, 
Forget your trouble, try to be just like a cheerful chick-a-dee,
And whistle while you work (whistle)

Come on get smart
Tune up and start
To whistle while you work.

leave the winter on the ground.
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
in the bedroom and all around.

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.

It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched 'til the time had run out.

Make-believing we're together,
that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water
like a teardrop in your palm.

The Starlite Singers,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

You go and save the best for last

When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me

The Starlite Singers,"A lonely mother gazing out of her window 
Staring at a son that she just can't touch.
If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, 
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much.
But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 
'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble.
So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how,
Another body laying cold in the gutter.

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to.
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, 
But I think you're moving too fast.
 
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, 
But he just can't see.
She give him loving that his body can't handle, 
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me.""
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, 
But he doesn't recognize his own face.
His health is fading and he doesn't know why.

But too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray
I pray all ten fade away
Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like his promise is true
Only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew
To bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes
No more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope
Is for the folk who can't cope
Wit such an endurin' pain
That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame
For tootin' caine in your own vein
What a shame
You shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane
And name this day in time
For fallin prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true
Believe in yourself
The rest is up to me and you

Tuesday I am fading
And By Wednesday I can't sleep
Then the phone rings I hear you
And the darkness is a clear view
Cause you've come to rescue me

Fall, with you I fall so fast
I can hardly catch my breath
I hope it lasts

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

I am moody and messy
I get restless and it's senseless
How you never seem to care

When I'm angry, you listen
Make me happy, its your mission
And you won't stop till I'm there.

Fall, sometimes I fall so fast
When I hit that bottom crash
You're all I have

It seems like I can finally
Rest my head on something real
I like the way that feels
It's as if you know me better
Than I ever knew myself
I love how you can tell
All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me

How do you know?
Everything I'm about to say
Am I that obvious?
And if it's written on my face
I hope it never goes away
Yea

On a Monday I am waiting
By Tuesday I am fading
Into your arms
So I can breathe

Rest my head on something real

And will you still love me tomorrow

You say that I'm the only one

The Stars of Faith,"I looked over Jordan and what did I see?
Comin' for to carry me home
There was a band of angels, a-comin' after me

Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home

I'm sometimes up, and I'm sometimes down
Comin' for to carry me home
But but I know my soul is heavenly bound
Comin' for to carry me home

Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
If you get there before I do
Comin' for to carry me home
Tell all my friends that I'm a-comin' too

Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
Comin' for to carry me home
And now they're comin' for to carry me home","Swing Low, Sweet Chariot",1994
