Daniela Romo,"Yo pensé que podría, olvidarte algún día, y no es verdad
Porque el tiempo, no borra ni llena el vació
Desde que no estas.

Se desgarra mi alma, tu recuerdo me clava
Como un puñal
Se agiganta el anelo, la ansiedad y el deseo
De volverte a encontrar.

Las heridas no, no sanan en un día no
Se quedan en la mente si, dentro de ti por siempre
Las heridas no, no cierran simplemente no
Se abren de repente si, cuando el amor termina.

Tu mirada, tus besos, tus locuras, tus celos,
Donde estarán
Me atormento pensando, que tal vez otros brazos
Te abrigaran.

Cada vez que amanece, tu recuerdo aparece en mi
Soledad
Y te lloro en silencio, y es en vano el lamento
Porque es tarde ya.

Las heridas no, no sanan en un día no
Se quedan en la mente si, dentro de ti por siempre
Las heridas no, no cierran simplemente no
Se abren de repente si, cuando el amor termina.

Las heridas no, no sanan en un día no
Se quedan en la mente si, dentro de ti por siempre
Las heridas no, no cierran simplemente no
Se abren de repente si
Cuando el amor termina",Las Heridas,2001
Daniela Romo,"No me vayas a olvidar
Es un desierto del que no podría escapar
Yo se que no podrías borrar
Nuestras caricias nuestros besos nuestro andar

No dejes que se escape
Nuestra historia
No olvides las promesas las razones

Abre tu ventana y la lejanía
Te traerá los sueños que habito yo
Siente nuestros cuerpos y como guardan el latir
De este corazón

Yo nunca podre olvidar
Que tu mirada me ha llegado a enloquecer
La llevo aquí dentro de mi
Mas la distancia hoy no la puedo vencer
Acercarme a tus días
Y piensa piensa piensa en mi
El tiempo va de prisa y pronto volveré

Abre tu ventana y la lejanía
Te traerá los sueños que habito yo
Siente nuestros cuerpos y como guardan el latir de este corazon
Abre tu ventana y la lejanía te traerá mi voz,
Te hablara de amor
Éxtasis mis sueños que no me apartaran
Nunca mas de ti

Nunca mas habrá
Una tregua entre tu y yo
Éxodo de tantas penas besame

Abre tu ventana y la lejanía
Te traerá los sueños que habito yo
Siente nuestros cuerpos y como guardan el latir de este corazon
Siente nuestros cuerpos
Y como guardan el latir de este corazon.",Piensa en Mi,2001
Daniela Romo,"No te bastara desear
Soñar no te bastara
Ahora habrá que pelear
Si amas podrás hoy luchar

La vida es una y pronto pasara
Y tu destino espera
Muévete búscalo

Corre riesgos
Llega a los extremos
Se lo que quieras siempre ser
Vibra vuela sigue tu quimeras
Cree puedo hacerlo suceder
Se sustancia
Logra con constancia ser otra posibilidad
Vive siente
Usa bien tu mente se, 
Hazle caso
A tu intuición

Allí esta la realidad
Las dudas la claridad
Impulsate al cuestionar
Escapa de la obscuridad 
Mueve tu instinto
Y pronto lo veras
Que en un instante
Todo cambiaras 
Cambiaras",Run Run (Corre Riesgos),2001
Daniela Romo,"Que largas las horas que no te respiro
Inmortales días, semejan una eternidad
No parece cierto, se me ha caído el mundo encima
Veo todo menos y que triste es la ciudad

Donde ir como saber, quiero huir no quiero ser
Soportar tu cruel ausencia,
Caminar ya sin ti

Soledad sin fin, un espacio donde tú no estas
Los recuerdos que repaso en mí no me dejan ni soñar
Soledad sin fin el perfume que ha quedado aquí
Un dolor insoportable que va secando poco a poco lo que fui

Como me haces falta ya me siento enferma
Y mis pobres labios besan tan solo sal de lágrimas
Yo soy como una sombra que se esfuma en las paredes
Un mar sin espuma, ya no responde nada en mí

Donde ir como saber si el vació reina aquí
Soportar tu cruel ausencia, existir ya sin ti

Soledad sin fin un espacio donde tú no estas
La distancia que hay entre tú y yo
Un abismo sin cruzar
Soledad sin fin y el perfume que ha quedado aquí
De ese amor que vas matándome
Y secando poco a poco lo que fui

Me siento única en el mundo
Y cuando gente habrá que morirá de soledad

Soledad sin fin y el perfume que ha quedado aquí
Como un árbol deshojándose
Vas secando poco a poco lo que fui
Poco a poco va muriendo lo que fui",Soledad Sin Fin,2001
Daniela Romo,"Noche real que me esciente tu mirar
Un ritual que me hace
Al fin vibrar
Tómame olvida
No hay después
Déjame buscar en ti la paz

Tu y yo reflejos espejos

De amarse

Déjame imaginarte así  
Suspirar hasta derramarse 
Olvidar que somos  
Errantes

Decirnos eres tu 

Escapar del
Día sin herir

Eres verdad

Daniela Romo,"Una explosión 
Un día de fiesta
Los dos 
De dos planetas colisión 
Los dos

Tu descubres
Yo descubro
Que esto es el amor
No rehuyes tu te entregas
Tanto como yo

Y las estrellas brillaran
Mágica luz de eternidad
Somos dos amor somos solo dos solo dos
Y las estrellas brillaran
La noche oscura alumbraran

Solo dos.

Porque el amor es un milagro lo se
Y acariciarnos celebrar siempre

Daniela Romo,"Sin respirar con la
Mirada te quisiera

Que yo siento

Sin cesar y sin hablar

Daniela Romo,"Quiero envolverme en tus brazos
Que no quede entre tú y yo un espacio
Ser el sabor de tu boca
Y llenarme toda con tu aroma
Ser confidente
Y saber por dentro quien eres tú
Como un tatuaje vivo
Impregnarme en tu ser,
No borrarme de ti
Yo no te pido la luna
Tan sólo quiero amarte
Quiero se esa locura que vibra muy dentro de ti
Yo no te pido la luna
Sólo te pido el momento
De rescatar esta piel y robarme esa estrella
Que vemos tú y yo al hacer el amor.

Correr en contra del viento
Conocer todos tus sentimientos
Dos cuerpos entrelazados,
Esperemos todos los inviernos
Bésame, en mis labios hallaras calor
Siénteme, frágil y de papel, como tiemblo por ti
Yo no te pido la luna
Tan sólo quiero amarte
Quiero se esa locura que vibra muy dentro de ti
Yo no te pido la luna
Sólo te pido el momento
De rescatar esta piel y robarme esa estrella
Que vemos tú y yo al hacer el amor.

Yo no te pido la luna-na
Sólo quiero tenerte muy cerca de mi

Sólo pido entregarme para siempre a ti

Yo no te pido la luna
Sólo te pido el momento
De rescatar esta piel y robarme esa estrella
Que vemos tú y yo al hacer el amor.",Yo No Te Pido la Luna,2001
Daniela Romo,"El poco amor que entre tu y yo hay es muy triste
Creo que es mejor que sin rencor decidas irte.
Es por demás, no me das más, siempre me dices no
Y la verdad es que jamás me dices ""te amo yo""
Tan solo yo siempre te doy lo que me pides tú
Luego te vas, tardas de más y eso es ingratitud
Y te tengo que esperar hasta el amanecer
Y todo porque te amo, nada más

Pero no puedo más, se que me cansaré
Es mucho, y es que abusas tu de más.

Es tonto amor si piensas tú que tengo que aguantar
Ya decidí que yo me voy si es que tu no te vas
Es tiempo de que yo también me vaya a divertir
Tengo con qué, busco con quién
Ya quiero sonreír

Tan solo yo siempre te doy lo que me pides tú
Luego te vas, tardas de más y eso es ingratitud
Y te tengo que esperar hasta el amanecer
Y todo porque te amo, nada más

Pero es por demás, no, no puedo más,
Se que me cansaré
Es mucho, y es que abusas tu de más.

Daniela Romo,"Estas sentado frente a mi 
Sonríes sin saber por que, suspiras , suspiras
La gente habla alrededor
Apuro mi café y me voy, me mira, me mira
Y yo tan sola y triste 
Que me encuentro hoy
Dejar pasar esta oportunidad
Y vuelvo la cabeza y lo venir para tomar el ascensor.

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

Me pide fuego y se lo doy
Me da las gracias y después sonríe, sonríe
Se queda quieto el ascensor
Estamos en el piso diez, lo miro, lo miro
Y yo tan sola y triste 
Que me encuentro hoy
Dejar pasar esta oportunidad
Me invita a tomar a su habitación
Le digo que lo pensaré.

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

Esta durmiendo y junto a el
El timbre del teléfono que llama, le llama
Le digo que ya lo pensé
Y luego ya en mi habitación suspira , suspira
Y yo que me encontraba sola y triste hoy
Y el que me miraba sin parar
Le dije que el amor es algo para dos
Y ahora no recuerdo mas.

Daniela Romo,"Ayer la soledad me hablaba
Pensé si nuestro amor se acaba
Silencios en donde había palabras
Dos sombras que no se mezclan nunca.
Ayer la soledad que me rondaba
Me hablo de libertad robada
Costumbres que se van desgastando
Siluetas que el tiempo va borrando

Que tonta soy que tonta soy,
Mira lo que pude pensar
Sera porque sera porque
Te necesito mas, y tu me quieres mas o no
Ayer la soledad me acompañaba
Pensé con una gran melancolía
En la pasión que nos quemara un día
En ese gran amor que se volvió ternura

Que tonta soy que tonta soy

Viaja sin mi corazón 
No eres culpable y yo tengo miedo

Una tormenta que me llueve dentro 
Para mi circulación 
Pero no es justo tan solo tus ojos 
Mueven esta sensación 
Dime que es cierto que eres sincero 
O esta noche yo aprendo y te digo no 

Bastara con dejarme volar y perderme en tu cielo 
Bastara si me dejas amar y habitar en tu cuerpo  
Quiéreme oh quiéreme 
Bastara que me digas que si que me dejes sentir  dime 

Al oído que solo eres mio y nunca yo te perderé  
Grita conmigo yo te necesito  
Y siempre te defenderé  dime que es cierto  que eres sincero 
O esta noche yo aprendo y te digo no  bastara si

Que diga el alcohol lo que yo no me atrevo
Estoy mas que harta de verte llegar

Dios de esperanza, Dios de fe,

Le entrego mis hojas secas, 
Mis frustraciones, mis orgullos, 
Todos mis sueños.

Los mejores vinos,mis segundos de paz, 
Mis angustias cotidianas. 

Le entrego todas mis pasiones, 
Mi guitarra, mi infancia, 
Los frutos de mi cuerpo. 

Mis nueces, mis etapas, 
Mis caminos perdidos, 
Todo lo que florezca en mi alma. 

Le entrego mis ojos tristes, 
Mi mejor sonrisa, 
Mi casa junto al mar, 
Mi cabaña en el bosque 
Llena de amor.

Será que no la quieres dejar 
Tampoco estás en forma 
Para aguantarla mucho más

Ella te va a olvidar 
Y eso no está tan mal

Vuelve a tu lugar 
Regresa 
No lo cambiarás 
No estorbes más, no estorbes más

Vuelve a tu lugar 
Recuerda 
Ya se borrará 
No esperes más, no esperes más

No quieres escuchar 
Ni hacerte para atrás 
Porque te hace falta el amor 
Sé que te hace falta el amor

No puedes aceptar 
Te hace falta soledad
(Porque te hace falta el amor
Sé que te hace falta el amor) 

Pero vuelve a tu lugar 
Regresa 
No lo cambiarás 
No estorbes más, no estorbes más

Vuelve a tu lugar 
Recuerda 
Ya se borrará 
No esperes más, no esperes más

Perchè ero in vacanza
E stavo bene così
Poi la radio nella mia stanza
Le canzoni anni ottanta
Video killed the radio star

E poi sono arrivati I novanta
E ho innaffiato una pianta
Cercando qualcosa che manca
Uh ma come siamo diversi
Così unici e persi fra milioni di bit

Che viene che va dal cuore

Daniele Luppi,"We touched the walls of the city streets and
Dead ends plain, sadly showed us our ways
Of never asking why

Cast down it was heaven sent and
To the church, no intent to repent on my knees
Just to cry

Until you travel to that place you can't come back
Where the last painting's gone and all that's left is black

Grey nights he's coming to me and
Some day they'll punish my deeds and they'll find
All the crimes

But then they ask when they gonna see them
Then they gonna ask to feel the ghosts, the walls, the dreams
We'll I've got mine

At last those coming came and they never looked back
With blinding stars in their eyes but all they saw was black

Fooled them hoping to seem
Like a slave of evil but the product of greed and
It's not a mass so be honest with me
We can't afford to ignore that I'm the disease

Practical since we had to be and
When they were old they came back to me and they tried
Oh they tried

And when you follow through and wind up on your back
Looking up at those stars in the sky those white clouds have turned it black",Black,2011
Daniele Luppi,"Help me through this déja vu
This crazy state of shock
Have you seen the problem queen
She's never far away
Away from me

And it seems all a dream
Some sad luxury
Of when I escaped
It's just I

Can't see through this hazy view
And all the doors are locked
We're only alive when we can be
Defectors from the clock
The clock of all time

She comes and she goes
But where no one knows
And when Her Highness grows
She shakes me

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la

I wake up and you're gone from me
This lonely share of shock
Helps me to imagine you
But more often than not
I'm all alone",Problem Queen,2011
Daniele Luppi,"Lonely I see
Lonely I need
Lonely I feel
Lonely I bleed
Lonely I trust
And lonely I must
Be the rose with the broken neck

The plow on the farm
The train on the track
The tracks on my arm
The train in the wreck

That's when they all sing this song
About when you are all alone
In your home with the broken neck

Help myself to a drink
Help myself to the sink
The dogs start to moan
And the crows start to beg
At my eyes and down at the ground
Oh and it shows
On the rose with the broken neck

Lonely I feel
And lonely I bleed
Lonely I trust

Daniele Luppi,"Make no mistake I don't do anything for free
I keep my enemies closer than my mirror ever gets to me
And if you think that there is shelter in this attitude
Wait til you feel the warmth of my gratitude

I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me, so what's another one
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a gun
Lucky for me, I'm not the only one

And if it looks to me like you in your reflection
Plan to add your own fight to this dimension
Then tell it this ain't no free-for-all to see
There's only three, it's just you and me against me

I get the feeling that it's two against one
I'm already fighting me, so what's another one

Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one

And if your foot's on to sick a thousand ""yes men""
Plan to break into the middle of this little plan
Then there's your plan to hear me say
That I won't play around the way
Anyway, I plan to plan around them

I get the feeling that it's two against one

Cold and always moving
Blind but never soothing

It moves like you and I
In the moonlight
Perfect like a circle
And powerful with energy

The world is an open book
Take a look
Welcome to your own views
Your greed is your own hangman's noose

She takes whatever you can give to her
No sooner
Never judging
No matter how much you seem not to care

There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning

Close to mine
Hear the whisper of the rain drops
Blowing soft against the window

Daniele Silvestri,"C'è, in un'isola lontana, una favola cubana
Che vorrei tu conoscessi almeno un po'
C'è un'ipotesi migliore, per cui battersi e morire
E non credere a chi dice di no
Perché c'è

C'è un profumo inebriante che dall'Africa alle Ande
Ti racconta di tabacco e caffè

C'è una voce chiara ed argentina, che fu fuoco e medicina
Come adesso è amore e rabbia per me

C'è, tra le nuvole di un sigaro, la voce di uno zingaro
Che un giorno di gennaio gridò

C'è, o almeno credo ci sia stato, un fedelissimo soldato
Che per sempre quella voce cercò

E che diceva

Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte
Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte

C'è, se vai ben oltre l'apparenza, un'impossibile coerenza
Che vorrei tu ricordassi almeno un po'

C'è una storia che oramai è leggenda, e che potrà sembrarti finta
E invece è l'unica certezza che ho

C'erano dei porci in una baia, armi contro la miseria
Solo che quel giorno il vento cambiò

C'era un uomo troppo spesso solo, e ora resta solo un viso
Che milioni di bandiere giudò

E che diceva

Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte
Venceremos adelante
O victoria o muerte

L'america ci guarda
Non proprio con affetto
Apparentemente placida ci osserva

Ma in fondo, lo sospetto
Che l'america, l'america ha paura
Altrimenti non si spiega come faccia
A vedere in uno stato in miniatura
Questa orribile minaccia

Fino al grido conclusivo di esultanza

Uomini uomini c'è ancora una speranza
Prima che un gesto vi rovini l'esistenza
Prima che un giudice vi chiami per l'udienza
Vi suggerisco un cambio di residenza
E poi ci vuole solo un poco di pazienza
Qualche mese e già nessuno nota più l'assenza
La panacea di tutti i mali è la distanza
E poi ci si consola con la paranza

La paranza è una danza
Che si balla nella latitanza
Con prudenza
E eleganza
E con un lento movimento de panza
La paranza è una danza
Che si balla nella latitanza
Con prudenza
E eleganza
E con un lento movimento de panza
Così da Genova puoi scendere a Cosenza
Come da Brindisi salire su in Brianza
Uno di Cogne andrà a Taormina in prima istanza
Uno di Trapani? Forse in Provenza
No, no, no, non è possibile
Non è raccomandabile
Fare ritorno al luogo originario di partenza
Ci sono regole precise in latitanza
E per resistere c'è la paranza

La paranza è una danza
Che si balla nella latitanza
Con prudenza
E eleganza
E con un lento movimento de panza
Dimmi che mi ami, che mi ami
E quando ti allontani
Per prima cosa mi richiami
In ogni caso è molto meglio se rimani
Se rimandi a domani
Dimmi che ci tieni, che ci tieni
E se non vieni
In ogni caso mi appartieni
E che ti manco più dell'aria che respiri
Più di prima
Più di ieri

Dov'è, dov'è
Tutti si chiedono
Dov'è dov'è
Ma non mi trovano
Lo sai che c'è?
Che sto benissimo
Fintanto che
Sto a piede libero
E poi perché
Ritornare da lei
Quando per lei è sempre stato meglio senza di me
Non riusciranno a prendermi
Io resto qui

La paranza es un baile
Que se baila con la latitanza
Con prudencia y elegancia
Y con un lento movimiento de panza
E se io latito, latito
Mica faccio un illecito
Se non sai dove abito
Se non entro nel merito
Se non vado a discapito
Dei miei stessi consimili
Siamo uomini liberi
Siamo uomini liberi
Stiamo comodi comodi
Sulle stuoie di vimini
Sulle spiagge di Rimini
Sull'atollo di Bimini
Latitiamo da anni
Con i soliti inganni
Ma non latiti tanto quando capiti a pranzo
E se io latito latito
Mica faccio un illecito
Se non sai dove abito
Se non entro nel merito
Se non vado a discapito
Dei miei stessi consimili
Siamo uomini liberi
Siamo uomini liberi

Daniele Silvestri,"Visto dall’oblò di questo aereo
Il mondo sembra ben organizzato
Dell’uomo cogli l’operato serio
Il tratto netto, duro ed ordinato
Reticoli di campi cesellati
Di cui non percepisci mai l’arsura
E specchi d’acqua poi, come diamanti
Che l’uomo ha regalato alla natura
Forse per darle una struttura
Per darle una struttura
Le strade che si inseguono impossibili
Dei popoli raccontano il cammino
Aggirano i più straordinari ostacoli
O basta non guardarle da vicino 

E noi che siamo in mezzo a queste ali impavide
Non siamo niente o siamo tutto
Lasciarci trasportare è stato facile
Ma adesso ritornare giù non sembrerebbe giusto 
Dovremmo resistere
Dovremmo insistere
E starcene ancora su
Se fosse possibile
Toccando le nuvole
O vivere altissimi
Come due acrobati
Sospesi

Non guardare giù, non so se c’è la rete
Il mondo da quassù sembra lontano e invece
Invece è un attimo e lo sai
Rifinirci dentro
E devo stare attento
A non sbagliare ancora
A non sbagliare
A non sbagliare

E c’è una strada sottilissima
Che non riesco più a vedere
Se continui ad aggrapparti rischiamo di cadere
Di cadere oppure fingere un’altra acrobazia
Questione di equilibrio
L’equilibrio è una filosofia
Dovremmo resistere
Dovremmo insistere
E starcene ancora sù
Se fosse possibile
Toccando le nuvole
O vivere altissimi
Come due acrobati
Sospesi

Il tempo
Non passa
Rallenta
Si ferma
È il vento
Che conta
Che canta

Disobbedire alla gravità

Non credo che sia grave

Non rischi di cadere

Per essere certi 
Di non ritrovarsi a rimpiangere niente 
Si riempiono gli occhi
Le mani ed il ventre
Di occhi, di mani e di malto
Poi vanno all'assalto di un altro locale
Di un'altra avventura e di un altro bicchiere
In cui sciogliere un altro frammento di vita e poi bere

Rientrano tutte le notti
Ogni volta più sfatti
Dei loro misfatti ricordano niente
La luce del giorno gli azzera la mente
La luce di un giorno qualunque
Per loro comunque si tratta di ore
Da vivere in fretta
O da fare passare
Che la sera è vicina e qualcosa bisognerà fare

Non ricordo bene se ci siamo visti prima
Ma tu riempimi il bicchiere
Che fra poco la mattina arriverà

Not a brokenhearted mess
And I love to watch you rolling all alone

This is just another day

And I love to let it turn and turn and turn
And make it last

Di essere persi
E di non ritrovarsi ad avere più niente

O comunque un pensiero distratto

Piene di persone sole
Se ci sono le parole allora usale, usale

Chissà l'effetto che fa il sale sulla mia salute
Il sale da cucina che sa levitare la pressione
Sale la tensione se si sente male il commensale
Se ci sono le persone allora usale, usale

Chi carbonato
Siamo sale della terra

Miniere di sale
Vedo ancora processare
Le streghe di salem
La mia rabbia non si può inabissare
Come ingoiare sale e curry
Vedi che risale
Sulla trota versiamo sempre un pacco di sale sano
E se accecato domani vi giuro sale sano

Come nel deserto
Ramsete
Brindiamo finchè ribaltiamo l'asse cartesiano

Sulla salaria, sulla salaria
Aria marcia che sale
Facciamo a piedi le strade
Come cambia la marcia del sale
Da quando esistono le saliere
Sono diventati tutti agitatori
Io voglio volare con le canzoni
Non mettere salieri sulla coda 
Delle fazioni

Con tutto il sale che ho sulla coda divento
Caustico come la soda
Col poco sale che ho nella capa
Non ci condisco le cime di rapa
Sono di sale le statue che vedi
Talmente basali che dormono in piedi
Ma i sali che perdi sudando stasera
Posso trovarli scavando in miniera

E non porta male
Come il sale che versi

Lo senti che siaamo nell'avanguardia

Sa legittimare il gesto

Quella che fa male di sicuro
Ti sale un odio che altro che sodio col suo cloruro

Non c'è alcun problema
L'ho già fatto

Non tutti i sali vengono per cuocere

Se metti i soldi in tasca te li levano

Daniele Silvestri,"La mia casa è a Lisbona
A metà di una collina
Dove l’aria è sempre buona
In una piccola stradina che si inerpica
Guidata da rotaie
Che spariscono a ogni curva
E resistono alla furba ammaliazione del progresso
Che qui tanto non disturba neanche adesso
Questione di contesto e di cultura
La mia casa è una finestra in miniatura
E dopo i tetti in lontananza, il mare aperto

La mia casa è Marrakech
In quella piazza sgangherata
Così bella da sembrare una pittura
Così forte da restarti appiccicata
Pure essendo totalmente priva di un'architettura
E questa cosa nessuno mai l’ha spiegata
Che quella piazza lì non è fatta di niente
Solo di polvere e di musica, e di gente colorata
Casa mia è là, e c’è sempre stata

La mia casa è in un ostello di Berlino
Chiaramente riadattato come tutto
In questo splendido casino organizzato
Dove niente è come sembra
O perlomeno niente è più com’era stato
E tutto quanto intorno me lo insegna
Che il passato che è già stato fatto a pezzi come un muro
Qualcosa ne è rimasto per orgoglio tutto il resto invece
È proiettato nel futuro
Se poi verrà il momento in cui ci vuole il sole
E un vento che ti chiama
Casa mia sarà una cava a Favignana
Tra due ali di farfalla
Una bianca come il tufo e dolce
Quasi come l’altra è dura e gialla

La mia casa è a Camden Town
Nella Londra dei canali
Dei mercati sempre pieni
Degli inglesi sempre strani
Dei vinili che nascondono tesori mai sentiti
La mia casa allora affaccia sul Tamigi
E forse è molto più lontana e in cima agli scalini di (?)
Forse casa mia è a Parigi
Tra la bastiglia e il Bataclan
Sì, casa mia è a Parigi
Tra la Bastiglia e Notre-Dame

Perché ho amato mille volte
E mille volte ho cominciato
E ho lasciato mille pezzi del mio cuore
Sul sagrato delle chiese
Nel cortile abbandonato di un compound sud sudanese
Sul tortuoso muro a secco gallurese
Su di un ponte chilometrico di Istanbul, magnifica e geniale
Che riesce a trasformare il mare in fiume e viceversa
Il fiume in mare

Nella mia casa è tutta Roma
Perché è qui che sono nato
In mezzo ai preti, i gladiatori, gli avvocati, i senatori
I tassinari, gli impiegati, le bariste, gli artigiani
I rigattieri, i poliziotti, i cravattari, le puttane
E le duemila fontanelle per le strade
Dove l’acqua scorre sempre e non si ferma

Come se fosse eterna

Non voglio certamente rovinarti questo viaggio che però
Dovrà finire prima o poi
Dovrà finire e non finisce mai
Dovrà finire e non finisce mai
Non torni mai, tu non ritorni mai
Non torni mai, cosa cazzo fai

È il minimo che se dipendeva da me
Manco per sogno rimanevo solo senza di te
Infatti rosico
Come un facocero
Mi irrito perché chiedi poco di me
Che invece fingo e minimizzo con te
Che mi confondi con un monaco
Ma mica basta, l'abito

Ma sono solo pochi giorni
Sono solo pochi giorni, solo

È tipico di te che ti fidi di me
Che non mi fido quando dici che ti fidi di me

(feat. Daniella D'Ambrosio)
(The Specials)

Out of bed at eight AM 
Out my head by half past ten 
Out with mates and dates and friends 
That's what I do at weekends 

I can't talk and I can't walk 
But I know where I'm going to go 
I'm going watch my money go 
At the Locarno

When my feet go through the door 
I know what my right arm is for 
Buy a drink and pull a chair 
Up to the edge of the dance floor 

Bouncers bouncing through the night 
Trying to stop or start a fight 
I sit and watch the flashing lights 
Moving legs in footless tights 

I go out on Friday night
And I come home on Saturday morning 
I go out on Friday night
And I come home on Saturday morning 

I like to venture into town 
I like to get a few drinks down 
The floor gets packed the bar gets full 
I don't like life when things get dull 

The hen party have saved the night 
And freed themselves from drunken stags 
Having fun and dancing
In a circle round their leather bags 

I go out on Friday night
And I come home on Saturday morning 
I go out on Friday night
And I come home on Saturday morning 

But two o'clock has come again 
It's time to leave this paradise 
Hope the chip shop isn't closed 
Cos' their pies are really nice 

I'll eat in the taxi queue 
Standing in someone else's spew 
Wish I had lipstick on my shirt 
Instead of piss stains on my shoes 

I go out on Friday night
And I come home on Saturday morning 
I go out on Friday night
And I come home on Saturday morning 

I go out on Friday night

The weeds are hot in my front yard
But it's Friday night and I don't really care

The moon is out, the crickets loud
A train went by, but it's gone now
So up and down the street, I sit and stare

You could say there's not much here for us
Nothing but a pile of dirt and dust

There ain't no band playing ""Ramblin' Man""
No cowboys kicking old beer cans
Just a couple of cherry Cokes and a mix CD

Married you and settled down
With a picket fence & would've had a couple kids by now

Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

Summer came like cinnamon
So sweet,
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete.

Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate.

You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down.

You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.

Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside,
(just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Got to love that afro hair do.

Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change.

You turn sweet in the nick of time

Danielle Bradbery,"She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati
On a snow white Christmas Eve
Going home to see her mama and her daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low
On faith and gasoline
It'd been a long hard year
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention
She was going away too fast
And before she knew
She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both her lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even had time to crash
She was so scared she threw her hands up in the air

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on
So Jesus take the wheel

It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder
And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray
She said I'm sorry for the way
I've been living my life
I know I've got to change
So from know on tonight

Jesus take the wheel
Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on my own
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

Life is like a costume party
Just cover the floors in Cavalli
Let's hide the hurt in a molly
We're all tryna be somebody else
You can't hide your tears in wealth
When your heart knows you hate yourself
It's all pain we felt
Just the way that the card's been dealt

Cover up all that is passed
Drop an olive in your glass
Putting on a disguise
It's an ocular vice
Everyone on the run
Fifty feet all on the gas
Take him out, take him out
Gonna take him out

We're the only theory they can't prove
And we don't have anything to lose

In my eyes, in my ears, bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
Can we make it out right now
It's a full meltdown

Try to break her spirit so it shouldn't be surprisin'
We're here with no fear and gave her uprising
Gonna blend in with the bullies and the bureaucrats
Arrows pierce like lightning, choppers sound like thunder clap
Never will you stand, we gon' lay you down
Dominant and dapper kids comin' in to take the town
Try to restrain us, even though you trained us
We're better than you are, now we're gonna make you feed us

Cover up all that is passed
Drop an olive in your glass
Putting on a disguise

Fifty feet all on the gas
Take him out, take him out

We're all lookin' for status
Cristal sent over on gratis
Can't pretend we're not plastic
When these poker faces take practice
Who to trust? Who to love?
Who to run from? Who to hug?
Set fire to a government of thugs
Respect only comes from the money or your blood

We're out of sight, shadows of light
They're closing in and I know where we're goin'
But I don't know who I'll be

In my eyes, in my ears, bring might
Love is only figured once in life
Tell the crowd, search the town
Can we make it out right now
It's a full meltdown

I can't see

Danielle Howle,"She grew up with
The children of the stars
In the Hollywood hills and the boulevard
Her parents threw big parties
Everyone was there
They hung out with folks like
Dennis hopper, Bob Seeger, sonny and Cher

Now, she feels safe
In this bar on Fairfax
And from the stage I can tell that
She can't let go and she can't relax
And just before
She hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullaby, I sing

Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye

She still lives with her mom
Outside the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her
She's so pretty
But she'd be a whole lot prettier
If she smiled once in a while
`cause even her smile
Looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils
In this angel town

But, everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be all right
Rockabye, rockabye
Rockabye

I told her I ain't so sure
About this place
It's hard to play a gig in this town
And keep a straight face
Seems like everyone here's got a plan
It's kind of like Nashville with a tan, but,

Are people just like you and me
They smile and wave and don't complain
On each dollar that they make

Sneak in to kiss their kids goodnight
Others work a long hard day
And still make time for PTA

When we get tired we get tough
But that's the way that we grew up

I was taught to work hard, play hard but pray harder
Well, I was prayin' about to get there quick
You got to build it brick by brick

I'm thankful that my mom and dad
Loved with everything they had
But let me make my own mistakes
That's the biggest gift they could've gave

There's something to be said about
Straight on knees and falling down
Getting' right back up again
And givin' all you have to give

Leaves you with nothin' but a long scar down

A thorn in my pride

And what happened to paradise
Stolen away and I can't replace it now

Pig pods

No longer worthy
To be called your son
But papa runs to me

And in his arms

Rings and sandals
For my bloody feet

And let us all have a feast

But now is alive again

As a dog returns
To his vomit

I turn my eyes from all
The worthless things and

As we ride this boat of hide
All eagle-eyed and dignified
Down the river, across the great divide

Words beside at the highest of tides
With my bonafide bride, she's my touring guide
And yes, we both do reside
On this riverside where we hide

Vacation's a lot of work
But here we are with ringing bells
And floating on this cockleshell
My pal grins, hugs the wind and sighs

We realize with our blank minds aside
Only to see the mystery of many books floating free
And those books are free indeed
There's one caught in the weed, let's get it

Go get that lovely book
Let's grab those lovely books
Gather up all these books
We're gettin' looks, looks
We're gettin' the looks

These lovely bloody books
Arms full of lovely books
Freely collecting books
We're getting funny looks

While we are stacking, organizing, filing
Piling way up high and rising
Dewey dusty, decimalizing
Sorting, tracking, systemizing

Can't believe we found this vintage
We now have such great advantage
Great they'll look in our library
Let's get goin?, let us hurry now, now, now, now

Hey, hey, hey, what do they say
Collections sit and beg to play
Wanting to give, and speak with us
But neatly packed and nicely put away

What to do for I've heard they are good
But we've also been told they can't be understood
By simpletons like me, and should never be
So why try

Crack in to all those books

We open up these books
We takin? looks, looks
We're takin? a look

Time to hit the books
The lovely bloody books
Arms full of lovely books
Open up all these books

It's got the words of one who made the river
Blood that's flowing through the soil
I got books, I just don't read them
Cleaning scraps up from the table

Flippin? through with fingers pointing
At the letter and the numbers
Straining eyes and feeling better
Wonderin? how to be members, how now, how now

And I'm turning the page while on center-stage
It is starting to sink and I'm to the brink
With my plans in pencil, while the vision's in ink
What to think

My left brain tells me I'm a fool
My right brain tells me it's true, true
I only am knowing one thing
I like hearing good news, it's true, it's true, it's true

And it's false gonna cost myself for these books
Taking one second look
Gonna call my counselor now he's gonna clear
Clear confusion then explain everything

These books steer our ship with good news
For now I got nothing to lose
My brother remembers a thousand
I can't quote you one line

But, oh now I shall know all of your ways
With warm cockles in to my heart
And dancing to hits and skipping around
Around on unsinkable ships

Fim da paz de vez

Ou dez pras três

É muito cedo

Na minha frente
Crescendo capim

Tava na curva de rio
Dei o fora, até que enfim
Hoje o vento mudou
Melhor assim
Eu tava um

Mulambento
Um vira-lata aflito
Animal sarnento
Cão sem dono

Xexelento
Sem nem abrir o bico
Desatento
Chão meu trono

Sincero, não me via e ninguém
Me entrego e cada dia pior
Nem quero alugar você também
Mas eu tive encoberto, uma sombra, um nó

Pagando mico sem perceber
Cruz-credo, já me sinto melhor
Pensando no que dá pra fazer
Pra sacudir a fuligem e o pó

Parece até que é delírio
É melhor aproveitar
Vai saber quanto tempo
Isso vai durar

Ainda assim acredito
É melhor correr atrás
Contornar a dor
Pra nunca mais
Ficar um

Danilo Moraes,"Lá vai o poeta
(Danilo Moraes)


Cheio de querer saber
De querer ser, querer dizer
Que de querer nem vê

Vem com peito estufado
Cabelinho encebado
Olhar blasé

Todo todo, ele é o artista
Romancista, roteirista
Série de TV

Pé de cana é o capeta
Faz barulho, arruma treta
Arma o auê

Lá vai o poeta
Sua cura
Viatura
Quem atura
Não sossega

Outra noite inteira
Com os mendigos
Com os noinhas
Com os polícias

sé que no debo buscarte
perdona si te desperté

no cuelgues te lo ruego
sólo te quiero explicar
mis noches de desvelo
pienso en ti a cada instante
nunca podré olvidarte

Necesitaba llamarte
why saber como te iba, 
necesitaba escucharte
para sentir que eras mía.
necesitaba llamarte
dejando a un lado el orgullo
necesitaba decirte
que yo seré siempre tuyo
necesitaba escucharte.

Dijiste que todo acabó
que entre los dos todo ha muerto,
por eso fue que te llamé 
quería hablar de lo nuestro,

y como siempre tu,
tan segura de tus besos 
y de tu calor,
que nunca dices cuando volveras

Y yo, como siempre Atormentado 
cuando tu no estas,
prisionero del silencio 
y de esta soledad,
que dejas aqui a mi lado 
sin pensar

Que yo no se 
como vivir sin ti

Preciosa tu
no te alejes nunca de este
pobre corazon
que depende de tu risa
que es mi bendición
y que alumbra el lado oscuro del amor uohoho

Preciosa que
hago para escapar de tu recuerdo si
cada vez que no estas cerca
yo no puedo hacer,
otra cosa que extrañarte
y en mis dias solo se pensar en ti

Voy a buscar las mil maneras
de hacerte feliz,
y que algun rayo de luz
por fin te ate a mi
porque no queda nada si no estas

Es que aun no se
como vivir sin ti",Preciosa,2006

For you I sigh, for you dear only

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms

Of paradise, where roses grew

Sack the town, and rob the tower, and steal the alphabet 
Close the door and bar the gate, but keep the windows clean 
God's alive inside a movie! Watch the silver screen! 

Rum was served to all the traitors; pygmies held themselves in check 
Bloodhounds nosed around the houses, down dark alleys sailors crept 
Six bells struck, the pot was boiling - soup spilled out on passers-by 
Angels mumbled incantations, closely watched by God on high 

Lightning struck out - fire and brimstone! Boiling oil and shrieking steam! 
Darkness struck with molten fury, flashbulbs glorified the scene 
Not a man who had a finger, not a man who could be seen 
Nothing called (not name nor number) - Echo stormed its final scream 

Daybreak washed with sands of gladness, rotting all it rotted clean 
Windows peeped out on their neighbors, inside fireside bedsides gleam

Danity Kane,"Lately, I've been tryin' to fight whatever's pulling us under
It's got a hold and really making me wonder
What it takes to get through
I gotta stick with you, my baby
Baby, tell me
Maybe I'm foolishly overreacting
But being without you I can't imagine
It's just too close to the heart, and
And I won't stand it if were broken apart

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now
When the chips are down
It seems like it's so hard for you to move ahead
Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

We've been cutting it close with the backwards and forwards
It's rocking the boat; we gotta get control of this
Let's take it back to three years ago
When you said that we could make it through whatever, ever
And to me it sounded like you meant forever, ever
Leaving was not an option, baby, never, never
Now don't you believe in a love that's worth a fight
In you is everything that I'm missing
So give us a chance

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now

Just know that I am by your side
There ain't no ifs, buts, or maybes
I'm gonna stay down and ride for you, baby

Don't you dare tell me we gotta let it go
We been on top for too long just to let it go under
I don't wanna hear that
I just can't hear that
And know
Wherever you wanna take me
I'll go
I been with you for too long to start over with another
I know that you hear me
Just tell me you hear me

Do you hear me?
Baby, ya gotta believe in the things that make you and me win together
Don't you throw in the towel
I'm keeping my promise to you; I got ya back now

I reach out for you but you're not there
So I stood waiting in the dark
With your picture in my hands
Story of a broken heart

Stay with me, don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me and hold me close
Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what it's like without you
So stay with me, just stay with me

I'm trying and hoping for the day
When my touch is enough to take the pain away
Cause I've searched for so long, the answer is clear
We'll be okay if we don't let it disappear

Stay with me, don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me, hold me close
Because I've built my world around you
And I don't wanna know what it's like without you
So stay with me, just stay with me

I've searched my heart over so many many times
No, you and I is like no stars to light the sky at night
Our picture hangs up to remind me of the days
You promised me we'd always be and never go away
That's why I need you to stay

Stay with me, don't let me go
Cause I can't be without you
Just stay with me and hold me close

When the red light comes on I transform!

Look in my eyes covered in Maybeline
Looking like something fresh out of a magazine
I can be part of your deepest fantasies
You're the detective
Come solve my mystery

Some say that love,is all that I'm missing
Some call it Jezebel
I call it attention
But what they don't know
They can't even imagine
Say I don't have self-esteem
But its my passion

Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl, a bad girl)

I can be your addiction if you wanna
Get hooked on me
I, I can be your addiction if you wanna
Get hooked on me
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl, a bad girl)

When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform
When the red light comes on I transform

Something about me has got you hypnotized
Examine my body like you're the science guy
Watching my every move, you anticipate
What you're thinking about boy, I can re-create

Some say that love, is all that I'm missing
Some call me Jezebel
Call it attention
But what they don't know
They can't even imagine
Say I don't have self-esteem
But its my passion

Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)
Maybe I'm just a (bad girl, a bad girl)

I hope you looking for a
B-A-D C-H-I-C
Looking so sexy
Make 'em pay me
She not me, cause there just one me
I'm the M to the I double S, Y, E
When the lights come on I tran-transform
Gimme that, baby come, come on!
I could do it all night to the break of dawn
On, on, and on
I keep on going
They call me a Jezebel
'Cause I freaks, I does it well
Got extensions in my hair
Bad girls, is ya'll up in hurr
Tonight we gon' just let it do what it do
I can flip this pretty young thing on you
I ain't looking for attention I just want you
Lemme be your addiction, I can be that too

I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me
I, I can be your addiction if you wanna get hooked on me

Maybe I'm just a (bad girl)

When the red light comes on I transform

From a caterpillar to a butterfly
I know I got something that you gonna like
Don't be afraid I won't let you down
I'm the one that'll make you come around

When I’m not the one you’re into (tell me)
But you know you are (tell me tell me)

'Cause when I’m giving you all my heart, my soul
You tell me it’s not enough (tell me it's not enough)
When I’m looking for something soft and sweet (tell me)
You’re giving it to me rough (tell me tell me)
One minute, you build me up (me up)
Next minute, you let me fall
So baby don’t lead me on (don't lead me)
Baby just turn me on (tell me tell me)

Tell me how you want me (turn me on)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight (tonight)
Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight (tell me tell me)

'Cause you don’t know
Don’t even know the half
Just take your time
Get to know who I am
'Cause you can have it your way
But I need to know you deserve it
When I look in your face
Just tell me which way you want it

Tell me how you want me
Tell me, tell me
Tell me how you want me tonight (I need you to tell me)
Tell me how you want me (I need you to tell me how you want it)
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

Danju,"Ich denk ich bin schon viel zu lange wach
Die Augen werden müd', die Glieder schwach
Ich chill mit mir allein, als würd ich lasterfahren
Geh nur noch selten raus ich mach die Nacht zum Tag
25 Kaffee nur so ungefähr
Doch is scheißegal auch wenns schon 100 wärn
Ich bin immer iced out wie ein Eskimo
Die Augenringe funkeln bis nach Mexiko

Zwei Schachteln Kippen, um einen Tag zu spitten
Eyeslow und ich weiß, dass sie's blicken
Wirf die gelbe Pille ein darf ich bitten?
Komm wir beide könn'gemeinsam hier flüchten
Was geht ab Bitch? Geb mir selber High Five, eey
Man mich killt dieser Lifestyle
Aber mix mir noch n Mai Tai
Und sage dann für paar Stunden diesem Leben bye bye
Ich muss zurück in die Steinzeit
Doch hab zum Glück grad kein Wifi
Stell erst mal das Duschwasser ab
Ich ruf mitten in der Nacht den Buchmacher an (hallo)
Sag ihm morgen 10 Riesen real (was geht man?)
All die Sorgen sind wieder egal
Klopfe auf Holz und schau hoch in die Sterne
Nein ich bin sicher nicht von dieser Erde
Fliege viel höher als ihr jemals werdet
Irgendwo im parallelen Universum, ah
Nur paar Frauen wissen wo des is
Hab von hier immer zu den Mond im Blick
Ich seh nur Zäune und Verbot
Doch hab nur Angst vor der Steuer und dem Tod
Manche ticken Marijuana in den Blocks
Andre' fahrn' in nen Hummer zu ihrem Schloss
Wir vertun' unsre Chancen viel zu oft
Das sind nur paar Gedanken in meim' Kopf
Yeah, du kannst mich grad verstehen?
Dann solltest du besser schlafen gehn'

Bitch vier, fünf, sechs Mischen verändern die Sicht
Du sagst ich hab mich verändert, wer nicht? Alles änderte sich
Ich trink inzwischen meinen zweiter Kaffee, 
Rauch den ersten Jibbit, wenn mein Mitbewohner von der Arbeit kommt
Kriege schmeichelhafte Post, komm ich bitt' dich, 
Der Bildschirmschoner zeigt n' andern Arsch pardon
Whut? Sie lieben mich, hey, sie lieben mich
Du weißt wie es ist, bin süßer als n Bienenstich
Ok Babe mal ganz ehrlich, nächste wie diese, bisschen vermisse ich dich
Ich seh ja die Bilder, is gut jetzt, ich seh ja, is gut jetzt es kümmert mich nicht
Egal wo auch immer du bist
Es kümmert, es kümmert mich nicht
Glaub mir ich komm gut alleine klar (Hart kann sein)
Baby I don't give a fuck, bin inzwischen schon seit Tagen wach
Sag mir, wer weckt mich auf? (ja, ich weiß)
Roll' erst nochmal n Doobie up
Dieses Game ist eine Hure ich bin next to blow (oder schlaf ich ein?)

You catch your boyfriend with your best friend on the floor
Or some girl you go out with don't want you anymore

Listen to me watch this and do it too

Look 'em in the eye
Open up your mouth And Say...

Is it not to know the one who made me

As I'm looking down the road ahead
Love has a hold on me
Someday when I breathe my dying breath
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

Where will I go
When this life is through
Back into the light that made me and you

Love has a hold on me
Something opened up my eyes to see
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

I don't have answers to all the questions
Running inside of my mind
But I can't help believe that
Understanding comes in time

Love has a hold on me
Something opened up my eyes to see
Love has a hold on me
Love has a hold on me

If I run, if I hide, I know inside
Your love has a hold on me
Tell me yes, tell me no, my heart will follow
Your love has a hold on me

If I run, if I hide

Dann Huff,"In our times of trouble
We only had ourselves
Nobody else
No one there to save us
We had to save ourselves

And when the storms came through
They found me and you
Back to back together
And when the sun would shine
It was yours and mine
Yours and mine forever

[Chorus:]
Oh how the years go by
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes
All through the changes the sould never dies
We fight, we laugh, we cry
As the years go by

There were times we stumbled
They thought they had us down
But we came around
How we rolled and rambled
We got lost and we got found
Now we're back on solid ground, yeah

We took everything
All our times would bring
In this world of dangers
'Cause when your heart is strong
You know you're not alone
In this world of strangers

[Chorus]
And if we lose our way
Any night or day
Well we'll always be
Where we should be
I'm there for you
And I know you're there for me

Do you want to be in love forever
Do you want to make my dream come true
Let me be the one to kiss and hold you
Say you'll be my baby
Can you see the two of us together
Living in love this whole life through
Do you want to be in love forever
Say you'll be mine

I can remember
When my mind was clear and free
Now there's a feeling
Coming over me
The sweetest attraction
That my heart has ever seen
I'm going crazy making sense of anything

(repeat chorus twice)

I really wonder
Is there magic in your smile
Taking me under
Got me acting like a child
Something about you
Hits me like avalanche
I try to stand my ground
But I don't stand a chance

(repeat chorus)

Every time I close my eyes I dream about
Hugging you, holding you, kissing you boy
It's driving me crazy
But even if it takes forever
To win your heart and your love and your devotion
I know it's gonna be worth the wait

Ooh, say you'll be my baby
Ooh, be my baby
Ooh, oh darlin', say you'll be mine

Do you want to be in love

Dann Huff,"Regie Hamm and Joel Lindsey
So many mountains that we try to climb
So many places where we fall behind
Deep in the struggle just to find our way
We lose the heart, we lose the faith
Sometimes this life can tear your world apart
But you've got to remember that...
Chorus:
His love is strong enough to win the fight
His love is strong and good and right
When the heart gets weak
And the road get's long
His love is strong
His love is strong
Within the wonder of a baby's cry
And in the thunder of the midnight sky
Is something stronger than the heart of steel
It's a power you can touch and feel
So when you think that all your hope is gone
You've got to remember that...

On a road that's rough
But keep believing in the morning light
And His love will be enough, cause...

'Till I stand upon that mountain 
'Till I sit beside the thrown

Give me strength to bare the load
Give me signs that I can follow
Set feet upon the road 
And may he who walked on water give me courage where I tread

Danna Davis,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

Atraviesan como balas
Una detrás de otra
Mi existencia
Me muero si no estás

Que dejaste al marchar aquel día

Ayer al marcharte
Por aquella puerta
Te siguieron por la espalda
Futuras reservas de sonrisas
Y de felicidad

Hoy me sobran las palabras
Mis besos y mis miradas
Los minutos de mis horas
Cada gesto de mi cara
Y de mi alma
Eran por y para ti

Danna Paola,"Las palabras correctas
Un aroma perfecto
Y como me convences al mirar
Hicieron que te adorara

Ese abrazo era tan real
Parecía que todo era verdad cuando me decías que me amabas
Con un beso de película
Tu boca me atrapo y mi cuerpo se entrego

Pero todo fue un show
Una simple actuación me enamoro
Y mi alma te creyó
Pero todo fue un show
Como are para explicar al corazón
Que nada era lo que parecía
Que era ensayado lo que me decías
Y que la función se acabo

Quisiera poder hacerlo
Quisiera ser un poquito como tu
Y dominar mis sentimientos
Con un beso de película
Tu boca me atrapo y mi cuerpo se entrego

Pero todo fue un show
Una simple actuación me enamoro
Y mi alma te creyó
Pero todo fue un show
Como are para explicar al corazón
Si yo se que en algún momento
No fue teatro, y si me amaste
Aun que sea un segundo, aun que sea un segundo
Pudo más el amor que el acto

Pero todo fue un show
Una simple actuación me enamoro
Y mi alma te creyó
Pero todo fue un show
Como are para explicar al corazón

I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were built to last

That's what you get

I say that's what you get

That's what you get for changing your mind

And after all this time
I just hope you understand

Do not make the man

Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box

He can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness-the tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips

Até o dia em que eu mudar de opinião

Eu adivinho sem ninguém ter me contado
Coisas que eu sei

É o meu ponto de vista, não aceito turistas

Eu vejo o filme em pausas, eu imagino casas
Depois eu já nem lembro do que eu desenhei

Coisas que eu sei
Não guardo mais agendas no meu celular
Coisas que eu sei
Eu compro aparelhos que eu não sei usar
Eu já comprei

Quanto mais eu mexo mais afundo em mim
Eu moro num cenário do lado imaginário
Eu entro e saio sempre quando 'tô afim

A million tears have been dried

The fear of loneliness

Well, you knew me better than that
At least you thought you knew me then
But you know now
It's not always a happy ending

Danni Leigh,"(Malcolm Holcombe)

I've heard misfortune blossoms
And wasted ways before me by the cause
Of giving someone time enough for spending
Love only borrowed

I've placed myself at ease
Listening to the lies and self-belief
Of wanting something close enough for keeping
A far cry from here

But I believe in wasting years
To speaking of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here

Even still, the night's passing
Behind a heart, an emptiness still follows
The distance stands the swallow's heart from lending me
Love only borrowed

But I believe in wasting years
To speaking of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here

Some are sad of truly knowing
There's belonging in just longing for someone
My shoulder rests a road I only follow
Love only borrowed

But I believe in wasting years
To speaking of the deer who has been spared
Innocence so near
A far cry from here
A far cry from here
A far cry from here

Danni Leigh,"I live in the house of pain
It always seems to rain
The rooms are dark and plain
Now that he's gone
And no one ever calls
And I've climbed every wall
My life's a crying shame
Here in the house of pain

Flowers used to bloom on the windowsill
Bluebirds used to sing in the yard
When the sun went down
We had the lovingest home in town
That was all before you broke my heart

Now I live in the house of pain
It always seems to rain
The rooms are dark and plain
Now that he's gone
And no one ever calls
And I've climbed every wall
My life's a crying shame
Here in the house of pain

A broken girl
A broken home
Broken dreams are all I own
Empty words
Empty sighs
Fill my empty rooms at night

Danni Leigh,"Standing on the westbound track with my hands in my pockets
The wind blows against my back wishing me down the line
Guess I've had enough of this empty feeling
Finally gonna leave all this pain behind

Haunted by a past of a lone gone lonely
Bought a ticket, free at last, figure I'll take a ride
Around here, I can't shake what seems to ail me
I'll be somewhere else, come morning light

Gonna take the last train to San Antone
Give my troubled mind somewhere to go
Want to get lost in that old city
A stranger there may have some pity
What's around the bend, I'll never know
If I'm not on that train to San Antone

Staring out across the night, I find hope through the darkness
I feel a rumble, see a light, it looks about a mile away
My anticipation of tomorrow
Keeps my heart from hanging on to yesterday

Gonna take the last train to San Antone
Give my troubled mind somewhere to go

Danni Leigh,"Normally, I go through each day, like everything is fine
Till they ask if I still love you, I said no
It's been a whole week now, since I told myself that same old lie
Sometimes, it hits me so hard, I want to lay down and cry

[Chorus: ]
Sometimes, there's nothing to do but think of you
Sometimes, it drives me right out of my mind
I'm almost to the point of finding that it's no use
I always want to see you sometimes

Usually, I try to sleep at night, like I never cared
But I'm always waking up and looking around
At the empty room that's telling me, you're still really gone
Well, I don't need a bad dream, telling me what's wrong

[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

Danni Leigh,"Yesterday
I still believed in love
And everything I was dreaming of

Suddenly
When you told me goodbye
I had a thousand tears to cry
That didn't ease the pain

One long night, cold and dark
Alone and broken-hearted
With your memory, standing in the rain
It feels like it's killing me
But even on my knees
I'm crawling out of yesterday

There's nothing left to say
And all that I can change
Is hurting over you

One long night, cold and dark
Alone and broken-hearted
With your memory, standing in the rain
It feels like it's killing me
But even on my knees
I'm crawling out of yesterday

Gotta find a way to carry on
Even though a love that's gone
Keeps hanging on so strong

All that I can change
Is hurting over you

Settled revolutions in Spain

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,

Dannie Richmond,"The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring,
And you appear in all your splendor,
My one and only love.

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms.
I feel your lips, so warm and tender,
My one and only love.

The touch of your hand is like heaven,
A heaven that I've never known.
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own.

You fill my eager heart with such desire.
Ev'ry kiss you give sets my soul on fire.
I give myself in sweet surrender,
My one and only love.",My One and Only Love,1982
Dannie Richmond,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together
I'll remember April and be glad

I'll be content you loved me once in April
Your lips were warm and love and spring were new
I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely

Dannie Richmond,"Oh! Will you never let me be?
Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us
There's no escape that I can see
And still those little things remain
That bring me happiness or pain

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2012

Dannie Richmond Quartet,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?

The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1979

The words were locked deep inside
That's alright I'll give you every sign that I can

Now I know a girl who's got a crush on you
But she is just a little shy and a little proud
Now you know you've had the time
To think it through don't make me wait
Another day, let it out

I wish that you'd stop wishing
And finally ask so we can get started
On a love that will last
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask

As I sit here and make believe
I know that you are watching me
Your eyes are burning a hole through my heart

If there's a place we can start let's begin
Now it seems to me you want me to give in
And make a move showing you that I care
But my love is still a prize that you must win
Don't waste a chance to take my heart while it's there

I wish that you'd stop wishing
And finally ask so we can get started
On a love that will last
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask

Wanna get started now, can we get started now ooh
I wanna get started now, yeah yeah
Don't make me wait another day
Cause you know you've had the time to think about me
All the time we've wasted we'll never get back
So I wish that you'd stop wishing and finally ask

I wish that you'd stop wishing
And finally ask so we can get started

Where am I?
Love surrounds my body
My eyes are closed, but I see
Colors have soothed the soul
Moving as part of this world
Taking it to ...floor
Diving deeper, backened by dolphins
They appear and dance around me
Brushing against my skin, tickling
I swim closer, speaking of thoughts ...are friendly
Where I stand
It's safe beneath the waves

Is this real
Is this real

*Everybody changes underwater
Everybody changes underwater
Everybody changes underwater

I come up for air 
I just want to prove everything is new ...seems to cool
And fill the water to a garden
Fruit ...from the trees
I reach up and take it
It's ripe, soft, and sweet
I feel there's a long grass
I run my fingers through the blades
Umm...feel inside me
I lie back closing my eyes
The song soothes me
I begin to float, floating higher and higher
Higher and higher

*Repeat

Everybody changes underwater

There's no darkness
Looking down, the world is ...
If I fall, no one will catch me
Space, everywhere I once and ...all
Floating in the small part of the endless universe
I feel glowing starts, Poseidon and ...
Someone to ...
A finding light appears
So it's a life I recognize
You reach out your hands
And welcome me like angels

Don't ask me, because I don't know why

You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard to want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups and your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes?

We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play

Street soldiers killing the elderly
What ever happened to unity?

Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You notice one time he was your man

But you laid in bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?

The one that stretches for success will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad

When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the boys on the train, drive to school on the church

Do not be a fool who's prejudice
Because we're all written down on the same list

A swaying gracefully

About the way the world just be changin'
Is it a sin to be chasin' paper
I can't count the niggas dyin' lately
It's the grave or incarceration
I know you hurt but you can't replace em
You go and dig a hole then erase em
You just created a smaller nation
A jail cell is all that's waitin'
Look at all the progress you're makin'
I really hope you're kinda patient

You're freedom is all their takin'
Is it best to be dead or pacin'

Can't let go i got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless i get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young and restless
Get mad 'cause a quarter million on my necklace

You and I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh no i can't stop i was destined

And i put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed 'cause the outfit all in it
'Cause the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil' visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Reality see when your blessed just kill critics
Buggatti never when im rich, just god fearing
Look at me steering, got the blogs staring
Gotta good feeling, plus the right caring, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit

Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish

Danny B. Harvey,"It was down by old Joe's barroom, on the corner of the square
They were serving drinks as usual, and the usual crowd was there

So sweet, cool and so fair

Thought we said goodbye last night

Wish I forget you, but you're here to stay
It seems I met you
When my love went away
Now everyday I stop I'm saying to you

Stop haunting me now

Just leave me alone

That good old Gumbo fillet

I'm gonna tell you the reason why
Let you know the secret out

When I'd be held under your thumb

Moved and compelled, at your command
Whether it's for bad or for good
I would never change it if I could

Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong
Maybe I'm weak, maybe I'm strong
But nevertheless I'm in love with you
Maybe I'll win, maybe I'll lose
And maybe I'm in for crying the blues
But nevertheless I'm in love with you

Somehow, I know at a glance, the terrible chances I'm taking
Fine at the start, then left with a heart that is breaking

Maybe I'll live a life of regret, 
And maybe I'll give much more than I get
But nevertheless, I'm in love with you

In spite of all I could do
I went ahead falling for you
So if I laugh or I cry
I made my bed, that's where I'll lie

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Boots with the fur (with the fur)

I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go, this crazy, all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I whoa
Did I think I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

Hey
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans full of gwap and they ready for stones
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on)
Two stacks (come on)
Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand)
What you think I'm playin' baby girl
I'm the man, I'll ain't dealin' rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was ova, that henny and Cola got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her, like a pornography poster she showed her

Whoa shawty
Yea she was worth the money
Lil mama took my cash, and I ain't want it back
The way she bit that rag, got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack, I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin'
They be want it two in the mornin'
I'm zonin' in them rosay bottles foamin'

shawty did that pop and lock, had to break her off that gwap

Now I'm taking that game up and the ace of hearts is high.
Things are mending now, I see a rainbow blending now.
We'll have a happy ending now, takin' a chance on love.

I got that grip again, takin' a chance on love.
Now I prove again that I can make life move again.

Someday again we'll meet.
