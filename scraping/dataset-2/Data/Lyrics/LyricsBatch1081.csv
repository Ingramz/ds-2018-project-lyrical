Technova,"Walk in silence,
Don't walk away, in silence.
See the danger,
Always danger,
Endless talking,
Life rebuilding,
Don't walk away.
Walk in silence,
Don't turn away, in silence.
Your confusion,
My illusion,
Worn like a mask of self-hate,
Confronts and then dies.
Don't walk away.
People like you find it easy,
Naked to see,
Walking on air.
Hunting by the rivers,
Through the streets,
Every corner abandoned too soon,
Set down with due care.
Don't walk away in silence,
Don't walk away.",Atmosphere,2003

The right time for kissin'
But night time is my time
For just reminiscin'
Regrettin' instead of forgettin'
With somebody else

There'll be no one
Unless that someone is you

To have it today to give it back tomorrow

Ted,"Its true what they say
You gotta run free
To learn the very secrets of life
And life ain't a joke
Because when you're broke
You can't pay your debts with a smile

I've seen a whole lot of ramblin at backstreet motels
Where all the honky tonk cats
Go chasin for rats
I'm through with my job and the factory smell
Ii have the right to expect
A little respect
I ain't got a dime to be saved in a bank
that's why I gotta be frank

Lovin you
Is lovin you just for the money
Ooh loving you
Is the kind of livin
I want to do
Play tennis together on top off a hill
Were happy forever as long as you will
Love just for the money

How deep is your love and your credit account
I gotta know all the facts
To get in the act
Invite all my friends to a church outta town
I have to send them some bucks
To rent them a tux
You know they gotta looka nice
When they stand in the aisle
And sing along
With a great great big smile

Lovin you
Is lovin you just for the money
Ooh lovin you
Is the kind of livin I want to do
When I face the altar and give you my ring
The reverends daughter and choir will sing
Love just for the money

Lovin you
Is loving you just for the money
Ooh loving you
Is the kind of livin I want to do

Ted & Sheri,"Never mind all the things you heard about me
You're never gonna understand it
Every time that I've given you the truth
It's never made a bit of difference

Disappointment takes you
Then the doubt, it breaks you
It's enough to make you cry

Always looking for a sign
Miracles won't change your mind
Tell me how much evidence you need
Turning truth into a lie
Hardened heart and blinded eye
All you need to do is just believe

Ted Bogan,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,1978

He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Ted Brown,"Now won't you listen honey, while I say, 
How could you tell me that you're goin' away? 
Don't say that we must part, 
Don't break your baby's heart 

You know I've loved you for these many years, 
Loved you night and day,
Oh! honey baby, can't you see my tears? 
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday, when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You're gonna feel blue, and you're gonna feel sad
You're gonna feel bad
And you'll miss, and you'll miss,
And you'll miss the bestest pal you ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
But baby, think what you're doin'
I'm gonna haunt you so, I'm gonna taunt you so
It's gonna drive you to ruin

As the years come and go
Only forever, if you care to know
Would I grant all your wishes
And be proud of the task
Only forever if someone should ask

That to me is what your eyes are,
Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?

Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,1965
Ted Curson,"This lovely day will lengthen into evening
We'll sigh goodbye to all we ever had
Alone where we have walked together

I'm not afraid of autumn and her sorrow

For flames live such a little while
I won't forget but I won't be lonely
I'll remember April and smile",I'll Remember April,1997
Ted Curson,"How did I know that the warmth of the glow would last.
How did I guess that the long loneliness was past.
I merely looked at you and I knew that I knew.

It's you or no one for me
I'm sure of this each time we kiss
Now and forever and when forever's done
You'll find that you are still the one

But you don't care how many tears I cry

I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye

Cause everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's plaything
And there are no exceptions to the rule
Yes, everybody's somebody's fool

I told myself it's best that I forget you,
Though I'm a fool, at least I know the score
Yet darlin', I'd be twice as blue without you
It hurts, but I'd come running back for more

Cause everybody's somebody's fool

He/She may be near or ever so far away
But I'll have none except the one I love

Though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jests
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie...

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Lie la lie...

Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone
Going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me,
Leading me, going home.

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remains

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

In the album of my memory

And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more

Oh how real it all starts to seem

In a cottage close by a stream
I know it all by heart now - we're about to part now
It's the same old dream

If you but knew
How many times I pretend - that I'm with you
I'm sure your heart would unbend - you'd see me through
Until my dream had a happy ending

And I can picture clearly - the things I love dearly
In the center you reign supreme
We kiss and I discover - I'm a lonesome lover

They just lie there, and they die there
Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely, lovely work of art.

Ted Heath & His Music,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I pray one more is not too much to ask
I've tried to fight this battle by myself
But it's a war that I can't win without Your help

Tonight, I'm as low as any man can go
I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

So many times I've hurt the ones I love
I pushed them to the edge of giving up
They've stood by me but how much can they stand
If I don't put this bottle in Your hands?

I'm down and I can't fall much farther
And once upon a time, You turned the water into wine
An' now, on my knees, I'm turning to You, Father
Could You help me turn the wine back into water?

I shook my fist at heaven for all the hell that I've been through
Now I'm begging for forgiveness and a miracle from You

Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased the pain

Oh, the dark days are done and the bright days are here
My sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny, thank you for the love you've brought my way

You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Oh, Sunny one so true, I love you

Sunny, thank you for the truth you've let me see
Sunny, thank you for the facts from A to Z

My life was torn like wind-blown sand
Then a rock was formed when we held hands
Sunny one so true, I love you

Ted Lewis Orchestra,"Like the beat beat beat of the tom-tom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick tick tock of the stately clock
As it stands against the wall
Like the drip drip drip of the raindrops
When the summer shower is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating you, you, you

Night and day, you are the one
Only you beneath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me, or far
It's no matter darling where you are
I think of you, night and day

Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom 
In the silence of my lonely room 
I think of you, night and day,

Night and day, night and day
Under the hide of me
There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me
And it's torment won't be through 
Until you let me spend my life making love to you

Ted Lyons,"Well I found a bunch of letters
That were written for the fellow who broke your momma's heart
And the envelope folds smelled of her ancient perfume
I'll bet she didn't know
How to respond before the blankets of snow
Caught him out wandering alone
With no place to go

There were stars in the sky
There were houses on the hill
And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm

Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box
Labeled tinsel and lights
Didn't know what I was I looking for
Maybe just a blanket or artifacts
Eisenhower sent him to war
He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart
And when he hit shore
Must have been a target for the gunman

There were stars in the sky
There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill
Where he will lie
Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes

There were stars in the sky
There were houses on the hill
And there were bottles of pills that were easy to buy

Don't stay out to late
Cause he's got something he want's to give to you
He calls in his dreams, with his phantom screams
Hide from the shadows in the night
Only day will save you,
Gotta watch the attack of the mad axeman
He can take you anytime he pleases
He wants to make you bleed,
Around town his laughter sounds
Deep into the night, that flash of knife in the
Flickering lights for you
He knows when he's down

Ted McKenna,"A time of fear, so long ago,
Lived a man in Salon,
In his dark and magic room,
He gazed on times to come,
All is then revealed, and visions on water speak true!
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
A flash of light, fills the night,
And chills the blood in his veins,
Will the power possess his mind, soul in chains
All is then revealed, and tears that he shed were for you
Cry for the nations, cry for the nations.
Battles of kings, and of fools,
And changes in ways he once knew,
As pages of days fade away
He's lost in time...

Don't go giving me all your reasons
I can see them but they'll hurt me I know
Cause if the time should come, that you'll be leaving
Will I have the strength to let you go
I'll play the clown, when I'm insecure
I close my eyes if I'm not too sure
But things you do make me want to shout
Let's give it time, and work it out
Every time you think you've got it made, you stand
Last, don't you think that I can't stand this pain
Forever again well oh no...
I've crossed the line, so I just can't lose it
I'm tied and bound and I can't abuse it
And all the things we've been fighting for
We'll break it loose, I can take some more
Don t go giving me all your reasons
I can see them, but they'll hurt me I know

You can't remember, and I can't forget!

You know very well who.

JESUS

Why don't you go do it?

JUDAS

You want me to do it!

JESUS

Hurry, they are waiting.

JUDAS

If you knew why I do it

JESUS

I don't care why you do it!

JUDAS

To think I admired you.
Well now I despise you.

JESUS

You liar. You Judas.

JUDAS

You want me to do it!
What if I just stayed here
And ruined your ambition.
Christ you deserve it.

Hurry, you fool. Hurry and go.
Save me your speeches,
I don't want to know. Go!

APOSTLES

Look at all my trials and tribulations
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine.
What's that in the bread? It's gone to my head,
'Till this morning is this evening, life is fine.
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll all talk about us when we've died.

JUDAS

You sad, pathetic man, see where you've brought us to,
Our ideals die around us and all because of you.
But the saddest cut of all:
Someone has to turn you in.
Like a common criminal, like a wounded animal.
A jaded mandarin,
A jaded mandarin,
Like a jaded, faded, faded, jaded, jaded mandarin.

JESUS

Get out they're waiting! Get out!
They're waiting, Oh, they are waiting for you!

JUDAS

Every time I look at you I don't understand
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand.
You'd have managed better if you had it planned...
Oh....

APOSTLES

Always hoped that I'd be an apostle.
Knew that I would make it if I tried.
Then when we retire, we can write the Gospels,
So they'll still talk about us when we've died.

Will none of you wait with me?

Who is this broken man cluttering up my hallway?
Who is this unfortunate?
Soldier:
Someone Christ - King of the Jews
Pilate:
Oh so this is Jesus Christ, I am really quite surprised
You look so small - not a king at all
We all know that you are news - but are you king
King of the Jews?
Jesus:
That's what you say
Pilate:
What do you mean by that? That is not an answer
You're deep in trouble friend -
Someone Christ - King of the Jews
How can someone in your state be so cool about your fate?
An amazing thing - this silent king
Since you come from Galilee then you need not come to me
You're Herod's race! You're Herod's case!

Jesus I am with you
Touch me, touch me Jesus
Jesus I am on your side
Kiss me, kiss me Jesus

Christ what more do you need to convince you?
That you've made it and you're easily as strong
As the filth from Rome who rape our country
And who've terrorized our people for so long

Did you see I waved
I believe in you and God
So tell me that I'm saved

Jesus I am with you
Touch me, touch me Jesus
Jesus I am on your side
Kiss me, kiss me Jesus

There must be over fifty thousand
Screaming love and all for you
And everyone of fifty thousand
Would do whatever you ask him to

Keep them yelling their devotion
But add a touch of hate at Rome
And you will rise to a greater power
We will win ourselves our home

And you'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever
And you'll get the power and the glory
For ever and ever and ever

You'll get the power and the glory

Neither you Simon, nor the fifty thousand
Nor the Romans, nor the Jews
Nor Judas, nor the twelve
Nor the priests, nor the scribes

Nor doomed Jerusalem itself
Understand what power is
Understand what glory is
Understand at all, understand at all

If you knew, all that I knew my poor Jerusalem
You'd see the truth but you'd live a lie
But you'd live a lie while you live
Your troubles are many

Poor Jerusalem
To conquer death
You only have to die
You only have to die

Ted Neeley,"And so the king is once again my guest.
And why is this? Was Herod unimpressed?

We turn to Rome to sentence Nazareth.
We have no law to put a man to death.
We need him crucified.
It's all you have to do.
We need him crucified.
It's all you have to do.

Talk to me Jesus Christ.
You have been brought here
Manacled, beaten by your own people.
Do you have the first idea why you deserve it?
Listen King of the Jews,
Where is your kingdom?
Look at me. Am I a Jew?

I have no kingdom in this world.
I'm through.
There may be a kingdom for me somewhere.
If you only knew.

Then you are a king?

It's you that say I am.
I look for truth and find that I get damned.

But what is truth?
Is truth a changing law?
We both have truths.
Are mine the same as yours?

Crucify him! Crucify him!

What do you mean?
You'd crucify your king?

We have no king but Caesar!

He's done no wrong.
No, not the slightest thing.

We have no king but Caesar!
Crucify him!

What is this new respect for Caesar?
'Till now this has been noticeably lacking.
Who is this Jesus? Why is he different?
You choose Messiahs by the sack full.

We need him crucified,
It's all you have to do.
We need him crucified,
It's all you have to do.

Talk to me, Jesus Christ.
Look at your Jesus Christ.
I'll agree he's mad.
Ought to be locked up,
But that is not a reason to destroy him.
He's a sad little man.
Not a King or God.
Not a thief,
I need a crime!

Crucify him!

Behold a man,
Behold your shattered King.

We have no King but Caesar.

You hypocrites,
You hate us more than him.

We have no King but Caesar,
Crucify him!

I see no reason. I find no evil.
This man is harmless, so why does he upset you?
He's just misguided, thinks he's important,
But to keep you vultures happy I shall flog him.

Crucify him! Crucify him!

(Thirty-nine lashes, Pilate counts)

Where are you from Jesus?
What do you want Jesus?
Tell me.
You've got to be careful.
You could be dead soon,
Could well be.
Why do you not speak when
I hold your life in my hands?
How can you stay quiet?
I don't believe you understand.

You have nothing in your hands.
Any power you have, comes to you from far beyond.
Everything is fixed, and you can't change it.

You're a fool Jesus Christ.
How can I help you?

Pilate, Crucify him!
Remember Caesar.
You have a duty
To keep the peace, so crucify him!

You'll be demoted.
You'll be deported. Crucify him!

Could you see
Don't you feel

You should have told me
I was there 
When you needed

But you lied
Now you're gone
And I'm alone

I get scared
Feel the pain
My hearts bleeding

Ch:
I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

They were sure 
I was strong 
I could take it

They don't see
All the nights
That I cry

I can't believe all the loneliness
I was lost when you left our home
It was strange to exist with the loneliness
I'm not used to being alone

Maybe now 
I can find
A new baby

Maybe now
I can start
Over again

No more tears
No more pain
And no lying

Its so hard
Its ok
Now I'm trying

Knows you're the one I'm thinkin' of

Without your precious love I can't go on
It's hard to be, I need you so much

The pleasures of a journey to the center of the mind

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare

Beyond the seas of thought beyond the realm of what
Across the streams of hopes and dreams where things are really not



Come along if you care
Come along if you dare
Take a ride to the land inside of your mind

But please realize you'll probably be surprised
For it's the land unknown to man


Where fantasy is fact
So if you can, please understand
You might not come back

Come along if you care
Come along if you dare

You lost your emotions. You're paralyzed. 

Amputate your logic, you're hypnotized. 
You show no emotion. You're paralyzed. 

Don't you know you crucify yourself, oh, no. 

You're killin' you and nobody else, 
And know you been spending your nights alone. 
The lights are on but there's nobody home. 

You don't know where you come from. You're not too wise. 
You got nowhere to run to. You paralyzed. 

Can you feel your body? Can you move your eyes? 
Can you feel your heartbeat? Well, are you paralyzed?

Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in Earth's delights

Painted desert, sequined sky, stars that fill the night, here all life abounds
Rivers flowing to the sea, sunshine pure and bright, here all life abounds
No man rules this land, no human hand has soiled this paradise
Waiting patiently, so much to see, so rich in Earth's delights

So the maiden lies in waiting for the sails to reach the shore
Land of beauty and abunance, innocent, you opened wide your door
Wanderers found the waiting treasure, full of gifts beyond their measure
Milk and honey for our pleasure

Across the sea there came a multitude, sailing ships upon the wave
Filled with visions of Utopia and the freedom that they crave
Ravage, plunder, see no wonder, rape and kill and tear asunder
Chop the forest, plow it under

Que é pra mim ficá ouvindo

Foi um boi sem coração

Lá pra banda de ouro fino
Levando o gado servage
Quando eu passo na porteira
Até vejo sua imagem
O seu rangido tão triste
Mai parece uma mensagem
Daquele rosto trigueiro
Desejando me boa viagem

A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now,

Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,

Ev'rything and ev'rybody
Makes life a happy song
When somebody has nobody
Birds won't sing and that somebody

Ted Weems & His Orchestra,"I've got a longing way down in my heart
For that old gang that has drifted apart
They were the best pals that I ever had
I never thought that I'd want them so bad
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals

Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
Last night I strolled to that old neighborhood
There on that corner I silently stood
I felt so blue as the crowds hurried by
Nobody knew how I wanted to cry
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine
I can't forget that old quartette that sang ""Sweet Adeline""
Goodbye forever, old fellows and gals
Goodbye forever, old sweethearts and pals
(God bless them)
Gee but I'd give the world to see
That old gang of mine

Recitation:
Last night 'neath a street lamp I silently stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
As I gazed at the houses, unchanged by the years
In my throat came a lump and my eyes filled with tears
I looked at the lamppost, the pump and the stoop
And again I could picture us kids in a group
There was Shorty, and Yeller and Skinny and Mike
And the rich kid who had ball bearing skates and a bike
And down near the school I could see the brick wall
Where we used to go for a game of handball
And the crabby old janitor who chased us away
Say, what I wouldn't give to just see him today!

And then came the parties and dances-- that's why
We didn't notice the years going by
And the first thing we knew we were all twenty-one
But the Gang stuck together in a fight or in fun
-And then came the War- the crowds in the street
-The blast of the Bugle- the tramp of the feet
And the gang, that old gang of mine
Was the first gang that hit the Von Hindenburg line.

But the war is all over and last night as I stood
On the same corner back in that old neighborhood
I couldn't help brushing a tear from my eye
For I knew not a face in the crowds that went by
Gone forever are the pals that I love
There isn't a trace or a sign
Of that regular honest to goodness old bunch
That I call that old gang of mine",That Old Gang of Mine,2000

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

Tedashii,"Look I don't know what they told you but if it don't match up
With His holy Word then homie they need to back up
Some they pretend like they get Him they twisting facts up
That's why we dig in the scriptures to know the Master
Homie, we have to if we want to get past the
Only thing we know being what we learned from the Pastor
I really hope your listening, my listeners 'cause after
We want to see Him clear like a big screen plasma
Half of the cats I seen they don't really know the Lord
They think my views are extreme, think I'm going overboard
But they ain't read a page of the place where
He's spoken for Himself in the matters, man that's what I be quoting for
Some say He don't exist, nah that don't even make sense
This Earth is masterpiece somebody had to paint this
Forget the big bang, or evolution and face this
He's the King of Kings and author of all creation
Some say He made it then let's it run like a clock
Nah, He controls every soul and every action on the block
If it happened then He watched and it happens on His watch
No surprise in His eyes, no my God's never shocked

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

Wonderful, Counselor, Masterful
This is Jesus Christ, L-O-R-D, all capitals
This is why Trip and I trip after the mass appeal
Of people, who pigeonhole Jesus as a pacifist, whoa!
A prophet with no power in His plasma
Still we preach against the views that Arius profess to have of Him (Look it up!)
Meaning the deifying of Jesus was nothing more than an accident
But the Bible's the proof that refutes and gives us facts on Him
That He was, what His Daddy was Homousia, the God-Man
Sent to save us all that He loves
And set us free from sin and shut it down like it was Attica
Anyone disbelieving this truth may want to back it up or back it up
Because the Son of Man is coming that's what's up and at
His judgment seat is where you will see His holy wrath is just
But God is Love, that don't mean He's weak, hey check His resume
Just 'cause He let's you breath don't mean He won't take His breath away

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think

I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think
I don't know what you think, homie time to get it straight

These days in the church, most cats got it twisted
Don't let them fool you on how we posed to live this
For instance, some say to come to Christ for riches
Or maybe your blessing, but my question is what is this?
'Cause that ain't the gospel, that if you put your faith in Him
To come to the Savior, and then you'll rake that paper in?
Face it friends, they made Jesus they holy ATM
Paul would appalled, this gospel would be disgrace to Him
This false gospel strips Him of His flyness
He's more like your servant and less like His Highness
So please don't buy it, that idea is absurd
Jesus said the Christian life can be strife and it's filled with hurt
Look homie I would hate for, cats to get that fake stuff
And never know it's wrong 'cause they won't open a page up
I pray we erase the wrong views and embrace the
Holy Word that testifies to us about the Savior

I don't know what you heard, I don't know what you heard
I don't know what you heard, hope it matches with the Word
I don't know what you think, I don't know what you think

Cause I stopped partying, chasing all the ladies
And they told me I was loosing it calling me a lunatic
Because, for you, that world; I told them I was through with it
Man I heard the rumors calling me a joke
I'm praying saying, I wish they knew what I know
'Cause if they did they would see, how you were meant to be
Much more than the god of emergencies
You're the God that elected me chose, and selected me
When nobody else would mess with me
Never neglected me you even loved me when you corrected me
Hands down you're the best to me
I spent years of my life trying to be liked or be like the people who
Seemed to be liked
Following the crowd, trying to be allowed Into a world where every thing
Seemed right but

Embracing me, taking me, making me yours

Amazingly and graciously when I was lost and wavering
Couldn't get from A to B you opened the door
I deserved to be left there in distress with the rest there
Right there in my mess yeah
Still believing all the lies the world can satisfy
I almost died, pushing you to the side
What a fool, making crazy moves about to lose, all I had for a buzz and a thrill
We too easily satisfied and that's just how Adam died, He was in the place
Where the love wasn't real
But the more I get to know You the more I get to know truth
And through you I see who I am
My identity revealed as you show me how to live, through the example of the
God-man that's why,

Tedashii,"I hear so many Christians, murmuring about their imperfections,
And their failures, and their addiction, and their shortcomings.
And I see so little war! Murmur, murmur, murmur.
Why am I this way? make war!

Bang with me, ba-bang bang, ba-bang with me
No more playing games mane
Cause this thang can get risky
So mane if you into Christ,
Take up!! your cross quickly
Stand fearless on the front-line
Time to come with it, do the right thing
Wake up!! And let's get it
I ain't even in the ring
They throwing bows like Riddick
Persistently attacking me
They're even in the back of me
It's either fight or loose my life
And I can't take this passively
So what you think I'm 'bout to do
I'm bout to do what I can do
Trust the one who got me through
And fight like it was after school
Never giving up, steady, standing on the battle field
Feet firm to the ground like I stepped on Chapel Hill
Flesh feeling frisky, sin persuades and tempts me
Satan cheers me on, guilt followed by conviction
It's the same ol' trap and we fall like we defenseless
Work your senses, grow in wisdom
Stand firm and be relentless

Do you even have a clue
What happened to you when He died
When that tomb got rolled when He rose in the sky
I think we emphasis sin so much
That it makes us paralyzed
And glorify struggle so much
That it makes us terrified
And de-emphasize the fact
That we have been sterilized from our own lives and thus
We gotta snap out of it
We ain't in no straight-jacket, we free
When Jesus died in our lives something strange happened
He gave us power
Yeah I know that we sinners
But since He rose He's renewing the image of God in us
Now, we gotta start making war
Now we can start saying no
To them fleshy impulses that Jesus Christ is paying for
Now we can start taking the lead
Just like the Dalai Lama and start going all out like a suicide bomber
Whatever the sin is we gotta go go go harder
By His grace no time to waste and just just just like there's no tomorrow

So listen up to it asap, like you do a Lecrae track
I'm spittin' written visions to put on heads like a wave cap
Sinning, naw we don't play that
Cause that's the way that a slave acts
I'm filled with the spirit so tell them dog this is payback
As you begin to copy the carbon copies of Christ
And conform to his written image you should be shinning a light
If you not, why is that?
Is it fear that's been grippin' you
Cause you scared they'll be dissin' you
Flipping birds while that spit at you
If you not, why is that?
It don't matter so bump it
Perfect love cast out fear and He ain't save us for nothing
This is a privilege (privilege)
Your life to give to Him (give to Him)

I see it like a flash back, that empty life
Now in Christ, I finally got my dad back
God was that He snatched me back He got me off that fast track
Of chasing dreams and manish things, like power, pleasure, and respect
Taught me that a selfish view, never was a healthy view
Here's some help for you who struggle too, living past that
Selfish gain or selfless aim, hey baby they gone clash black
Worldly wisdom or scripture, it ain't but one that has facts
Tried it all, all alone, but found that I was handicapped
Strength I lacked, abused by this world you can have it back
See the fact remains I was changed when I heard His name
I know He's real, and I'll never be the same

[Chorus]
I'm in love with one hand in the sky
I'm looking at the the cross with both of my eyes
I know I was born into sin
But now I'm in Christ yes I'm born to win
I know, I know, that Jesus lives
And I know, I know He is my king
And that's why, that's why I'll always sing

Growing in their pride, eyes closed so they can't see
Walking blind all the time, too arrogant to see their need
I can hear the preacher preach, reaching out to you and me
Begging us to look to Jesus and no longer be deceived
Cie-cie-cieved, by the enemy or the sin in me
That says to be sufficient independently
I'm so glad to be walking on the straight and narrow
I know that god got me if his eye is on the sparrow

[Chorus]

So from the newest life, the truest life, I know that He's real
From the changes in my stride to the way that I feel
Something different, you sense it, even momma was trippin'
Wondering like Alice asking me, hey boy what's gotten in you
I said, Jesus is real (hey), this ain't just a religion
I done tried to practice habits but man nothing was sticking
But His love and His joy and the peace that He brings
Man was dead in sin till Jesus came on the scene
Now it's a wrap for ya boy, no more, quiet on set,
I'm telling everyone I know, I ain't ashamed to represent
I love Him, no one above Him, I'll forever worship
Hands high to the sky, as I show my love to him

Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
Jesus, thank you for saving my life

Into the army, Uncle Sam

She says don't go, but the call came,
It's time to deploy, and they called his name
Close to zero five-hundred, her mind starts wanderin'
Butterflies, tummy starts rumblin'
Queasy, uneasy, tryin' to hold it all together
She doesn't want their last moments here to be
Unpleasant

The car ride is quiet, outside it's hard to fight it
Inside it's like she's dyin', that's when she started cryin'
He tries to comfort her, ""Baby, it's alright, liar""
That's what she screams louder from the thoughts of fight
They pray, it's okay, ""I'll promise that I'll be safe"" uh

And as he walks away, lookin' in her eye
Last kiss as they say

She's headed off to war and it's hard for her to face it
Or face her, the daughter that she's leavin'
It's hard to come to terms with the truth, no one
Believes it and even when it's starrin' in ya face, you don't
Receive it

She hears mommy and it's just like her heart

Worried when she leaves she may not be back to
See them, her baby girl, and the family that she loves
Tryin' to hold back the tears right now is tough
She fights to stay strong, gotta hold on
She says a prayer, just tryin' to find a calm
Thoughts of eternity, then back to reality
And then she tells her family

However I seen them boys mane take that bar and wait for God's sake
Beastie boy he still took three the hard way
Toss me out heart away crucifix no jewelry
Just wooden beams he took from me
Took 'em up to Calvary while I was a DGK
Wiling out to UGK runnin' from the HPD
Huffin' puffin Mary Jane no grip chains mane
I was looking for a super freak
Nasty cameo candy super sweet
But now your boy turnt up free from all them chains
Ya volume on ten you can call it unashamed

Lord have mercy and pity on your son
From what I once was to what I have become
Lord have mercy and pity on your son

Now I'm turnt up daily I'm on my one-eighty
They thought I'd water it down I'm like boy y'all crazy
On my J.O. my OJ Mayo I'm on my Grizzly
Jesus turned me around me so fast that you would swear I was dizzy
Now they askin' who is he now they wonderin' my name
I run in my own lane screaming Jesus is King
'Til my heart stop pumpin' no more blood in my veins
Watch me turn up everyday homeboy I'm so unashamed

Turnt up boy turnt up boy
Turnt up boy turnt up
Turnt up boy turnt up boy
Turnt up boy turnt up

For the pain boy I'm up to bat
Patient for the win 
'Cause we win-slow with these family matters

That you won't find no bolder men
Than those of them
That's going in
For holiness
God goes with them
What you know about going harder?
Walk with me through these martyrs
And fathers that barely father
For the Father boy don't get me started
Let me try to break it down
I thought I'd be doing it if I moved a couple pounds
Made a hundred-thou(sand) with the women in the house
But that ain't doing nothing but f-f-following the crowd
If everybody is doing what everybody is doing
You're cool with doing the opposite of everybody is doing
You're going hard for Yeshua
You're going hard in the truest
I promise

Bad attitude
Woulda coulda shoulda been shot dead
Always running my mouth
I'd rather die than be soft man
I've been slammed on my back just to prove that I'm not scared
(turn the other cheek)
Stop playing
Till I met Jesus and really seen just what He's about
He endured the cross
To kill 'em all
Woulda been the easy route
When I first got saved had a dude come up to me
Talking tough to me
Wanted to duck and swing but I walked away that was the tougher thing.
See a Godly man acts different when he's been wronged
He's knows how to overlook offense (a fence) like a peeping tom
It's easy to smoke your problems away with that Cheech and Chong
It's hard to take 'em head on
He mans up before the Lord
What about the brother that discovered that his lover was under the covers with another man (that's hard)
With everything inside of him he wanna go and bother him but he giving 'em grace instead (that's hard)
What about them brothers who are wanted by multiple women but they married and they know they got to be there for their children so they wanna be living their faith and they giving their wife everything

I go off: hard for this
No holds barred the Lord is in
No arguments
Keepin' my cool
Faith on fire, no arsonist
It's hard to miss
One one six, yeah
Una-shamed
Rep His Name
Even when they disregarding this
Our culture don't go hard for this
I know it's tough
When your eyes and your mind seek lust
And your pride is a must
And your lies rise up
To disguise what's what
And you feelin' like quitting 'cause what you tried ain't enough
That's when you take heart
God got it
still God
Harder
Harder I go for the Lord
Go hard till the day I depart
I, go harder for the Father even if it means I'm martyred or slaughtered or fall
It doesn't matter He bought us
He chose to call us
Somebody planted and watered and these seeds
Increase when He's been through like trees
Breathe ah breathe
Breath in my body
Of the King I'm a product
Chance is slim, but I deem I'm sought out
But He caught us
All us
Guaranteed he got us
So I'm living this thang
Giving the reigns
Even when I know that temptation is tryna slip in this thang
It's so much easier man
To give into sinning like many of the men and women I know who caught up in chains
Steady living in vain
And they sit with no shame
And they slack in the prison
Until they meet up with saints
Who be bringing them change

Puffin Backwoods, walking through the back of the hood
No protection, Stapleton section
Corrupt life, T.M.F. arch style, we rush mic's
Disarmed for that gold-piece charm
Red alert, we all alarmed, ready for combat
No contact, counting backwards ten-to-one
Now let me launch that, no way you can catch my format
I'm like the Gingerbread Man, moving on land
Catch me if you can, I move faster than the average man

[Chorus: x2 Shyheim]
You only got one life to live
So all of my children, it's better to give than receive
Life is short, Days of Our Lives seem to speed
Still waiting for the day when Clinton legalize weed

[Dom PaChino a.k.a. P.R. Terrorist]
It's like gun play when my darts spray
Leave you scarred today, mental washed away
I shoot like Hardaway, your body parts decay
Slow-lay, too busy lusting the Rol-ay, platinum face
I snatch you over-arms, I take you out of space
Take you into my orbit, Terrorist gone corporate
Chopping tracks into sawdust, son, so you could snort it
In the conference room, Terrorist Hymn coming soon
Album cover pitch-black like the sky, without the moon
To illuminate, in my dome-piece there lies a metal plate
Titanium, harder than a lock in your gate
Burglarize your enterprise and have fun with your mate
Cause I'm not nasty, when doing my dirt, won't see ya masta me
Silent Weapons is a classic like Freddy Bassey
What a word pro, electro, grenade logo
Forever show how I firmly handle the phono
Bitches lust me, my plans of wetting the seeds in the mo-mo
Terrorist relating to Shy, mi vida loco (I feel the same way)

[T.M.F. #2]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Eh yo, treasury, stacking this paper for Longevity
The money first, put it in work, that be my pedigree
Let's take it to higher degree
Sit back and visualize so our eyes could see
Black God, we living hard
Mugs get scarred, thugs get barred
Treated like slaves in the yard
Playing the field, most niggas tell and squeal
That's why I move for 'self, only me and my steel
Cause shit is real and leary niggas will rat you out
Get under pressure by the jakes when they smack 'em out
Gat in they mouth, for talking, you sleep-walking
Can't play the street often, become a victim for extortion
For your fortune, your bank rose
Stank hoes, you think I ain't cold?
Run up in your crib, take everything, even the sink goes
You sweat like a pink rose
Can you smell it, when you soft like velvet?
Catch one up in your helmet, get dealt wit
On the quick-fast, take you on a great adventure like Six Flags
Spent every day of my life just trying to get cash
So when my shit blasts
Duck behind buildings for shelter, or you'll get hit fast
Catch whiplash, fucking wit Trife, you must've skipped class
Your bitch-ass didn't take notes, infra-red scope beaming
I'm tired of dreaming, I want to hit the big screen and
But keep an open eye for them cats who stay scheming",One Life to Live,

You turned the tables on me
And now I'm falling for you;
You turned the tables on me
I can't believe that it's true
I always thought when you brought
The lovely present you bought
Why hadn't you brought me more,
But now if you'd come
I'd welcome anything
From the five and ten cent store,

You used to call me the top
You put me up on a throne
You let me fall with a drop

To be sure when day is done
That the hour is coming when you'll be kissed

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,

Teddi King,"After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no Bromo-Seltzer handy, I don't even shake
Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation put me on the blink

I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?
Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it although the laughs on me
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it like a babe in arms
Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation put me on the blink

I've sinned a lot, I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?
I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best
Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I?

Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last

Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot

My thoughts all stray, stray to you

In the still of the night
While the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number
When I say to you

Do you love me
Just like I love you
Are you my life to be
That dream come true
Or will this dream of mine
Will it fade way out of sight

Just like that moon growing dim
Way out on the rim of the hill

Teddi King,"When you were very young
The world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel

The circus tent was strung
With every star in the sky
Above the ring you loved so well

Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the silver and gold

Sit there and count your fingers what can you do
Old girl, you're through
Just sit there and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

A song in blue
Like a flower crying
For the dew
That was my heart serenading you
My prelude to a kiss

If you hear a song that grows
From my tender sentimental woes
That was my heart trying to compose
A prelude to a kiss

Though it's just a simple melody
With nothing fancy
Nothing much
You could turn it to a symphony
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch

Oh how my love song gently cries
For the tenderness within your eyes
My love is a prelude that never dies

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Teddy,"I've been in the wrong system, the wrong territory, for way too long
If I say it's right and I show it to Johnny, looks back at me like it sounds wrong
Who am I making music for then?
(Ask him) Me, the label or him?
I go macho on people eat their tunes 'cause really Wiley goes in
I'm torn between catering for me and the fans, (I'm going mad)
I only hear my big hits where people go to get tans, (Beach)
What's that to me is they want easy, I can't show skills
For the wayward music they want brother, I don't want mils (I don't want mils)

I step back looking in from the outside
Wondering if it sounds right
Sounds good to me
On this path it's good to be (Yeah)
You could do the hook for me (Okay)
Or I could do the hook for free (That's right!)
Got a rave booked at one
Leave an hour gap then I'm booked til three (uuhh)

Where do I start with this one
I was on the outside trying to get inside
With the tools outside I got inside
In a matter of time I was doing a lot
Might see me with a lighty on the block
Wiley told me to murk this
So I gotta make this worth it
When I spit, spit to kill, not only Fruity Loops that I kill
I'm a lord of the beats fam
Check YouTube, every man knows that it got real
Five bills for a grime beat, that's real
Had 'em scared and shook like I just got signed and dropped, let go from the deal
I'mma stack till I get mils

I step back looking in from the outside
Wondering if it sounds right
Sounds good to me
On this path it's good to be
Yeah, you could do the hook for me
Or I could do the hook for free
Got a rave booked at 1
Leave an hour gap then I'm booked til three

I don't know who's approval man's seeking
Or what crowd man's tryna be reaching
Don't wanna make tunes that are bait
I make music for an acquired taste
Started doing this thing 'cause I loved it
Not to make tunes for the general public
Our music is made to measure
Wiley is a national treasure
Not everybody is gonna like it
If they don't like it, fuck 'em
Man really started from the bottom
Walk in to radio, man ain't forgotten
I used to pay 5 pounds a week to get heard
Now I get five bags for spoken word
Personally I think man's winning
And it's only the end of the beginning

I step back looking in from the outside
Wondering if it sounds right
Sounds good to me
On this path it's good to be (Yeah)
You could do the hook for me (Okay)
Or I could do the hook for free (That's right!)
Got a rave booked at one
Leave an hour gap then I'm booked til three

Teddy ,"Did you ever hear the story
That happened not long ago?
'Bout the man with a tan
El Diablo de Mexico

And this man played his hand
And he lived by the luck of the draw
Now and then and again
Found him stepping outside of the law
Hey, hey

And his fortune he had made
Let him live high on the hog
'Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog

He was out on the run
Knowing he could get by
'Cause the men killed in sin
Were not there to testify
Hey, hey!

He was caught, he was bound
In La Casa de Calaboose
He was tried, he was found
And readied for the noose

But the break he would make
It didn't turn out so well
And the hombre called Diablo
Bid his last farewell",El Diablo,2007

The weather there is nice and warm
The climate's of a Southern brand
But here's what I don't understand

They got a gal there, a pretty gal there
Who's colder than an arctic storm
Got a heart just like a stone
Even ice men leave her alone

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Leather is tough, but Hannah's heart is tougher
She's a gal who loves to see men suffer

To tease them and thrill them, to torture and kill them
Is her delight, they say; I saw her at the seashore with a great big pan
There was Hannah, pouring water on a drowning man
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

They call her Hard-Hearted Hannah
The Vamp of Savannah, the meanest gal in town
Talk of your cold, refrigerating mamas
Brother, she's the polar bear's pajamas

Is her delight; they say an evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees
Is like traveling through Alaska in your B-V-D's
She's Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah, GA

Can you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?
She's got the right name, the Vamp of Savannah

While we're dancing please hold me tight; step lively don't lag.

You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl

You've made me break a many true vow

You've filled my heart with weary old blues

You've made me throw my old friend down

But beautiful!

Beautiful to take a chance
And if you fall, you fall,
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all.
Love is tearful or it's gay.
It's a problem or it's play,
It's a heartache either way,
But beautiful!

And I'm thinking if you were mine
I'd never let you go,
And that would be but beautiful I know.",But Beautiful,1966
Teddy Edwards,"If you could see me now, you'd know how blue I've been
One look is all you'd need to see the mood I'm in.
Perhaps then you'd realize I'm still in love with you.
If you could see me now, you'd find me being brave
And trying awfully hard to make my tears behave
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you.
 
You'll happen my way on some mem'rable day
And the month will be May for a while.
I'll try to smile but can I play the part
Without my heart behind the smile?
 
The way I feel for you I never could disguise
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes.
I think you'd be mine again if you could see me now.",If You Could See Me Now,1979
Teddy Edwards,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,1993
Teddy Edwards,"My heart is sad and lonely
For you I sigh, for you dear only
Why haven't you seen it

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

My life a wreck you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender myself to you body and soul

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Blame your kiss as sweet as a kiss can be
And blame all your charms that melt in my arms

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

I would be right there to catch your tears

Teddy Grace,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.

Teddy Grace,"I dreamed of two blue orchids
Two beautiful blue orchids
One night while in my lonely room
I dreamed of two blue orchids
So full of love and light
That I wanted to possess each tender bloom
Then my dream took wings
And through a thousand springs
Blue orchids seemed in a world apart
But when I met you
Something pale and blue
Came stealing from the meadows of my heart
I saw my two blue orchids
My beautiful blue orchids
Last night and what a sweet surprise
When you looked at me
It was plain to see
Blue orchids only bloom in your eyes",Blue Orchids,2006
Teddy J. Politzer,"Whoa...There's something on my mind
Won't somebody please, please tell me what's wrong

You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to live in this world
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad
You know you love him, you can't understand
Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man

He's got me smilin' when I should be ashamed
Got me laughing when my heart is in pain
Oh no, I must be a fool
But I'll do anything you ask me to
 
You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to live in this world
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad
You know you love him, you can't understand
Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man

Without my man I don't wanna live
You think I'm lying but I'm telling you like it is
He's got my nose open and that's no lie
And I, I'm gonna keep him satisfied
 
You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to live in this world
You take the good along with the bad
Sometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad
You know you love him, you can't understand
Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man

A wave of action speaks louder than words
The truest thing that I ever heard
I trust my man and all that he do
And I, and I'll do anything he wants me to do
 
You're just a fool, you know you're in love
You've got to face it to live in this world

Why he treats you like he do when he's such a good man",A Fool in Love,2002
Teddy J. Politzer,"If you want some loving,
That I can give to you.
And if you want some hugging, 
Said I can hug some, too.

All I want, baby, now
Is some thought of you
And just a little of your affection,
You know, will see me through.

'Cause you know that you are my man,
And I want you to forever be mine.
I idolize you (Yes, she idolize you)
",I Idolize You,2002
Teddy Jackson,"You and your friends watch videos
Try and dance like Beyoncé
You was raised a church girl
Now you always find yourself out on Sunday
And do on Monday the same thing you did Tuesday
And Wednesday feel the same
Now you feel uncool like your auntie husband
And you don't wanna feel that lame
But you don't know that much
But it's okay go pour that up
If you got your drink then hold that up
'Cause you ain't pay for it 'cause you got a big ol' ass
So somebody bought it
You ain't gotta pay that back
I'm like, each night and it don't get old
But just know everything that glisten ain't gold, so
Don't believe everything you've been told
Just know that your future ain't sitting in stone like
Rolling Stone, I rock like granite
Hit the stage, rock the mic like Janet
If I say things they might just happen
Turn stock to seeds I might just plant it up
With no ring, just a Saturn, whip
You used to get your son from baby daddy (uh)
I ain't judging beauty pageants but
Time ain't never moving backwards
So, okay get this infamy
I just feel all the vibe that you sent for me
If God sent me an inquiry
About angels
And instantly you fell outta the sky
With a pair of some angel wings
Would you believe in the thing called destiny:
So would you live for me, or die for me, or sin for me
Or play along baby girl like a symphony, I'm like

Would you live for me?
Die for me?
Sin for me?
Cry for me?
Baby, if I wrote you a symphony
Tell me, would you play along? 
(Come on! Ay, play along! Ay)
Tell me, would you play along? (Come on! Ay, play along! Ay)
Tell me, would you play along? 

Would you live for me
Die for me?
Sin for me?
Cry for me?
Baby, if I wrote you a symphony
Tell me, would you play along? 

I said
Play along play along
Look, it ain't that hard
Don't act too cool, play your part
And if your card decline and you claim fraud
And if your man's there then he gon' take that charge
But if it's never your fault then it's never your fault
If you don't got money, you can say that thought
And you ain't learn a thing, now you pay back loans
For that diploma that sit on your wall at home (damn)
So who you owe, what you own?
You say you grown but I can't tell
Pop out, best fit you gon' put it on
But you still out here takin' them big L's
Broken nail, crack the screen
Worked at noon, slept 'til 3
At the club you risked it all
'Cause you stayed there 'til they turned the lights on
Looking for that love and basketball (like why?)
Really, no, I'm just saying
You be looking for the right things in wrong places
Make a man catch chills from your body language
At this point get lost in translation
Like damn, know they got it in for me
I can feel all the vibes that you sent for me
It's scientific chemistry, you wifey
Wifi, you connect to me
So let me be the Adam and you be Eve
But really girl I'm just trying to feel you're energy
So would you live for me, or die for me, or sin for me
Or play along baby girl like a symphony, I'm like

Would you live for me?
Die for me?
Sin for me?
Cry for me?
Baby if I wrote you a symphony
Tell me, would you play along? 
(Come on!) Play along
Tell me, would you play along? (Yo)
Tell me, would you play along?

If god sent me an inquiry
About angels that he missed consistently
And then you fell out of the sky with some angel wings
Would you believe it was meant to be? Huh? Like

Ooh, baby it's your move (Play along, play)
It's your move
Tell me what you want to do
Let it out, so, tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want to do, let it out",Symphony,2017

Oh hoo hooooo baby 
Oh yeah 
Eh hey 
Why you want to playa hate on me?? 

Nobody can help him 
So welcome to the land of ski maskes 
We blastes 
To bust a couple of caps up in they weak asses 
The dust that's bein kicked up 
An Yuk is down to lick up 
Do a stick up 
At an Armor truck pick up 
Then get tucked, 
Up out the scenery, 
Wit greenery, 
Stopped up, watch up, 
Sew the block up wit creamery, 
The cream, I sling, got fiends on my team, 
Like a fiend I dream, an hoes swing on my ding-a-ling, 
Sumpthin tremendous, 
They spend grip, 
Endless trips to Macy's, they trade me, 
So playa hataz hate me, 
I keep the safety off my four-fifth, 
Hold it in focus, 
Fools didn't used to trip on my dick when I was the brokest, 
But notice, I got a lil mail now, 
'Cause everbody bump L-you-N-I-Z like hell now, 
You juss a busta brown an blood you know, 
Chris spreadin faulty rumors around the Town like Club New Vogue, 
Really though.

Why you wanna playa hate on me??

Keep my business to myself, 
'Cause hataz talk mo than get shot to spread rumors when it's loaded, 
Hatin' get yo grill exploded, 
Quick, 
Severed, 
The first thing I heard, 
I stole a credit card from Chris Webber, 
I never knew that, 
But's who's that, an next, 
I heard them ridin' around smokin' crack in the back of my homies Lex, 
It be them broke ass, no cash, 
Bustaz tryin to quote that's why the Town got rid 'o $hort, 
I think you busta browns need to wise up, 
Before we ride up, 
Stop, 
Sew up yo block, an sew them lies up, 
Once don't trip, 
Twice no grip, 
Three timmesss, will get you bucked wit the nine, 
I thought the hatin' would stop, but the rumors are passin' still, 
Sounds like that busta that plugged mo holes than mass appeal, 
You need to stop!! 
Hatin' on, 
The see-N-O-T-E, D-are-you, an the L-you-N-I-Z.

Gotta think for you so leave the Luniz alone.

You stress, 
When you test the young Hugh Heff, 
The tech a spit up, 
Chest get lit up, 
Foo that's a rigg up, 

Now I think the whole world knows me, 
Not what they should know, 
It's like rap an sellin' crack is all I'm good for, 
Hangin' in the hood for so long, 
I see why they talk, 
Bitches, 
Snitch a bustaz home. 

(Can we talkkkk.... fo a minute??) 

You're wrong I won't be offended, 
I be there hand in hand wit the pencil, 
Can it all be so simple, 
Like Wu-Tang, spit true game, to get pootang, 
From a nimfo. 

Now I keep sayin, 
Don't get mad 'cause you can't bump me, 
But I'm still gonna spit it, 
'Cause you still don't get it, 
If it ain't noted, don't quote it, 
Hataz when it comes to common sense you ain't showed it, 
I don't understand!

Teddy Johnson,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior

Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""

Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,2003

Why make me remember what I want to forget?
I've been lonely, lonely too long
Emotions, please leave me alone

You worry my days, yes, you torture my nights
Never a dream, no, those dreams never turn out right

When lights are low

Music hath charms 
Life's so appealing
With inspiration, in your arms

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2012

Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

Now I only want to to melt

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Just the same
I'm not entirely to blame
For love
You'd be so easy to love
So easy to idolize
All others above
So worth the yearning for
So swell to keep every home fire burning for

We'd be so grand at the game
So carefree together
That it does seem a shame
That you can't see
Your future with me
Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love",Easy To Love,2012
