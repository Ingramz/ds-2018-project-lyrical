Reggie Smith,"I believe in a hill called mount calvary
I believe whatever the cost
And when time has surrendered
And earth is no more
I'll still cling to the old rugged cross
I believe that this life with it's great mysteries
Surely someday will come to an end
But faith will conquer the darkness and death
And will lead at last to my friend
I believe that the Christ
Who was slain on the cross
Has the power to change lives today
For He changed me completely
A new life is mine
And that is why by the cross
I will stay
I believe in a hill called mount calvary
I believe whatever the cost
And when time has surrendered
And earth is no more
I'll still cling to the old rugged cross

Some say faith
Is just believing
Others say it's self decieving
Inventing, childish dreams
To get us through
Deep inside me
There's a yearning
For true wisdom
Not just learning
I'd trade all my clever questions
For one answer that is true
I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be
My lord
My God
Lord you know, I need some answers
Questions eat at me like cancer
Make me once again, a simple child
Help me take the risk of losing
Lose it all to find in choosing
To believe You are the answer
Earth and heaven reconciled
I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only son
I do believe
I touch I see
That all along
You've longed to be
I do believe
You are the one
The home I've longed to find
My only hope
God's only son
I do believe
I touch, I see
That all along You've longed to be
My Lord
My God
My Lord
My God

If you could see what I once was
If you could go with me
Back to where I started from
Then I know you would see

A miracle of love that took me
In it's sweet embrace
And made me what I am today
Just an old sinner saved by grace

I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place

Now I live and breathe in freedom
With each breath of life I take
Loved and forgiven, backed with a living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace

How could I boast on anything
I've ever seen or done?
How could I dare to claim as mine
The victories God has won?

Where would I be
Had God not brought me
Gently to this place?
I'm here to say I'm nothing
But a sinner saved by grace

I'm just a sinner saved by grace
When I stood condemned to death
He took my place

Now I grow and breathe in freedom
With each breath of life I take
I'm loved and forgiven backed with a living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace

Now I grow and breathe in freedom
With each breath of life I take
I'm loved and forgiven backed with a living
I'm just a sinner saved by grace

Reggie Smith,"Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy wounded side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save from wrath and make me pure. 
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone. 
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress;
Helpless, look to Thee for grace;
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Savior, or I die. 
While I draw this fleeting breath,
When my eyes shall close in death,
When I rise to worlds unknown,
And behold Thee on Thy throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.
",Rock of Ages,1999
Reggie Smith,"Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound 
 That saved a wretch like me. 
 I once was lost but now I'm found, 
 Was blind but now I see. 
 T'was grace that taught my heart to fear 
 And grace my fear relieved 
 How precious did that grace appear, 
 The hour I first believed. 
 Through many dangers, toils and snares 
 We have already come 
 T'was grace that brought us safe thus far 
 And grace will lead us home. 
 When we've been there ten thousand years 
 Bright shining as the sun; 
 We've no less days to sing God's praise 
 Than when we first begun",Amazing Grace [DVD],2008
Reggie Smith,"I am weak but Thou art strong Jesus keep me from all wrong
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk let me walk close to Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee grant it Jesus is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee let it be dear Lord let it be
When my feeble life is o'er time for me will be no more
Guide me gently safely o'er to Thy kingdom shore to Thy shore
Just a closer walk with Thee",Just a Closer Walk with Thee [DVD],2008
Reggie Smith,"I once was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in

Reggie Smith,"O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
How great Thou art, How great Thou art!

When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim: ""My God, how great Thou art!""

How great Thou art, How great Thou art.

Reggie Smith,"Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heaven and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

""Let not your heart be troubled,"" His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.

Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.

I sing because I'm happy,
I sing because I'm free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.",His Eye is On the Sparrow,2011
Reggie Smith,"There's a line that is drawn through the ages 
On that line stands an old rugged cross 
On that cross, a battle is raging 
To gain a man's soul or it's loss 

On one side, march the forces of evil
 All the demons, all the devils of hell 
On the other, the angels of glory 
And they meet on Golgotha's hill 

The earth shakes with the force of the conflict 
And the sun refuses to shine 
For there hangs God's son, in the balance 
And then through the darkness he cries

It is finished, the battle is over 
It is finished, there'll be no more war 
It is finished, the end of the conflict 
It is finished and Jesus is Lord

Yet in my heart, the battle was still raging 
Not all prisoners of war had come home 
These were battlefields of my own making 
I didn't know that the war had been won 

Oh, but then I heard the king of the ages 
Had fought all the battles for me 
And that victory was mine for the claiming 
And now praise his name, I am free",The Old Rugged Cross,2011
Reggie Thomas,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo.

Reggie Thomas,"In my solitude
You haunt me
With dreadful ease
Of days gone by

In my solitude
You taunt me
With memories
That never die

I sit in my chair
And filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm afraid
Dear Lord above
Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

Reggie Watkins,"You say I'm aggressive, too possessive; it's too soon, too much
You want to wait around, slow it down, but I'm burnin' up
What can I do to get through to you? I know that you're the one
'Cause there's no controllin' this emotion; it's bigger than us

[Chorus]
You don't know what love is if you think that I can fight this feeling
Keep my true heart from revealing everything inside
You don't know what love is if you hear me say you're mine forever
Feel our two hearts beat together and think you can resist
You don't know what love is

It's soft and gentle; it's sentimental
Can't you feel it too?
There's no denyin' or compromising; it's perfectly true
It's overpowering; it's all around me when I'm around you

[Chorus]

I see you smile and, girl, I'm sure I've found it
Heaven knows there's just no doubt about it now

[Chorus]

Reggie Watts,"(Sunshine)
I can see
By the dawn
Words of thoughts that meaning but we carry alone
And I feel
You so strong
Any time we do is like I'm doing all wrong

And we are moving
Like we need it
Waves are crashing in and we can barely perceive it
Baby
When you move
You make me feel like I got something to prove

Take your time
I wanna change your mind
I wanna make you mine
I wanna figure it out
Take you now
I want to show you how
I wanna know what it means, what your all about

Take your time
I wanna change your mind
I wanna make you mine
I wanna figure it out
Take you now
I want to show you how
I wanna know what it means to be on your side

Sunshines on my baby out on the floor
Sometimes love shines like never before

(Sunshine)
There's a word
For your kiss
Any definition is a failed attempt
And the way
Of your words
Haunt me in my dreams to the point of absurd

And were moving
Like we need it
Waves are crashing in and we can barely perceive it
Baby
When you move
You make me feel like I got something to prove

Sunshines on my baby out on the floor
Sometimes love shines like never before (never before)
Sunshines on my baby out on the floor (yea)
Sometimes love shines like never before (never before yea never be-never before)

Sometimes I think there's never enough (never enough)
Every moment counts when you looking for love (looking for love)
The meaning of it all seems to fade away
When I see you in that perfect place

Reggie Workman,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1965
Reggie Workman,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1987
Reggie Workman,"It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To become when you've found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way, and I know
That I have to go away
I know, I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down
And take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times, that I've cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
And it's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

But its them they know, not me 
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away 
I know, I have to go",Father and Son,1988
Reggie Workman,"Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
And miss it each night and day
I know I'm not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger 
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi
Hurrying into Spring

The moonlight on the bayou
A Creole tune that fills the air
I dream about magnolias in bloom
And I'm wishin' I was there

And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for

Every mornin' at the mine you could see him arrive
He stood six-foot-six and weighed two-forty-five
Kinda broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip
And everybody knew ya didn't give no lip to big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

Nobody seemed to know where John called home
He just drifted into town and stayed all alone
He didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy
And if you spoke at all, you just said hi to Big John

Somebody said he came from New Orleans
Where he got in a fight over a Cajun Queen
And a crashin' blow from a huge right hand
Sent a Louisiana fellow to the promised land, big John
(Big John, big John)

Then came the day at the bottom of the mine
When a timber cracked and men started cryin'
Miners were prayin' and hearts beat fast
And everybody thought that they'd breathed their last, 'cept John

Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell
Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well
Grabbed a saggin' timber, gave out with a groan
And like a giant oak tree he just stood there alone, big John
(Big John, big John)
Big bad John (big John)

And with all of his strength he gave a mighty shove
Then a miner yelled out ""there's a light up above!""
And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave
Now there's only one left down there to save, big John

With jacks and timbers they started back down
Then came that rumble way down in the ground
And then smoke and gas belched out of that mine
Everybody knew it was the end of the line for big John

Now, they never reopened that worthless pit
They just placed a marble stand in front of it

Reggie Young,"While resting the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
And he was talking to the Lord just like he'd be talking to a friend

Well he said with his voice calm and quiet
Them corn tassels need sucking I got no strength to tie it
Had no rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable hot that the kids were even gettin' fussy

Now that grass down and the pasture it should be knee high
If we could just have a little shower Lord it might keep the calf from going dry
Oh but listen to me talking you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord you'd think I was down right hateful

You'd think I forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the money in the mail that took care of the rent
Mama's cough's better and Johnny's home from the navy
And that good Sunday dinner of hot chicken and dumplings and gravy

And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the man
Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord I won't take no more your time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line

Don't you worry about us now Lord cause everything is gonna be all right",The Farmer and the Lord,1999
Reggie Young,"(God put a song in the heart of an angel and softly she sang it to me)
I get to thinkin' lotta times about when I was a lad 
Of the old home place where I grew up of the days both good and bad 
My overalls were hand-me-downs shoes full of holes 
I used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold
I've seen the nights when my daddy would cry 
For the things that his family would need
But all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed
And yet and somehow our homefire never flickered once
Cause when all the things went wrong
Mama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song
(What a friend we have in Jesus)
I've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend
Morning come Rock of Ages it gently wake me once again
Then daddy'd reach up and take the Bible down and he'd read it
Read it loud and strong
And I always felt that maybe our home was blessed
When daddy'd say mama sing a song
Sister left home first I guess then Bob and Tommy and Dan
By then dad's hair was turning grey and I had to be mama's little man
But it seemed that when dad grew weak mom's faith grew strong
And I think those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song
(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)
I guess the old house is still standin' I don't go back much anymore
No voice is left to fill those halls no steps to grace the floor
For you see mama sings in heaven now round God's golden throne
But I'll always believe that this old world is a whole lot better place
Because one time my mama sang a song (precious mem'ries flood my soul)",Mama Sang a Song,1999
Reggie Young,"The General just gave me a medal oh I'm a sight for mom to see
But when the news gets round that I ain't got ole Bill
Some kids gonna think a whole lot less of me
You see she gave me that puppy and said he'd protect me through the night

And if I got hurt he'd go for help or he'd back me up in a fight
He growed all the while I was trainin' forget him I never will
'Cause you'd never see me with right at my heels was Oklahoma Bill
We hit a long ridge one sunup and it seemed like death held all the cards

'Cause we payed and payed with lives of men for every hard fought yard
When finally we drove up to the top there wasn't nothin' but death behind
And as we all dug in we all thanked God though we numbered only nine
And as the snipers switched their guns as darkness closed that hill

My soul companion in the night was Oklahoma Bill
There's no glory in a battle once you've seen its awful cost
But there's glory in the knowledge that your flag is never lost
And yet in the stillness of the nightime and all alone you hold a post

You start cryin' like a baby sittin' there with all the ghosts
You feel your buddies are pattin' your back though their guns're silent and still
It's only a dog tryin' to love you my Oklahoma Bill
I gave my note to the Colonel and I bound a shattered leg

And I said Bill we're sure in trouble he never whimpered or begged
I could tell he hated to leave me I was the only God he ever knew
But quick as a flash he took of through the night like a fightin' marine would do

Reggie Young,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound

And the auctioneer felt it was hardly worth his while,
To waste much time on the old violin but he held it up with a smile,
Well it sure ain't much but its all we got left I guess we aught to sell it to,
Oh, now who'll start the bid on this old violin?
Just one more and we'll be through.

And then he cried one give me one dollar,
Who'll make it two only two dollars who'll make it three,
Three dollars twice now that's a good price,
Now who's gonna bid for me?
Raise up your hand now don't wait any longer the auctions about to end,
Who's got four Just one dollar more to bid on this old violin?

Well the air was hot and the people stood around as the sun was setting low,
From the back of the crowd a gray haired man,
Came forward and picked up the bow,
He wiped the dust from the old violin then he tightened up the strings,
Then he played out a melody pure and sweet, sweeter than the Angels sing, 
And then the music stopped and the auctioneer, 
With a voice that was quiet and low he said now what am I bid,
For this old violin and he held it up with a bow.

And then he cried out one give me one thousand,
Who'll make it two only two thousand who'll make it three,
Three thousand twice you know that's a good price,
Common who's gonna to bid for me?
And the people cried out what made the change we don't understand,
Then the auctioneer stopped and he said with a smile,
It was the touch of the Master's hand.

You know threes many a man with his life out of tune,
Battered and scared with sin and he's auctioned cheap,
To a thankless world much like that old violin,
Oh, but then the Master comes,
And that old foolish crowd they never understand,
The worth of a soul and the change that is rought,
Just by one touch of the Masters hand.

In the morning
At the diner
On the corner

I am waiting
At the counter
For the man
To pour the coffee

And he fills it
Only halfway
And before
I even argue

He is looking
Out the window
At somebody
Coming in

""It is always
Nice to see you""
Says the man
Behind the counter

To the woman
Who has come in
She is shaking
Her umbrella

And I look
The other way
As they are kissing
Their hellos

I'm pretending
Not to see them
And Instead
I pour the milk

I open
Up the paper
There's a story
Of an actor

Who had died
While he was drinking
He was no one
I had heard of

And I'm turning
To the horoscope
And looking
For the funnies

When I'm feeling
Someone watching me
And so
I raise my head

There's a woman
On the outside
Looking inside
Does she see me?

No she does not
Really see me
Cause she sees
Her own reflection

And I'm trying
Not to notice
That she's hitching
Up her skirt

And while she's
Straightening her stockings
Her hair
Is getting wet

Oh, this rain
It will continue
Through the morning
As I'm listening

To the bells
Of the cathedral
I am thinking
Of your voice...

And of the midnight picnic
Once upon a time
Before the rain began...

That's where I had my first heart break
I still remember how it all changed

We ruled the world,
Thought I'll never lose her out of sight,
We were so young
I think of her now and then
I still hear the songs, reminding me of a friend

But it's about Jesus and a way, a truth, a life 
That can change a heart and a soul forever

It's the power of the blood 
That brings us to redemption 
We can rise above the fall 
And the reason for it all

I search for the best I can see

I won't be the best I can be

I'll go away, When I know
I'll come back on my knees some day?
For whatever my man is 
I am his forever more
Oh, my man I love him
 
Sometimes I say 
If I could just get away 
With my man
He'd go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream 
Of a cottage by a stream 
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too and I wonder what
It is I feel for you

You're gonna make it through the night

You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help
See, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself
Behavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it
But every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it
Losin' friends day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there won't be a his or hers, just ours
Then you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years
Do the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers
I will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him

You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against
Everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
That's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before
'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war
Between good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you
If you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

My Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead
Take what's in my heart and put it in my head
See, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you
My life is yours, my soul I gave you
I don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)
And we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)
But I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example, if I can do it, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do

I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him (The light with him)
'Cause you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
'Cause you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)

He's by your side
Right by your side

Books on the shelf thoughts on the shelf 
Hands to myself, i should definitely keep my hands to myself

Caught between madness and gladness of flight 
Nothing is wrong and nothing is right

Full of frustration and anger and fear 
Everything's tears 
Nobody hears 
Nobody's here, and nobody hears

Made eye contact with a solitary pickle

But where the bedside lamp had been
Is now emanating soft soft green
Has it always been this way?
Is it possible that all this magic went unnoticed?

maybe now things will start to change, 
And life will turn a better page
No more rage.

Running hopeful through the aisles

But not a single jar will smile

And pickles are just pickles

It is raining
He's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings
Trying to save his suit

Tryin' to dryin' to tryin' to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says ""ew""
Everyone who sees him says ""ew""

Cause last night he got a visit
From the ghost of corporate future

Imagine you go away on a business trip one day
And when you come back home
Your children have grown and you never made your wife moan

And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic
And everyone's sarcastic
And all your food is frozen
It needs to be defrosted

You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now

And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
Or lick a rock
Or both
Maybe you should cut your own hair
Cause that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead

People are just people
They shouldn't make you nervous
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
If you don't toss your plastic
The streets won't be so plastic
And if you kiss somebody
Then both of you'll get practice

Put dirtballs in your pockets

Regina Spektor,"In Dusseldorf I met a clown
His nose, it was red
In Gelterkinden I forgot to frown
Then remembered again
In Paris I saw a big fish
Swimming slow in the Seine
It made me hopeful that someday our
Water will be breathable again

In Frankfurt I heard ein zwei drei
Counting cookies and no one was shot
In Berlin stopped by the polizai
For drunk driving and everyone smiled
In Prague I knew I'd been a witch
Burnt alive, a pyre of Soviet kitsch
It made me miss my Moscow mother
It made me miss my New York nothing

In Montpelier I stayed in a chateau
A boy climbed into my bed and he knew no boundaries
And in Amsterdam I got quite crazy
Might have been all the tulips and canals
Or it might have been all that hash, and in
Barcelona, buenos dias, chocolate, le Picasso
And in Brussels, clean-cut hostel
And in London, me and the French existentialistsâ?¦

In Corsica I floated away
All the way to Marseilles
I should have held an afterparty
For all the thoughts I didn't say
In Dusseldorf I met a dwarf
With bad breath and a really good tan
In Gelterkinden I remembered how to laugh
And I never ever forgot it againâ?¦",Düsseldorf [*],2006

They laugh at tragedies

But they believe her
They never leave her while she sings

That you will cry in spite of you
Little wet tears on your baby's shoulder

There ain't nothin' right, there ain't nothin' wrong

It feels a little worse
Than when we drove our hearse
Right through that screaming crowd
While laughing up a storm
Until we were just bone
Until it got so warm
That none of us could sleep
And all the Styrofoam
Began to melt away
We tried to find some worms
To aid in the decay
But none of them were home
Inside their catacomb
A million ancient bees
Began to sting our knees
While we were on our knees
Praying that disease
Would leave the ones we love
And never come again

On the radio
We heard November Rain
That solo's really long
But it's a pretty song
We listened to it twice
'Cause the DJ was asleep

This is how it works
You're young until you're not
You love until you don't
You try until you can't
You laugh until you cry
You cry until you laugh
And everyone must breathe
Until their dying breath

No, this is how it works
You peer inside yourself
You take the things you like
And try to love the things you took
And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
And walking arm in arm
You hope it don't get harmed
But even if it does
You'll just do it all again

You hear November Rain

But a spoiled little prince I was not
Had a chamber maid and a chamber pot
And there's thirty one others just like me
There's thirty one others I can be

Someimtes I'd stand by the royal wall
The sky'd be so big that it broke my soul
And I stood on my toes to catch a glimpse
Of my mother's eyes and my mother's skin
And she retired to her chamber
And we remain quite strangers

And to see me made her awful sad
And to touch me made her awful sad
And to see me made her awful
And to touch me made her awful


And one morning I woke up
And I thought Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus, Oedipus
Then one morning I woke up and I thought Rex, Rex, Rex

People screaming love and hate

And they scream

Long live the king,
Long live the queen

And to touch me made her awful sad

Wait for the earth to suddenly shake
For the walls to somehow suddenly come crumbling, tumbling and
For the bars to somehow magically break

Aw, there's nothing wrong with them
That a thousand bucks can't fix
That a thousand arms can't hold down
In the ground they're tattooing the stones with
cusses like cavemen - your momma was here

But they want to run through the air with no barriers or obstacles
Gunmen or guard dogs or priests
And to rise from the mud and start over and over
With the people all dead.

Then none of this shit would have ever gone down

You were way out of your mind
Wrapped up in my reveries

Be careful, you fool, there are certain rules
Even for a fellow like you
But don't be alarmed, no one gets harmed

But why'd you have to steal my heart?
Well, I didn't plan to go berserk
Baby, you were such a jerk

Well, just hear me out

Lost like some forgotten dreams

Do you ever sit and wonder,
It's so strange
That we could be together for
So long, and never know, never care
What goes on in the other one's head?

Things I've felt but I've never said
You said things that I never said
So I'll say something that I should have said long ago:

(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all
(You don't know me)
You don't know me at all (at all)

You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me (paint me)
Any face that you wanted me
To be seen.
We're
Damned by the existential moment where
We saw the couple in the coma and
It was we were the cliche,
But we carried on anyway.

So, sure, I could just close my eyes.
Yeah, sure, trace and memorize,
But can you go back once you know

Clueless chump you seem to think I am
So easily led astray,
An errant dog who occasionally escapes and needs a shorter leash, then
Why the fuck would you want me back?!

Maybe it's because

(You don't know me at all)

(You don't know me,
you don't know me.)

So, what I'm trying to say is
What (What?)
I'm trying to tell you
It's not gonna come out like I wanna say it cause I know you'll only change it.

Others said it must have been the weather
The neighbors were trying to keep it quiet
But I swear that I could hear the laughter
So they jokingly nicknamed it the porridge
Cause overnight that lake had turned as thick as butter

Saying that to them it doesn't matter

Hold in your breath til you thought it through, you fool

Wiping clean the ketchup bottle labels
Getting high and mumbling German fables
Didn't care as long as he was able
To strip his clothes off by the dumpsters
At night while everyone was sleeping
And to wade midway into that porridge
Just him and the secret he was keeping

If you just hold in your breath til you come back up in full
Hold in your breath til you thought it through, you foolish child

With donuts, coffee and reporters
The kids were waking up hungover
The neighbors were starting up their cars
The garbageman were emptying the dumpsters

Dreaming that the antidote is orgasm

And the flickering lights it cannot get beyond

Inside were pictures of your small family
You were so young
Your hair dark brown
You had been born in nineteen fifty-three

Your winter birthday
Was stamped on the plastic
Of a license so recently expired
I was so tired
As I walked through my door
I laid all the contents of your wallet on the floor

And like a holy relic
Or a mystery novel
I thumbed them in the dim light
Searching for a clue
A blockbuster card
An old stick of juicy fruit
A crumpled receipt
From a pair of leather boots

You said things that I never said

You don't know me at all

You could have just propped me up on the table like a mannequin
Or a cardboard stand-up and paint me (paint me)
Any face that you wanted me
To be seen.
We're
Damned by the existential moment where
We saw the couple in the coma and
It was we were the cliche,
But we carried on anyway.

So, sure, I could just close my eyes.

But can you go back once you know

An errant dog who occasionally escapes and needs a shorter leash, then
Why the fuck would you want me back?!

Maybe it's because

(You don't know me,
you don't know me.)

So, what I'm trying to say is
What (What?)
I'm trying to tell you

Until we knew them mathematically

Until forever

We didn't know better

So we made our own computer
Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking
While we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation

And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Our hearts were little stones

Pulled 'em out they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat 'em up against each other
We beat 'em up against each other
We struck 'em hard against each other
We struck 'em so hard, so hard til they sparked

So it soon might be that

And we'll warm up our hands by the fire

Don't judge so harsh

You are only spying
Everyone knows it's going to hurt
But at least we'll get hurt trying

And it gathers regret
Someday you'll wake up and feel a great pain
And you'll miss every toy you ever owned

You'll want to go back
You'll wish you were small
Nothing can solve your crying
You'll take the clock off of your wall
And you'll wish that it was lying

Love what you have and you'll have more love
You're not dying
Everyone knows you're going to love
Though there's still no cure for crying",Firewood,2012

How can I never see you again?

Went wrong

That we will meet again somehow

Oh, oh, oh, oh baby
How can I begin again?
How can I try to love someone new?
Someone who isn't you
How can our love be true?
When I'm not, ooh
I'm not over you

I guess you know by now
That we will meet again somehow

Time can come and take away the pain
But I just want my memories to remain
To hear your voice
To see your face

To grab their guitars and run out to the hall
And we're coming out right along to sing them my new song

For every place there is a bus
That'll take you where you must
Start counting all your money and friends before you come back again

For every road we can retrace
For every memory we can't face
For every name that's been erased
Let's have another round
May I propose a little toast?
For all the ones who hurt the most
For all the friends that we have lost

And then you run to the old lake house

Under the floorboards there's a deep well
That leads to a spring that sprung up in hell
That's where old devils danced and kissed
And made their blood pacts in the ancient myths
And running through forest they screamed in chorus
While piercing fair maiden's chests with their horns
And then they lay in the grass 'til the dawn came
Sleeping away 'til the dawn came
Lay in the grass where now stands the grand hotel

The Maître D' and a fancy chef
Silver's real, the liquor's top shelf
Play some tennis, swim in a pool
Stroll the garden shady and cool
You won't care that the devils
Won't mind that the devils
Won't know that the devils are near

Somewhere below the grand hotel
There is a tunnel that leads straight to hell
But no one comes up for the souls anymore
They come for some comfort and for the dance floor
And hiding sharp horns under fedoras
Do not disturb signs instead of a chorus
They toss and turn 'til the dawn comes
On soft sheets 'til the dawn comes

Scented soaps, chauffeured cars

Regina Spektor,"The sellers of flowers buy up old roses
They pull off dead petals, like old heads of lettuce
And sell 'em as new ones, for cheaper and fairer
But they die by the morning, so who is the winner

Not the roses, not the buyers, not the sellers, maybe winter

'Cause winters coming, soon after summer
It runs faster, faster, chasing off autumn
We go from a warm sun to only a white sun
We go from a large sun to only a small one

When I was a small girl, I walked through the market
Holding my dad's hand, mitten-gloved hand
That night there were roses, lit up in glass boxes
The heat lamps would keep them from freezing in winter

We never bought them but somebody must have
Maybe they made it or maybe they froze up
Before any person had put them in water
And hoped that they'd still be alive by the morning

Who's the winner
Not the roses, not the buyers, not the sellers,
Not the tellers, of the stories,

Maybe winter, maybe winter

Somebody steps on a light through a tunnel
They're holding a piece of their mind in the rubble
Hold on, I won't let go, I want to know

But no one lives long enough to see the outcome
To know any answers, to know what the point is
To know if the winter ever came closer
Than on that night when I walked with my father

Lodged in my thoughts, lodged in my eyes
Cold all around, cold all around
Warm from inside, warm from inside

Boy, how they could love!

True as the stars above!

One night Frankie happened to pass by the hotel;
Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!

Reginald Pinckney,"Listen to my tale of woe, 
It's terribly sad but true, 
All dressed up, no place to go 
Each evening I'm awfully blue. 

I must win some handsome guy 
Can't go on like this, 
I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good 
Oh, lady, be good to me 
I am so awfully misunderstood 
So lady, be good to me 
Oh, please have some pity 
I'm all-alone in this big city 
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood, 
So lady be good to me.

Reginaldo Bessa,"Chora que a tristeza
Foge do teu olhar
Brincando de esquecer
Saudade vai passar
E amor já vai chegar

Entao canta que a beleza
Volta pra te encantar
Num sonho tao pequenho
Que o dia escondeu
Guardando pra te dar

Como é bonito gostar e querer ficar
Com alguém pra quem possa dizer
Olha quantas estrelas
Nascem pra te encontrar
Depois do céu azul
A noite vai chegar
E eu pra te amar",Llora Tu Tristeza [Chora Tua Tristeza],2006
Reginaldo Frazatto Jr.,"It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From Angels playing near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth could will two men
From Heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the Angels sing

And I hear them singing
Sing, I do hear them singing

The first Noel the Angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay, they keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep",It Came Upon a Midnight Clear,2003

Você já cansou de escutar
Centenas de casos de amor

Garçon, no bar todo o mundo é igual
Meu caso é mais um é banal
Mas preste atenção por favor

Saiba que o meu grande amor
Hoje vai se casar
Mandou uma carta pra me avisar
Deixou em pedaços meu coração

Quero tomar todas
Vou me embriagar

Me deite no chão

Mas todo bebum fica chato

Une valse musette
Je suis un peu pompette, j’arrête
Tant pis pour le bon vin

Je viens danser dans vos bras dans vos mains
Je viens me donner, enlacez-moi les reins
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique
Je suis à vous pour cet instant magique
A vous et à la musique

Entraînez-moi encore
L’accordéon me guide
Et l’espace se vide, pour nous
Pacifique corps à corps

Quand on est plus timide, surtout

Et que je danse ce soir
Au-dessous des lampions
Et que je vibre pour ton accordéon

Sur la piste déserte
Je tourne et je balance
Et j’ai le corps en transe, pourtant
Je suis à vous refaire, pour un tango pareil

Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
and put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went lookin' for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side
I said, 'Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown'
She said, 'I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around'

Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day

He said, 'Do me a favor, son, woncha stay an' keep Anna Lee company?'

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, 'I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog'

To make it all much better aside
From going all the way
To try a little harder
And make the hearts go fonder a
Little more than words can say

We just gotta make it happen

leave them just as they were.

Now it seems years
I'm back in the city
Where nothing is clear
But thoughts of me holding you,
Bringing us near

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

Time in New England
Took me away
To long rocky beaches
And you by the bay
We started a story
Whose end must now wait

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you again

I feel the change comin'
I feel the wind blow
I feel brave and daring
I feel my blood flow
With you I could bring out
All the love that I have
With you there's a heaven,
So earth ain't so bad

And tell me, when will our eyes meet?
When can I touch you?
When will this strong yearning end?
And when will I hold you

And a wonderful spring to be sprung

I'm gonna feel the way I do today

Regis Philbin,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!",The Christmas Song,2005
Regis Philbin,"Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be miles away
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years we all will be together
If the fates allow
So hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

Regis Philbin,"Oh the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've bought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm!
But if you'll really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

The fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
But as long as you love me so

Regis Philbin,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Regulo Caro,"El hombre no podía creer
Que lo manoteara la muerte
Pero le regreso el detalle
Con su ultimo suspiro de aire
Que le quedaba

También le multo cuatro balas
Que su propia vida vengara
Y así es como mueren los hombres
Mostrando el valor
Al filo de su ultima batalla

Le acortaron el camino
No había fuego de tiros
Al lomo se hecho un eme cuatro
El boquete caliente
Después de haberlo descargado

Cuando soltó una carcajada
Chispeaba la sangre en su cara
Y eso fue porque pecho a pecho
Con erre o con cuerno
En cortito los desfiguraba

Lo mandaron por un contrario
De pies a cabeza amarrado
Habrá la cajuela jefe
No soy barbarin
Pero lo hice al estilo regalo caro

Antes de irse dejo un encargo
A quien mas confianza tenia
Tu vas a cobrar mi vida
Prepara venganza
Te dejo la lista de la casería

No no voy a darles claves
Pero esto es un homenaje
Alcen cañones al aire
La despedida fue honorable
Y aquí termina el corrido

Mis padres y mis hermanos",Memorias De Un Sicario,2011
Regulo Caro,"Solo bastaron minutos
Para forcejear con la muerte

Aquí sentir lo bonito
Matar en defensa pa seguir vivo
Al primer impacto enrosque el gatillo

Si quisieron levantarme
Les falto para atorarme
Cuando la torca rodearon
Ahí se les fue complicando
La treinta y ocho soltó balazos

Y aquellos que se escaparon
Aquí les dejo un recado
Veinticinco de diciembre
Le va a llegar mas temprano

A todos ustedes
Les tengo un regalo
Uno por uno
Los iré cazando

Quemamos varios cartuchos
Yo con la super les pegue duro

Manoteábamos la puerta
Yo desde adentro
De la camioneta
Agarro la super contra metralleta

Balas rompieron cristales
Sentí mi carne quemarse

Quizás eso fue una emboscada
Que les quede de enseñanza
Lo que le dijo
El pato a una gazna

Regulo Caro,"Donde esta el peligro que lo ando buscando
Cubriendo el asfalto en mi doble rodado
Atrás enredinas varios encuernados
Si traigo un despliegue de comando armados

Se me atravesaron tres carros blindados
A mas de cien metros ya iba calculando
Cuando llegue al cruce mis plebes brincaron
Bonito los contras tentaron al diablo

Con el brazo izquierdo lance una granada
Y en cuatro segundos pedazos volaban
Son muy efectivas para una emboscada
Arrasan con todo contrarios se acaban

Mi rifle me apoya si hay que soltar balas
Recargo en dos tiempos y en corto descarga
Entra por el pecho sale por la espalda
Siete punto seis es munición que mata

La muerte es mi amiga siempre me acompaña
La traigo de escolta pues nunca me falla
Andando en las lumbres como un lanza llamas
Va abriendo el camino a fuego de metrallas

Que me traen en cola el gobierno buscando
No me ando escondiendo todo lo contrario
En cuatro segundos los hice pedazos",4 Segundos,2011
Regulo Caro,"La verdad me apena  me desespero
No puedo hablarte, con palabras de amor
No soy romántico solo hablo de avionetas,
Metralletas, perdición tuve que enfermarme

Para expresarme para cantarte esta canción
De amor pero si me besas algo presiento aquí
Por dentro detonar mi corazón tus labios tienen
La pólvora tu estilo especial cuando me abrasas

Me des-fragmento de paso activas un sentimiento
Y al instante una explosión por dentro por que
Me pones a temblar perdóname nuevamente la enfermedad
Te contagiaste del virus ántrax y los corridos también

Te encantan también te enfermas y te arremangas
Y eso me hace quererte mas y cuando me lanzas
Una mirada con el poder de convencimiento
Esas miradas son mas certeras que el r-quince que traen

Los hombres del macho prieto ráfagas de besos
Me has disparado no los detienen ni con blindados
Tus uñas son filosas mas peligrosas mas tenebrosas
Que el cuchillo que trae el ondeado tus labios

Tienen la pólvora un estilo especial cuando
Me abrasas me des-fragmento de paso activas
Un sentimiento y al instante una explosión
Por dentro por que me pones a temblar

Perdóname nuevamente la enfermedad
Te contagiaste del virus ántrax
Y los corridos también te encantan
También te enfermas y te arremangas y eso
Me hace quererte mas",Amor Enfermo,2011

Carlos le dice a su hermano
Tu dices lo que hay que hacer
Al fin venimos armados
Así el corrido comienza
De Carlitos y Alejandro

Una Cherokee del año
Blindada traía Carlitos
Salieron de madrugada
Pero había un operativo
Esa noche iba hacer larga
El santero lo predijo

Alejandro se bajo
Y se amarro la pechera
Carlos agarro valor
Se tercio la metralleta
Con un franco tirador
Empezó la balacera

Alcanzo a llevarse a dos
Antes que le respondieran
Usaban visión nocturna
Como las que usan en guerra
Los balazos a los guachos
Le rosaban la mollera

Así pasaron dos horas
Mientras llegaba el rescate
Se puso fea la cosa
Se les acababa el parque
Se atrocharon el la loma
Rodeados de militares

Quince tiros de la escuadra
Se las descargo al teniente
Los que se iban arrimando
Corrieron con la misma suerte
Pues como no si las balas
Se estrellaban en la frente

Asían el ultimo esfuerzo
Cuando el apoyo llego
Hay en pleno enfrentamiento
Los rescataba un convoy
Los guachos se sorprendieron
No esperaban esa acción

En la listas del gobierno
Ahora son los mas buscados
Mientras esquivaban balas
Tumbaron a varios soldados
Así el corrido termina
De Carlitos y Alejandro",Carlitos y Alejandro,2011
Regulo Caro,"En vivo y directo
Con corte parejo
Eran segundos de infierno
Tiempo traicionero

Porque las balas
De sus fusiles me las capeaban

Mala puntería
O tal vez un milagro
La virgencita me hizo invisible

Si la fe mueve montañas
Pero esta vez fueron balas
Las señas dejo en mi nombre soy tres en uno
Sigo con vida y no pierdo el porte

No soy de esos hombres que enseñan el cobre 
Todo camino tiene su charco 
Las ambiciones son males para el contrabando 

De aquellos polvos viene este lodo 
No pensé dos veces 
Empecé desde abajo subí a lo más alto 
Estar arriba envidia a los de abajo 

La fama viene agarrada 
De la envidia y las cizañas 
Siempre he dado cuentas claras 
No tengo miedo yo no me escondo yo doy la cara 
Porque cuentas claras amistades largas 

Lagrimas de sangre por mis compañeros 
Si me dio coraje, no miento, pero los comprendo 
Matar en ventaja sin remordimiento 
Hubiera echo lo mismo 

Vidas peligraban algo se activaba 
Extintos de defensa reacciona violencia 
Requiem pa' los afectados yo me quedo de este lado 
Estoy contando las balas por cada muerto 
Habrá un desquite dijo el pariente 
Porque le han matado a gente valiente

Sé reconocer la derrota y hoy pierdo 
Cuando eres un hombre es difícil volverte un cordero 
Quedé en desventaja llegó una parvada 
Que fachas de un hombre 

Sin dar a la brava y burlar con sus balas 
Le escupía mi sangre a la muerte en su cara 
Y no se le hizo a la doña nomas me piso la sombra 
No era el lugar ni la hora 
La fiesta eterna no se me antoja 
Contando las balas mi turno es ahora",Contando Balas,2011

¿O qué mijito? ¿Usted lo mato o qué?
Pos ya diga
Sí, yo lo maté y si vuelve a nacer
Lo vuelvo a matar al hijo de su chingada madre

Por varios años surtí funerarias
Cargué la lumbre y pesaban mis brazos
Todo el coraje descargué en mis manos
Maso y recuerdo primeras batallas
Las lecciones que se aprenden con sangre
Jamás se te olvidan

¿Qué pasó oiga que me mando a llamar?
Adelante, ¿estás listo para tu primera misión?
No viejon, ya sabe que aquí estamos listos pa' los chingasos

Y que no se te olvide la pechera, ni cargadores, 'amonos

Empuñé la escuadra y una carabina

""Vamos a llegar, te vas a bajar de la camioneta
Toca la puerta y le das un balazo
Y asegúrate que no quede vivo
Y bien segurito y que no le tiemble el dedo, eh
Y yo estaré en la a camioneta esperando con mi cuerno""
""Ya está viejon, no lo voy a dejar abajo""
""Ándale pues, y después de esto nos vamos a ir a festejar""

Corté cartuchos, balas expansivas
Once balazos con mucha energía
Le dí uno en la nuca, doblo las manitas
Su cuerpo sin fuerzas cayó de rodillas
Rematé al encargo solté una risita
Aquí me graduaba lindo me agregaba
Más gente a la lista

""Listo viejon, ya quedó""
""Eso es todo no esperaba menos de usted
Y ya sabe donde tiene mi casa
Y como llegar, para agregar mas a la lista""
""No pues gracias a usted jefe
Ya sabe que de aquí pa' delante
Los que vienen como si nada los voy a trozar""

Les doy un consejo a todos los muchachos
Respeto al trabajo si están enrolados
Si reparten lumbre que sea el contrario
A los inocentes déjenlos a un lado
Y no es que sea bueno tampoco sea malo

Y él que no la anda gozando",Diario de un Sicario,2011

Pues yo nunca eh visto que una guerra se gane sin muertos y sin derramar sangre
Mercenarios contra mercenarios no dejaban de tirar chingazos
Se les miraba el diablo en la cara a aquellos chavalos

Se chocaron de frente los carros si se disparaban salieron sobrando
Las pecheras de nada sirvieron por que los dos bandos estaban tramados
La muerte cuando llega al contrario se lo lleva aunque este empecherado
El mejor blindaje eran las balas que ellos dispararon ajustes rk

tardaras en volver,

brotan los recuerdos,
me duele en el alma,
saber que te pierdo,
mi corazón te siente

A ver dime) 

Y ahora dime que se siente 
Que te mientan lindo y de frente 
Mija no por que seas bonita 
Te van a respetar chiquita 
Por andar de cola caliente 
Te deslumbraron los billetes 
Pero a si se cobra la vida 
Cuando chingas también te chingan 

Y ahora ven a decirme 
Que se siente 
Que tu orgullo lo pisoteen 
Y ahora ven a decirme 
Que se siente 
No me digas que no te duele 
Y ahora te traen de bajada 
Te voltearon la jugada 
Hace mucho te lo deseaba

la vigilancia siempre ha burlado 
de Culiacán hasta el otro lado

(Hay va un saludo pa toda la parientada ahí te va Juaquinillo 
y arriba el sitio pariente) 

Su treinta y ocho súper del once 
lo cuida siempre de día y noche 
en el respaldo de un carro porche 
descansa un rifle mini catorce

Las hembras bellas son su delirio 
si no lo aceptan es un martirio 
ofrece boda pa salir bien 
y si él lo pide se van con el

Ya me despido me voy cantando 
de California a Badiraguato 
pongan cuidado los asesinos 
porque Ariel Caro va en el camino",Ariel Caro,2015
Regulo Caro,"Caminito de la sierra
Que bajas curveando cuestas
Me han bajado de tu tierra
A punta de metralletas
En donde estaba sembrando
La cosecha que más cuesta

El gobierno volar, puede
Nosotros pues, caminamos
Pero si bajan tantito
En el suelo lo esperamos
Ya cuando estemos parejos
Aquí sí nos la rifamos

No es que fuera malo el hombre
Ni tampoco su ayudante
Mal consejera es el hambre
Hay que tenerlo presente
Se olvidan buenas costumbres
Con gobiernos prepotentes

El mar es un buche de agua
Si te andas rifando el cuero
Por eso bajo a los ranchos
A pasearme con dinero
Con música y con mujeres
Para olvidar este infierno

Y buscando un mejor rango
Lo mismo que en los partidos
Allá se ganan gritando
Aquí se ganan con tiros
Por eso buscando plata
Me vine a sembrar con Lino

Ay les dejo este corrido
Amigos, allá en Caborca
Por mi amigo a Dios le pido
Que el aprieta, más no ahorca
Que rieguen bien esas milpas
Pa' que crezcan las mazorcas",El Ayudante De Lino,2015
Regulo Caro,"Llegaron varios carros
Y mi nombre preguntaron
Esa noche no pensaron
A qué joven se llevaron
Nunca dieron las razones
Al muchacho levantaron

Sonaron todos los radios 
Nomás cantaron los gallos
Buenos días mis chavalos 
Dijo un señor muy calmado
Si no regresan al hombre 
Yo mismo salgo a buscarlos

Atado de manos con los ojos bien vendados
No se miraron los rostros 
Los capuchos ocultaron
Oyeron mas no escucharon, 
Esta vez se equivocaron

Les dijo el amigo 
Yo no debo ni he robado 
Y tengo testigos 
En mi lista de contactos
Yo no tengo las respuestas
Para su confesionario

Escuchen amigos 
Aclaremos este enredo
Porque lo que yo miro 
La envidia me trae del cuello
Y entre tanto operativo 
Recordaron que es el miedo

A la puerta de su casa
Llegaron los mismos carros
Somos de la misma plaza 
Los sujetos preguntaron
Ocho con tiro de gracia 
Creo que no los disculparon",El Confesionario,2015
Regulo Caro,"De lejos tierras yo he venido caminando 
Porque te tengo un cariño verdadero 
Pero chatita tú sabes cuánto te quiero 
Te quiero mucho y te doy todo mi amor

Tengo esperanza de un día ser amado
Pero chatita me siento desdichado

Si no me quieres ten compasión
Mira que el hombre que te idolatra

Se encuentra herido dell corazón

¿Por qué te ocultas cuando te miro?
¿Por qué te ocultas mi vida así?
¿Cuál es el crimen que he cometido?
Haberte amado nomas a ti

Soñé que un angel su amor me daba
Y que yo en cambio mi amor le dí
Ella juraba que me adoraba
Yo con el alma se lo creí

Bajo la somba de aquella noche
Mis desengaños voy a ocultar
Para que nadie sepa que te amo
Cuando de amores me oigan cantar

Toda mi vida yo he sido franco
Y siempre he hablado con la verdad
Y desde luego ya ni hay motivo
Para que pierdamos la amistad

Yo enamoraba a una dama
Ella me niega su amor

Paciencia pídele al cielo

Paciencia le pido al cielo

Una naranja madura
Y entre los gajos halle
Lo dulce de su hermosura

Regulo Caro,"Iba montado en su cuaco
Lo acompañaba su perro
Se empinaba la botella

Recordaba que en su encierro
Le informaron que en su casa
Casi a diario había un entierro

No más pensaba y pensaba
No se explicaba el asunto
Otro trago se aventaba
Regresaba al mismo punto
Como es que había tanto entierro
Si no había ningún difunto

Su mujer estaba abajo

Con el cuchillo en la mano
Sintió que le hervía la sangre
Le corto los dos al bato
Al perro le quito el hambre
Y le dijo a su mujer
Es todo tuyo el compadre

Maldiciendo a su mujer

Dónde están esos amigos 
Ahorita que no hay fortuna

Regulo Caro,"En un ranchito en la sierra 
Feliz vivía Manuel Juárez 
Arrendando sus caballos 
Cuidando sus propiedades 
Trabajando bien sus tierras 
Poco salía a las ciudades

Bonita estaba su chata 
Estaban recién casados 
Vivían en casa de adobe 
Pero bien enamorados 

La feria del cuarto viernes señores 
Se celebraba en el pueblo 
Cerca de semana santa 
Pero andaba suelto el diablo

Manuel ensilla una yegua 
También su potro más fino 
Con su sonrisa y su chata 
Con rumbo al pueblo se vino 
Caramba que mala pata 
Que jugada del destino

Un tipo grita en la calle 
Ay que re' chulas caderas 
No se refería a la yegua 
Y esas si son chingaderas 

Manuel le dio vuelta al potro 
El otro sacó pistola 
Juárez herido de un brazo 
El otro muerto hecho bola 
En las patas del caballo 
Que Manuel Juárez adora

Testigos hubo del caso 
Y aunque a Manuel apresaron 
Luego de averiguaciones 
En libertad lo dejaron 
Mientras que calladamente 
Al hocicón sepultaron

Y en un ranchito en la sierra 
Allá vive Manuel Juárez 
Con sus hijos y su chata 
Tiene pocas amistades 
Trabaja cuacos y tierras 
Ya no baja a las ciudades

Ya con esta me despido señores 
Y les recuerdo una cosa 
Que aunque sea humilde el ranchero 
Hay que respetar su esposa",Manuel Juarez,2018

No le causo mal a nadie 
Mas sé que algunos dolidos 
Quisieran aniquilarme 

Pero no encuentran motivos 
Y eso es lo que más les arde

Todo lo que sube termina cayendo 
Las balas te llueven si no estás despierto

De hacer un mal trato, quedaron recuerdos 
Hoy son mil balas que comen mi cuerpo 
Fuego contra fuego, aquí nadie es eterno 

Si quieren mis cueros, mi rifle trae huevos 
Saludo a la muerte, vénganos tu reino 

De oquis tanto ruido si son balas mansas 
Si el miedo las carga, no hiere ni matan 
Llegaban sus carros en sus caravanas 
Yo acomodé el cuerno a mi propia ventaja 

Entre la puerta y el vidrio me escudaba 
Chispas relumbraban sobre la blindada 
Y la muerte arriaba todas mis descargas 
Se me acabó el parque, seguí con la escuadra 

En el último intento me comían sus balas 
Como esta señora, deme su estocada 

Y regresamos con corridos progresivos

No hay muerte sin vida ni ley sin justicia 
Pero una venganza sabe mejor fría 
La suerte del vivo, el muerto la envidia 
El gusto que me queda, escuchen la ironía 

Mi suerte en mil balas, pa' mí ya es la misma 
Les hierven las tripas que les hice jiras 
Haberme llevado un hombre entre sus filas 
Al hijo del socio, quién lo pensaría 

Nomás por unas libras que me debían 
Les salió muy caro quitarme la vida 

Tiempos de violencia, cualquiera es maldito 
Cualquiera se tercia un cuernito de disco 
Pecheras granadas, se repite el ruido

I'm so excited that I tingle inside
She picks me up in that long white car
We go a-camping and we count all the stars

She drives a cammy and it's wired for sound
It purrs so sweetly when she puts her foot down
Out to the country where the air if fresh
Just to be with her is just what I like best

I see her pale skin shine in the sun
She's got her 15+ sunblocker on
I can tell you that our love will be strong
After the boys of noise have gone

We're always planning about running away
So we can be together every day
When she's not here I don't know how I survive
I hurt myself 'cause I forget I'm alive

We run and hide from all the other boys
And sit in parks with educational toys
We sit and sip hot water and milk
And talk about how all the blood got spilt

We like to lie in bed and watch TV
And gasp in awe at miffy's simplicity
And when the rest is all said and done
I feel so good 'cause she's my geek love

Come gather round the court
Come sweat and scream for your favorite team
As you cheer and down a beer
You think they're looking like they could be back in form this year;
They're sporting all the name gear

They got the shoulder-smacking corporate-backing
Lights ablaring things are happening
You see the media sacarin glistening on their tongues
They'll be climbing up the rungs to the top of the industry echelons

Keep it going on 'cause they didn't just come to play they came to win
Pros like them know losing is a sin
And when it comes down to handling their balls
These boys'll give it their all from hand to eye
Down the line super fine control
Backhand forehand underhand power plays
They'll be leaving all the opposition in a stunned daze

Fast man
They leave the rest behind
You find they always have the last laugh
As the crowd roar

Music is sport
Music is sport

The fests are the test they're like the musical Olympics
Or like grand final meets without the seats
It's band vs. band in an action packed day of non stop play off
Where's the fucking pay off?

One gets the mic
One makes the pass
One executes the play
Time for a Mexican wave

Crowd goes wild for racket skills
I teach lessons in regression but it sure don't pay the bills
What the hell we hitting for?
Record companies keeping score

Trying to get those shiny plaqued trophies for the office wall
Pumping out the hits to feed the media blitz
Now watch the swollen champs blow the champers on bikini clad tits
Busted through a banner backstage

High five and then we pray to god
Before we play to the throbbing mob
So if you're ever on the sideline or sweating on the court
Just remember my friends

Broke the old mold smashed the last cast
If you ask me don't believe the hype of the past
'cause political ties are never built to last
Seems like a motherfucker want a capitalize
Parasites on the rise with greed in their eyes
I criticise only when you fuckers despise
Lives take a dive when your dirty profits are high
Good grief could we see some debt relief
Or can you stand to watch another fucker spending belief
Fuck sake all you do is take n take n take
Maybe it's time to cut a break

I mean shit.. they told me I was worth it.. legit that's all I need
I'm free to rot my teeth with coca co I utilise
The phenylalanic flow to tap the toe and rock it
Live I survive by the means I deploy
Laugh in the face of the void.. prozac.. enjoy

We're big macking keep the fries on the side
'cause I'm like n.i.k.e get the fat free
One hell of a pimp almost get it for free
Wrappin job skills up with the childcare too
If you're poor and underage we'll come and see you
'cause I'm logo largin crash card chargin
A hard entourage for the cultural barge
Mmm.. yeah that's the sound
Roll the red rugs out 'cause we're coming round
You can listen to the mithanthric shit I be given
But I can't be guaranteein take it or leave it
Call me a hyppocrit for this I know I can't be forgiven
By product of the ego.. nomic life I be livin
I'd be fucking with you if I said I knew what to do
But before you get to swallow just remember to chew
And if it tastes like shit then spit it out.. out out out
Murdoctered that's beyond a doubt
'cause none of what you hear and even less what you're seein
Comes even close to any version of the truth worth believing
It's just a bland scam stamped with the master brand
Lambs to the slaughter
Only 'cause you do what you oughta
But if your plan is to take what you can
Watch where you stand
Hand bights the clan - fear fights on demand
And if you understand evil could be good mistook
You gotta get the fuck up and take a look...

Hangin' up on strippers, working on my 3rd bottle of liquor
You smellin' like cat litter, still bitter
Walk around the earth stressed
I've been buggin' since I fell out of my mothers dress
I guess, I'll have another panic attack
It's always darkest right before it's pitch black

World full of crazy people and I guess I'm one in the same
And I tell you man it's evil, but I don't know no other game
How did I get so dirty, you can see it on my face
But I ain't killed nobody today, just yet
So ya'll better give me some praise

Knockin out a wall and I don't got a gun
So I'm shootin' birds at ya'll

Lookin' out the window and the world calls me a chump
Smokin' a cig at the gas pump
Hey you wanta' bump
Excuse me sir, can you spare a buck of two
Fuck you mother fucker, I need liquor too
The worlds a cess pool and I'm a piece of shit
Stomach hangin' out my mouth when I'm blowin grits

It's that I'm so comfortable, uncomfortable and sad
Everybody else seems to get mad, yeah, yeah

Objects in the mirror are closer than they appear
I look half dead from here and I need bread for beer
They're probably discovering my empty bed about now

Like Othello hidin' out from Poncharello
Dead off in the Median
Fallin' apart like usual handin' out flyers to my funeral

Rehab,"I am the everything, the all-knowing, the omnipotent one
I watch the fields, I do not feel, I circumnavigate everyone
I am the scarecrow, alone and disconnected
You stare right past me undetected
I am only here when you expect it
Nowhere man, I live invisible and feel a sadness undescribable
I hang here motionless holding a bible, no revival
I died and became apathy, then married vacancy
Then moved my children to the tundra of complacency
I do not exist in your world
I've burned the bridges, I have cut the life line
Now all I have left is my mind
Which judges all of you, analyzes all your dumb philosophies
In wonderment of how you all have ruined your ecology
Yet you do not hear for I am to you only but nothingness
And I can't understand why I'm the only one that feels like this
It's all piss, I flee, out of all the people that have left me
The one I miss most is me

I am the scarecrow
And I am so alone

And I've seen thirty years of down time
The face of a clown, a stick for a spine
From a grandiose small town mind and crows fly all around mine
They shit on my shoulder, I got no voice, no mobility
I get older, heated but colder
No yield in my field, fuck my opinion
I stare at your houses in the distance
Silent persistence, at night your windows glisten
I got nothing to say cause no one would listen anyway
So I remain against the grain, I've seen sunny days with rain
Busted knuckles in pain and never complained
Dirt is my domain, my view is plain
But I'm invisible, sounds mystical
Not really, the days are dry, the evening chilly
The only person that understands is little Billy when he's lonely
Let me feel something, make me worth a damn
Make me new again, make me a fuckin' man
I've seen the rise and fall, the come and go
The high and low, and if you knew what I know
Sometimes one does not reap what he sews
The wind blows, the moon glows, the water flows
The rain turns to snow and the ground is froze
And only God knows why that's the way it goes

And I am so alone

Heart still wearing a stain I'm to blame
Little bitty guilty's crawling all over my soul
I can't believe this shit
Said I caused the things she did
Bear down hard when you fill it in
Give me the pain I'll grit my teeth in

Now he was just your average everyday traffic jam competitor
With half a gram, walkin' in the club tryin' to set it off
She had two silicon weapons of mass distraction
Nipples like screw-in cleats, damn near blastin'
Through her skin tight blouse, she lookin' for some action
Said her hubby was out of town and started askin'
If he'd like to go to her house.
I think that's when he realized he couldn't do it
Looked at her finger, a diamond from her ring
Hit his eye, he couldn't linger
He started feelin' guilty for everything they were up to
He took a deep breath said, ""you know what, I'd love to
But evidently there is already someone who loves you""
She looked at him like he insulted her and said, ""fuck you
Look at your pupils, I know what that stuff do
Mr. Goody Twoshoes, Call me out, I'll call you out too.""

Together in their deceitful ways embracing the lust
They got carried away like a dog chasin' a bus
They were back at her house in another man's bed
And gettin 'freaky deaky' while the husband sped home
To see his wife cause his job had got done early
Meanwhile they're wreckin' the room
And talkin' all dirty, and sweaty
The hubby stopped and got some flowers so pretty
And a bottle of wine to spend some time with his sweetie
Gets home, sees a car in the yard and he's thinkin' hmmm?
Walks up the driveway opens the door and goes numb
Just about the time he's gonna yell ""honey I'm home""
A trail of clothes down the hall leading to passionate moans
Changed his tone, tip-toed to the gun cabinet
Grabbed a gun his daddy gave him that he used in Vietnam
Walk down the hall kicked in the door said ""surprise""
Sat down on the bed with guns and roses and wine

Just walk away, just walk away
There's too much wrong for you to stay
Just walk away, Just walk away
Gonna get yourself in trouble, walk away

Hubby said ""how you two love birds doing? You havin' fun?
Don't cover up your nakedness now, What's done's done""
He made his wife call her parents
Made the dude call his wife and daughter
And told them to come over, ""let's talk about life""
And then hubby called the preacher 'cause you want God involved
When the victim of infidelity has got a revolver
and the guests straggled into the room one at a time
Realizing what was happening and then wishing they were blind
He told the preacher who had married them back in the day
That he was right 'the lord works in mysterious ways'
Then he addressed the room waving the gun carefree
Saying ""ladies and gentlemen you've been called here to see
Two naked embarrassed humans in a bed that I bought
They were havin' great sex about the time they got caught""
Then he laid the gun down on the bed so relaxed
And said ""I'm leaving' feel free to shoot me in the back""

That you couldn't get a beer there

I'm a junkie for your lovin' your adrift in my veins
You travel through all of my spaces and you swallow my brain
Dance on my skin - sleep in my head
I float my guitar then I swim in your bed
Such a lovely vision when I left my eyes looking at you

I know you now me. I know you like the taste of my tongue
Like dancing branches we mingled in the yesterday sun
Deep water eyes spin me around
Stuck in your gaze such a sweet place to drown

Such a lovely vision",Love Junkie,2003
Reid Lee,"Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love and not feel your rain.

[Chorus]
Set me free, leave me be. I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while and all my fragile strength is gone.

[Chorus]

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that you're everything I think I need here on the ground.
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down.",Gravity,2009

Reign,"I had some problems and no one could seem to solve them.
But you found the answer.
You told me to take this chance and learn the ways of love,
My baby, and all that it has to offer.
In time you will see that love won't let you down.

You said that you loved me; said hurt only came to pass me.
It sounded so convincing that I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby.
There is so much love inside me,
And all that I have I'll give my all to you;
All, all my love, baby and:

All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.
All this love is waiting for you, my baby, my sugar;
And all this love is waiting for you.

As the sun has its place up in the sky,
I love you so dearly,
And all the same there's no need to wonder why.
I need you, please hear me.
Say you really love me baby,
Say you really love me, darlin';

Oh, I really love you, darlin.

Reign of Kindo,"Snow in the air, as it rides the winter breeze
Crystals of ice are hanging from the trees
The morning of Christmas has arrived in its due time
The children are waiting, their joy becomes mine

We march down the stairs and into the other room
The lights shining bright on the tree for all to view
The window is shattered and the presents are all gone
And the cries of my children wrote this song

I swear, when I get my hands on him
He'll never breathe again.
I won't stop tearing him limb from limb
He'll never breathe again.

I get in my car to chase the only set of tracks
A gun in my hand and a bag in the back
Deep in the slums, I saw him with their toys

My gunshot rang out,
But the snow absorbed the noise.
I bagged up his body and I threw it in the car
With all the toys that he'd carried oh so far

Now that I've got my hands on him,
I can breathe again
Finally, I've rid the world of him and
I can breathe again

Back at the house all my children were so sad
But when their presents return, then not but joy,
They'll surely have
I drove to the river and I threw the body in
No one else will be paying for his sin

Something screaming inside me
Says that I can breathe again
Judge me all that your hearts desire,
But I can breathe again.",Breathe Again,2008
Reign of Kindo,"The moments in between the words I hear you speak
Are desolate and clean and leave me feeling weak
I just want to see the beautiful world in my dreams
But all I see is me in the center of all I seek

Now I feel like a ghost in a world that is fading
All I've been taught to recall simply fails to persuade me
The truth tends to sting while it heals
And the only way back is screaming the words

Oh my God what have I become?
I feel this fire burn
Burn till I'm undone and never to return

I remember when the wind brought heaven's scent
And the stars that filled the sky
Drew a line between you and I

Oh my God what have I become?
I feel this fire burn
Burn till I'm undone and never to return

Lift up your voice loud
I declare myself this hour
Simply dust that's entrusted with such a peculiar power

Oh my God what have I become?
I feel this fire burn
Burn 'till I'm undone, never to return

There's nothing like living, asleep in some hazy dream

Reign of Kindo,"There comes a time
When you make up your mind
Of where to lay your lonely roots down
And I've been travelin' so far and wide
Seen the deepest depths and heights beyond high
So I'm surprised to see you with my eyes
With my mind's best dreams and left your face so incomplete

It's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
It's nice to meet you
Nice to meet you
Nice to meet you

I know the day that I chased you away
When the words I spoke, were terribly wrong
And I confess that I made quite the mess
But it's just too late, and now you've moved on

Take me back to the days of the sun
Brightly shining down on the two of us
You used to lie I staring into the sky
Leaving every toil, and worry so far behind us

No tienes cuartada no tienes palabra no tienes corazon

He sobre pasado el umbral del dolor
Tu ausencia es el invierno mas largo que he vivido

Levemente cada vez que el viento sopla te respiro
Bajo el manto de la noche diariamente te alucino
Extraño tu fragancia marchita
Desde entonces el tiempo la seco no no no
Mi corazon no es una flor irradia dolor

Por que todo me falta
No me alcanzan las ganas de vivir
Aunque todo lo intento yo no entiendo
Por que no estas aqui

Tu lo eres para mi
Te necesito por que sin ti no sé vivir

De que me sirve ver un nuevo dia
Si no hay alegria
Solo quedan ganas de huir
De que me sirve el reflejo de la luna

La vida decidió que es
El momento de partir
El tren de mi destino
Seguiré

Déjame ir
No tengas miedo
Yo también sufro
Cada que respiro
Al igual que tu
Déjame ir
Aunque me muero
Debo seguir en esta travesía
Y encontrar mi luz
Déjame ir

Déjame ir
No tengas miedo
Yo también sufro
Cada que respiro
Al igual que tu
Déjame ir
Aunque me muero
Debo seguir en esta travesía
Y encontrar mi luz
Déjame ir

Déjame ir",Déjame Ir,2011
Reik,"Un millón de emociones
Solo dos corazones
Y una vida que compartir
Fueron cinco segundos
Y cambiaste mi mundo
Faltan miles de historias para escribir
Contigo

Ven ven ven
Contigo quiero enloquecer
No tengas miedo, besame
Atrévete, no lo pienses
Ven, ven, ven
Contigo quiero despertar
No tengas miedo de intentar
No te detengas y déjate llevar

Cien por ciento seguro
Que encontré mi futuro
Cuantas veces lo quiere oír
Fueron cinco segundos
Y cambiaron mi rumbo
Si tu quieres pasamos juntos una
Eternidad

Ven ven ven,
Contigo quiero enloquecer
No tengas miedo, besame
Atrévete, no lo pienses
Ven, ven, ven
Contigo quiero despertar
No tengas miedo de intentar
No te detengas y déjate llevar mi amor

Regalame tu corazón
Quisiera detener el tiempo
Y no decirte adiós
Ven

Contigo quiero enloquecer
No tengas miedo, besame
Atrévete, no lo pienses
Ven, ven, ven
Contigo quiero despertar
No tengas miedo de intentar
No te detengas y déjate llevar

Ven, ven a mi
Déjate llevar",Déjate Llevar,2011
Reik,"Lejos de ti me perdí
La realidad yo jamás la vi
Todo me da igual
Igual a nada

Mi corazón se agito
Primera vez que me paso
Pero después nada fue igual
Igual a nada

Como la brisa
Que no soplaba
Igual a nada
Como la lluvia
Que no mojaba
Igual a nada
Pero no volverá, no volverá
Es una historia terminada

Si no eras tú para mí
Si yo no fui nada para ti
Perdóname no entendí
No entendí nada

Uh oh!
Como si nada

Como la brisa
Que no soplaba
Igual a nada
Como la lluvia
Que no mojaba
Igual a nada

Uh oh!
Igual a nada
Uh oh!
Igual a nada",Igual a Nada,2011
Reik,"Ya no tiene caso, deja de intentar
Dices que has cambiado y quieres regresar a mi
Tienes la visión distorsionada
Y tu intuición está desorientada
Me arrancaste el corazón y el daño es

Irreversible
No creo más en ti
Eres invisible
Te desaparecí
Y todos tus besos se hicieron pedazos
Eres historia, te borre de mis brazos
¿No te das cuenta? Yo ya lo decidí
Es irreversible

Oh oh oh
Irreversible
Oh oh oh

Quédate con cada instante que te di
Me fallaste y yo gane más de lo que perdí
Ya no hay rastro del amor
¿Qué esperas?
Mi puerta se cerró contigo afuera
Hace mil y una noches te olvide

Irreversible
No creo más en ti
Eres invisible
Te desaparecí
Y todos tus besos se hicieron pedazos
Eres historia, te borre de mis brazos
¿No te das cuenta? Yo ya lo decidí

Ya no queda más
Nada más que hablar

No creo más en ti

Reik,"Mis besos ya no quieren esperar
En esta noche fría enciéndeme el aire
Y solo tu podrías domar
Mi corazón ingobernable

Acércate no hay forma de frenar
De parar ya mis sueños inevitables
A media voz me puedes curar
Este silencio insoportable

Tuve miedo de mi
Quise escapar de ti
Quise apagar con gasolina el fuego

Vas desafiando con tus alas a la gravedad
Con tu fuerza infinita con esa forma de besarme
Que mi boca necesitas
Que me pierdo entre tus ojos
Y me vuelve a encontrar que mi alma
Me lo evita eres mi tormenta favorita

Na na na
Na na na na

A donde quieras ir te seguiré
Serás mi luna en los caminos oscuros
Me creo en ti y me soltare
De mi pasado y mi futuro

Tuve miedo de mi
Quise escapar de ti
Quise apagar con gasolina el fuego

Vas desafiando con tus alas a la gravedad
Con tu fuerza infinita con esa forma de besarme
Que mi boca necesitas
Que me pierdo entre tus ojos
Y me vuelve a encontrar que mi alma
Me lo evita eres mi tormenta favorita

A la orilla de la noche somos fugitivos de la soledad
Que en la oscuridad se encuentran

Vas desafiando con tus alas a la gravedad
Con tu fuerza infinita con esa forma de besarme
Que mi boca necesitas
Que me pierdo entre tus ojos
Y me vuelve a encontrar que mi alma
Me lo evita eres mi tormenta favorita

Na na na
Na na na na
Hazme despegar

Na na na

Hazme despegar",Mi Tormenta Favorita,2011
Reik,"Me canse de ir a ningún lugar
De bajar la voz y de caminar
Lejos del amor y tan cerca del veneno

Me canso tu luz tan artificial
Y esta conexión tan superficial
No me importa quien es el malo y quien el bueno

Te dejo solo queda por decir
Que estoy cansado de fingir
Y que lo intente eternamente

Nada puedo regozarme a tu mirada fue mucho dolor
Perdiste tu valor fuiste convirtiéndote en
Nada una historia rota sin contar que quisiera borrar
Perdiste tu lugar ya no digas nada

Me canse de huir de la realidad
De busca en ti mi felicidad
Nuestro sueños van sobre líneas paralelas

Una estrella que no brillaba mas
Y se acostumbro ala obscuridad
No la encenderás ni con un millón de velas

Te dejo y solo queda por decir que estoy cansado de fingir
Y que lo intente eternamente

Nada puedo regozarme a tu mirada fue mucho dolor
Perdiste tu valor fuiste convirtiéndote en
Nada una historia rota sin contar que quisiera borrar
Perdiste tu lugar ya no digas nada

Nada una historia rota sin contar que quisiera borrar
Perdiste tu lugar ya no digas nada
Nada que pensar ya no digas nada mas",Nada,2011
Reik,"Desde que te vi siento que se mueve el sueño
Me emocionas tanto que me ponen mal
Tengo miedo que mi corazón se detenga
Y sin darme cuenta me enamore de ti

Y una vez fue todo lo que necesite
Tocar tu piel me eleva me enloquece

Ya no quiero mas que abrasarte
Besarte hasta perder la razón
Tomarte de la mano y darte mi corazón
Y no se si serás lo que había soñado
Pero no lo puedo evitar
Un momento no puedo dejarte de pensar
Ya no te quiero olvidar

No mires atrás te pido no me tengas miedo
Solo quiero amarte déjate llevar

Y una vez fue todo lo que necesite
Tocar tu piel me eleva me enloquece

Ya no quiero mas que abrasarte
Besarte hasta perder la razón
Tomarte de la mano y darte mi corazón
Y no se si serás lo que había soñado
Pero no lo puedo evitar
Un momento no puedo dejarte de pensar
Ya no te quiero olvidar

Mi cabeza me dice no te pierdas dentro de la noción
Ten cuidado no escuches tan pronto al corazón

Ya no quiero mas que abrasarte
Besarte hasta perder la razón
Tomarte de la mano y darte mi corazón
Y no se si serás lo que había soñado
Pero no lo puedo evitar

Ya no te quiero olvidar
Ya no te quiero olvidar",No Te Quiero Olvidar,2011
Reik,"No logre tomar
Distancia critica
Me vuelvo a equivocar
La historia típica
Y en un irracional
Impulso eléctrico
Mi corazón corre en tu dirección

Me hace tanto mal
Tu humor errático
Te sigo sin pensar
En automático
Si doy un paso mas
Ya no lograre volver
No se como retroceder

Una y otra vez
Tengo que luchar conmigo

Vivo en peligro
Y otra vez corro por la linea de fuego

Me besas y caigo en tu juego
Peligro de caer
En tu voz estoy perdido
No escucho
A mi sexto sentido

Usas contra mi
Tu voz hipnótica
De nuevo voy a ti
No tiene lógica
No se como cruzar
Un laberinto que yo construí
Quiero salir de aquí
Una y otra vez vuelvo a tropezar contigo

Vivo en peligro
Y otra vez corro por la linea de fuego
Me besas y caigo en tu juego
Peligro de caer
En tu voz estoy perdido
No escucho
A mi sexto sentido",Peligro,2011
Reik,"Si te alejas de mi lado
Será mi culpa lo se
El a verte lastimado
Me da pena y destroza mi ser

Esta tarde gris si te quieres ir yo entenderé
Pero antes de partir dame algo de ti
Por que no se si te vas

Que voy a ser con mi vida
Puede ser que se me parta el corazón
Al saber que no regresaras
Si te vas, que hará mi alma vacía
Si te llevas lo que resta de tu amor
Solo me quedare en el dolor

Ya no puede remediarlo
Fue tan grande mi error
Y no me hacen en reversa
Las agujas de un viejo reloj

Esta tarde gris si te quieres ir yo entenderé
Pero antes de partir dame algo de ti
Por que no se si te vas

Que voy a ser con mi vida
Puede ser que se me parta el corazón
Al saber que no regresaras
Si te vas, que hará mi alma vacía
Si te llevas lo que resta de tu amor
Solo me quedare en el dolor

Tengo el mal presentimiento
Que si te vas de mi la luna llorara
Se va acabar mi mundo si te vas

Que voy a ser con mi vida
Puede ser que se me parta el corazón
Al saber que no regresaras
Si te vas, que hará mi alma vacía
Si te llevas lo que resta de tu amor
Solo me quedare en el dolor",Si Te Vas,2011
