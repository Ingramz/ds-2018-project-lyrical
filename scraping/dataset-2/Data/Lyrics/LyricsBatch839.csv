Pete Seeger,"This old man, he played one,
He cut back in Washington,
With a knick Knack paddy whack,
Give the dog a bone,
This old man should go back home.

This old man, he played two,
He is doing it to me and you

This old man, he played three,
No more kids' school lunches free

This old man, he played four,
Now we're in El Salvador

This old man, he played five,
ERA did not survive

This old man, he played six,
He was better in the flicks

This old man, he played seven,
Now big business is in heaven

This old man, he played eight,
He helped Nancy decorate

This old man, he played nine,
B-1 bombers all in line

This old man, he played ten,
Let's go back and vote again",This Old Man,1992
Pete Seeger,"[Chorus]
One blue sky above us
One ocean lapping all our shore
One earth so green and round
Who could ask for more
And because I love you
I'll give it one more try
To show my rainbow race
It's too soon to die.

Some folks want to be like an ostrich,
Bury their heads in the sand.
Some hope that plastic dreams
Can unclench all those greedy hands.
Some hope to take the easy way:
Poisons, bombs. They think we need 'em.
Don't you know you can't kill all the unbelievers?
There's no shortcut to freedom.

[Chorus]

Go tell, go tell all the little children.
Tell all the mothers and fathers too.
Now's our last chance to learn to share
What's been given to me and you.

[Chorus]",My Rainbow Race,1992

Gone again, skip to my Lou

Jimmy sent a letter to his bride back home
For three long years now he's been gone
He left her cryin' on her wedding day
And went to fight the battle of the Blue and Gray

Oh Mary don't you weep for me
Oh Mary just you wait for me

Pete Seeger,"I went down to the railroad yard, watch that train come by,
Knew the train would roll that day, but I did not know what time.

I did not know what time, boys, did not know what time.
Knew the train would roll that day but I did not know what time.

Good morning Mister Railroad Man, what time does your train roll by?
Nine-sixteen and two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five.

At nine-sixteen, two-forty-four, twenty-five minutes 'til five.
Thank you Mister Railroad Man, I wanna watch your train roll by.

Standing on the platform, smoking a big cigar,
Waitin' for some old freight train that carries an empty car.

I rode her down to Danville Town, got stuck on a Danville girl,
Bet your life she was a pearl, she wore that Danville curl.

She wore her hat on the back of her head like high-tone people all do,
Very next train come down that track, I bid that girl adieu.

I bid that girl adieu, poor boys, I bid that girl adieu,
The very next train come down that track, I bid that girl adieu.",Danville Girl,1993
Pete Seeger,"As I went out one morning early,
To breathe the sweet and pleasant air,
Who should I spy but a fair young maiden
She seemed to me like a lily fair.
I stepped to her add kindly asked her,
""Would you like to be a bold sailor's wife?""

""Oh no kind sir,"" she quickly answered,
""I choose to lead a sweet single life.""
""What makes you different from other women?
What makes you different from other kind?
For you are young, sweet, beautiful and handsome,
And for to marry you, I might incline.""

""It's now kind sir that I must tell you.
I might have been married three years ago
To one John Riley who left this country.
He's been the cause of my overthrow.""

""He courted me both late and early.
He courted me both night and day.
And when he had once my affections gained,
He left me here and he went away.""
""Oh never mind for this Johnny Riley,
Oh come with me to the distant shore.
Why, we'll sail o'er to Pennsylvany,
And bid adieu to Riley forever more.""

""I shan't go with you to Pennsylvany,
Or go with you to the distant shore.
My heart is with Riley, my long lost lover
Although I'll never see him no more.""
Oh, when he saw that her love was loyal,
He gave her kisses one, two, and three,
Saying, ""I'm the man you once called Johnny Riley,
Saying ""I'm the cause of your misery.""

""I've sailed the ocean, gained great promotion,
I've laid my money on the English shore,
And now we'll marry, no longer tarry,
And I shall never deceive you any more.""",John Riley,1993

Pete Seeger,"Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo

Once upon a time there was a little boy who
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'
Grown-ups said ""Get that thing out of here!""

Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make
Things disappear. But the father played too
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass
Disappears, He'd come to someone about
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'
No chair.

People said to the father, ""You get out
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and
Your son!"" The boy and his father were
Ostracized. That means they made them
Live on the edge of town.

Now in this town they used to tell stories.
The old people used to tell stories about
The giants that lived in the old days They
Used to tell a story about a giant called
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a
House and could eat, people, up.
Of course, nobody believed it, but they
Told the story anyway.

One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red
Over the hill. And the first people got up
And looked out of their window, they saw a
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And
They could feel the whole ground shake.
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'
Strong men fainted ""Ohh!"" - ""Run for
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!""

He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'
Daniel, ""Grab your most precious
Possessions and run! Run!"" Just then the
Boy and his father woke up ""Hey, Paw,
What's coming over the field?"" - Oh, Son,
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him
To lie down, I could make him disappear.""

The boy said ""Come with me, Father."" He
Grabs his father by one hand. The father
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the
Ukelele. They run across the field. People
Yelled, ""Don't go near him! He'll eat you
Alive!"" There was Abiyoyo. He had long
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.

Well, you know the giant had never heard a song
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to
Dance ""Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" the boy
Went faster, ""Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo,"" The giant
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.

They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,
""Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,
We don t care anymore!"" And they all sang:

Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo
(Oh, you sing it with me,)",Abiyoyo,1994
Pete Seeger,"The words mean, I am a truthful man
From the land of the palm trees
And before dying, I want to share the poems of my soul 
My poems are soft green, 
My poems are also flaming crimson
My poems are like a wounded fawn 
Seeking refuge in the forest

I want to share my fate

Pleases me more than the sea",Guantanamera,1994

I'd ring it in the evening, all over this land

It's a song about love between my brothers and my sisters all over this land",If I Had a Hammer,1994

I was walking along
I heard that special
Singing a lonesome song

Pete Seeger,"When something in my history is found
Which contradicts the views that I propound
Or shows that I perhaps am not the guy I claim to be
Here's what I usually do

[Chorus]
I lie
I simply boldly falsify
I look the other feller in the eye
And just deny, deny, deny
I lie

I don t apologize. Not me. Instead
I say I never said the things I said
Nor did the things some people saw me do
When confronted by some things they know are true

[Chorus]

I hate those weasel words some slickies use
To blur their past or muddy up their views
Not me. I'm blunt. One thing that makes me great
Is that I'll never dodge nor obfuscate

From [the] California to the [Staten] New York Island,
From the Redwood Forest, to the Gulf stream waters,
[God blessed America for me.]
As I went walking that ribbon of highway
And saw above me that endless skyway,
And saw below me the golden valley, I said:
[God blessed America for me.]

I roamed and rambled and followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts,
And all around me , a voice was sounding:
[God blessed America for me.]

Was a high wall there that tried to stop me
A sign was painted said: Private Property,
But on the back side it didn't say nothing
[God blessed America for me.]

When the sun come shining, then I was strolling
In wheat fields waving and dust clouds rolling;
The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:
[God blessed America for me.]

One bright sunny morning in the shadow of the steeple
By the Relief Office I saw my people
As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if

Pete Seeger,"Did you ever hear the story of Aimee McPherson?
Aimee McPherson, that wonderful person,
She weight a hundred eighty and her hair was red
And preached a wicked sermon, so the papers said.

[Chorus]
Hi dee hi dee hi dee hi
Ho dee ho dee ho dee ho.

Aimee built herself a radio station
To broadcast her preaching to the nation.
She found a man named Armistead who knew enough
To run the radio while Aimee did her stuff.

She held a camp meeting out at Ocean Park
Preached from early morning 'til after dark.
Said the benediction, folded up her tent,
And nobody knew where Aimee went.

When Aimee McPherson got back from this journey,
She told her tale to the district attorney.
Said she'd been kidnapped on a lonely trail.
In spite of all the questions, she stuck to her tale.

Well, the Grand Jury started an investigation,
Uncovered a lot of spicy information.
Found out about a love nest down at Carmel-by-the-Sea,
Where the liquor was expensive and the loving was free.

They found a cottage with a breakfast nook,
A folding bed with a worn-out look.
The slats were busted and the springs were loose,
And the dents in the mattress fitted Aimee's caboose.

Well they took poor Aimee and they threw her in jail.
Last I heard she was out on bail.
They'll send her up for a stretch, I guess,
She worked herself up into an awful mess

Now Radio Ray is a going hound;
He's going yet and he ain't been found.
They got his description, but they got it too late.
Sin they got it, he's lost a lot of weight.

Now I'll end my story in the usual way,
About this lady preacher's holiday.
If you don't get the moral then you're the gal for me
'Cause they got a lot of cottages down at Carmel-by-the-Sea.",Aimee Semple Mcpherson,1996
Pete Seeger,"Belle Starr, Belle Starr, tell me where you have gone
Since old Oklahoma's sand hills you did roam?
Is it heaven's wide streets that you're tying your reins

Eight men knew the feel of your dark velvet waist
Eight men heard the sounds of your tan leather skirt
Eight men heard the bark of the guns that you wore

And from out of your love was born the boy, Ed
A pal killed Jim Reed by the dark of the moon
And your son Ed was blowed down in a drunken saloon

Then there was Bob Younger, you loved him so well
He rode with the James Boys out on the long trail
Well, they caught him in Minnesota along with the gang
And he died down in jail in the cell or the chain

You loved Mr. William Clarke Quantrill
And his Civil War guerrillas in the Missouri hills
He hit Lawrence, Kansas and fought them still
And when he rode out, two hundred lay killed

They say you could have, they whispered you might
Have loved Frank James on a couple of nights
He fought the Midland Railroad almost to death
Then in 1915 Frank drawed his last breath

That you loved Jesse James, that desperado
Jesse got married, had a wife and a son
Was shot down at home by the Ford brothers' guns

As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay

Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die

It was once in the saddle I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle I used to go gay
First down to Rosie's and then to the card house
Got shot in the breast and I'm dying today

Get sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin
Get six jolly cowboys to sing me a song
Take me to the graveyard and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong

Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Get six pretty maidens to sing me a song
Take me to the valley and lay the sod o'er me
For I'm a young cowboy, I know I've done wrong

Play the Dead March as they carry me along
Put bunches of roses all over my coffin
Put roses to deaden the clods as they fall

Then there was Bob Younger, you loved him so well
He rode with the James Boys out on the long trail
Well, they caught him in Minnesota along with the gang
And he died down in jail in the cell or the chain

You loved Mr. William Clarke Quantrill
And his Civil War guerrillas in the Missouri hills
He hit Lawrence, Kansas and fought them still
And when he rode out, two hundred lay killed

They say you could have, they whispered you might
Have loved Frank James on a couple of nights
He fought the Midland Railroad almost to death
Then in 1915 Frank drawed his last breath

They say it could be, they say maybe so
That you loved Jesse James, that desperado
Jesse got married, had a wife and a son
Was shot down at home by the Ford brothers' guns

Belle Starr, Belle Starr, your time's getting late
But how is Jim Younger, did you hear his fate?
He was jailed and then pardoned for all he had done
And he blowed out his own brains in nineteen and one

Eight men they say combed that waving black hair
Eight men knew the feel of your dark velvet waist
Eight men heard the sounds of your tan leather skirt
Eight men heard the bark of the guns that you wore

Belle Starr, Belle Starr, tell me where you have gone
Since old Oklahoma's sand hills you did roam?
Is it heaven's wide streets that you're tying your reins
Or single footing somewhere below?

Pete Seeger,"I'm just a typical American from a typical American town
I believe in God and Senator Todd and a-keeping old Castro down
And when it came my time to serve I knew ""better dead than red""
But when I got to my old draft board, buddy, this is what I said:

[Chorus:]
Sarge, I'm only eighteen, I got a ruptured spleen
And I always carry a purse
I got eyes like a bat, my feet are flat and my asthma's getting worse
Oh I think of my career, my sweetheart dear, and my poor old invalid aunt
Besides, I ain't no fool, I'm goin' to school
And I'm working in a defense plant

I got a dislocated disc and a wracked up back
I'm allergic to flowers and bugs
And when bombshells hit, I get epileptic fits
And I'm addicted to a thousand drugs
I got the weakness woes, I can't touch my toes
I can hardly touch my knees
And if the enemy came close to me
I'd probably start to sneeze

[Chorus]

I hate Chou En Lai, and I hope he dies,
But one thing you gotta see
That someone's gotta go over there
But that someone isn't me
So I wish you well, Sarge, give 'em Hell
Yeah kill me a thousand or more
And if you ever get a war without blood and gore
Well I'll be the first to go

Pete Seeger,"How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been

Old age is golden so I've heard said
But sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed
With my ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup
My eyes on the table until I wake up
As sleep dims my vision I say to myself
Is there anything else I should lay on the shelf?
But though nations are warring and business is vexed
I'll stick around to see what happens next

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been

When I was young my slippers were red
I could kick up my heels right over my head
When I was older my slippers were blue
But still I could dance the whole night thru
Now I am older my slippers are black
I huff to the store and I puff my way back
But never you laugh; I don't mind at all
I'd rather be huffing than not puff at all

How do I know my youth is all spent?
My get up and go has got up and went
But in spite of it all I'm able to grin
And think of the places my get up has been

I get up each morning and dust off my wits
Open the paper and read the obits
If I'm not there I know I'm not dead
So I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed

I will tell you of a young boy, whose age was nineteen
He was the bravest union man, that I have ever seen

Harry Simms was a palomine, we labored side by side
Expecting to be shot on sight, or taken for a ride
By them dirty cold operator gun thugs, that roamed from town to town
A-shooting down the union men, where e'er they may be found

Harry Simms was walkin' down the track, one bright sun-shiney day
He was a youth of courage, his step was light and gay
He did not know the gun thugs was hiding on the way
To kill our brave young comrade this bright sun-shiney day

Harry Simms was killed on Brush Creek, in nineteen thirty-two
He organized the miners, into the N.M.U.
He gave his life in struggle, that was all that he could do
He died for the union, also for me and you",Harry Sims,1996

Pete Seeger,"When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip,
I wanted some place to call my own.
And so I made the race, and staked me out a place,
And settled down along the Cimarron.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home, it blowed away.
It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there,
But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away.

I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.
Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
And got a fancy mortgage on the place.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
All the crops I planted blowed away.
You can't grow any grain if you ain't got any rain;
All except the mortgage blowed away.

It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there,
I figured I was all set for life.
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
And went to town and picked me out a wife.

She blowed away, she blowed away
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.
Mister as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.

Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack;
So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed,
A-travelin' with the wind at my back.

I blowed away, I blowed away
Chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.
Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;
My Oklahoma farm is overhead.

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere.
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin'
I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.
But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,
My Oklahoma home that blowed away.

I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick 'til I die.
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;
My Oklahoma home is in the sky.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My farm down upon the Cimarron.
But all around the world, wherever dust is whirled,
Some is from my Oklahoma home.

A story I will tell
'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well.
It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode.

There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An' his wife she overheard.

Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down.

Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name.

But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes.

Others tell you 'bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill.

It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say:

Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief.

Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;

And some with a fountain pen.

And Great Grandmother was his bride
They found a lot, a jolly little spot
Over on the old North Side
It sloped down toward the river, from River Avenue
Great Grandma said that it would give her
Such a lovely view
So they took a look in Godey's Ladies Book
To see what they could find
And they found a house, a jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Great Grandfather was a handy man
Who never wasted any time
He found a crew that knew just what to do
With white pine, common brick, and lime.
He said, ""I'll build a big veranda, where Amanda can perch.
""And I'll sit there myself on Sunday mornings
""When everybody else has gone to church.""
The neighbors said, ""He's crazy in the head
""He's surely lost his mind.""
But he built that house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Great Grandpa at last was laid to rest
With Great Grandmother at his side.
Old Aunt Amanda said, ""My land, an
""Empty house I can't abide.
""I'll start a ladies' seminary, it will be very select.
""Of course, it will be very necessary
""That all my girls be circumspect.""
As you may guess, it was a big success
Those girls were so refined
In that self-same house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now, Aunt Amanda's work at last was done
And she passed on to her reward.
Appeared a sign that bore the line
Announcing simply, ""Room and Board.""
The house was soon filled with roomers, of every degree
Red flannel underwear and bloomers
Hung out for everyone to see.
The old porch stoop had started in to droop
The house looked so resigned
That self-same house, that jolly little house,
With a Queen Anne front
And a Mary Anne behind.

Now that old house was looking worse and worse
And so was River Avenue.
Wooden shacks across the tracks
Spoiled Great Grandma's lovely view.
A group of very pretty ladies moved in there one day.
The were such pretty Sues and Sadies
But a wagon came and took them all away.

Lord I wish I was back in Tennessee
Way down in that old Columbus Stockade
My friends all have turned their back on me.

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
In your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Many a night with you I've rambled
Honey, countless hours with you I've spent
Thought I had your sweet love and your little heart forever
But I find it was only lent.

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Last night as I lay sleeping
Oh, I dreamd that I was you in my arms
When I woke I was mistaken
Lord, I was still behind these bars

Go and leave me if you wish to
Never let me cross your mind
If in your heart you love another
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

Pete Seeger,"On top of old smokey all covered with snow
I lost my true lover for courting too slow
For courting's a pleasure and parting's a grief
And a false hearted lover is worse than a thief
For a thief will just rob you and take all you save
But a false hearted lover will lead you to the grave
And the grave will decay you and turn you to dust
Not one girl in a hundred a poor boy can trust
They'll hug you and kiss you and tell you more lies
Than cross lines on a railroad or stars in the skies
So come all your maidens and listen to me
Never place your affections on a green willow tree
For the leaves they will wither and the roots they will die
You'll all be forsaken and never know why.",On Top of Old Smoky,2000

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

But I believe in love

Will surely shine you'll see
And guide us to where we ought to be

And I'm still here in prayer
You say you've had enough
And that you just don't care

And light shines from above
You tell me in my dreams
That you believe in love

Will surely shine you'll see
And guide you home again to be...

And it also got the guitar and the guitar got us

It was Afro American people in the south
That worked out this way of playing it though
You know in Europe they usually play a guitar
But the Afro American peple worked out a way to play it
Just like a drum band

The base strings were played by a thumb with a steady beat
And the top strings were played
With the finger and got all the little off beats

Who wrote a song, which some of you may know
She plays it, who knows it?

When green buds all were swelling,
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling,
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen.

So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him,
And the only words to him did say
Young man I think you're dying.

He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling,
Good-bye, good-bye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen.

When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard hearted Barbara Allen.

Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow.

And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow,
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow.

Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her,
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar.

Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briar.",Barbara Allen [*],2002

Said, ""Hammer's gonna be the death of me, Lord, Lord.

The captain said to John Henry
""Gonna bring that steam drill 'round.
Gonna bring that steam drill out on the job.
Gonna whop that steel on down. Down,
Down.
Whop that steel on down.""
John Henry told his captain,
""A man ain't nothin' but a man,
But before I let your steam drill beat me
Down,
I'd die with a hammer in my hand. Lord,

Down.

Thought he was mighty fine,
But John Henry made fifteen feet;
The steam drill only made nine. Lord, Lord.
The steam drill only made nine.
John Henry hammered in the mountain
His hammer was striking fire.
But he worked so hard, he broke his poor heart.
He laid down his hammer and he died. Lord, Lord.

Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries

Or a decent job or a helping hand

Said: ""Steve, you're way behind time,

""Shovel on a little more coal.

This is how it read:

Scalded to death by the steam.

The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their T.V.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain

A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;

And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

My crops I lay into the banker's store.
My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.

Now I worry all the time like I never did before

Late in the winter, it's maple syrup time.
You need warm and sunny days but still a cold and freezing nighttime
For just a few weeks, maple syrup time.
We boil and boil and boil and boil it all day long,
Till ninety seven percent of water evaporates just like this song
And when what is left is syrupy don't leave it too long
Watch out for burning! Maple syrup time.

I know it's not the quickest system but each year I can't resist it.
Get out the buckets, and tap the trees in time
Making it is half the fun, and satisfaction when it's done.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.

Ah! but no more than this attempt to make a happy little rhyme,
So pat your feet or swing your tail, but keep in good time.
Keep up the fire! Maple syrup time.

Hoping they don't mind a little advice in rhyme.

Reflecting on the past
The shattered hopes and dreams of a future
That was never meant to last

Just turn around now
Tell me what you see
Look all around you
Is this how things could be

Had enough of love neverlasting
But now I know it never will
Hanging around on the off chance
Waiting for that certain thrill

Just turn around now
See what we have done
It's getting late now
The future has begun

Witness the change

Some kinds of love are magical mystical
I wonder how I'd feel
If ever I should be so enchanted
To get a taste of what is real

Just look around now
Tell me what you see
Look all around you
Is this how things could be

I feel the sound of thunder and laughter
It's tearing me apart
I start to fade till all that's remaining is
The echo of my heart

Even though it wasn't so good it was all that I'd had
Now I've seen it slip away and tomorrow's just another day
To find relief from feeling sad

What else can I do
Maybe I don't know right from wrong
Who knows who cares now
What else can I do

You had changed your mind
Now I guess that it's
All up to you
Am I just today another one
That you've left behind
Or did you love me
With a love so true

I thought you and I were friends
Still you made me cry
What else can I do
'N' maybe love will find a way
Give me one more try
It's all up to you

How can you tell me that I must be dreaming
You're waiting around I've got nothing to do
So tired of waiting I've only one lifetime

Until it dragged me down

Another lonely lifetime
Until it drags you down

I'm more and more amazed by the world that I see

Looking the other way

Before we drag it down
It's not too late to resolve the old solution
And then we'll drag it down

All the day is the night
But somehow I just can't sleep
Somehow though it don't seem right
I had you but love didn't keep

Echoing it makes me cry

And I just can't get to sleep
Sorting out my thoughts
But I don't know which are the right ones to keep
Thinking of the countries
Where there's nothing left to eat
Counting the starving millions by the thousand

They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time could be for ever

The things I say may very well sound different
Depending on your point of view
Some kind of lovers give you creature comforts
Do anything you want them to
Somebody told me they thought I was much older
They thought having fun was the answer
But you see next time should be for ever

Never again I hear somebody saying
Will you break this heart of mine
But I can't wait not even for a moment
I'm drifting off the edge of time
You showed me things that should remain a mystery
Just like they were intended to
If I try hard and do some rearranging
I could find a place for you

You say you know but you might be mistaken
Taken for a ride again
Alone at last but this is not the first time
I hope it won't turn out the same

You can buy a lot of shame with your money
He's riding in a limousine now
Walk down, walk down, walk down, walk down!

Sweat is the name of this town
It's an ugly old, dirty old disgrace
And now that the steel's shut down
It's fear puts the sweat in a man's face
Walk down, walk down, walk down

Oh now I should have a break like you
But somebody stacked up the decks
Heads are going to roll some day
If we ever get this yoke off our necks
Walk down, walk down, walk down, oh

Well I'm walking through a wasted land
I'm walking through a wasted land
Where is the future we planned
I'm walking through a wasted land
Walk down, walk down, walk down, walk down!",Walking Through a Wasted Land,1993

That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room, and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up the book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire

[Chorus]
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said, ""Never mind, your part
Is to be what you'll be.""

The theme of the sermon was 'Come unto me,
Love will find a way',
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday

[Chorus]

She arrived at six, and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails, looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said, ""Here we go!""

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage

But soon the atmosphere was cooler
As Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
And touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage

[Chorus]

Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye, she had to try
But couldn't see through their lights
Her face was gashed, and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night

The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face, oh

Sixteen stitches put her right, and her dad said
""Don't say I didn't warn you.""
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile

I am alone with the truth

I am happy singing in the arms of God

I am balanced, keeping mind and heart equal

Pete Townshend,"Well, once I was a stone, many years ago
Into a pool was thrown, many years ago
Time went by and the pool ran dry
Excavated was I, and tempered and beat in the fiery heat
By the hand of a man, whose name was Dan, Dan the blacksmith

Well once I was a sword, many years ago
And my blade was broad, many years ago
Wore it with pride, and into battle I'd ride, on a warrior side
And cut my tail, their was loss of my tail
And soon did rust, corrode to dust, oh my

Well once I was a daisy, many years ago
In pastures green and lazy, many years ago
But I was met by a goat who fell in a moat
And forgetting to float he sunk like a lead and stayed until dead
And was relieved to find just how kind it all was

Well once I was a grub, many years ago
And I lived among that mud , many years ago
But I'm a reckless mood, and I gave it a Coo
That was it with a prune, and when the good Lord was done
I walked with the sun, I shed my skins
And tried my wings and flew away

Well, once I was a bullfrog, had to struggle for survival
And once I was a carp and lived in waters on the meadow
And once I was a mynah bird, quoting verses from the Bible
I said pretty boy, pretty boy, Saint Luke

Well once I was a mule, many years ago
And my master treat me cruel, many years ago
By by was sick, so I moved to a kick, 
So I took out a stick , laid it back across my back
To an almighty crack to my dismay
I cast away into the blue

Then I was born a human baby, many years ago
I remember I was born unto a lady, many years ago
All our hopes were piled on the back of a child
Who turned out to be wild, sent the devil a prayer
Caused the parson to swear so I took my leave
To lie and thieve, on my way to jail

Known good times and disaster
But now I have a teacher and my teacher has a master
And the master is perfection, so he'll help us get there faster

All the love he has and more

And now that the summer's ending
And your baby cries out to sea
I do feel that I am drowning
In the love that you're sending me

I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

Blind to it, as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free

There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it, still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves

Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above

But she wouldn't let me pass
I was such a bore, and I lied to her
I said I didn't really want her ass
I went away in the mud and rain
The gang became snide and laughed
I was slain, but I smiled and the pain
Began to subside at last

And when I got back to my hotel
I wondered if the thunder meant I'd landed in Hell
And on the forecourt I slipped and fell
I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell
I thought, hey

Somebody saved me - I thank you, my friend

I'd have wanted her forever

Twenty years ago or more

But I didn't know what lips were for
I ran away in the mud and rain
The weather here is never too bright
She'd had an affray with her man and came
For solace and the means to fight

She finally bored with seducing me
And took up with some geezer from the Ealing scene
It nearly killed him like it would've killed me
When her original man snapped his fingers and she obeyed, she obeyed

Every show there's been more faking it

Somebody saves me from a fate worse than Heaven

I took up the connection once
Made me feel quite aloof
I never could queue to collect my lunch
While I was pursuing the truth
So I left my folks in the mud and rain
It always rains in Sunnyside Road
I lived hippy jokes, getting stoned insane
Till the rain looked just like snow

But there was a soul in whom I could depend
He worked himself crazy while I laid in bed
I never leaned on a person like I leaned right then
And when I finally woke up clean
My friend was dead, stone dead

Somebody saved me - it happened again

Pete Townshend,"I was just thirty-four years old and I was still wandering in a haze
I was wondering why everyone I met seemed like they were
Lost in a maze

I don't know why I thought I should have some kind of
Divine right to the blues
It's sympathy not tears people need when they're the
Front page sad news.

The incense burned away and the stench began to rise
And lovers now estranged avoided catching each others' eyes

And girls who lost their children cursed the men who fit the coil
And men not fit for marriage took their refuge in the oil
No one respects the flame quite like the fool who's badly burned
From all this you'd imagine that there must be something learned

Slit skirts, Jeanie never wears those slit skirts
I don't ever wear no ripped shirts
Can't pretend that growing older never hurts.

Knee pants, Jeanie never wears no knee pants
Have to be so drunk to try a new dance
So afraid of every new romance

Slit skirts, slit skirt
Jeanie isn't wearing those slit skirts, slit skirt
She wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
Wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt

Slit skirts, slit skirt
Jeanie isn't wearing those slit skirts, slit skirt
She wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
Wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt

Romance, romance, why aren't we thinking up romance?
Why can't we drink it up true heart romance
Just need a brief new romance

Let me tell you some more about myself, you know I'm sitting at home just now.
The big events of the day are passed and the late TV shows have come around.
I'm number one in the home team, but I still feel unfulfilled.
A silent voice in her broken heart complaining that I'm unskilled.

And I know that when she thinks of me, she thinks of me as him,
But, unlike me, she don't work off her frustration in the gym.

Recriminations fester and the past can never change
A woman's expectations run from both ends of the range

Once she walked with untamed lovers' face between her legs
Now he's cooled and stifled and it's she who has to beg

Slit skirts, Jeanie never wears those slit skirts
And I don't ever wear no ripped shirts
Can't pretend that growing older never hurts

Knee pants, Jeanie never wears no knee pants
We have to be so drunk to try a new dance
So afraid of every new romance

Slit skirts, slit skirt

She wouldn't dare in those slit skirts, slit skirt
Wouldn't be seen dead in no slit skirt

Pete Townshend,"I don't matter, you don't matter
Neither does this mindless clatter
It don't matter where you're from
What matters is your uniform

Wear your braces round your seat
Doctor Marten's on your feet
Keep your bonnet very neat
For credibility on street

We are marching as to war
We won't be obscure no more
In uniform, in uniform

I am really living life inside a jar, I'm all alone
So I feel forgiven if I'm under par, a fallen clone
Only in the river can I claim a star to call my own
I'm newly born in uniform, I'm up on the throne

I am frightened, you are frightened
Should we get our trousers tightened?
Where in Brighton is your norm
And wears enlightened uniform?

On my parka is some band
I don't really understand
Perry is my guiding hand
Scooter polo sweeps the land

We are marching as to war
We won't be obscure no more
In uniform, in uniform

People think we dress alike to segregate identities
Pills or drink or puffing pipes in integrated entities
Then they wink and snort their line
And say how great their Bentley is
They feel so warm when they confirm

They say that nakedness is what our Lord intended
When we stand naked then we all appear the same
But it's just faking it if we all try pretending
Are we just making all our prayers in the rain
Heaven knows I need new clothes

We are marching as to war
But we are really fighting for
Our uniform, our uniform

When I contemplate my future I go numb, don't feel a thing
I don't overrate my suitors, number one, I always sing
But the state and their computers make me run for comfort
In my uniform, in uniform I feel like a king

They say that nakedness is what our Lord intended
That we stand naked, then we all appear the same
But it's just faking it if we all try pretending
Are we just making all our prayers in the rain

It seems insane
But heaven knows
It's all the same
And I need new clothes

Pete Townshend,"She was born in the back of a thirty four Ford
And raised in a foster home
Her guardian made sexual connection with her
Before she was even grown

When she was fifteen she fell in love
With a boy who had a fast car
But she was timid and withdrawn
So she worshiped him from afar

Still he couldn't help but notice her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

She ran away to the city the next year
Disowned out of jealousy
She frightened men with her figure
So they treated here like a sleaze

She lived cross the street from a piss factory
As dark as the sun is bright
The kind where you think you just went blind
When you walk in from the daylight

Still they couldn't help but notice her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

She was discovered by a man three times her age
Who worked for a studio
And he bought her dresses and perfume
And moved her into his home

He got her a part in a comedy
Where she played a dumb blond whore
And she posed without clothes for a magazine
And the offers came in by the score

In a restaurant in Brussels she pulls back her hair
Picks up a candle and lights a cigarette
And she's recognized by a tourist
Who can't see her face but knows her silhouette

He imagines her robe as it drops to the floor
He imagines her skin soft to touch
He imagines her naked on silk sheets
The morning she never woke up

Still I couldn't help but notice her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

I noticed her
She was fatally beautiful
Ever since she was a girl
She was fatally beautiful

With apple cores and mice along?
Did you ever lay on ice and grit

Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Past cozy homes with secret beds?
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
And wake up cold to the smell of bread?

Well I have slept there badly twice
And shared my straw with scratching mice
Although you'll find some deep brown hair
I'll tell you something for nothin'

Did you ever wonder why music hurts

Were you ever fooled by laughter's lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite?

Watching ripples splashing over
Wadding the bank where horses are grazing
Reflection shatter quite amazing

But soon I quietly ask, is this the way for me?
I twist my vacuum flask and have a cup of tea

Goin' fishin' never catch none
If I did, I'd surely lance
The spirit of the first is quiggley
The fish tackle scares me and the snails

The pleasure cruiser's speed
Laden with wind cheaters
The hooters blow and seize
My mind from nature's creatures

Blowing the fish, emptying in my warm hand
I want fishin' everlasting
You can take my son if you drown your own daughter
You're a man and I am free

Throw a stick into the surface
Watch it bob, it cruises pass
The river flows gently eroding
Moves 'cross land, but not to fast

Pete Townshend,"Say goodbye to the brilliant blues
Say goodbye

It's time, to live
Make me, take me
It's time, to give
So don't betray me, pay me

Don't want to be frozen
I'll spend my mornings at the sunshine cafe
I've read the news and the clique-ridden notions
I know that now is the time to say

It's time, to teach
So tell me, come on tell me
It's time, to preach
So help me, come on and help me

Will never flow this way again
The color of the river is gray

Have faded into sadness and pain,
And now it's time to say, it's time

We'll get far away from the blues and the mist and the rain
You and me are going to fight until we win the day
For now is the time we must say goodbye

Pete Townshend,"His pride is like a bandage
He's wrapped in a warm cocoon
His pride is just like heroin
He's back inside the womb

His pride is like an ocean
Encircled by a reef
His pride's an hypnotic potion
His memory is a leaf

Her pride is like an armour
Flaming ring of fire
Her pride is like a blindness
An ever tightening wire

Her pride is like a razor
A surgeon's purging knife
Her pride is like a censor
She's slashed out half her life

Pete Townshend,"Nothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
You're crashing by design
You once believed that crazy accidents
Were happening to you
You were chasing a capricious wind
Whenever bad luck and trouble
Happened to pursue you
The dice would surely save your skin
But when you look back you must realize
That nothing in your life's divine
Everything that's ever befallen you
Happened simply 'cause it crossed your mind
You're crashing by design
Nothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
You're crashing by design
In your single-roomed flat in a courtyard building
You sit alone just like a broken toy
Where's your mother, where's your lover
And where are the children
Are you a man or still a boy?
Who left you behind, or did you run
From the crush of so many options?
Now you know the special despair of the man
Discussed, debated and offered for adoption
Nothing must pass this line
Unless it is well defined
You just have to be resigned
Another man without a woman
Dropped like a useless tool no longer required
A man who longs for the stifling
Milk flowered bosom, a fool
Who's no longer desired

Another man without a woman
Too many rages have cost you this time
Another man among a hundred children
You're just a child who is lost in time

Pete Townshend,"From my window, I see roads
Lead to darkness, leading home
In the midnight of a soul's unsleeping
I hear the waterfall of women weeping

Hear the distant noise of traffic stalling
I hear the prostituted children calling
From the barred and mesh-floor streets
Of a winter's night, without a moon

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
Hiding out

I look over chequered fields
And the towering web of steel
Young and old will sit and judge unfeeling
While the empty church's bell are pealing

And the green hills lay ignored, untended
Lonely watchers remain unbefriended
And out in the one way streets
Is a swelling maze, without a door

I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here
I am safe hidden here

I am safe hidden here
Hiding out
I am safe hidden here

My heart is touched, 
By awakening faces.
I see the panic, 
Of people in motion.
I can stand here, 
Look out on an ocean.
I am a wall, 
Awaiting a catchword.
I see the city laid out like a patchwork.

Alone, I am free, from hatred and blindness.
I hope that this life, 
Is frozen and timeless.
My man is here, 
We grow old by inches.
Tomorrow, I'll walk among heroes and princes.

I feed the boys, 
I hear secrets whispered.
I know the hearts that are battered and blistered.

I am secure.

This is my cell,
But it's connected to starlight.",I Am Secure,1985

The White City Fighting, remember, remember

Down to the refuge, near QPR
I drive to committees in my German car
Prone to violence, prone to shame
I glide in silence, my pride in vain
For no one remembers, not that I can see
That we were defenders, we were the free

The White City, blood was an addiction
Now it is analyzed just as though it were fiction
That battles were won and battles were blown
At the height of the White City fighting

And then the sound of Brixton gun and the scream of a child.
The night is hot

This gang running wild.

there ain't no color in memories.
He rode his brother's Harley across the TV
while I was laughing at Dom DeLuise.

I've gotta stop drinking, I've gotta stop thinking,
I've gotta stop smoking.

After the fire the fire still burns,

blackening the promises, the tears and the rain.
The fire will burn
'til the wind begins to turn
and it all begins again.

Pete Townshend,"A love born once must soon be born again
A spark that burned, then died, leaving cinders to be fanned
By the wind and thrown to flame;
Flames like tongues impassioned in a moments burst.
Tell me friend - why do you stand aloof from your own heart?
The truth confronts you - the truth confronts you as the sea
Crushing without detail,
Impassioned and detached,
Killing with love and power in God's Name.
Love conquers poses. Love smashes stances. Love crushes angles
Into black. So you, without question, know your first love
Is your last. And you, will never - never - Love again
I always wished to walk with her into resteraunts, (A clammy tale).
To be seen beside her at the public bar footrail.
I always wanted to be matched with her -
Yet her beauty was so different to mine.
My ""beauty"" needs an understanding, a knowledge of what I am.
Hers is enough. Earned through eons; for that is what true beauty is -
Time's gift to perfect humility.

But God help me -
May I be matched with you again

It brings back a night of tropical splendor

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
The clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

And wash me to mud
Dry me to dust
And set me to smolder

They dropped things on his back

Pete Townshend,"Down at the Astoria the scene was changing,
Bingo and rock were pushing out X-rating,
We were the first band to vomit in the bar,
And find the distance to the stage too far,
Meanwhile it's getting late at ten o'clock,
Rock is dead they say,
Long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock,
Be it dead or alive.

People walk in sideways pretending that they're leaving,
We put on our makeup and work out all the lead-ins,
Jack is in the alley selling tickets made in Hong Kong,
Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone,
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock,
Be it dead or alive.

Landslide, rocks are falling,
Falling down 'round our very heads,
We tried but you were yawning,
Look again, rock is dead, rock is dead, rock is dead.

The place is really jumping to the high-watt amps,
'Til a 20-inch cymbal fell and cut the lamps,
In the blackout they dance right into the aisle,
And as the doors fly open even the promoter smiles,
Someone takes his pants off and the rafters knock,
Rock is dead, they say,
Long live rock, long live rock, long live rock.

Long live rock, I need it every night,
Long live rock, come on and join the line,
Long live rock, be it dead or alive.

I always feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad

He said, ""Son now here's some little something""
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I, I don't feel bad at all

Pictures of Lily let me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily make me feel alright

And then one day things weren't so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said, ""Son, now don't be silly""

""She's been dead since 1929""
Oh, how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright

Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
But their was always,
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily to help me feel alright
Cause me and Lily are together in my dreams
Hey I was wondering mister, have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily?

I've played the silver ball.
From Soho down to Brighton
I must've played them all.
But I never seen anything like him
In any amusement hall...
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He stands like a statue,
Becomes part of the machine.
Feeling all the bumpers,
Always playing clean.
He plays by intuition,
The digit counters fall.
That deaf, dumb and blind kid
Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.
A pinball wizard's got
Such a supple wrist.

How do you think he does it?
I don't know!
What makes him so good?

He ain't got no distractions,
Can't hear no buzzers and bells.
Don't see no lights a flashin',
Plays by sense of smell,
Always has a replay,
An' never tilts at all...

Sure plays a mean pinball!

He's a pinball wizard.
There has to be a twist.

Holding your head to the sky, in there

As your hurting all together
Are you really getting threw

Would you be wrong to sing and dance

Understanding isn't really new

I am a fool you claim
We are one all the same
Then you surrender, and the case is closed

Guess you ride innocence
I cause a sin offense
Short change my heart, for a fashionable home

Praying the game we play
All do it every day
No point pretending nobody's fool
Staying the same we say
Bring on a change our way
Treating the Lord, like a teacher in school

And we check over each shoulder
Making sure that no one knows
As we get down on our knees

And yet the witness inside
Looking out threw our own eyes
Is there really worthy on the trees

What we want is a brand new year
Open your hearts and set them free

All shall be well and all shall be well
And all manner of things are gonna be well
All shall be well and all shall be well
And all manner of things are gonna be well

All shall be well and all shall be well
And all manner of things are gonna be well
All shall be well and all shall be well
And all manner of things are gonna be well

All shall be well and all shall be well
And all manner of things are gonna be well

",New Life/Reprise,1989
Pete Townshend,"Was there life before this love
Was there love before this I can see
Was there ever love for her before me
And if I look will she look back at me
Is fantasy enough?

Was there heat before this flame
Were there flames before this fire in my heart
Was I wrong about it from the start
Am I in ecstasy or next to see that fantasy's to blame

Was there life before this love

If I look will she look back at me
Is fantasy enough?

If this scene is in a dream
Then I'm perfect for the part I play
You can count on me to stand and say
""Was there ever life before this wonderful day?""

Was there heat before this flame
Were there flames before this fire in my heart
Was I wrong about it from the start
Am I in ecstasy or next to see that fantasy's to blame

If this dream's within a dream
Then I'll never swoon quite deep enough
No hypnotic trance quite sleep enough

If in this sweet dream I'm flying
I will never fly quite high enough
You will hear me crying high above

Was there ever life before this wonderful love?
",Was There Life,1989
Pete Townshend,"No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free

When my fist clenches, crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile, tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool

And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver, please give me a blanket
Keep me warm, let me wear your coat

No one knows what it's like
To be the sad man
To be the bad man
Behind blue eyes

Pete Townshend,"There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breathe rippling by
The note is eternal
I hear it, it sees me
Forever we blend as forever we die

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

As people a**emble
civilization is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Gas on the hillside
 Oil in the tea cup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy

We all know success when we all find our own dream
And our love is enough to knock down any wall
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
In us all

I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star

Today is the day the sound curdles mountains
Flowing and blowing each man in its wake
Destroying itself in the end with vibration
There's nothing on earth it's challenge can take
Excepting one note

Excepting one note pure and easy
Playing so free like breath rippling by

The glass sets up a sound like people laughing
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing

Mmm.

I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing, passing

Find it, I got to hear it all again...
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it, as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free

There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it, still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves

Don't listen to people talk, don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greed's
Just hear it in the sound of time a passing

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution

Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again

The change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all
The world looks just the same
And history ain't blamed
Cause the banners, they are flown in the last war

No, no!
We don't get fooled again

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
Get all my papers and smile at the sky
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya?

There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye
The parting on the left
Is now parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight

They pervade everything, human consciousness is reflected by them
Atoms are vibrations between positive and negative forces

Every person wearing an experience suit
Will share this adventure with us

Ray writes a letter


RAY: Dear Rosalind, thanks for the new tape. You did my song very well. But, be careful. Celebrities believe their actions affect the behavior of their fans. It is a conceit the press reinforce. They suggest they entrust their precious readers into the hands of the performer. But it's really the performer who entrusts his audience to the press. You must serve the press as well as the audience. For me, a journalist called Ruth Streeting has become a symbol for the press and the establishment. They can't accept that a shit like me has value. I've always needed to make a crowd look away from the beautiful toward me. The more distasteful Ruth Streeting finds that need, the more driven I am to perform especially for her. Her disgust is the most powerful motivator of the artist in me. And as this is the last time I'm writing to you, I can tell you now something that I hardly believe has happened. I have fallen in love with her.

You shone a light for me to follow
Knowing I would
You graced me with a precious gift
That no-one else could
Touched by your presence I surrender, oh yeah
You gave me a lead and I was a follower
A quest to succeed, I am a discoverer
Oh flame, you set me on fire

And full of desire

He's been seen out and about in the big city

Without a drink inside him
There was talk of a nervous breakdown
He's even got up the nose of his sexy manager

Now has a challenged coke habit
I've always had a soft spot for Rastus

I hold my son
I plan our toys
Time expansive more, take more
I must outlive the dinosaur

Rising rivers
Drown new shoots
Words and breath
In death cahoots
The strong survive
To wean more brutes
Who grow and seed
Extend their roots
Cowards, bombs
And scab recruits
Like monkeys trapped
In monkey suits
Time is plentiful more, take more
I must outfight the dinosaur",Outlive the Dinosaur,1993

Pete Townshend,"I remember being richer than a king
The minutes of the day were golden
I recall that when the joint passed round
My body felt a little colder
But now I'm like a sewer channel - running lime and scag
Let me get at the master panel - let me at my stack

The sea refuses no river
And right now this river's banks are blown
The sea refuses no river
Whether stinking and rank
Or red from the tank
Whether pure as a spring
There's no damned thing stops the poem
The sea refuses no river
And this river is homeward flowing

I have seen a trace of strain
In other's eyes not spoken
I must admit that I enjoyed their pain
But this time it's me that's broken
I demand for you and His
This must be the time
When we decide what freedom is
Turn water into wine

For the sea refuses no river
We're polluted now but in our hearts still clean
The sea refuses no river
We tried not to age
But time had it's rage
We're washed over stones
From babes into clones of the mean
The sea won't refuse this muddy river
Nor deny the sulfurous stream

There was a fool in a dressing robe
Riding out the twilight hour
Lonely and cold in an empty home
Trying to assess his power
But now he's like a stream in flood
Swollen by the storm
He doesn't care if he sheds his blood
Let him be reborn

For the sea refuses no river
Remember that when the beggar buys a round
The sea refuses no river
And rain fills the gutters
No time for stutters
This is our chance
To sing and to dance and to clown
The sea refuses no river
And rivers were sprung to drown

The sea refuses no river
No pecking code respected for the damned
The sea refuses no river
Whether starving or ill
Or strung on some pill
Just ''cause you own the land
There's no unique hand plugs the dam
The sea refuses no river
And the river is where I am

The river is where I am",The Sea Refuses No River,1996

Pete Townshend,"If your traveling in the north country a far
Where the winds hit heavy on the border line.
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.

And when you go, and the snow flakes fall
The rivers freeze, and summer ends
Please see for me, that she's wearing a coat so warm
Keep her from... that howling wind.

Please see for me that her hair is hanging long
And flows and flows on down her breast.
Please see for me that her hair is hanging long
For that's the way I remember her the best.

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all
The many times I've often laid
In the darkness of my light
The brightness, of my day.

And what it is is love,
And love is what it's all about
In the frantic panic of day to day depths
Over schizophrenic city

Yes Yes Yes is the stuff that makes it work and hold together,
How it fits into the twines and how the rhythm flows,
Like the river Siddharthe sat by.
Yes Yes, is the music there for listening,
Is the poetry there for perception for even tired eyes?
Let's rub noses in the smell of things,
Fingers through grubby summer grasses,
As polluted pearls burst over rooftops;
Hope encapsulating a moment of truth in a moment of time.

Yes, Yes, it's a moments like this I can run barefoot
Over wet paving stones that the city performs its bitter
Reflections without regret,
For it's in good hands, in good hands,
The hands of the Master.

Yes Yes Yes, just this feeling, just the feeling, the feeling,
You can feel it; I can feel it,
Streaming through me, continuous, enchanting rhythm,
And the rhythm's enchanting,
And the rhythm's like season rhythms,
River rhythms, sea rhythms, sun rhythms, love rhythms,
And even in the roaring traffic's rude rhythms,
Overlapped the electronic chains;
City birds chirp communications.
Oh Yes, Yes

And the love flows on
Feeling in the misused madness
Which works to separate the unity of all creation,
And the chains which would bind us,
And in my bones,
And in the inner functions of my unbelievable being.

Yes Yes Yes Yes
And the love flows on, and the love flows on,
And the love flows on, and the love flows on.

And in the million frowns,
And in the million sightless eyes,
Jostling for a place in the circle of perfection;
And I can feel it in you who listen to the song
And in you who do not listen to the song
And in you who may never hear the song,
Oh Yes, Yes

And the love flows on, never ending,
Never resting,
Everywhere and in everything that manifests.
Is there anything which God isn't?

And in my heart I want to say I love you;
And in my prayer I want to say I love you;
And I love you, and I love you

Pulling hard and there's no concealing;
Diamond fingers pull me through;

Try a day of silence
Take things very slow
Listen to the wireless

Never speak a sound
Sit up on the hedgerow
Watch the world go round

When you've had a row
Sit alone say nothing
It's really funny how
You quickly see that something

Wonderful and warm
Lies between each second
In every side and out
Eternity will beckon

You and me, we are part of a single soul
And one day we will know we're one
Sit and listen the word will come
There is nothing beneath the sun that we can't realize

And one peaceful night
Will remind us that it's alright
And we'll figure we owe it all
To one life of silence

Whispers will emerge
Proud against the thunder
The wind hiss precious words
Erase our problems rumble

Watch a speckled fawn
Hear it crash like seaspray
Someone sees it all
We will meet him someday

Try a day of silence
Take things very slow

Just swung these leapers out the door

Can I match your money you have seen before.

He showed me ways, a different way to be
But now's comes a time to move further down the line
So get your ten lil' fingers off of me

But for every thing you gave, I then became your slave
Mary Jane, please take your hands off of me this minute

There are millions out there waiting for your charms
So proud Mary, go and take them in your arms
And threw her lovely eyes, you'll see a new sunrise
But will they see the things as they are?

They've taken me on one fantastic life
They've seen how I failed when I tried
I think that now and then I could take you again
But now I've got someone else inside

Mary Jane there are things that I've been told
By a man who is very, very old
He says it's up to me and if I can but see
His silver will give way to his gold
",Mary Jane,2000
Pete Townshend,"I've looked under chairs
I've looked under tables
I try to find the key
To fifty million fables

[Chorus]
They call me the Seeker
I've been searching low and high
I won't find what I'm after
Till the day I die

I asked my idols
The questions to my mother
I bought tickets just anywhere
Hoping to discover

[Chorus]

People tend to hate me
Cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand
Focused in on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a Seeker, I'm a really desperate man!

I asked Bobby Dylan 
I asked the Beatles 
I asked Timothy Leary 
But he didn't help me either

They call me the Seeker
I've been looking low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Now look at my face
Ain't this a smile?
I'm happy when life's good
And when it's bad, I cry
I got values
But I don't know how or why

I'm looking for me!
You're looking for you!
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do!

Pete Townshend,"The iron man came to the top of the cliff
How far had he walked nobody knows
Where had he come from nobody knows
How was he made, nobody knows
Taller than a house, the iron man stood
At the top of the cliff in the darkness

The wind sang through his iron fingers
And his great iron head, shaped like a dustbin
But as big as a bedroom
Slowly turned to the right, slowly turned to the left
He was hearing the sea

His eyes like headlamps, glowed white then red
Then infra-red, searching the sea
Never before had the iron man seen the sea

He swayed in the strong wind that pressed against his back
He swayed forward on the brink of the high cliff
And his right foot, his enormous iron right foot
Lifted-up out into space

And the iron man stepped forward, off the cliff into nothingness
Crash
Down the cliff, the iron man came toppling head over heels
Crash, crash, crash

From rock to rock, tumbling slowly
And as he crashed and crashed, his iron legs fell off
His iron arms broke off
And the hands broke off the arms

His great iron ears fell off
And his eyes fell out
His great iron head fell off

All the separate pieces tumbled scattered crashing
Bumping clanging down, on to the rocky beach far below
Then silence

Nobody knew the iron man had fallen
Nobody knew the iron man had fallen",Iron Man Recitative,2001

But you seemed to think
I deserved all indulgence I dared

Unaware of who was feeding whom

I couldn't say how we planned it to be

We laughed while we dine
I served the entrees
You served the spirits and the wine

But time heals and while
We laughed through our meals
I cheated desire
Fading and tired and pine

Say it right to my face
Have a Maxim more for the road
And let's get out of this place

When they both have said it all
We make the rule and bemoan the rule
That neither soul should call

But love that was is love that is
Demands to always be unchanged
But then all lovers are deranged

We walk away with memories
And clutch them to our hearts
We disembodied entities
We loves in fits and starts

For love like wine intoxicates
It drives all of you drink insane
But then all lovers are deranged

You know that you don't really fall in love
Unless you're seventeen
Then break your word, let your spirits fly
But you can't know what it means
Unless you're seventeen

It takes a fight to start a fight
And differences remain
We have the right to think, we're right
We're addicts feigning shame

For love recalled, is love reborn
We're determined to revive the pain

I was an English boy
I was brought up right
You cold hold me down
And I would bite
I knew no fear
I served with joy
I was proud to be here
An English boy

You spray like a tomcat
Piss like a stray dog
Swear like a sailor
Speaking in gang tongues
Kicking in chorus
Stabbing to order
Slashing like a blind man
Lost like a soldier

[Chorus]

Blurred like a movie
Gray under streetlights
Gray in the sunshine
So black on the tube line
Red on the touchline
Moving like a fever
Spreading like an oil slick
Thicker than a house brick

[Chorus]

And I don't know where I am now
Or where I'm gonna go
I keep going round and round on the circle line
Like some demented kind of commuta
Trying to avoid paying for my ticket
I'm a lost soul
I read about myself in the newspapers
I'm a pig
I'm a thug
I've got nowhere to go but down

(guitar solo)
Stand up, when I'm talking to you boy
Stand up, when I'm talking to you boy
Stand up, stand up, stand up!
Stand up!

Slow like a prejudice
Broken like hatred
Kicking at a dead man
Cut pieces to pieces
Marking your territory
Freezing the future
Stopping the stopwatch
I am despairing

And melt your cold, cold heart

That you belonged to me

Ein verlorener Traum
Damals warst do ein Kind
Do erinnerst Dich kaum
Oh
Cindy.
Denk an die Zeit
An das alte Klavier
Es ist lange verstaubt
Doch es träumt noch von Dir
Oh
Cindy.
Denn es steht in Deinem Zimmer
Und Deine Puppe sitzt noch immer
Wo do spieltest all die Jahre
Cindy.
Und sie schaut mit traurigen Augen
So als würd' sie niemals glauben
Daá ihre Zeit mit Dir vorüber ist.
Rock'n'Roll hat Deinem Leben
Einen neuen Sinn gegeben
Do gehst Deine eig'nen Wege
Cindy.
Und die alten Kinderlieder
Sie erklingen nie mehr wieder
Denn die Kinderträume sind vorbei.
Die Jahre vergeh'n
Do hast seiber ein Kind
Das so aussieht wie do
Doch die Zeit
Sie verrinnt
Oh
Cindy.
Sieh es Dir an
Und dann weiát do genau
Aus dem Mädchen von Dir wird bald eine Frau
Oh
Cindy.
Dann stehst do in ihrem Zimmer
Und ihre Puppe sitzt noch immer
Wo sie spielte all die Jahre

So als wirst do niemals glauben

At all the things that I have seen
And the items that I'm hoarding up the back stairs

Shut it up you silly cow

These words are not my own
They only come when I'm alone

She's taken all my vitamins
Used up my lighter fuel
I'm sure she stole all of my pencil lead in school

To realize, to be brought back down to size,
the wicked lies and all the shite you say.
I'm not losing my mind,
no I'm not changing my lines,
I'm just learning new things with the passage of time.
I'm looking on the bright side,
I wear it like a bruise,
I've never loved Elvis,
and I've never sung the blues.
I'm thinking of another man,
I remind myself of him,
I wear him like a hairstyle,
or a stain upon my skin,
but, my flesh is getting cleaner,
and my hair is growing thin.

I dreamed the only woman I ever loved
People, turned her back on me
Let me tell you little more about the dream

I dream of working a graveyard shift
For the long nights a week
When I left home my baby's in bed
My baby, she was fast asleep

When I'm done sick of my job
And I had to go home
And when I got there my bed was empty
My baby she was gone

It couldn't let this worry
It all happened in my sleep
All the things that has been so bad
And I don't want you from seven to seven next weekend

And that's why, that's why, that's why I had a dream
Lord, that's worrying me
She's the only woman I ever loved, people

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging
Chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime

No rain nor rivers flow

We couldn't stay
We were not each others truth
We were close but very far
I'll never see your face in sunshine again

It was fresh as the ocean
It was great last summer
But we can not go back again.

We were trying
To repeat what we once had
But you left so many times
You can never go back again

We were there last summer

We will talk about it and laugh
But now it's too close, it's too close

We were fools

I know I can not do it all again

I'll cram a fist of love so deep
It makes you bleed inside
Lift you up and make you real
Am I comin through
I trip you up or make you heal
It's up to you
Hey are you with me when everything goes your way
Hey you want to be all the things you take from me
It's the one time, it's the one time, it's the one time
Let me crawl inside your head for just a little while
You know it makes me feel like a dirty child
I know, I know I'm talkin bout me 
I'm fucked inside
Hey are you with me when everything goes your way
Hey you want to be all the things you take from me

Peteco Carabajal,"Sentado solo en un banco en la ciudad
Con tu mirada recordando el litoral
Tu suerte quiso estar partida, mitad verdad, mitad mentira
Como esperanza de los pobres prometida

Andando solo bajo la llovizna gris
Fingiendo duro que tu vida fue de aquí
¿Porque cambiaste un mar de gente por donde gobierna la flor?
Mira que al río nunca le falto el color

Carito suelta tu pena
Se haga diamante tu lagrima entre mis cuerdas
Carito suelta tu piedra
Para volar como el zorzal en primavera

En Buenos Aires los zapatos son modernos
Pero no lucen como en la plaza de un pueblo
Deja que tu luz, chiquitita, le hable en secreto a la canción
Para que te ilumine un poco mas el sol

Cualquier semilla cuando es planta quiere ver la
Misma estrella de aquel atardecer
Que la salvo del pico agudo, refugiándola en lo oscuro
De la gaviota arrasadora de los surcos

Carito yo soy tu amigo
Me ofrezco árbol para tu nido
Carito suelta tu canto que el abanico
En mi acordeón lo esta esperando

",Canción Para Carito,
Peteco Carabajal,"Lo decides, hoy te vas
Tus maletas listas ya
Te despides ya de mí
Con un nudo en la garganta sonreí
Pues se va mi corazón
Mi alma entera en este adiós 
Por no atreverme a confesarte
Y no demostrarte
Que al marcharte sufro yo

Y si me hubiera atrevido
Hacer a un lado mi orgullo
Decirte que te amo y me aterra pensar
Que mañana al despertar
No tendré a quien amar no, no podré vivir sin ti
Recordando que en un tiempo fui feliz
Tú serás lo más grande que he tenido en esta vida
Y hoy me dejas y te vas de mí

Y si me hubiera atrevido
Hacer a un lado mi orgullo
Decirte que te amo y me aterra pensar

One Union shall unite us forever proud and free
No tyrant shall defeat us, no nation strike us down
All men who toil shall greet us the whole wide world around.

My brothers are all others forever hand in hand
Where chimes the bell of freedom there is my native land
My brother's fears are my fears yellow white or brown
My brother's tears are my tears the whole wide world around.

When I read the things she wrote
She said, we miss you girl
We love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

It's hard to tell the state I'm in
Where I'm going, where I've been
But there's a dream I've been following so long
If mama knew the things I've done
She'd forgive them everyone
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Can't remember when I ate
it's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right
I'd be with them all tonight
But I'm still five hundred miles away from home

Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Lord, I'm still five hundred miles away from home",Five Hundred Miles,1964
Peter & Gordon,"All in the merry month of May
When the green buds they were swelling,
William Green on his death-bed lay
For the love of Barbara Allen.

He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying ""Love, there is a call for you 
If your name is Barbara Allen.""

She was very slowly getting up
And very slowly going, 
The only words she said to him
Were ""Young man I think you're dying.""

""Don't you remember the other day
When you were in town a-drinking,
You drank a health to the ladies all around
And slighted Barbara Allen?""

""O yes, I remember the other day
When I was in town a-drinking,
I drank a health to the ladies all around,
But my love to Barbara Allen.""

He turned his pale face to the wall
And death was in him dwelling;
""Adieu, adieu, to my friends all,
Be kind to Barbara Allen.""

When she got in two miles of town
She heard the death bells ringing:
They rang so clear, as if to say 
""Hard-hearted Barbara Allen!""

So she looked east and she looked west
And saw the cold corpse coming,
She says ""Come round you nice young man
And let me look upon you.""

The more she looked the more she grieved
Until she burst out crying
""Perhaps I could have saved that young man's life
Who now is here a-lying.""

""O Mother, O Mother, come make my bed
O make it both soft and narrow,
For sweet William died to-day 
And I will die to-morrow.""

""O Father, O Father, come dig my grave
O dig it deep and narrow,
For sweet William died in love
And I will die in sorrow.""

Sweet William was buried in the old church tomb,
Barbara Allen was buried in the yard;
Out of William's heart grew a red rose,
Out of Barbara Allen's grew a brier.

They grew and grew to the old church tower
And they could not grow any higher;
And at the end tied a true lover's knot
And the rose wrapped around the brier.",Barbara Allen,1964
Peter & Gordon,"Hear the lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds to blue to fly
The midnight train is a-winding low
I'm so lonesome I could cry

I've never seen a night so long
When time keeps crawling by
The moon is gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry

Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown?
Like me he's lost his will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And yes I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry",I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,1966

All you gotta do is wiggle your little hand

I'm a smiling happy face when you want me to
Even make you happy when you're feeling blue",I'm Your Puppet,1967
Peter & Gordon,"I don't want to see you again.
I hear that love is planned,
How can I understand,
When someone says to me,

""I don't want to see you again.""?
Why do I cry at night?
Something wrong could be right.
I hear you say to me,

""I don't want to see you again.""
As you turned your back to me,
You hid the light of day.

Peter & Gordon,"Long ago in days of old
There lived a knight who
Wasn't quite as bold
As a knight should be

He rode an old grey mare called Bess
Searchin' for a damsel in distress
Just to see if he
Could set her free

See the knight in rusty armour ride
To her aid
Trusty sword is hanging at his side
With a rusty blade

Up the tower steps he sneaked
But as he moved
His rusty armour squeaked
Such a mournful note

And all the sentries at their posts
Thought it must have been the castle ghost
They jumped for their lives
In the moat

So the knight in rusty armour won
His fair maid
Had no need to draw his trusty sword
With a rusty blade

As he bent to kiss his bride
He found that he was
Rusted up inside
In his battle dress
And I can't guess

How they still got married
And had twins
They came in tins
Every suit of armour ever made
Has a kink

She made a ride that caused a scene
In the town

Hangin' down around her knees

Prayin' for a little breeze
Her long blonde hair
Falling down across her arms
Hiding all the lady's charms

She found fame and made her name
A Hollywood director came into town
And said to her
""How'd you like to be a star?""
""You're a girl that could go far""

Gave her pretty head a shake

Doesn't need it long anymore

You can give me so much love it seems untrue,
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree,
And then when you've heard him see if you agree,
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you,
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise,
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through,

It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one,
When other lovers are gone we'll live on,
We'll live on.

I chose to settle down
I chose to take a wife

That I never thought I would

You don't have to answer
I see it in your eyes
Maybe it was better left unsaid

But this is pure and simple
And you must realize
That it's comin' from my heart
And not my head

I love you, I honestly love you

I'm not trying to make
You feel uncomfortable
I'm not trying to make you anything at all

But this feeling doesn't come along everyday
And you shouldn't blow the chance
When you've got the chance to say

I love you, I honestly love you

If we both were born
In another place in time
This moment might be ending in a kiss

But there you are with yours
And here I am with mine
So I guess we'll just be leaving it at this

When we know we''ll only cry
We''re gonna be lonely

Someone along the way
I forgot you had your own hopes and dreams
I never meant to make you weak
But I was too blind to see that I''ve been hurting you
How I made you blue
Now guilt is killing me

Peter Andre,"Thinkin back to the time when I was so into you
I thought that I knew it all
My perseption of love
Well it was something to do
But I didn't expect the thought
I understand your fellings of doubt
I know I must have let you down
But I wonder would you be around
If I loved you the right way
Loved you the right way
I would have put that smile upon your face
Loved you the right way
Never thought that id thank you for the hert and the pain
And the changes you put me through
I guess I needed to look at my intensions again
I didn't give enough to you
My mind has never been so clear
And I feel my happiness is near
But I wonder if you'd still be here if I loved you the right way

'Cause you diserve the right way
I should have put that smile upon your face
I should have kept you in my warm embrace
Loved you the right way
Sometimes love is so mistaken
Simple values put aside
Mind love is just a ride
When its over no one seems to care
If I ever find myself with someone new
I'll remember what I learnt from you
Yeah
And I will love her the right way
Love her the right way
I will put that smile on her face
I will keep her warm in my embrace
I will love her baby
Make each day a better day
Never gonna sacrifice a mean
I will love her the right way
I'm gonna love her baby
I'm gonna love her baby",The Right Way [Radio Edit],2004

But how can love go through pain

Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-arity
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby til I don't want to see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger

Ain't that peculiar
Peculiar as can be
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity

I cried so much just like a child that's lost its home
Maybe baby you think these tears I cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears

Now ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes",Ain't That Peculiar,1996
Peter Bardens,"In violation of a thought a long long time ago
Impressive reasons fill the caverns of my mind
No celebration for the people that I didn't know
Connected even though there's nothing left to find

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my inspiration help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees
I've shed away my tears
And lost my destiny
I sit beneath the sun
My hands held to the sky
I cannot ask a question
But still I wonder why

Poetic justice never seems to make the world feel right
Chaotic voices in the darkness call your name
You turn away from me whenever I remind you
Of the day the sun saw through the lies exposing all the pain

There's more than I can see and there's a deeper part of me
Won't you be my inspiration help me end my desperation now

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do

But still I wonder why

There's so much pain
There's so much war
There's so much hurt
I can't take no more
Won't you come and take me to another day
Take me far away

Tell me what it is I'm meant to do
I've fallen to my knees

I laugh more often now, I cry more often now,
I am more me.
