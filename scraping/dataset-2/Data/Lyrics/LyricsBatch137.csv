Détroit,"Tu viens encore chaque nuit
Visiter mon jardin enfoui
Comme une traînée d'or effilochée
Toi la douce trace hurlante

Dors mon ange de désolation
Dès que le vent aura tourné 
Nous ferons diversion
Et tu m'emmèneras

Tu sais maintenant 
De ce côté du monde, on étouffe
L'odeur du soufre et le cristal brisé 
S'incrustent au tréfonds des chairs
En direct, nos cœurs en dissection
Dans leurs paniers à ordures,
Il y aura 510 versions
Pour engraisser les porcs

Dors mon ange, dors
Dors mon ange, dors
Dors mon ange, dors
L'éternité nous appartient
Chaque seconde la contient

Dis moi, te souviens-tu des splendeurs nocturnes et des rires fous?
Et dans l'iris, plantés comme des poignards 
Des éclats de rires rien qu'à nous
Dors mon ange de désolation,
Rien ne pourra jamais nous enlever nos frissons

On mixera la voûte céleste avec le macadam
Et tu m'emmèneras",Ange de désolation,2014
Détroit,"A se changer en Roi
A hurler à  la lune
A traquer la fortune
Tout ça pour traîner son poids

Au risque de s'y plaire
Au moment de s'y croire
Sonnez les courants d'aire
Faites donner l'exutoire
Il faudrait qu'on s'élève
Au fond il a d'la classe
Ou alors qu'on prenne la sève

Comme elle vient
Encore et encore

Tu la vois la belle bleue
Des feux de l'artifice
Et tu la sens même un peu mieux
A la faveur d'une éclipse
On voit du jour au lendemain
Que ça ne s'invente pas
Instantanément comme ça
Reprendre de volée d'aussi loin

Comme elle vient
Encore et encore

Comme elle vient
Comme on peut
C'est cruel et sans fard
Ça choisit pas, merci pour eux
Comme une flèche
Comme un pieux
C'est bon pour la mémoire
Ça vous fait quoi d'être au milieu?
Hé camarade
Si les jeux sont faits
Au son des mascarades
On pourra toujours se marrer
Et tout le long des courants d'air
On voit des amoureux
Que savent encore changer leurs nerfs
En un bouquet délicieux
On en aura des saisons
Des torrides et des blêmes
Je peux encore garder ton nom
Je peux aussi dire que je l'aime",Comme elle vient,2014
Détroit,"Je peux gravir pour toi les sommets de l'ivresse
Et ramper en silence dans les tranchées de boue
Aussi longtemps que Mona Lisa peut garder son sourire de caresse

Je peux prendre les armes et les rendre au centuple
Sécher les larmes et saluer l'horizon
Et je veux te saisir sans jamais épingler le papillon

Je t'aime, mais je ne te tiens pas
Dans le creux de ma main
Dans le creux de ma main

Dans les hivers de glace et les étés de feu
Dans les jours de péril et les longues nuit de grâce
A la gloire de l'étreinte et au cul de la pensée étroite et restreinte

Il n'a y pas de méthode et rien à expliquer
Pas de techniques en vogue de calculs étriqués
Que vienne l'extase et que crèvent les pouvoirs au rabais

Je t'aime, mais tu ne me tiens pas
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main

Faire ? des alliés
Mon amour damné
Reste encore
Une lueur dans la nuée

On les connait les porcs, les cafards et délateurs
Apôtres cyniques et rampants serviteurs
Ceux qui devant donc, qui ont le sarcasme qui gicle épars encore

Que plus jamais personne ne nous oblige à vivre
En mettant dos à dos spirituels et sensuels
Et que la porte d'or s'ouvre enfin sur un ciel d'infini

Je t'aime, mais tu ne me tiens pas
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main
Dans le creux de ta main",Le  creux de ta main,2014
Détroit,"Tous les jours on retourne la scène
Juste fauve au milieu de l'arène
On ne renonce pas, on essaye,
De regarder droit dans le soleil

Et ton cœur au labour de lumière
Quand l'amour revient à la poussière
On ne se console pas, on s'enraye
Mais on regarde droit dans le soleil

À la croisée des âmes sans sommeil
L'enfer est myope autant que le ciel
On t'avait dit que tout se paye
Regarde bien droit dans le soleil

Tourne, tourne la Terre
Tout se dissout dans la lumière
L'acier et les ombres qui marchent
À tes cotés

Dans le parfum des nuits sans pareil
Et l'éclat des corps qui s'émerveillent
Ses lèvres avaient un goût de miel
On regardait droit dans le soleil

Les serments se dispersent dans l'air
Et les mots qui retombent à l'envers
On ne sait plus comment ça s’épelle
Regarder droit dans le soleil

Tourne, tourne la Terre
Tout se dissout dans la lumière
L'acier et les ombres qui marchent
À tes cotés

Assiégé par le chant des sirènes
Sentinelle au milieu de la plaine
Le tranchant de l'œil en éveil
Pour regarder droit dans le soleil.",Droit dans le soleil,2014
Détroit,"C'est comme la fin du siècle
On aura tout compris
Même les shérifs ceux qu'on achète
On les distingues mal des bandits

On a tout eu
Ce fut un siècle formidable
Quelques malentendus seulement
Des histoires, des histoires
Garde les yeux ouverts
Que tout y passe au moins
Chéri, donne pour la paix
Car moi je veux que tout aille bien

C'est comme ces fumées rouge-oranges
Des rubans qui s'étranglent
Autour de mon cou c'est étrange
On pourrait brûler
Ah avaler
Le grand déversoir des images cyniques
A boire à  plein tube
Cathodique
Attendez-moi

J'avais envie de venir aussi
Mais voyez-vous ça va trop vite
N'allez pas si vite
Mon vieux numéro
Y'avait les drapeaux du grand soir
Y'en avait des rouges, y'en avait des noirs
Aussi loin
Que je me souvienne, loin
Quand les missiles montaient tout droit

Au ciel
Nous on veut de la vie
Longtemps, longtemps, longtemps,
Longtemps
Longtemps, longtemps, longtemps
Il y a qu'on nous prépare
A une énième révolution
D'ordre

Spectaculaire
Venez voir
Des réseaux résolus
A câbler l'infini,
Et l'univers",Fin de siècle,2014
Détroit,"Quand la nuit s'étend, elle se laisse tomber au hasard
Elle enveloppe et elle sape les carcasses atroces
Et si tu peux te perdre du côté du fleuve
Il te calmera jusqu'à ce que tu ne puisses plus respirer

Comme elle est belle la ville et ses lumières seulement pour les fous
Celui qui veut, il la découpe en tableaux
Là c'est l'heure ou le silence balance sur les eaux du fleuve
Le rythme des horloges qui pourrissent

Y a là-bas cette fille qui enfle son souffle et ses jupes
Ouvertes comme des corolles en suspens
Plus elle danse, plus elle flambe, plus il l'aime, lui, comme il sent
Que no se puede, la Vida no vale nada.",Le  fleuve,2014
Détroit,"Come here my love
Right beside me
Oh I yearn for you to be 
Endlessly burning near me 
The everlasting seconds of twilight
Surround us briefly
And the rift between two worlds
Increases dangerously

Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes

Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes

You're far away
Then my night becomes your day
It's getting harder to recall
If we're still leading the same fight
Sometimes I wonder
Where are you

My intuition varies
Am I or am I not alone
You just say you're always with me
But how can I stop the fantasy
When it's on ?

Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes

Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes

Who could think that you could save me with just a glimpse
So deeply carved in my mind
(and it begs the question)
What about you
Or is it only me ?

Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes 

Amid the whirlwind and commotion
I find myself losing control
The ground has shattered into pieces
But then I remember
That soothing glimmer in your eyes",Glimmer In Your Eyes,2014
Détroit,"Combien de temps déjà
Combien de temps passé dans ce tunnel sous le coup de sang
Pas éternel
Éternellement enfoui derrière la porte close
Et la vitre sans tain
La peau de quartz verre

Il ne fait jamais nuit
Sous ce jour de néon
Mais l'aiguille en surgit
Sous les paupières closes

Parfois la porte s'ouvre
Pour aller faire tourner ton fantôme sur lui-même
Sous un ciel barbelé
Quartier de sol glacé de haute sécurité
Et ce soir les chiens ninjas
Hurleront de ce sol

Je sais qu'il faut se taire
Au loin le tonnerre gronde
Éradiqué du Monde
évincé de la Terre

Cherche ton horizon
Entre les cloisons

Le rythme carcéral passe par la tuyauterie
Un dialogue de misère pourrait dire qu'on est en vie
Ou bien qu'on fait comme si
Et qu'on sait que ça n'a plus ni le moindre sens
Ni la moindre importance

Qui de ma tête ou de mon cœur va
Imploser comme une étoile
Quel débris ou quel morceau de moi
D'abord, te rejoindra, te rejoindra

Cherche ton horizon
Entre les cloisons

Au dehors le spectacle abjecte continue
Et tous les doigts pointés en déluge de papier
Envahissent les avenues
Et tentent de boucher les pores de nos peaux
Prière pour que jamais ils n'y arrivent tout à fait

Cherche ton horizon
Traverse les cloisons",Horizon,2014
Détroit,"Au bistrot comme toujours
il y a de beaux discours
Au poteau les pourris, les corrompus aussi

Allez danse avec Johnny

Se rappellent de la France

De l'ordre, des jeux, de l'essence

Un autre jour en France
Des prières pour l'audience

Toujours un peu plus

Détroit,"I can see you're young an pretty
I know it would be so easy
Any way dark lady I feel lazy
Those afternoons are confused
I don't think that you really choose
There's even one more reason to feel lazy

While you go away
While you go away
While you go away
While you go away

I could die but I could lie
I can't deal with what's in your mind
Anyway, I'm tired and I feel lazy
You know we're both lost in maze
You're misarable, I'm so dazed
Don't you think you should feel

Suddently lazy
Lazy

Détroit,"Lolita nie en bloc elle navigue au loin
Sous les cils à cent lieues de se douter que
Les silences et la jalousie la guettent
Elle oublie la liste et l'allonge
Encore elle veut s'isoler
Et alors elle s'absorbe dans la contemplation
De ses pieds

Un ange passe
Un ange passe

Et puis son doigt décrit dans l'air
Des étoiles ou bien des éclairs
Elle ignore si superbement
Les sentiments les aléas de l'amour
Elle s'avance vers la fenêtre
Abandonnée lascive et elle
Couvre le ciel de mille signes étranges et inconnus de tous

Un ange passe
Un ange passe

Un ange passe
Un ange passe

Désolé Lola je n'ai pas su déchiffrer le sens secret
De tes gestes lents aérés
Simulacres ou magie futile
A moins que le vide et l'ennui

Et si cette bulle pleine de rien
Voulait se crever enfin

Un ange passe
Un ange passe",Lolita nie en bloc,2014
Détroit,"Ça m'amuse que tu sois ma muse
Dis moi si ça t'amuse aussi
Ou bien si tu refuses
Le fluide ne s'use que si l'on en abuse
Et si ça m'use parfois ma muse
Tellement ça fuse de toute parts
D'antennes en satellites 
Ou pylônes au hasard
Je ne regrette pas
Mais

Ne le répète jamais à personne
Et surtout garde ça pour nous, alone
Les braises incandescentes sont encore
Sous la cendre froide
Autrement dit, ""Sois toujours
Au rendez-vous""

Ça m'inspire chaque fois que je respire
Ton essence complice, qui goutte à goutte
S'immisce en moi
Que s'éloigne le pire, que s'effacent les frontières
Que s'affinent les contrastes et s'encrent nos mystères 
Les nerfs se changent en air 
Flottant autour des météores
Et la petite musique se glisse
Entre les interstices
Mais

Ne le répète jamais à personne
Et surtout garde ça pour nous, alone
Les braises incandescentes sont encore
Sous la cendre froide
Autrement dit, ""Sois toujours
Au rendez-vous""

Ça m'amuse que tu sois ma muse
Ça colle des ailes à mes labiales
Ôte à mes mots la muselière
Impose des lettres capitales

Alors veux tu que je te dise
Je prends ce que tu donneras
La pierre est précieuse et magique
Maintenant je sais que tu es là

Détroit,"Here I am, God knows I'm stranded in our times
Suffocated, a champion in his prime
Call me a computer illiterate
Label me, non existent, null and void

Humble flowers stifled in our glorious backyard
Scurrying lovely little big brothers recording my life
Tamed children under the latest spell
Nice and pretty, better them than me

Detroit,"Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then, one fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
You know, she couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock 'n 'roll

Despite all the imputations
You know, you could just go out
And dance to a rock 'n' roll station

A beautiful dream.

y'all dudes is geeks, y'all really don't influence the streets
The streets influence the slang that you fluently speak
Confusin to me, tryna be somethin your not
When them slugs pop you the one duckin them shots
I go hard like them youngins that be huggin the block
I go hard like Humphrey wit a glove and a glock
I'm somethin ya not, quite frankly you could love it or not
Certified number one nigga up in your spot

A'yo remember Candy? White too dope camry
Big booty wit the small panties
Used to smuggle yay' for the homie Randy
Got the plushed out crib off the water in Miami
She almost had me, I was gone off the fatty
In love wit the way she called me daddy
Had she, known about the city where I'm from
And I ain't goin home til my bankrole's done
Motherfucker's think pimpins for fun
I ain't done til my greenery's weighin a ton
And we could smoke big weed, just lay in the sun
Hellafied when we ride, weed makin me buzz
Let's hit the room right after the club
That's what I'm here for

One egg short of the omelet
Simon says, shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
And tell him catch up like mayonnaise, um
I'm the sickest nigga doin' it
Bet that baby
These other niggas dough I'm wet crack baby, yes
Get back get back boy this a set back
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon, and get my howl on
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm on that dry kush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet 
Or put some money on your head
Life ain't cheap
You're better off dead
If you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door don't get a key
You outside lookin' in, so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me

Detroit Sam,"Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river

Go ahead man, I ain't hatin', go ahead, yo

I'm the dopest rapper in the Gospel Rap industry
I kill more white rappers than snipers
I'm the one they call to get the crowd hyper

Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile

I question why you rhymin'?
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use him as a jewel well then your crown?
And you clout your time will tell

In life he must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
See, the ministry begins the minute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life
You hear in the pages of his very word?

'Cause if not face his rage
You ain't understandin' he demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to Hip Hop can't be found in his commandments

'Cause she's been waitin' all night to rape me

Here I come rubbin' on your girl's clit and on her bum
Oops, look what I found, a nice little wonder bra
She must be young, 'cause I barely get on her rum
Next we turn the hips
So I can keep on rubbin' 'em
Broke a hole in her butt while I'm suckin' on her titties
That's fun, 'cause I can do all three at once
Bust a nut, let it drip, drip from her tongue
Slut, I just gave you anal, you still licked it up

It's time to find me some more girl in the club
I like 'em black, I like 'em white
I like 'em young
I like 'em tall, I like 'em short, they got junk
She's got an ass that goes like a dump truck

I like boys and girls and rockstars
Even virgins wanna come into my snack bar.
Don't hate me because I fucked your favorite band.
Beer bottle in my pussy, let's do a keg stand (bing).
And let me show you how to sit on that dick.
America's next top model, click click.
I'm the ringleader girls follow my trends.
Got hannah montana doing anal with my friends.
Pull my hair, scratch my back, beat me like rihanna.
I love ass to mouth and black cock like obama, what?
We showed you how to turn off the lights
So give me some fucking twilight neck bites.

In the back sittin' v.i.p, that's right.
And you're still waiting outside with a girl, mad.
Because I got into the front line, with a gun.
Yeah it's all fun till your laid out with your brains out
And you end up on the other side of the club.
With your face down.
While my whole club bangs out of control.
It's out of this world.
The way you shake them hips make me like ""damn girl"".
The way them lips taste make me think damn sure
That your sucking dick straight from the men's bathroom.
A little drip drip because you suck a dick quick.
It's awesome, bitch, then you realize ""oh shit! ""
Took that shit out,

California, stand up, and go on, put your hands up.
I'm sipping on whatever, so she can look better.
I don't want a problem, so I bought the condoms.
Truth is in the house, she must be in some luck.
I've seen her at the club, and heard she wants to fuck.
I'm gangster like white walls, sitting on a regal.
I hear no, I see no, I speak no evil.
Rock your boat, baby I'm the coolest skipper.
Live up in this hospital, ain't nobody sicker.
Balling, baby, my truth speak for itself.

I like the smiles on your bitch and that's a fact
I put some miles on your bitch and send her ass back

They love me because I'm famous, and haters hate that I made it.

Let me get in your mercedes, I know you got a friend or two, maybe.
I hope she ain't think we're dating.

I'm heroin, I'm like ecstasy.
All these girls want sex from me.
Blowing up my phone, always texting me.
All they want to do is get next to me.
I'm schizo, I'm loco.
They're mad because I'm rolling solo.
I'm rich trying to get that mo-dough.
And in the bed these girls say I'm a mofo.

Deuce,"Never was a killer, 
But I spilled enough blood 
Never thought I'd be the one, 
To sweep your fuckin' ashes underneath my rug 
People come, 
And people go 
But I ain't people 
So tell your people when they see me 
They gonna feel the evil 
You missed the past, 
Off them city lights, 
And make it last 
Now you're sayin' ""rest in peace"", 
Packing all your bags 
Say goodbye, say goodbye, 
But save your last dance 
Take your last glance at me, 
Now it's your chance! 

[Chorus: x2]
(If you died) 
Goodbye, goodbye, 
Everything will be alright 
Goodbye, goodbye, 
I promise I'll be by your side 
Goodbye, goodbye, 
Rest in peace alone, 
I wouldn't put a fuckin' flower on your gravestone 
(If you died) 

I used to be the boy, 
The only boy my momma had 
Now I'm sitting in this house, 
Underneath my past 
Cleaning out, where we used to drink and laugh 
Thinking what had happened, 
How it happened, 
How I didn't see the past 
Seemed like it all happened all too fast, 
Thinkin' sound was my mask, 
I was caught up, lost in the mask 
Now it's dark, 
And now it's black 
I missed the contrast, 
You say it's black and white, 
Black and white my ass! 
And in these moments, 
I've been wrong 
These moments seem so long, 
Ticking on the clock, 
Till the moments gone 
And I don't wanna go back 
Relapse the day, 
Collapse the faze, 
While I'm looking down the drain 

[Chorus: x2] 

See my conscience don't work no more, 
It don't hurt no more 
And it don't hurt to see you lying, 
It don't work no more 
So when I'm saying 'stay away' 
Realize I ain't fuckin' playing 
Younger, like my younger days, 
May be hungry but I'm crazed 
Raised by criminal ways, 
Hear the chandelier break 
It ain't no mistake, 
I'm waitin' on Nolana's grave 
And can't get pictures from my veins 
Ain't no fucking me for Jane 
Naked for my brothers rein, 
On my arm, you'll see the same 
And if I never see your face, 
I will always feel the same 
Divide me from the wrongs 
So when I'm gone, 
My spirit will live on 
Let my lyrics show you God!

Click boom, now he's on the fuckin news

Now who's the king of these rap acts? American Bad ass
They say he's a class act, no wonder he's jabbed at
That's why they put me up in lights and I rap back
And have these critics wanna mimic my crack ass
He ain't no cinic but he knows where your dad's at
They ain't gonna finish til' they send you to Bagdhad
And minute by minute they goin' pull you right in it
You go' end up at clinics because they put you on xanax
but don't you worry I'm back ya Deuce is back with a black hat
cape and a black cat baby I'm the new Batman
You know only sarah can grab that
I dont need no groupies trying to grab at my pants
hoping that im gonna go back and tax that
I aint endin' up in no place with no bad rash.
How come I get laughed at by media trash bags,
Just because I'm white and I sing like I'm half black

Now you see my life and it looks so pretty looks so pretty
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad
Try and take my pride we both know that's silly know that's silly.
You want what you can't have and you know that's too damn bad.

Soon as my voice's touch's or even get's close to a track
it's rat-a-tat-tat-tat I'm droppin' bomb's on they asses
burn you up in the ashes ya I'm back to my old tactics,
rappin to slay faggots and rappers who aint have what it take's
so I straight jack 'em, Slap em' I aint laughin',
this is where it gets tragic homie you aint matchin' me or my ryhmes
half black half white rapper tryna' downgrade my skills
tellin everyone I'm wack, shit what about your habbit?

Whateva' you thinkin' won't stop this supa' star,
This world is mine to rape, fuck it like stupid groupie broads
Use a magnum extra-large but I'd ooh rather do it raw,
These pussy rappin' faggots sissy bastards really turn me on
And I'm gonna stick it to 'em, man my dick is gettin' hard,
Fuck 'em all and I'm a prove it while I do it like its my job
If it is I stick my dick up in this biz to get it off,

Just to trick 'em like I'm fickle and its possible I'm fluff,
But my dick is quick to switch the brick and give it to 'em rough
I'm a sick and twisted son of a bitch, no disrespect to mom,

Everyone knows I'm on fire, shit,
Its the reason why these white kids buy this
Theres no more Undead, its Nine lives,
This punk-ass better go home or retire, with his mama
'cause its already to late to stop what I did
It hurts when I rip this mic' up, slap you upside
And call you 'my bitch' if you can't play the game fucker
Better stand outside it
You ain't never gonna have no fame again,
Both you and your boyfriend in bed
Look at these faggots, how I beat them with
Just the touch of a pen
I could' a smacked you hard but I tapped you bitch
And wrote this song instead, like I said in story of a snitch,
We are not best friends

You tried to push my ass off the edge, but I got Nine lives homey,

You could go and ask God, even he wants you dead
I'll put you into shame every time that my pen hits the paper
Mista Mista I'm the new Docta Davis, who tries to rap, but can't even sing
The only time he sounds good is when he's spreadin' his rumors
Fillin' up his beer gutt with the last of his Cooler's
Yeah Right, Dumb Man, don't you ever compare me to you
I'm the next Dre, you're that dude who can (?)
And now you're chokin' 'cause your career is over for you
I fuckin' smoked you, both you, don't you got something

Hello? Dr. Drew says he don't like me
If he's got a problem with my penis, he can bite me

You think I'ma sit here lying Fuck that
I ain't gonna let no psychologist pump back in my city nine milly milly
Singin' with me
I got the truth and the spirit, you can try to hear me
There's a certain magic when I spit and only few can match it,
'Cause I'm right above the ceiling, it's a normal habit
That's why these people say I killed their fake God (?)
So take up all these feelings, so when you need me
Just say, ""How you doin'?""
I don't need that other crap about how u grew up
And You can take the other route and just say ""Wow you Blew up ""
But behind my back, you're sayin', ""How the fuck did he do it""

Yo, some may view me as a villain,
They treat me like a felon
So music's like a weapon
My mind is like my senses
I know when they pretend shit
Acting like it's friendship
Kiss my fucking necklace
Ask Joe hes my motherfucking witness
In every single line I spit I spit like I'm 2pac and shit
But yeah, I'm still rocking it, still walking it

Toss God a bone every once in a while, have a Coke and a smile

I question why you rhymin'?
Is ministry in mind and does God direct your timin'?
Or do you even put it in to put it out? What you about?
Do you use him as a jewel well then your crown?
And you clout your time will tell

In life he must prevail, a living example is needed to rap it well
See, the ministry begins the minute you step up in from the stage
Is your character the essence of the life
You hear in the pages of his very word?

'Cause if not face his rage
You ain't understandin' he demands a higher standard
Stayin' true to Hip Hop can't be found in his commandments
Take notice because the atmosphere is about to get tense

Wanna find relatin' truth to, some gone take it offense
Young cats, heed the message of this elder emcee
Who got responsibility to let you know what kind of abilities to key?
But it seems that some of y'all ain't caught the vision as we

This is a message to you rap infants
Showin' faces in the places where we blessin' at
Tryin' to battle, got respect for your skills
But skill alone don't get you props, it takes integrity

All money ain't good money, this i know
But i still love hood money, it gets my dough
And as a youngster, that nigga went through so much church
That still turned out fucked up, i did so much dirt
Told to bang the neighbourhood, i put in so much work
Did a whole lot of time, caused mom so much hurt
On everythang, that boy wasn't done on purpose
Who knew that all my darkness was really gon' surface
I was stuck on that bullshit jus runnin' the streets
Without some type of beef, the week wasn't complete
Its like a nigga felt better after dumpin this heat
On feet, just to see the body slumped in the seat
Its like a whole 'nother rush to me, bussin' was sweet
Now im smarter, im all about something to eat
Im on the road spend 30 days a month in the suite
But im still gon' hustle and cheat, Lets Go Now!

I first cast tickets to perfection, me and Ben got a connection (yeah)
That's why i bring the Benz out to impress him (yeah)
Caught in my zone, all alone, homes rattlin' my bones
Cuz he yappin' off his lips and if i hit him i be wrong
Cuz he ain't never gon' be shit, i done work so hard
But i will make you a corn of the cob, you be performin for God
Either that or rob you on your boulevard
Bet you never thought for a second niggas would pull your cards
I don't know about y'all star, cuz my nigga gone
H.P tatted on me so his memory lives on
Engagin in drama without your llama
There'll be funeral arrangements for your momma

You can't even talk to those that supposedly know you
Some of the levels that these people'll go to, for crumbs
Damn tell me, is this what that dough do?
That's when you find yourself talkin to Pro Two
There's not to many people who ever can walk in Loc shoes
Its good as hell that my heart contains
I explain, so many different parts of pain
Im clean, but still some marks remain
From the past, when that crushed weed sparks to brang
The cash made some people start to change
I feel hate when i pulled up and parked the range
Ya damn right i got rich, but my heart the same
And practice makes perfect with the harder aim
You ain't really got the heart to bang
You ain't start to hang, till you find out I cought the chain..

Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?
[verse 1 - Frost]
Time, sits through the hour glass, through night and day
and I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
and if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit (yeah)
I've seen the manifestations of the street
so why can't I confess what I see on a drumbeat
like just last night (yo what happened)
I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
one of them was quick to pull a knife
he stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
in prison at the age of 21 (yeah)
living on death row cause he couldn't let go
caught in the web of violence (damn)

I want to hold you just one more time

Don't look back I want to remember you just like this

And say goodbye

I've got ties and so do you

That outer space is overrated and too 
About all the problems on this earth we should 
Worry now to solve them later 
And so he’s brooding and alluding on a perfect design 
He thinks that working on behalf of himself is a crime 
He flushes out by the water, a view so divine 
He’s the architect of his own fate, a man in his prime

Fell madly in love with a couple of beautiful ears
It's only a variation
Had long and boring conversations about nothing
Talked so much, I bored myself to death
And the more I talk, the more I turn into a vegetable

I wasn't suffering no odd decease

It never made me wonder or even think
Just merely tapping tapping on my instinct
It left me there but I wasn't left to choose.

It haphazardly just sucks you in,
Makes you do stuff you never thought you'd do

One night it drove me to despair

It doesn't lose it just let's you win
With a little bit of luck you don't come out too bruised.

So much energy I couldn't spend
It would have fucked me over if I hadn't cut it loose. YEAH.

we were kicking ass we didn't fight it.
She never once suspected, that she had it, coming soon.

all my life I've only loved the one.
I was raised with compassion and they said
I was loved for the loving that I spread

In smithereens
Your kingdom
Has gone down my friend
Camelot
In washed out jeans
Your staying power
Has come to an end

The sweetest stroke
Went up in smoke
And love's a joke
Or a spaceship
Or a plant
Or a tubezipper
It's what you want it to be

It must have crossed your mind
You run a little behind
With all schemes and programs
You have 'em built in
Need a small device to screw it out
And unlearn the craft
You been drilled in

(It's too late, you are now becoming) NATURE

Backdated trip
Backfired whip
You bite your lip
But do what you want

And then a shoulder to cry
Makes your eyes run dry
Stop-start nature
I wish you all you wish for
And when I walk I will stumble no more
It's a new beginning
It's a new dawn

And all the magic you missed
And all the days you squandered
And all the nights you passed out
Countless are the nights you wandered

It's as good as you can handle
It's as good
It's what you want it to be

It must have crossed your mind
You run a little behind
Stop-start nature
I wish you all you wish for
And if I run I will hurry no more
It's a new beginning
It's a new....

Here comes, here comes the night train

Making a point in conversations
That I'll never hold
Protect myself from the rumours
That I will never be told
Choking on beauty
I usually don't even see
I'm living life through someone else
Looking at me

Here comes, here comes the night train

Now all the evil thing I done
And all the harm I ever did
Stand right before me
Eyes wide open
Where were they hidden?
I'm gonna rip it up
Bring it down
Send it to hell
Somebody teach me something new
Somebody as guilty as me
Can break this spell

Here comes, here comes the night train

(Make it stop, oh I can't make it stop it's on again)

Get up
Put up
Open your eyes
Let the black blooded vein
Come to your brain
Angels round here don't sing
They have a curse upon me
The shame
The lovers
The tricks
The blessings
The rebound
The future
Is used
It feels like you used it up
I look at you
I pity you
I dream of you
What are you?
Drop a name
Leave it there
Bruise a heart
Leave it there
Pay the entrance
Leave it there

Shouldn't be this
Shouldn't be that

That outer space is overrated and too 
About all the problems on this earth we should 
Worry now to solve them later

He thinks that working on behalf of himself is a crime 
He flushes out by the water, a view so divine 
He’s the architect of his own fate, a man in his prime

God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you 

Will it say the love you feel for me, will it say
That you will be by my side 
To see me through
Until my life is through 

Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I 
I am glad at least in my life I found someone 
That may not be here forever to see me through

But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

Cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I 
In my mind we can conquer the world 
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I",You and I,
Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin,"[Chorus]
The night is like a lovely tune, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
How white the ever constant moon, 
Take care my foolish heart, 

There's a line between love and fascination, 
That's hard to see on an evening such as this,
For they both give the very same sensation,
When you're lost in the magic of a kiss.

Your lips are much too close to mine, 
Beware my foolish heart, 
But should our eager lips combine, 
Then let the fire start, 

For this time it isn't fascination, 
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart, 
It's love, this time it's love, 
My foolish heart! 

[Chorus]",My Foolish Heart,2007
Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin,"Too late now to forget your smile 
The way we cling when we danced awhile 
Too late now to forget and go on to someone new 

Too late now to forget your voice 
The way one word makes my heart rejoice 
Too late now to imagine myself away from you 

All the things we've done together 
I relive when we're apart 
All the tender fun together 
Stays on in my heart 

How could I ever close the door 
And be the same as I was before? 
Darling, no, no I can't anymore 
It's too late now 

All the things we have done together 
I relive when we're apart 
All the tender fun together 
Stays on in my heart 

How could I ever close the door 
And be the same as I was before? 
Darling, no, no I can't anymore 
It's too late now 

Too late now",Too Late Now,2007
Deutschland Sucht den Superstar,"We believe the dream comes true
Everything we tried to do
It wasn't easy all the time

We never felt like this before
But we love it more and more

Every day and every night

We had joy and we had pain
Come on let us start again

Music is what we're living for

We have a dream - music is our life
We have a hope - music will survive
We'll take the chance - we had it all
We feel like heroes - we're standing tall

We, all had the greatest time
Hearts were beating, and we felt fine
May I dream, my dream with you

Oh I, I was sometimes so alone
Couldn't make it on my own
But my friends, they're helping me

We cried tears and we had fun
And we're singing our song

Music is what we're living for

We have a dream - music is our life
We have a hope - music will survive
We'll take the chance - we had it all
We feel like heroes - we're standing tall

We have a dream - music is our life
We have a hope - music will survive
We'll take a chance - we had it all

We have a hope - music will survive
We'll take the chance - we had it all
We feel like heroes - we're standing tall",We Have a Dream,2003
Deutschland Sucht den Superstar,"If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

All the things
That we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now girl I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothing
To break up our happy home
Don't get so excited
When I come home
A little late at night
'Cause we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

If you don't know me by now
You will never never never know me

We've all got our
Own funny moods
I've got mine,
Woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me like I trust in you
As long as we've been together
It should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye

If you don't know me by now
You will never
Never never know me",If You Don't Know Me by Now [*],2007
Deutschland Sucht den Superstar,"I'm not quite sure what I want you to do
So why don't you just stand there
And look at me like I'm fucking insane
I'm your Einstein on acid
Your superman, if you will
If you would, I think you could do a lot worse than me

My t's are dotted and my eyes are crossed
Somewhat funny, somewhat bitter, somewhat lost
I make more sense than your steady one hand clapping
Thinking daisies but I'm pushing up little black roses

Dropped off my common sense
On four mile road
Bad to the marrow
And sour to the bone
Salty like an ocean
I know you want to swim
I think you're wonderful
You're wonderful, you're wonderful

Feeling rather silly, talking's such a chore
I know you want out, I know, I'm such a whore
But I can make you giggle
And do that funny little thing you do
Sleeping with the dogs was never this good

You're not so sure about me
I can tell
But you know me better than anyone
And I'm just lame
You're so great, you know
A total shooting star
I think you're wonderful
You're wonderful, you're wonderful",Wonderful,2008

Hit the club with the homies, leave with three chicks
Please don't step on my Louis', I'm a be pissed
On some G shit flyer than a G6
Yeah, my whole crew is gettin' paid now
Busload of honnies', I need a grayhound
Haters swing from my nuts, I need a playground
Shawties love my voice, I got a great sound
Live good, is tatted on my fingers
I'm searchin' models and R&B singers
I got an actress and she don't even act right
You can use my pick-a-ring as a flashlight

[Chorus]

I'm ready, oh yeah I'm hot right now
Limousines, champagne in my lifestyle
Plus yo girl let me poke like an eye-gouge
Hop in European wheels every time we ride out
Got a change car and money at the hideout
Bet I shine if it's cloudy or it's bright out
It's easy to get breezies all in my house
I got something to alleviate your dry mouth
I'm good like my credit, you know I keep it A1
Made another hit for the radio station
Two chains to compliment my Rolex
Haters so stale, oh well, we so fresh

[Chorus]

Check it off, and then I bring the dough back in
Flashing lights, I'm taking pictures like Kodak film
I'm takin' trips, different stripper different city
You sayin' goodbye girl, I'm sayin' hello kitty
My girl's got nice toes, I gotta keep 'em pretty
My friends go so hard, so I keep 'em with me
Warm like a chimney, bring it back like a Frisbee
In the bed, I'm bustin' hard like a semi
Automatic, signed, sealed, delivered
Baby I'm yours turn you out like a pivot
I'm good, awesome, naughty fantastic
Gotta stay fly, I'm A1, it's a habit

Avoidin' the P's, steady tryin' to hit it (hit it)

Equivalent to no other, relevant to recover
Sell that shit to your mother

You beat it like Ike Turner, I swang it like A-Rod
Up-and-comin' rappers better keep they fuckin' day job
Cause I'm the best so they got me mistooken
So clock in and watch this lyrical ass whoopin
Cause they got flows that make hoes sleepy like slow jams
My shit rocks! (Cocaine!) Like Lindsay Lohan
Listen to Luda in the Cadillac Broug-ham
Try to turn me down and your niggaz like ""NO, MAN! ""

Ughhhh, I'll plug jumper cables to the bridge (Bay area!)
Put your lights back in this bitch (bitch)
West Coast representative from the label they call Sick Wid It
The best that ever lived it and spit it
And fucked around and got away with it (got away with it)
Ughh, ever since the '80s I've been paved with it, overlooked and underrated
Gotta keep it real with y'all, I can't fake it (I can't fake it)
Ughh, I be off-beat then I'm on-beat
Then I'm off-beat then I'm on-beat and my style is so unique
I gotta have one teeth in my mouth and sweep a broad up off her feet (feet)
Took her down on the couch before I had a chance to speak (speak)
Skeeted all in her mouth and then we went for round three (three)

Come and run away with me
Now would you throw it all away for me
I need to know that, need to know that
It’s not over

Cause you were the boy
Daddy told to stay away from me

One day I’m gonna love you, too
But for now I’m running oh,
I’m running south, south, south!

You say you better have a way back home
But I know they won’t forget my name back home
Cause they know I’m running oh, I’m running south!

Can you see it on my face, small town girl, never knew my place
So I got first and lined for the race,
People telling me to let your dreams go to waste, waste, waste, waste
But what are dreams if you never sleep?
Now my dreams are life, and this life is sweet
Trippin’ in the lights, a piece of the pie
I think I need a slice, slice, slice, slice

How can I be lost in the dark?
I thought I was walking on stars,
And even if I wanted took a stop
I can’t go back home, cause I came this far,
So can you see it on my face, man?
Are you amazed, the way I make magic in a wasteland

I'm takin' trips, different stripper different city

My girl's got nice toes, I gotta keep 'em pretty
My friends go so hard, so I keep 'em with me
Warm like a chimney, bring it back like a Frisbee
In the bed, I'm bustin' hard like a semi

And I remember you turnin' out the lights all i ever saw was the red in your eyes.
No big surprise. Happened nearly every night your own flesh & blood.
I did wonder why.

I remember not knowing what to say & how calm you had remained your child still born with no name.
I remember the never ending summer rain.

It was at this precise moment that he saw her. Her walk was soft and delicate, with a thaumaturgical touch that only a rabbiÃ¯Â¿Â½s daughter could have. Before their eyes had even met, her luminous lips had already lured him in. Salvation winked with the promise of a Bris held at pinnacle and a congregation of sage's bunny hopping and chicken dancing to Yiddish Mento. Then their eyes linked, an aeon blinked, Amharic vows were scryed upon their hearts. Just to think, this could be with the frenectomy and a few words of love...

Raios de sol no céu da cidade

Brilho da lua, oh, oh, oh, noite é bem tarde
Penso em você, fico com saudade

Manhã chegando
Luzes morrendo, nesse espelho

Que é nossa cidade
Quem é você, oh, oh, oh, qual o seu nome

Conta pra mim, diz como eu te encontro
Mas deixa o destino, deixe ao acaso

Quem sabe eu te encontro
De noite no Baixo

Brilho da lua, oh, oh, oh, noite é bem tarde
Penso em você, fico com saudad

That you say to me 
Tonight I love you

Devendra Banhart,"We once had a time
Meet me at The Castro tonight
I held a rose, you held who knows
But that’s fine

And we fell in love, we fell in love
At the Jon Reed choir
And right there and then
I swore to no end
Swore to never let you go

But love’s got a way of fading away
I never saw you again
I never saw you again

Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there and will be 'til my dying day

So understand, don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry and throw my hands up to the sky

So understand, don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

I'm traveling on
I'm traveling on
I'm traveling

So understand, don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

So understand, don't waste your time
Always searching for those wasted years
Face up, make your stand

DevilDriver,"Well my name's John Lee Pettimore
Same as my daddy and his daddy before
You hardly ever saw Grandaddy down here
He only came to town about twice a year
He'd buy a hundred pounds of yeast and some copper line
Everybody knew that he made moonshine
Now the revenue man wanted Grandaddy bad
He headed up the holler with everything he had
It's before my time but I've been told
He never came back from Copperhead Road

Now Daddy ran the whiskey in a big block Dodge
Bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge
Johnson County Sheriff painted on the side
Just shot a coat of primer then he looked inside
Well him and my uncle tore that engine down
I still remember that rumblin' sound
Well the sheriff came around in the middle of the night
Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road

I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
They draft the white trash first,'round here anyway
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
And I came home with a brand new plan
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico
I plant it up the holler down Copperhead Road
Well the D.E.A.'s got a chopper in the air
I wake up screaming like I'm back over there
I learned a thing or two from ol' Charlie don't you know

One dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of red-eyed cows he saw
A plowing through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy drawl

Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry

Their shirts all soaked with sweat

But he ain't caught 'em yet
Because they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on, hear their cry

As the riders loped on by him
As he heard one call his name

From riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride

Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns

Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still

Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ

Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles

And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe

Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split

Smoke some weed smoke ya pipe fuck it 
Life if how you live it
I grab the mic while tha DJ groove it (turntable scratch noise)

Trying to make money so I can make honeys blow on mah dick
I go on a quick mission to find some kil'
Ain't no big deal, just hop in the Seville
Mah homey put me down quarter pound for a bill
Wake up in the morning and I have weed still and I chill
With the brothers sipping coffee
Too old to be listenin' into what you say so hoe get off me 
You're born in this world by ya self and you die alone
So as long as ya grown ya might as well gone and just

Do what the fuck you want to do (Go ahead and just)
Say what the fuck you want to say

What did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you 
So do what tha fuck you want to do

Now everybody's got elders and you should respect um
They been through similar shit but then again you can't let um
Put they hands on ya life like a remote control
Have you traveling down the same bumpy tore up road
Now close friends and relatives they should be constantly by ya side
And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get a ticket might as well enjoy tha ride and just

And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And the dollar you earn is the doller you spend
Go get something for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin 
Is it a sin? I don't (don't) know
What X and O's in this game
Trying to survive, trying to get high, trying to get by and stay alive
So (Do it till ya satisfied) Not just a lil bit 
But wait until ya eighty and start saying what you could of did

Say what you want hoe ya grown

But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

[Chorus]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

[Chorus]

[Devin]
Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

[Chorus]

[Tela]
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases

When I finally realized couldn't believe it
I couldn't, even swallow
Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so I'd be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in
That's when the snoopin' and shit it would begin
Where you at?
Where you going?
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a hello or I miss you
Or the renaissance how does it do?
Suspicious ones go few
Can stress out your brain
In weighs on your mane
And helps you peep game I thought it was me
But then I could it see

It was you
Its you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end

I couldn't take it
But the spell of love
I couldn't shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else
It was your lover
You gave me up
And managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turn to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doin' love
Get it? these things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
Its never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doin' so much to try to pin me
Goin' through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seekin'
Well it seem I'm gettin' close
That I'm reachin'
And I was thinkin' I had no reason
Callin' you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?
We'll make a mends if you admit it
We can ascend if your committed
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes for many days
Sweet love can decay from you

Its you
At the end of it all it was you
And at the end
It was you
At the end of it all it was you

Baby was a virgin.. that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Something to go by and bitches know why

You stayin' with that trick, layin' with that trick
All your paper off playin' with that trick
At first, all you want to do is [fuck] with the trick
Years pass by, now you stuck with the trick
Fighting more and more now you're fed up with the trick
But you knew that was a [ho] when you hooked up with the trick
But you trusted the[bitch] 'cause you lust for the [bitch]
(This line was too edited for me to typed out)
Now she around this [motherfucka] pregnant and [shit]
But a child to a [nigga] this seem nothin' but a lick
The next thing you know the [bitch] got you in court
Tryin' to get your paper calling it child support
Takin' half of your [shit] talkin' bout a divorce
If you don't know the game, well here's the crash course
They say ""You live with the [bitch] so common law marry.""

I got a letter from the government the other day
I open and read it, said ""[Fuck] UGK.
We've been watching your success ever since[niggas] dropped
We would've spoke a long time, but we thought you would've flopped
Man, two [niggas] got some [heat], you graduated to mainstream status
From being two broke[niggas] from off the cut, growing up in a town
Where's population 50,000, only 3 high schools, but 8 sets of low-income housing
Look, when you two did 'Too Hard To Swallow' We Thought it was a fluke
When you boys came 'Super Tight' we played it cool hand luke
'Ridin Dirty' went gold with no video we gave a break
But this MTV award nomination [shit] just took the cake
So read this letter real good and take it as a warning
We'll be watching you when you asleep and when you wake up in the morning
The people that you running with and everything you do
Sincerely Yours, Sign, You know [motherfucking] who."" Ain't that a bitch?

Just when you thought that [ho] was especially for you
You put all your trust in the [bitch] and guess what she do?
Around two in the mornin' that [ho] gone
Then she come with some different clothes on
I guess the [bitch] is so fine that you pay it no mind
You asked her where you been she said ""with one of her friends"" that [ho] lying
Her [pussy] is a gold mine, well that how she feels
She can get a few thangs for exchange for cheap thrills
The price of [pussy] is turning women into [whores]
And just because they give you some that [pussy] ain't yours
So I don't trip on it, but I'll stab if I can
Then wipe off my weapon, then turn into the traveling man
Like this [bitch] Ruby Tuesday, Friday I'd had to slap the [ho]

After being monitored by secret service agents for two years 
Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his 
literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution 
Degrade women  influence gambling  promote and teach violence and more importantly 
Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community 
Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped 

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission 
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision 
They claim we threats to society 
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet 
For the bullshit they done to me 
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me 
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that 
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat 
So why you tryin kick some dust up 
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups 
And we were always considered evil 
Now they tryin to bust our only code of communicating with our people 
Lets peep the game from a different angle 
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled 
So why you criticize me 
For the shit that you see on your tv 
That rates worse than PG 
Just bring your ass to where they got me 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga don't believe that song 
That nigga's wrong 
Gangstas don't live that long 

So now they tryin separation 
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation 
Tappin into our conversation 
Saying the message that they give 
Bring forth or premeditation 
So David's got a silver mag 
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad 
David Duke's got a shotgun 
So why you get upset cause I got one 
A tisket a tasket 
A nigga got his ass kicked 
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket 
An open and sgut situation 
Cop gets got, the want to blame it on my occupation 
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me 
Because the shit that I be sayin ain't worse than no western money 
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]

You best to free your mine 
Before I free my nine 
And stop fuckin with the void in pop 
Or feel my hot rocks 
Bang, bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black 
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act 
I'll attack and make you vomit 
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad 
Do he got a brother, I'm it now 
I'm the illest 
want to kill this house nigga Don Cornelius

Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face 
But i bust two times to the gut

Devin,"Yeah
This goes out to whom it may concern
But anyway
Check it out

Sittin in the next room talkin softly on the telephone
Makin plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a hoe
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peek it, loc, here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think ehm, Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m. with this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin with my dick
And I'm constantly askin myself, like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know - damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin, illin, riffin, trippin, she gave my face a smack
Now she's got a busted lip and says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin
Hey yo baby, apologize, but now I realize, hm, I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin at the crib by my goddamn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin my back tryin to suck my own dick

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin on
Everytime I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin in my pants, grabbin my nuts like a fuckin squirrel
So what was I to do, me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe, I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak, we would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We gots to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin was funny, so she came home early
And all that moanin and groanin, I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up walkin round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspected there was somethin up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me, she never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin and shit when she left at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months and when she call all she do is talk cold to me

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy",Fa Sho,2002

A hard lesson to learn, now I'm just finna turn
This curb and go buy some herb and try to wet my worm
With some bitch who don't even know my muthafuckin' name
It's a shame, shame, shame

It's a shame when you're left out
And you're runnin' all over town
Am I to blame, am I the only one
To pick myself up after fallin' down
When I try, tryin' so hard
To keep my feet on solid ground
So many people comin'into my life with bullshit in my ear
Steadily irkin' me, won't you stop workin' me

Why (why) do the seasons change (seasons change)
Why (why why) do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way

Get up and get high
A sweet to the head, my eyes redder than fire
I'm gettin' blowed, lettin' smoke go right out the screen do'
People walkin' by, ""Hey D, have you seen...?"" No
I'm by myself and alone
And if it's bullshit I gotta listen to, man, gone
Don't even like to go but when I show at a club
I be lookin' for pussy, seldom searchin' for love
But I fucked up again and I went once mo'
Wasn't tryin' to find a bitch but stumbled upon a hoe
So me and this bitch who didn't even know me
Left the curb so she can serve me, wanted to show me
A nice quiet private place no one would know
I rolled somethin' to smoke, she had somethin' to blow
But then them laws, though, they had us fucked in the game
Charged the bitch for prostitution, charged me for the caine
It's a shame

The things that'll make you laugh
Can be the same things that make you cry (cry)
Those things that'll make you tell the truth
Can make you lie, make you lie, lie, lie, lie
Can make you cry, cry, cry, cry",It's a Shame,2002
Devin,"We need to change our ways
Doin' the same thing we did yesterday
Making beats, getting high
Chasing freaks, feeling fine
Its just the same old shit
But I think we ain't gone quit
Makin' a rhyme, climbing the hill
Staying alive, just tryin' ta live

It's a constant struggle, but brothers gotta keep climbing
People be thinking this shit is simple and simon
Lookin' at my wrist to see the position that I'm in
Kinda clothes I'm wearing, the type of car that I'm drivin'
I been strivin'
With damn near nothing to fight with
Flashlight, nightstick, ain't no blowin' up right quick
Type shit, I just write shit, hopin' it might hit
So I can make a living, but there some who don't like it
But I.. I really don't give a motherfuck 
A nigga's tryin' to get another buck
The legal way that people say what they want em 
But I'm gonna, smoking drinkin' fuck with these freaks
Til I find one life with mona
On a mission 
Every day wishin' and prayin'
can't be kidding and playing
Fast break missing the laying
So what you saying?

Man we need to make these beats, fuck these freaks, fire these sweets

Constantly asking me to change my ways
But the way I'm acting now is the way I'm acting since the first day
But the sumas to Vics smoke blunts significant others man
Ya'll can't stop the jump up for pound with these brothers
It's a rough long climb up the hill to the top
Giving it all that we got 
As we proceed to wreck shop
And it's the same shit, ain't shit changed since 94'
You see the scorn left the scene
And paid the circle back to let you know
Gotta get my paper bro
If I can't I'ma let it do
We coming back for mo, and kicking the hinges off your door.
(kickin the hinges off your door)
And life is so lunt slunt
Reality hits bluntly
Amongst all these issues we grind, cause the rents due monthly
But everything you do is certain consequences
I know there is more than this is a Piz and he's three dimensions
I'm just trying to hold it down and maintain my existence
Lets put something down right here and we can do it with persistence
I'm knowing its real cause I can feel it in the distance (talk to me)
Man listen
Its like old folks that get settle in their ways
And it pays for one to be wise these days
Not afraid
Smoke one is my typical habitual ritual 
That let this music and these words give you a visual
Come Now!

Now I'm just tryin to gain green
(I'm doing the same thing)
Them hoes don't want to see me live
(They all wishing to change thing)
All doing some strange things
But leemee(?) Rico I know 
My baby mama keep them crooked police booking my dough
Looking for dough
(What you got?)
Nothing but beer, plus I got these fucking lyrics I wrote
You mean them niggaz fucking with you by flows
You make em count by zeros
(Aint they some hoes?)
Hell yeh!
I know, all up in a nigga shit
Fuckin with your women get, with it
Come on my nigga, ya'll stay committed
Spit it
If you ain't got a nigga get it
Flip it
Stay the same dog, never quit it
Dig it, Dig it

I busted two nuts already now you waiting for number three
You ask me what will it take to get me hard again

You'd rather have it on your skin you wanna rub it in
Move your tongue like that once more girl I'm bout to nut again
Fuck your friends in your business ask me why I call everyday

Devin,"I think it was Friday night, I met her at the club
Apple Martini-ed up, smokin bud with my thugs
Then yo yo, there she was, très bon booty ( *French* )
Like Beyoncé no fiancé, let's keep in touch
I wanted to beat it up, cause she was a superbad
I mean with all that ass, same night hit it that fast
We at her mega pad, still diggin like a sav'
We poppin x tabs, the head was extra lav'
But this her baby dad and he don't live with her
And at his grandma's pad they left the kids with her
So that explains the pictures I see of this nigga
She says she's low on scrilla, she wanted gifts for her
So she can get her nails done and get her weave fixed
And I can't stand no nappy hair bitch
And so I break off bread, nothin but pocket change
She blew my socks again and then I hopped in the Range
And then she kept on askin for bread, like everyday
""My children need some aspirine, I got some bills to day""
Now what am I to say, cause Yuk, he love the kids
Puffy sell millions, but Yuk, he love the kids
So I broke off bread, I did it for the kids
Never trust a bitch, never think Yuk a trick
I got the slut dismissed, she got the dismissal
I ain't fuckin with you, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Time after time, rhyme after rhyme
I look around, some hoe after mine
But I'm just steady on the low, steady 'bout my flow
Why try to keep a hoe steady when they be steady wantin mo'?
I don't want no hoe all on my back, all up in my sack
Before I burn one, at every corner that I turn on
Hoe, get a life ? boppin' all night like you a nigga
Need to be at home with yo damn children
Like that shit was cool, well ain't shit cool
About your children missin school
Because you done cut a fool at the club last night
And you ain't ? six
Ran into a couple of ballers cappin like you broke them tricks
But them tricks make cheese, they pop bottles for fun
And you'll fuck one just to say you fucked one
How dumb can one get, didn't even break bread to get with you
And walkin round like you the fuckin shit, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Bitch, you get rotated through every crew like a tire from BF Goodridge
Cause you 21 now, what, you actin like a good bitch?
I'm tryin to get my nigga sucked cause he from outta town
You just suck his dick while I weigh out the pounds and then you out
What you mean you don't know, don't you need a little bread?
You can feed a starvin child for just a little bit of head
You suck a broke nigga dick but won't suck a rich nigga
He a white boy, little man, limp dick nigga
Three minutes and you gone, then I hit you at your home
Give you a little for your pocket, now your weekend is on
I don't understand, huh? Then why the fuck I'm talkin?
Matter fact I'm wastin time, huh, bitch, get to walkin
You try to help a rat bitch, she'll diss you on some wack shit
You weigh 125, how you still lookin fat, bitch?
Save them cheap ( ? ) yeah, I'm tryin to diss you
You a broke-ass, think-you-bad bitch and you got too many issues

You got too many issues

The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y, let's have some fun
S-s-y, that's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y

I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the snapple, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books
Blowin' up her beeper ringin' her phone off the hook
Ball players they spit money, rappers they spit time
All a while they both clamin' that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise
We ask her, who pussy is this look her right in her eyes
She said this pussy's yours daddy, tell 'em nothin' but lies
They didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

[Chorus]

I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfuckin' clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be givin' mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why'all chumps be coppin' them furs, and all that
Feining for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysittin', and these balls need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought his girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this niggas back
He busted her guess what, he still took the bitch back
3 things niggas love, money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft in love
Now take it from a player whose done all the above
Niggas it's the lesbian, R&B thug

[Chorus]
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, that gotta have the best ride
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U, I see you

The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.
The U is for uterus, down deep in the middle.
SS is so slippery when I go up inside.
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.
See I got my first shot when I was bout seven.
Her father called my house he said,
""I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's eleven and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed.""
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
""No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!""
Then I was suspended three day, taken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin' at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin' hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of y'all.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels.
Cuz it's

[Chorus]

Niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh
See it don't matter who you are
Where ya from, in this life
At some point, you're gonna wanna
Get you some, yes you will, oooo, uuuh",P***y,2002
Devin,"I chose to live this life, I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz

Niggaz trippin' and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up, even to a total stranger?
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them

Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pussy but not me, motherfuckah
I move quick with my pool stick, slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly

But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it

And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose
Pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line but with that I gotta bring the pain

Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done
When it comes to your pride and your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, 'cause I gots me a rep to protect

Now I mights be known for this and maybe recognized for that
But they be high beamin' me and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be

'Cause through seconds, minutes, hours, days
Weeks, months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin' freaks, blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be, pimp life that's the life I chose for me

I be stickin' this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz
Niggaz trippin', I chose to live the pimp life

Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I can't help it, can't stay witchu girl
'Cause I can't tell if it's official or just another ritual

It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin' for me to get a hoe
I know it sounds pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a PFL 'til I'm a old nigga

'Cause I never spend my life with groupies or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin' to make it
If you spendin' all his money, take it bitch, you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me

I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose
To live the pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live this life
Pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

People ask me question 'bout this
People ask me question 'bout that, say what?
I'm a handsome John motherfucker
Independent of the nasty ass cuts

Gipp, still runnin' down in the wood, Gipp, still ridin' out like vogues
Gipp, still cruise hundred spokes, straight from the 80's ladies
Grew up in nuttin' but dem Grady babies

Pimpin' the game since ninety-six
Can't sell a big ol' pimp no box of bricks

Gettin' money out the sexual industries
At the same, tryin' to get our slice

Raggedy-ass bitches
That bitch ain't no good

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up

[ CHORUS: Devin ]
Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine
Only your mother could love you
Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime

[ VERSE 2: Devin ]
You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up
I guess fuckin with me just wouldn't keep your rep up
I used to think about you when I'd go sleep, even dream
Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love

[ CHORUS ]

Break it down

[ Devin ]
I can't do nothin for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin for ya

Aight, check this out

[ VERSE 3: Tela ]
Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - ""Help me homie""
See, I can give a fuck about your loss cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle
You black-hearted bitch, you are full of lies
So like go on and suck Young Tela and die

",Only Your Mother,2003
Devin,"Man, yo this comin' from you

You're like, what's ya name ma 
Should've run from her 
The girl's (Poisonous!) 
You made a bad move 
She's from a bad crew 
They're all (Poisonous!) 

[Chorus: x2] 
She ain't the one to trust 
She'll treat your heart like Toys are Us 
She's dangerous to touch 
Stay away she's poisonous (Poisonous!) 

Some chick in the club you can't trust 
Front like they fans only out for your buck 
Front like they don't have a man and such 
You start holdin' hands, that's when the van pulls up 
It's tight situations like this 
You know the risk, roll the dice, hit or miss 
She feelin me? Well, she got different motives 
A candy shell to cover up the poison 
I don't have to pretend 
You know the type to fuck around with a mans best friend 
You know the type out to do you wrong 'cause you don't spend 
Enough time or enough bread (Poisonous!) 
It's the chicks that I let on the bus 
I took one in the back, the other stole my stuff (damn) 
It's the season of the vict', that night I got picked 
I'm telling you now, they're dangerous to touch (Poisonous!) 

[Chorus] 

She's poisonous, can cause serious harm 
Just one touch, play with your heart 
Like she was in Toys are Us, ignore your trust 
She's poisonous (Poisonous!) 

You thinkin' its love but that's lust 
You feelin' like she's a drug with that touch 
She breaks hearts 'cause her heart got crushed 
And loves cash, but she loves credit cards as much 
She like the creole, for real, maybe Puerto Rico 
No self-esteem, but fronts the biggest ego 
Never knew her father, her mother used to drink though 
Her step-father had a peep show through every keyhole 
Sweet and wholesome, he stole her innocence 
Now he's up in foursome, and she's the venomous 
Hates men, and dates them to rape them 
For payback, to pay bills she breaks them 
Catch her at the bar, Vanilla Coke and stoleys 
Now she throwin' bait, reelin' them in slowly 
She wants celebrities, 'cause she can hustle that 
A cat from the Mavs of the Cav's double back 
They threw a couple back, they had a couple laughs 
He was in trouble when he offered her a bubble bath 
He didn't strap up, she 'bout to make him splash 
Plan B was the get the hat up out the trash 
And get the turkey baster, she's thinking tall paper 
She cracked a smile when he told her that he'd call her later 
She's gonna hit the lotto, she wants them all to pay her

Devin,"It was a cool afternoon the first day of school
Everybody wonderin' whose the new dude
With the Kangol sneakers with the wide shoe strangs
Wonderin' where he from and how he do thangs

His eyes stayed red but he kept his mind clear
The brothers knew he wasn't from no where round here
And the girls kept whisperin' in each others ear
It seems they didn't care about the smell of the beer

They was all on his thing a couple of 'em tried to grab it
Takin' their chances didn't know of his bad habits
A two timin' cheat and quick to make up a lie
Just to be kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry

Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

The girls didn't take caution
When they was flossin' with Georgy
Porgy turn a simple party into an orgy
And just when they thought
That they was the one that he chose

He get rid of them quick and get so mo
No time for lames, it's a shame what he do to women
His mouth spit game like a snake shootin' venom
And after he hit 'em some claim that he's no good

But they stick wit' him guess the pain feel so good
Take what he can get givin' up nuttin' why
He don't think that he should pay for the puddin' pie
Takin' 'em, breakin' 'em, fakin' 'em out
He just be kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry

Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

He kept a girl on the side, he keep one at home
And those who wasn't smart they couldn't leave him alone
He'd pick one of 'em a different one, yep, each weekend undressin' 'em
Caressin' 'em, kissin' 'em, freakin' 'em

But last Friday night oh this what I heard
Outside his driveway parked a thunderbird
Georgy, couldn't hear nothin' but the headboard knockin'
Looked up and saw a strange woman in the window watchin'

Didn't know if it was Tina, Tenae or Toila
But whoever it was they had a gray revolver
They asked no question just start bustin'
George was in shock couldn't say or do nothin'

He just laid there stiff lookin' froze
And all he could think about was I got too many hoes
In the bed wit' no clothes just waitin' to die
Just for kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry

Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry

Devin Cruise,"Late nights, everyday is a motherfuckin' party
Too stoned, don't know what I did last night
Hangin' with my niggas gettin' drunk
Smokin' weed & doin' what we want
We live our lives
And ain't no one gon' bring us down
Staying out, sleeping when we can
'Cause we don't stop
Going hard, wake up in the morning
Do it all again!
Roll up the Marley, let's get it started
Life of a party!
Let's live for today, we might not be here tomorrow
And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
'Cause we just want more, (more)
We just want more,(more)

Every time I hear the music
I go crazy
Floating there you take me away
Higher we've ever been before
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds

Every time I hit the club
I take my money, I spend it all
Standing on the couch just showing love
Don't give a damn
Don't give a fuck
Float me and take me away
High up in the clouds, never coming down
Somewhere out the space, never on the ground
Always turning up, never turning down
Another hundred grands
As soon as I turn around
Take me up to where I wanna be
Tired as fuck, but we don't wanna sleep
Mary Jane and them paper planes
Pouring shots, you better take this drink

And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, (more)
We just want more, (more)

And if not, would it be okay if someone bought you a beer?
Let's say that someone wanted to dance
Would he have any snowball in hell of a chance
To get you out on the floor before this slow song ends?
Oh hey, I'm just asking for a friend

He ain't ever been any good at laying it all out on the line
I swear down deep, believe me girl, he's a really good guy
If you can find it in your heart just to cut him some slack
He'll be Johnny-on-the-spot here in two seconds flat
Yeah, he's holding his breath, come on give him a second with you

Oh hey
Yeah what do you say?
It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful
What man wouldn't think you were the love of his life?
He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool
Just one drink would sure mean a lot to him
Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend

Let's say this friend of mine went and messed up real bad
And he'd do anything in this world, girl, to get you back
Hey what kind of sorry would it take for a man to erase his worst mistake
And would this even begin to make a dent?

Oh hey
What do you say?
It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful
What man wouldn't think you were the love of his life?
He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool
I don't mean to ramble on like this
Hey, I'm just asking for a friend

Yeah, what if I told you he hadn't slept in weeks?
And he was standing right here in front of you instead of me
Is there any way you could ever love him again?

Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

(Devin) Had to get away, needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n

And understand you gotta let ya conscience be your guide
There'll finally come a time for ya self you must decide
Cause you only get a ticket might as well enjoy tha ride and just

[Chorus]
And there's a couple of fucked up man made rules that we should follow
But you gotta realize you just might not wake up tomorrow
And the dollar you earn is the doller you spend
Go get something for ya kids or buy a bottle of gin 
Is it a sin? I don't (don't) know
What X and O's in this game
Trying to survive, trying to get high, trying to get by and stay alive
So (Do it till ya satisfied) Not just a lil bit 
But wait until ya eighty and start saying what you could of did

But what did it all mean?
Say what you want hoe ya grown
You make decisions on your own
No one would suffer but you 
So do what the fuck you want to do

What's up? You've reached 7-6-5-0-8-6...ahh well hell you know who you

Bitch what do you want? 
Nigga what do you need?
A rock hard bone?
A dime of weed?
Whatever it is just leave the message at the tone
Or better yet, fuck it you can call me at home
At 9-8-8-1 naw I ain't gonna say all dat
Just leave a number I'll call ya back

Answering machine:
You have two messages.

(some chickens talking)
Verse 1:
Bitch what do you want?
Nigga what do you need?
A rock hard bone?
A dime of weed?
Whatever it is hoe you can hit him from a phone
But if ya don't want nothin' leave him lone he be gone
See he's known for smokin' skunk and gettin' drunk without knowin'
He through about twenty bitches and hoes and he probably fucked yours
But the Dude don't disrespect but then he takes no shit
But if your bitch is in his ride then she's gettin' some dick
He moves quick real slick never been to the pen or the forum
They got stories bout the Dude the kids bragged when they saw him
And them laws he don't bomb
That nigga just keep dippin'
Early in the morning flippin'
Coffee sippin'
don't be trippin' on niggas they see him walk in the sto'
Get him some cigarettes, cigars and a Colt 4-0
Without payin' walk out that hoe so calm and so cool
(Who's that?)
Man that's the Dude and he's a God damn fool

Hook:
Who is it?
Not too often seen in public (that's the Dude)
Who is it?
Smokin' on Sweets while he's gettin' his nuts licked (that's the Dude)

Don't come talkin'
That nothin' shit
Round the Dude
Don't play no funny games
Don't talk shit no
He'll tell you to suck a dick
He's the Dude 
Hey hey here comes the Dude

Verse 2:
Da da do dap 
Bla do blap dap
Bitches front 'em at the club they gettin' jab slapped
He don't cap
To him that bring too much attention
Keep his eyes open for premeditated lynchin'
Countin' inches on his hard dick
You might need a yard stick
He makes bitches suck it and make them niggas get off it
Don't start shit with the Dude 
You wouldn't want him to finish
Cause hoe you know it be on in a minute
You need to thank him for ya gal he made her suck a little better
He love makin' trash outta another niggas treasure
Cause bitches for dude dog, come a dime a dozen
Fuck one let one suck his dick then find another
He don't debate he concentrate on survivin'
He don't like to drive if he's been drinkin' but he'll drink while he's 
drivin'
But he's higher than a fuck, you'll never catch him sober
All his women quit him cause they got fucked over
But all the pussy he got was pussy he earned
He'll fire up a Sweet before you'll fire up yearn
Some say he's nice and friendly but the niggas no fool
He's so swift he's so smooth he's so calm he's so cool
He's the Dude

Hook
Who is it?
Who is it?

Bridge:
Hey hey hell yeah can't you tell?
The Dude been through Hell
See the smoke in the air?
Shouldn't do the shit he do but see the Dude don't care
Empty bottles of beer and empty rubbers everywhere

Verse 3:
He jam old school music in his low slightly bumpin'
Saw him last Tuesday in an old white somethin'
Half naked bitch with him with plenty of ass
He threw the duces at your boy and continued to pass
People spread rumors about him to bring him down
But if ya know him like I do you know he don't fuck around
And he clowns and he jokes and he smokes and he hangs
But don't fuck over the Dude one night he showed me a brain
No name
I ain't gonna tell you all of his biz
He's down to fight for his friends 
Die for his momma and kids
Niggas be placin' they bids tryin' to do like he do
Try to be where he's been but they get folded in two
He's the Dude

Devin the Dude,"It was a cool afternoon the first day of school
Everybody wonderin' whose the new dude
With the Kangol sneakers with the wide shoe strangs
Wonderin' where he from and how he do thangs

His eyes stayed red but he kept his mind clear
The brothers knew he wasn't from no where round here
And the girls kept whisperin' in each others ear
It seems they didn't care about the smell of the beer

They was all on his thing a couple of 'em tried to grab it
Takin' their chances didn't know of his bad habits
A two timin' cheat and quick to make up a lie
Just to be kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry

Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Georgy, Georgy
Kiss the girls and make them cry
Kiss the girls and make them cry

The girls didn't take caution
When they was flossin' with Georgy
Porgy turn a simple party into an orgy
And just when they thought
That they was the one that he chose

He get rid of them quick and get so mo
No time for lames, it's a shame what he do to women
His mouth spit game like a snake shootin' venom
And after he hit 'em some claim that he's no good

But they stick wit' him guess the pain feel so good
Take what he can get givin' up nuttin' why
He don't think that he should pay for the puddin' pie
Takin' 'em, breakin' 'em, fakin' 'em out

He kept a girl on the side, he keep one at home
And those who wasn't smart they couldn't leave him alone
He'd pick one of 'em a different one, yep, each weekend undressin' 'em
Caressin' 'em, kissin' 'em, freakin' 'em

But last Friday night oh this what I heard
Outside his driveway parked a thunderbird
Georgy, couldn't hear nothin' but the headboard knockin'
Looked up and saw a strange woman in the window watchin'

Didn't know if it was Tina, Tenae or Toila
But whoever it was they had a gray revolver
They asked no question just start bustin'
George was in shock couldn't say or do nothin'

He just laid there stiff lookin' froze
And all he could think about was I got too many hoes
In the bed wit' no clothes just waitin' to die
Just for kissin' the girls and makin' 'em cry

Devin the Dude,"(2 guys talking about Devin)

Man.  They got him in the office again, man.
Yeah, I know.  He's been in there for an hour already.
And ya know, I kinda feel bad for the guy.
Damn, what do you mean.  The fucker clocks in drunk.
Man, it's his wife and kids; that's who you need to feel sorry for.
Yeah, I know.  And ya know, what are they gonna do if he loses another job.
Fuckin' alcy.  Fuckin' pothead.
He owes me $5 anyway.

Verse 1:

On my way to the job
Drunk than a bitch
I'm late for work again
Damn, boss goin' have a fit
He said, ""This shit been going on
For just too damn long
I need to go and find some help
Or take my drunk ass home""
And I really don't want to quit
Because see then I can't sit
Up on my ass and smoke my grass from unemployment checks
And I admit, when I wake up
I hit the drank, I blow up
But in back of the job
I don't bother no one
I stay strictly to myself
Co-workers know I be blowed
So they say my production is throwed
And I'm not carrying my load
So I go, and share my problems
With my friends who be
Just as high as I
As they pass the doobie to me
Who we be, fucked up fool, drunk, blowed, bent
When it's time to pay my rent
My money's damn near spent
I know I'm fucking up my lungs
My liver ain't 'bout shit
From all the weed
And all the alcohol
But y'all, I can't quit

(2 guys talking)

Man, if it was me dog, I'd say, ""Fuck that job"".
Man, here.  Hit the weed, man.  Fuck a job, man.
Shit, I'll hit that.  Here, I'll hit it.
Shit, no weed goin' never tell you nothin' wrong.
I've been tellin' you to quit that motherfuckin' job anyways.
Yeah, that boss trippin', on my dick anyways.
Fuck that nigga.  Hell fuck yeah.
Want me to kick his ass for you?
Fuck it man.

Verse 2:

See, reefer's like a friend
Who free me from my foes
Drinking something different today
But wearing the same old clothes
I guess weed, wine, and women
Was the life that I chose
But it got hard splitting my dick
Between my wife and these hoes
So I just smoke
An ounce a day, nothing less
Spent so many damn dollars
That it don't make no fucking sense
I went to seek help
Thought I was losing my mind
The doctor walked in high
With some brew and a dime
And said, ""It's your life, nigga
Go ahead and enjoy
And whenever you need some weed, nigga
Just hollar at your boy
'Cause ain't nothing wrong with it, go on on
Take these, you need at least 3 cups in the morning""
Drinking all day
Big chiefing at night
I keep my eyes red and tight
So that my teeth can look white
And I can smell it and tell it
The weed you have ain't shit
But I'll still take a pull
And twist the cap on the bull
I can't quit

(Devin and his doctor talking)

Damn, doctor.  Is this shit gonna kill me, man?
No, no son.  No need to panic.
It's actually quite good for you.
It slows down the structure of white blood cells
And cures the flow.  It's called nature's illing leaf.
The more you smoke it the better you feel.  Take another hit.
You ain't bullshittin'.  You did good.
Would I lie to you?

Verse 3:

Just another day
Another fat sweet to get my head right
I'm sitting back, my windows cracked
I'm chilling at the red light
Minding my business
But why is this law typing my plates
I only gotta dime and ain't got time to catch no case
But still she races up to me
And stick her nose out in my car
""Hey bitch, what you looking in my car for?""
She pointed at the sweet
Still burning and said, ""Aw""
I had to think quick
Pulled out my dick
And shoved it in her jaw
But like weak times
I had to hit the gas
Collect my seeds
Clean the ash
Non-stop, evade the cops
They mad because I'm high they not
I made the block, screwed up some cop
Dipped back on the freeway
Threw my empty 40 bottle out
When I passed San Felipe
We stay blowed, fucked up, drunk, full, bent
My kids screaming Astroworld
But all my time is spent
And you can tell the way I smell
My braincells ain't shit
From all the weed and all the alcohol
But y'all, I can't quit

(2 guys talking)

That was cool, man.  Hey, can I get one of those dranks?
Naw, man.  I told you about your beer-hoggin' ass.
Nigga, go to the fuckin' store.
c'mon, man.  Can I drink with y'all, man?
I can't hear.  Goddamn, I can't hear shit.
(...?...)
Do you have a job?  Do you have a job?
Hell yeah, I gotta job motherfucker.
I just spend all my money buying weed.
Ya know, it helps me work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed
So I can work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed
So I can work longer
So I can make more money
So I can buy more weed
So I can work longer
So I can make more money

Devin the Dude,"Verse 1:
Hey motherfucker it's me again yep
The one who fucked your sister but quiet is kept
Because she burnin' but instead of cussin' out the bitch
Just didn't tell her then let her suck the puss up out my dick
Gave me some money for gas I hopped out on 59
Smokin' weed (weed)
And feelin' fine
Dick suckin' laws right behind and they look and they stare
But I got on my seat belt so I don't care
""How the fuck you doin' today Mr. Officer?
If I had the time I wouldn't mind to offer ya
A fat dime and a black nine in my shit 
But no warrants and tight insurance so you can just ride the fuck on bitch""
People always gettin' mad at me bein' like this
Drankin' alcohol keeps me peein' white piss
Parents I'm not tellin' your children to smoke ya see
Cause if they just say no it be mo fa me

Hook:
Scratching ""Mo fa me""

Verse 2:
What did you say your name was?
D-E-V-I-N 
You saw me on the news but the TV be lyin'
They got bounty hunters lookin' for me I'm wanted for theft
Women claim that I came and got they pussy and left
I'm not an old fool from the old school like My Adidas
Cause All Day I Drink And Smoke it's like I need it
On stage you can boo you can hiss real loud
But I'll just pull out my dick and take a piss in the crowd
Then I'll smile take a bow put down my mic and I'll leave
Get the money from the promoter hope it's enough for some weed
Head dead to the back with the VIP status
In a room full of Pimps tryin' to find 'em a Gladis
Gotta pick one of 'em get one of 'em stick one of 'em quick
Cause they niggas might be here they niggas might be talkin' shit
They niggas always somewhere they ain't supposed to be
Niggas can't keep up with they pussy then it's mo fa me

Verse 3:
Son said ""Daddy I don't want to go to school
Cause the teachers a freak she tittie dance on the coo
And all my friends smoke reefer 
I think it might be cheaper
If I buy a couple of pounds and sell 'em ounces and threefers""
Cause any way to come up I got to do it ch'all
I'm havin' flashbacks I'm about to stash crack in my drawers
But fuck the laws
They got my brother already they can suck my balls
Average nigga have no luck at all
But have no other choice but to take up the bet 
Tryin' the seven or eleven when I come out and pick up a check
Gotta get my shit fixed 
Hit a quick liquid
Fringe  benefit, like gettin' my dick licked 
Cause this money runnin' funny gonna break before I'm broke
And I can't be wakin' up in the mornin' nothing to smoke
So I think I'll smoke half and roll some sweets
Well I can't smoke I'm a sell it

Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hitman hit it; damn bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin about
Chicken head, chicken fed, with a dick in yo mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place

No touching and rubbing girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine

We can't be kissing and hugging girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm goin too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin
That your pussy's been tampered with
Then you show him the new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick
You be workin it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin digging through some records instead
But, tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases

So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her

Lookin' for how I see her
When I finally realized couldn't believe it
I couldn't, even swallow
Had a lump in my throat my stomach hollow
I had a notion that things were fishy
But everything was fine so I'd be pissy
But when you wasn't seeing me nights you get in
That's when the snoopin' and shit it would begin
Where you at?
Where you going?
That's what I get when I pick up the phone
Not a hello or I miss you
Or the renaissance how does it do?
Suspicious ones go few
Can stress out your brain
In weighs on your mane
And helps you peep game I thought it was me
But then I could it see

It was you

I couldn't take it
But the spell of love
I couldn't shake it
Even though I would discover
That there was somebody else
It was your lover
You gave me up
And managed to turn the tables
And all your honest words they turn to fables
The things that you would accuse me of
It seem were the things you were doin' love
Get it? these things you projected
And I don't want to be affected
But when you get in love
Its never easy love
To make decisions of
You've defected
You were doin' so much to try to pin me
Goin' through all my stuff but it was empty
Answers, that I'm seekin'
Well it seem I'm gettin' close
That I'm reachin'
And I was thinkin' I had no reason
Callin' you a culprit it was treason
And the twinkle in your eye
It was kinda not for love
And tell me why?
We'll make a mends if you admit it
We can ascend if your committed
Your heart, is it in it?
If it goes for many days
Sweet love can decay from you

Devin the Dude,"(Scarface)
Hotel, motel, deep up in a hoe's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, 'cause you be on that weak rap
""Ay, can I get some roses please?"", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the hoe she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up

(Hook - Devin)
(Nasty) I'm slippin in and out ya girl 
(Nasty) Pussy all around the world
(Nasty) Stickin my dick up in and out ya girl
(So nasty) Pussy all around the world

(Devin)
Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel

(Hook) 2x

(Too $hort)
She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin 
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with a tight cat
Gettin head in a white 'Lac, bitch

(Hook) 4x

Devin the Dude,"It was this bitch that I knew back from '86
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin' to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key
Nah hoe I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this hoe, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin' in gold
It's cold ""On The Outside Lookin' In"" (Br!)
You'd besta make yourself worthy
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their Johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch
I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on them natural
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

[Chorus]
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothe sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes sho 'nough
Shakin' that ass in the club nigga what?, Suave love

No different from the rest
She's just an ordinary hoe
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo
Make it fast, takin' cash, shakin' ass in the mix
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks
Niggas in love
Can't stay out the club
All in the hoe's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin' up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin' hay, makin' clouds, gettin' ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin' to hide side from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin' with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho' 'nough

[Chorus]

Well I be God damned, this shy ass hoe
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitches be needin' me, leavin' you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin' for is some fame
A bigger name
Look, this thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin' to trick me
So I told that hoe my name Bill Bigsly
She still hit me
Now she, killin' my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I
M-J fuckin' G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin'
They ass with no clothes like some pros, sho' 'enough

Devin the Dude,"In world news today officials agree that rapper Brad Jordan alias Scarface must be stopped 
After being monitored by secret service agents for two years 
Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his 
literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution 
Degrade women  influence gambling  promote and teach violence and more importantly 
Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community 
Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be stopped 

We got this whole motherfucker on a mission 
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision 
They claim we threats to society 
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet 
For the bullshit they done to me 
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me 
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that 
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat 
So why you tryin kick some dust up 
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups 
And we were always considered evil 
Now they tryin to bust our only code of communicating with our people 
Lets peep the game from a different angle 
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled 
So why you criticize me 
For the shit that you see on your tv 
That rates worse than PG 
Just bring your ass to where they got me 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]
Nigga don't believe that song 
That nigga's wrong 
Gangstas don't live that long 

So now they tryin separation 
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation 
Tappin into our conversation 
Saying the message that they give 
Bring forth or premeditation 
So David's got a silver mag 
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad 
David Duke's got a shotgun 
So why you get upset cause I got one 
A tisket a tasket 
A nigga got his ass kicked 
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket 
An open and sgut situation 
Cop gets got, the want to blame it on my occupation 
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me 
Because the shit that I be sayin ain't worse than no western money 
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti 
So you can feel the hand of the dead body 

[Chorus: x2]

You best to free your mine 
Before I free my nine 
And stop fuckin with the void in pop 
Or feel my hot rocks 
Bang, bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black 
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act 
I'll attack and make you vomit 
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad 
Do he got a brother, I'm it now 
I'm the illest 
want to kill this house nigga Don Cornelius 
Can you feel this? 
You punk niggas make me sick 
Suckin' on the devil's dick 
Scared of revolution

What you gonna do when the people go home
And you want to smoke weed but the reefer's all gone
And somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out the doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way
What you gonna do when ya friends go home
And you want to take a pill but ya end's all gone
Somebody had the nerve to take the herb up out my doobie ashtray
Why they do me that way

You probably don't have a big ol house on the hill
But if you did just imagine how it would feel
If your phone got disconnected, no cash, and ya gas cut off
And the gal that you had that was helping just stepped the fuck off
She took the kid, the dog, and the kitty
And everybody know you're at a low they feel pity
And what's really fucked up is now you're just normal
No more hoes, no more clothes, can't go to the show 'cause it's formal
And you wonder why why why why why
And you resort to gettin high
But damn, you can't find ya stash
And you never took the time to ask yourself

You probably don't have a lot of money
But if you did would you find it funny
If you lent, and you spent it, and you didn't invest
Or put it in the bank so we can gain some interest
You just went and copped the biggest car you could find
And a couple more just like it so your friends could follow behind
Never mind how much it costs, you copped the best weed to smoke
And for her a fur coat
You got jet skis and boats
And next thing you're broke (damn)
And the yacht that you got, it won't sail or float
You look back and try to catch someone's attention for help
You made a right at the light and they made a left and you ask yourself

Why they do me that way
Yeah
Hey hey hey
Ain't no more doobies in the tray
What you gonna do when the people go home (home home home)

This goes out to whom it may concern
But anyway
Check it out

Sittin in the next room talkin softly on the telephone
Makin plans to see ya soon when I know I'm dead wrong
Why oh why must I continue to be a hoe
When I got a fine yellow bow-legged bitch at the crizzo?
She know jizza, guess I was only out to get paid
This girl was cuttin for daddy like a Mexican with a switchblade
But anyway, peek it, loc, here's how the story went
Second week in July, I think ehm, Tuesday the 10th
Around 4 p.m. with this bitch named Kim
She wasn't all that in the face but she had her own place
I got caught up in temptation, now here's what I'm facin
The situation's thick, I'm steadily thinkin with my dick
And I'm constantly askin myself, like, should I rush this hoe?
But you know - damn, little did I know
She was my best friend's sister's cousin auntie mother niece
Up on my daddy's side, I couldn't even lie
My girl start buggin, illin, riffin, trippin, she gave my face a smack
Now she's got a busted lip and says I overreacted
Now it's her things that she's packin
Hey yo baby, apologize, but now I realize, hm, I knew exactly how she felt
That's why I'm sittin at the crib by my goddamn self
The reason why, because I had to trick
Now I'm breakin my back tryin to suck my own dick

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Okay now check it, I met this gal, she got it goin on
Everytime I see this bitch she's all up on a nigga's bone
I told the bitch I had a woman and a little girl
She's diggin in my pants, grabbin my nuts like a fuckin squirrel
So what was I to do, me and my woman had trust
But I was thinkin how many nuts I can bust
In this hoe, I hit the pussy fast, hit the pussy slow
She whipped out her tongue and licked the Jugg up his asshole
She couldn't call the crib when she wanted some cock
So she would beep and I would sneak, we would meet at the bus stop
And then I called her to my crib one day
Because my daughter was at the daycare and my gal was at the jay
We gots to hurry up and bone, my girl get home at 5:30
She knew somethin was funny, so she came home early
And all that moanin and groanin, I couldn't listen
She busted in and caught me in a 69 position

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy
When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy
You'll end up with no pussy, no pussy

Me and my gal, we been apart for a while
Yeah, I miss her kiss and I kinda miss her smile
But I'm the one who fucked up walkin round with a big head
She made me feel like I had a gold-plated dick head
But I was tryin to fuck everything that moved and breathed
She never checked or suspected there was somethin up a nigga sleeve
Yeah, my baby she trusted me, she never even cussed at me
Except that Friday night when she busted me
I found a letter on the dresser that said:
'Tell your bitches don't be leavin they panties in my bed'
And I was laughin and shit when she left at first
But in a couple of weeks that shit started to hurt
Now it's been six months and when she call all she do is talk cold to me

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy
Tryin to get some mo' pussy

When you're fuckin over yo fo-sho pussy

It's a shame, shame, shame

It's a shame when you're left out
And you're runnin' all over town
Am I to blame, am I the only one
To pick myself up after fallin' down
When I try, tryin' so hard
To keep my feet on solid ground
So many people comin'into my life with bullshit in my ear
Steadily irkin' me, won't you stop workin' me

Why (why) do the seasons change (seasons change)
Why (why why) do I feel this way
Why do I feel this way

Get up and get high
A sweet to the head, my eyes redder than fire
I'm gettin' blowed, lettin' smoke go right out the screen do'
People walkin' by, ""Hey D, have you seen...?"" No
I'm by myself and alone
And if it's bullshit I gotta listen to, man, gone
Don't even like to go but when I show at a club
I be lookin' for pussy, seldom searchin' for love
But I fucked up again and I went once mo'
Wasn't tryin' to find a bitch but stumbled upon a hoe
So me and this bitch who didn't even know me
Left the curb so she can serve me, wanted to show me
A nice quiet private place no one would know
I rolled somethin' to smoke, she had somethin' to blow
But then them laws, though, they had us fucked in the game
Charged the bitch for prostitution, charged me for the caine
It's a shame

The things that'll make you laugh
Can be the same things that make you cry (cry)
Those things that'll make you tell the truth
Can make you lie, make you lie, lie, lie, lie
Can make you cry, cry, cry, cry",It's a Shame,2002
Devin the Dude,"We need to change our ways
Doin' the same thing we did yesterday
Making beats, getting high
Chasing freaks, feeling fine
Its just the same old shit
But I think we ain't gone quit
Makin' a rhyme, climbing the hill
Staying alive, just tryin' ta live

It's a constant struggle, but brothers gotta keep climbing
People be thinking this shit is simple and simon
Lookin' at my wrist to see the position that I'm in
Kinda clothes I'm wearing, the type of car that I'm drivin'
I been strivin'
With damn near nothing to fight with
Flashlight, nightstick, ain't no blowin' up right quick
Type shit, I just write shit, hopin' it might hit
So I can make a living, but there some who don't like it
But I.. I really don't give a motherfuck 
A nigga's tryin' to get another buck
The legal way that people say what they want em 
But I'm gonna, smoking drinkin' fuck with these freaks
Til I find one life with mona
On a mission 
Every day wishin' and prayin'
can't be kidding and playing
Fast break missing the laying
So what you saying?

Man we need to make these beats, fuck these freaks, fire these sweets

Constantly asking me to change my ways
But the way I'm acting now is the way I'm acting since the first day
But the sumas to Vics smoke blunts significant others man
Ya'll can't stop the jump up for pound with these brothers
It's a rough long climb up the hill to the top
Giving it all that we got 
As we proceed to wreck shop
And it's the same shit, ain't shit changed since 94'
You see the scorn left the scene
And paid the circle back to let you know
Gotta get my paper bro
If I can't I'ma let it do
We coming back for mo, and kicking the hinges off your door.
(kickin the hinges off your door)
And life is so lunt slunt
Reality hits bluntly
Amongst all these issues we grind, cause the rents due monthly
But everything you do is certain consequences
I know there is more than this is a Piz and he's three dimensions
I'm just trying to hold it down and maintain my existence
Lets put something down right here and we can do it with persistence
I'm knowing its real cause I can feel it in the distance (talk to me)
Man listen
Its like old folks that get settle in their ways
And it pays for one to be wise these days
Not afraid
Smoke one is my typical habitual ritual 
That let this music and these words give you a visual
Come Now!

Now I'm just tryin to gain green
(I'm doing the same thing)
Them hoes don't want to see me live
(They all wishing to change thing)
All doing some strange things
But leemee(?) Rico I know 
My baby mama keep them crooked police booking my dough
Looking for dough
(What you got?)
Nothing but beer, plus I got these fucking lyrics I wrote
You mean them niggaz fucking with you by flows
You make em count by zeros
(Aint they some hoes?)
Hell yeh!
I know, all up in a nigga shit
Fuckin with your women get, with it
Come on my nigga, ya'll stay committed
Spit it
If you ain't got a nigga get it
Flip it
Stay the same dog, never quit it
Dig it, Dig it

Devin the Dude,"I think it was Friday night, I met her at the club
Apple Martini-ed up, smokin bud with my thugs
Then yo yo, there she was, très bon booty ( *French* )
Like Beyoncé no fiancé, let's keep in touch
I wanted to beat it up, cause she was a superbad
I mean with all that ass, same night hit it that fast
We at her mega pad, still diggin like a sav'
We poppin x tabs, the head was extra lav'
But this her baby dad and he don't live with her
And at his grandma's pad they left the kids with her
So that explains the pictures I see of this nigga
She says she's low on scrilla, she wanted gifts for her
So she can get her nails done and get her weave fixed
And I can't stand no nappy hair bitch
And so I break off bread, nothin but pocket change
She blew my socks again and then I hopped in the Range
And then she kept on askin for bread, like everyday
""My children need some aspirine, I got some bills to day""
Now what am I to say, cause Yuk, he love the kids
Puffy sell millions, but Yuk, he love the kids
So I broke off bread, I did it for the kids
Never trust a bitch, never think Yuk a trick
I got the slut dismissed, she got the dismissal
I ain't fuckin with you, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Time after time, rhyme after rhyme
I look around, some hoe after mine
But I'm just steady on the low, steady 'bout my flow
Why try to keep a hoe steady when they be steady wantin mo'?
I don't want no hoe all on my back, all up in my sack
Before I burn one, at every corner that I turn on
Hoe, get a life ? boppin' all night like you a nigga
Need to be at home with yo damn children
Like that shit was cool, well ain't shit cool
About your children missin school
Because you done cut a fool at the club last night
And you ain't ? six
Ran into a couple of ballers cappin like you broke them tricks
But them tricks make cheese, they pop bottles for fun
And you'll fuck one just to say you fucked one
How dumb can one get, didn't even break bread to get with you
And walkin round like you the fuckin shit, bitch, you got too many issues

You got too many issues
Here, let me get you some tissue
No, I don't mean to diss you
But you want me to give you some money, quit actin funny
Baby girl

Bitch, you get rotated through every crew like a tire from BF Goodridge
Cause you 21 now, what, you actin like a good bitch?
I'm tryin to get my nigga sucked cause he from outta town
You just suck his dick while I weigh out the pounds and then you out
What you mean you don't know, don't you need a little bread?
You can feed a starvin child for just a little bit of head
You suck a broke nigga dick but won't suck a rich nigga
He a white boy, little man, limp dick nigga
Three minutes and you gone, then I hit you at your home
Give you a little for your pocket, now your weekend is on
I don't understand, huh? Then why the fuck I'm talkin?
Matter fact I'm wastin time, huh, bitch, get to walkin
You try to help a rat bitch, she'll diss you on some wack shit
You weigh 125, how you still lookin fat, bitch?
Save them cheap ( ? ) yeah, I'm tryin to diss you
You a broke-ass, think-you-bad bitch and you got too many issues

The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y, let's have some fun
S-s-y, that's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, he cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U-S-S-Y

I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took
One sample of the snapple, and ya ass was whupped
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books
Blowin' up her beeper ringin' her phone off the hook
Ball players they spit money, rappers they spit time
All a while they both clamin' that they never spent a dime
Business guys, she would victimize
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise
We ask her, who pussy is this look her right in her eyes
She said this pussy's yours daddy, tell 'em nothin' but lies
They didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave

[Chorus]

I ain't no rapper, but I'ma say my shit
When it comes down to that motherfuckin' clit, clit, clit
Niggas are sick, sick, sick, turn on you quick, quick, quick
That's why I be givin' mami much, dick, dick, dick
Why'all chumps be coppin' them furs, and all that
Feining for this pussy, as if y'all was on crack
When it comes to the truth, I can't hold back
Y'all cats that be babysittin', and these balls need to be smacked
It's this nigga named Monroe, that I know from way back
He hit the lotto bought his girl a Cadillac
Now this bitch be creepin' behind this niggas back
He busted her guess what, he still took the bitch back
3 things niggas love, money, pussy, and drugs
Can't get one without the other 'less you soft in love
Now take it from a player whose done all the above
Niggas it's the lesbian, R&B thug

[Chorus]
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why every motherfucker in the world dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, that gotta have the best ride
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
The power of the P-U-S-S-Y
That's why niggas get they hair cuts, try to dress fly
Every baller that can afford it, they cop the best ride
For the power of the P-U, I see you

The P is for the pearl tongue that I like to tickle.
The U is for uterus, down deep in the middle.
SS is so slippery when I go up inside.
Pussy's good and if you gettin some I know you know Y.
See I got my first shot when I was bout seven.
Her father called my house he said,
""I need to talk to yo son Devin.
My daughter she's eleven and she goes to the same school that yo son goes to.
And she said today she got screwed.""
But my daddy answer the phone so no drama, and all he said was,
""No shit! Let me talk to that girl mama!""
Then I was suspended three day, taken from school.
It was like a vacation.
Niggaz lookin' at pussy at the pool in our apartments.
I started hittin' hard when I was small.
Let me recite a story lesson for all of y'all.
See pussy's like a wound it would never heal,
The more ointment you put on then the better it feels.
Cuz it's

[Chorus]

Niggas would do anything
For some pussy, hey, hey, hey, oh
See it don't matter who you are
Where ya from, in this life
At some point, you're gonna wanna
Get you some, yes you will, oooo, uuuh",P***y,2002
Devin the Dude,"I chose to live this life, I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz

Niggaz trippin' and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up, even to a total stranger?
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin' your cum on them

Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
To pay a fee for pussy but not me, motherfuckah
I move quick with my pool stick, slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly

But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
To call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it

And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, 'cause that's the life that I chose
Pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

Come talk a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin' to cross the line but with that I gotta bring the pain

Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done
When it comes to your pride and your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, 'cause I gots me a rep to protect

Now I mights be known for this and maybe recognized for that
But they be high beamin' me and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be

'Cause through seconds, minutes, hours, days
Weeks, months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin' freaks, blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be, pimp life that's the life I chose for me

I be stickin' this dick up in these hoes hoes
'Til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz
Niggaz trippin', I chose to live the pimp life

Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
'Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I can't help it, can't stay witchu girl
'Cause I can't tell if it's official or just another ritual

It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin' for me to get a hoe
I know it sounds pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a PFL 'til I'm a old nigga

'Cause I never spend my life with groupies or gold diggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin' to make it
If you spendin' all his money, take it bitch, you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin' like the snub-nosed, they pay me

I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose
To live the pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live this life
Pimp life, pimp life, I chose to live the pimp life

People ask me question 'bout this
People ask me question 'bout that, say what?
I'm a handsome John motherfucker
Independent of the nasty ass cuts

Gipp, still runnin' down in the wood, Gipp, still ridin' out like vogues
Gipp, still cruise hundred spokes, straight from the 80's ladies
Grew up in nuttin' but dem Grady babies

Pimpin' the game since ninety-six
Can't sell a big ol' pimp no box of bricks

Too Short, Bun be, Devin and Big Gipp, yo we all some pimps
Gettin' money out the sexual industries
At the same, tryin' to get our slice
Never lookin' back twice, livin' in the pimp life

Raggedy-ass bitches
That bitch ain't no good

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up

[ CHORUS: Devin ]
Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine
Only your mother could love you
Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime

[ VERSE 2: Devin ]
You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up
I guess fuckin with me just wouldn't keep your rep up
I used to think about you when I'd go sleep, even dream
Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love

[ CHORUS ]

Break it down

[ Devin ]
I can't do nothin for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin for ya

Aight, check this out

[ VERSE 3: Tela ]
Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - ""Help me homie""
See, I can give a fuck about your loss cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle
You black-hearted bitch, you are full of lies
So like go on and suck Young Tela and die

",Only Your Mother,2003
Devin the Dude,"[Pimp C]
You stayin' with that trick, layin' with that trick
All your paper off playin' with that trick
At first, all you want to do is [fuck] with the trick
Years pass by, now you stuck with the trick
Fighting more and more now you're fed up with the trick
But you knew that was a [ho] when you hooked up with the trick
But you trusted the[bitch] 'cause you lust for the [bitch]
(This line was too edited for me to typed out)
Now she around this [motherfucka] pregnant and [shit]
But a child to a [nigga] this seem nothin' but a lick
The next thing you know the [bitch] got you in court
Tryin' to get your paper calling it child support
Takin' half of your [shit] talkin' bout a divorce
If you don't know the game, well here's the crash course
They say ""You live with the [bitch] so common law marry.""
And the [bitch] got accustomed to the paper she's been having

[Chorus: Devin the Dude singing]
Ain't that a bitch? (Pimp C: Ain't that a bitch?)
Ain't that a bitch?, now ask yourself ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch?

[Bun B]
I got a letter from the government the other day
I open and read it, said ""[Fuck] UGK.
We've been watching your success ever since[niggas] dropped
We would've spoke a long time, but we thought you would've flopped
Man, two [niggas] got some [heat], you graduated to mainstream status
From being two broke[niggas] from off the cut, growing up in a town
Where's population 50,000, only 3 high schools, but 8 sets of low-income housing
Look, when you two did 'Too Hard To Swallow' We Thought it was a fluke
When you boys came 'Super Tight' we played it cool hand luke
'Ridin Dirty' went gold with no video we gave a break
But this MTV award nomination [shit] just took the cake
So read this letter real good and take it as a warning
We'll be watching you when you asleep and when you wake up in the morning
The people that you running with and everything you do
Sincerely Yours, Sign, You know [motherfucking] who."" Ain't that a bitch?

[Chorus]
[Devin the Dude]
Just when you thought that [ho] was especially for you
You put all your trust in the [bitch] and guess what she do?
Around two in the mornin' that [ho] gone
Then she come with some different clothes on
I guess the [bitch] is so fine that you pay it no mind
You asked her where you been she said ""with one of her friends"" that [ho] lying
Her [pussy] is a gold mine, well that how she feels
She can get a few thangs for exchange for cheap thrills
The price of [pussy] is turning women into [whores]
And just because they give you some that [pussy] ain't yours
So I don't trip on it, but I'll stab if I can
Then wipe off my weapon, then turn into the traveling man
Like this [bitch] Ruby Tuesday, Friday I'd had to slap the [ho]
The [bitch] got knocked up by Roscoe, and said that I'm the poppa though
In this game they got a name for this chick, who gettin' rich by lickin' [dick]

Devin the Dude,"[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
Ain't no tellin' where I might be
I got places to go and people to see
Ain't no tellin' where I'll end up
I got shows to rock and hoes to fuck
Ain't no tellin' where I might go
Coast to Coast or just next do' (door)
But, I gots to go, I gots to go
Eh, eh, (I gots to go) eh (go), eh, eh, eh (gotta go)

[Verse 1: David Banner]
Roll up on that tour bus, smokin' a blunt
Then heard a (dunn dunn dunn dunn dunn!) what yo' baby momma want?
Nothin' but good fuckin' dick suckin' train runnin'
She lickin' on my nuts, talk to her if she hear me comin'
Watchin' me go
She swallowed cum, you kissed a hoe
Tongue and lip, all
Man you really lickin' my balls
Heard you for my baby momma last night nigga, nah
But she did bring weed, no seeds, sticks all
I'm lyin' when she come over, cock lyin' in her jaw
Niggaz all up in her drawers
And that's yo' baby mother
If it makes you feel better, she's a good dick sucker (sucker)

[Chorus: Devin the Dude]

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
My Job takes me out of town on all-expense paid
Wakin' up with a hangover 2,000 miles away
It seems easy: weed, women, and wine
Four hours of sleep is all you get - now it's time
To tally hoe to the show, a yo, yo let it go
Bust through the do' (door), rag & flow and grab my hoe
And get back in the van with some titties in hand
Let her meet ya new friend, who's willing to spend
The whole night? Another flight another gig another city
Touchin' on somebody's baby momma's titties
Niggaz in the lobby wonderin' where their women are
Third floor havin' a ""Let's Become a Bitch Seminar""
Can't get attached, I got a plane to catch
I wish I could a hit that but I'll be back

[Devin the Dude talking]
Yo, (huh) ain't no tellin' where I'm a be at
But you know, out the do' (door) uh huh

[Chorus: Devin the Dude]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Yeeah, man this the king of the chillin' circuit, I'm aight, ten in it
I'm paper chasin' and rap hustlin' it ain't no synonym
My money ain't a game so I ain't worried bout winnin' it
I'm worried bout makin' it, stackin' it and spendin' it (and spendin' it)
Ain't no pretendin' it don't make the world move
Same way you can't pretend my shit don't make yo' girl groove
See, God work in myterious ways but I don't (don't)
And the devil will make a deal wit yo' ass but I won't (won't)
Now you can have the cleanest paint job on ya trucks
Six T.V.s, wood wit leather seats, stitched and tucked
The biggest chrome rims, playa, I don't give a fuck
If I holla at yo' bitch, guarantee she gettin' buck
You can yell and you can scream and you can fuss and you can fight
Like it's the worst night in yo' life, to me it's just another night
I ain't carin' bout ya drama (uh uh), or breakin' up ya home
You just a joke for the crew and material for a song, main

[Chorus: Devin the Dude]",Gots to Go,2003
Devin the Dude,"Man, yo this comin' from you

You're like, what's ya name ma 
Should've run from her 
The girl's (Poisonous!) 
You made a bad move 
She's from a bad crew 
They're all (Poisonous!) 

[Chorus: x2] 
She ain't the one to trust 
She'll treat your heart like Toys are Us 
She's dangerous to touch 
Stay away she's poisonous (Poisonous!) 

Some chick in the club you can't trust 
Front like they fans only out for your buck 
Front like they don't have a man and such 
You start holdin' hands, that's when the van pulls up 
It's tight situations like this 
You know the risk, roll the dice, hit or miss 
She feelin me? Well, she got different motives 
A candy shell to cover up the poison 
I don't have to pretend 
You know the type to fuck around with a mans best friend 
You know the type out to do you wrong 'cause you don't spend 
Enough time or enough bread (Poisonous!) 
It's the chicks that I let on the bus 
I took one in the back, the other stole my stuff (damn) 
It's the season of the vict', that night I got picked 
I'm telling you now, they're dangerous to touch (Poisonous!) 

[Chorus] 

She's poisonous, can cause serious harm 
Just one touch, play with your heart 
Like she was in Toys are Us, ignore your trust 
She's poisonous (Poisonous!) 

You thinkin' its love but that's lust 
You feelin' like she's a drug with that touch 
She breaks hearts 'cause her heart got crushed 
And loves cash, but she loves credit cards as much 
She like the creole, for real, maybe Puerto Rico 
No self-esteem, but fronts the biggest ego 
Never knew her father, her mother used to drink though 
Her step-father had a peep show through every keyhole 
Sweet and wholesome, he stole her innocence 
Now he's up in foursome, and she's the venomous 
Hates men, and dates them to rape them 
For payback, to pay bills she breaks them 
Catch her at the bar, Vanilla Coke and stoleys 
Now she throwin' bait, reelin' them in slowly 
She wants celebrities, 'cause she can hustle that 
A cat from the Mavs of the Cav's double back 
They threw a couple back, they had a couple laughs 
He was in trouble when he offered her a bubble bath 
He didn't strap up, she 'bout to make him splash 
Plan B was the get the hat up out the trash 
And get the turkey baster, she's thinking tall paper 
She cracked a smile when he told her that he'd call her later 
She's gonna hit the lotto, she wants them all to pay her 
Especially all them entertainers and ballplayers 

[Chorus]",Poisonous,2004
Devin the Dude,"(Devin) Walk up in da session wit my dick in my hand
Fat sweet in my mouth,a 24 ounce can
Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape
Give it to da DJ
My eyes are tight and shinin'cause I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will
I see it nothin' but a party ya'll, I guess I'm the host
Ain't nobody got no mo weed, it time to smoke it
Keep that beat rollin', you see everybodys holdin' their own
You know I gotta bust atleast two or three before I'm gone
But there's always one in da crowd, rappin' loud
I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) Had to get away, needed some time to chill
So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill 'cause I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n


(music)


(Devin) I gotta visit from a old friend, fresh outta county
He said came up on a lick and he was glad that he foind me
He had some niggaz wit him, full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin' gats back talkin' bout ""c'mon Dee man you ready?""
Its a house down da street, about two does down
They sell weed and they least got two whole pound
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride, we cool
Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin', ain't nobody seen shit
So lets pile up five deep in ya lac
He'll know that it is you Dee and won't think its da jack
Man you must be smokin' crack, you don't know who dat is
That nigga work for HBD been sellin' weed round here for years
So when you finish plottin and schemin' whatever you doin'
Wait fo' me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

Don't Go, No girl (don't go just yet baby)

I'm surprised you tried to compromise and not supply me with
The pleasure of touching you tenderly, at least a tit
Shit, a nipple or something, Just let me tickle it with my pinkie
And play with your, well you know, get my middle finger stankin'

(Girl: Hey don't touch that)
I was just kidding
but you was crunk at the club, now we're alone and you bullshittin
Kissin' all on my neck, squeezing all on my shit
You getting yourself all wet, simply for the funk of it
Why don't you get undressed, lay back, let me massage ya
I won't tell Timmy, if you won't tell Tosha
Everything should be Kosh-er, well you know kosher
Why let your lips hang, let 'em sing like they supposed to

(My name's Cecile)
Pass the sweet around and hush
Don't pull my third leg and I won't beat around your bush
I put 15 dollars in the tank to come and get ya
Now you ready to go and want me to wait til Wednesday to get with ya

[Chorus]
I got ta go
Where you got to go?
Don't go to soon
Where you got to go?

Another day wasted
Shoulda told you I couldn't make it
A nigga damn near masturbated
But I waited
I told myself that I would quit
Fuckin with ya, after I can tell all my friends that I hit
But now its Blue Ball Tuesday
I may be out but I'm not down
I hit the town, neighbors frown
Hearing my ultrasound
I couldn't hear my phone
But when I checked it, a message
Opened it up and read it
It was you, saying come get it
Hey, sure you ready?
I mean, you felt it before, you know its heavy
And hard; you have me 'bout to nut just thinking of you
Those titties, that ass, girl I think I love you

Devin (talking on phone):
I'll be there about 10
What you got on?
You haven't been drinking have you?
Oh yeah, you want some more?
What? What do you mean somebody at the door?
Hello?

I gotta go
Why you gotta go?
Don't Go just yet baby

Her man came home soooooon
And then she saw him walk straight into the room
She was just on the phone luckily
Talking to a strong-boned nigga like me
I, detour to the left, mashed on the gas
Dick hard, hard times, I'm mad, gave the gas another smash
But fuck it, I'll get another chance
Cause tomorrow she's gonna borrow her mother's van
And that's a whole lot of room for the boom-shaka-laka
I've been spending time, thinking on how soon I can fuck her
But seems the bitch ain't gonna get no dick somewhat like Lassie
Cause her momma's takin the van to visit her Auntie in Tallahassee

Boog, weed, sess, skunk, pine, k, reefer, dank
Sell ya boy a plump dime
Killa, herb, grass, coffee, pot
We gotta get some mo' because this O is all we got
Smokin' everyday I can't let go
Rollin' perfect Sweets, I mean perfecto
Neighbors they say they smell this shit from next do'
And they keep me outa they house because they know I'ma fiend
Last month I pawned 17 sewing machines
Took the money to my Mexican patner his names Malito
...
We go way back, we'd lay back in his crib and get drunk
He always keeps some sess, but see sometimes he get's skunk
And he calls me when he get it, cause he know I'm wit it
And he tell me that's it's good but I'll believe it when I hit it
I'll show up with a cigar and then he bring out this bong
And before we get high we start singin' this song

[Chorus]
Love the good motha
Muy bien marijuana
Love the good reefa
Cannabis sativa
Love the good motha
Muy bien marijuana
Love the good reefa
Cannabis sativa (cheeba cheeba)

Smokin' weed really ain't nothin' to brag about
Unless ya got friends like mine, look at this big bag I got
Straight from Jamaica from that nigga Naughty Dread
He got some shit with just one hit I bet yo' eyes get red
And he call his weed cali, smoke it in the chalis
""Take ya shoes off boy and try not to be careless""
We be jammin' to the reggae music feelin' every note
Both of our heads boppin' while we eatin' curried goat and he say
""Hey mon, pass that motherfucker this way mon""
I'm blowed, he blowed, we high
He got pounds of weed in the other room, knee high
And my nigga ain't greedy, he gives to the needy
He put me down with weed and I hook him up with beaties
We be trippin' off people who think weed makes you forget
But you was, uh, shit

[Chorus]

Niggas smokin' sweets, dimes, ounces to quarters
We pass the sess around in chronological order
But when ain't nobody got no weed shit seems to be hopeless
I know an old school weed smoker named Keofris
He always keep killer cause all he do is roll jokers
It's good for his cataracts and help him stay focused
He say him and a couple of his friends back in the game
They used to sing are and be the shoopdey doowop thing
They had bowl cuts they eyes tight lookin' like Chinamen
They had to switch up and change they name every now and then
Finally tried to be they self but people wouldn't accept it
Shit started gettin' strange so they say fuck it and left it
He said, ""Boy whatever ya do just keep goin'
If weed helps ya with the music keep the Sweets blowin'
One day you'll get some money, you can buy me some teeth
I want to see ya make it boy, ya kinda remind me of me
Cus I love the reefer"" Huh? What'd you say? ""Cheeba cheeba""

Wrinkled foreheads greet me, but I'm high therefore I laugh
Attendants rush me, to check my bags

They said ""hurry, 'cause we 15 minutes behind
We have one seat left and its way in the back
It shouldn't be too hard to find, go sit down.""
I said aiite bitch, but I said it kinda low

It won't no problem go towards the back I go
Had a little weed on me didn't want it to show
Some helicopter took my patna 3 months to grow
So, I slid to the rear to find my chair

Hey pretty girl is this my chair here?
The key Y) didn't even crack a smile
She smelt my black and Mild
She think I be actin wild

And she refused to move her purse
Out the little little seat freak trying to get the dude to curse
Wanted a nigga to rant and rave
Just because of my color, thinkin I can't behave

I said, ""Pardon me ma'am, excuse me miss
But there's no reason for you to be pissed
I done payed my dues, payed my bills and fees
Just want to sit by the window here while I'm feeling the breeze"" caise

Disappearing underneath on ramp
Man, I started feeling kinda wicked
Should have never bought a ticket
Put on my seat belt in case
We land in shit creek
I had to grit me teeth
But then things kinda felt in place
I couldnt wait, broke out my big bag
Put it on the tray table
Wheels start rolling, table wouldn't stay stable
Waiter walked up and said do you want a beer?
I said yeah, he got happy start doing a cheer
He gave a bag of nuts to the nigga next in line

And the big ass plane shook
I started trippin, cause everybody was flippin and dippin
And even hiding pocket books from crooks
I'm like look
I know its kinda scary, its a long way down

Come on man hold it together man come on
I don't know why you crying over her anyway
Be strong!

She gave me everything I wanted from the start
Her mind, body and heart
And I just knew the two of us would never ever part
I used to fart under the covers and she'd just laugh
She even cleaned my balls when we would take a bath
She straightened up the bed when I was still in it
Get up and fix some breakfast
The kind of gal that makes you want to leave them other heffers alone
But my bone got a mind of its own
I continued to roam while she waited by the phone
Loneliness got the best of her
She wanted to explore
Her other options that she had, oh no my baby was no whore
Just a woman with needs, a desire to be apreciated
I tried to keep her in the nest, warm and incubated
But my heart was steady gettin colder
Coming home with not enough energy to even hold her
And then it happend
One bright early morn
I turned around to give my baby a hug and she was gone

She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone

Callin' house to house
Tryin' to figure out
Where could she be
She don't get up before me
And its damn near three
Its pouring down outside, raining cats and frogs
I know pretty soon, she's coming back to the house
Damn, 3:30, 4 o clock, five
Called her at 6, something must be wrong with the ride
Eyes wide, looking outside every ten minutes
Not realizing the relationship been finished
12 pack, 8 cups of coughee, 2 cups of tea
Hurry up and peepin out the curtain forgetting to pee
Telephone ring (brring) hurry up pick it up
I thought I heard some body say
""boy, I got ya bitch, what's up""
But it wasn't
But I still almost hit the star 69 button
Ready to cuss out whoever answered the phone
But I didn't call back, to face the fact that she was gone

She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone
She was gone, gone

Like a ticket through the comb
Can't imagine another motherfucker makin her moan
Got a call on my cell
It was her, what the hell
Wonderin what kind of story you got to tell
She said, she left a note under the bed
""had to get up early be back to get a loaf of bread""

Shit, loaf of bread, why you ain't been call me
""I had a flat""
You had a flat
""yes, I had a flat""
You didn't have enough minutes on ya phone to call me
""its locked in the car""
Oh...oh well shit, you left it in the car while you was on foot
""yes""
Alrite fuck it... just come on home, I'm here man
""I'm on my way""

Hello
Hey baby its me, I took care of everything
Oh yeh, he fell for that loaf of bread bullshit, didn't he?

Devin the Dude,"Ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

When I was young I was sprung off the way women used their tongue
I couldn't nut yet but fuck that, It was still fun to look
I took Vaseline even though it was thick and rubbed it on my dick
Now I'm grown and my bone is so well known hoes wanna get it cloned

Shit, ain't nothin' wrong with you chunkin' that monkey
All up on me 'til the whole room's funky
The negative thoughts, it's time to change
Shit, you a woman, I'm a man

It's all natural and we're compatible
I'll bend you over, knock you down
Slap that ass a little bit but not to hurt you
Like after havin' a full course meal, it's the dessert
Now lay on your stomach, put a arch in your hips
And look back so I can see all four of them lips

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

I got on Superman drawers
I'm 6 years old, all in my room, all alone
I'm young, dumb, layin' the pipe
Show time, HBO, Friday night

Butt naked on the couch without no clothes
Remote control ready to bust a load
And fuck Roxanne, I want Big Ann
Tight old pants, my mother's best friend

I watch all your movies and your DVD's
I heard you're comin' out with porno CD
I want Janet Jacme to smack me
Take your bikini off, get on the bed and attack me

I love porn but niggaz be hatin'
R. Kelly ain't got nothin' on the shit I be makin'
I'm a freak, I been that way since 7
Me, Big Boi and Devin, bitch is 11

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women, think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

I like a lady but I sure love a slut
The type that like to sit on my dick and let me screw up them guts
The chick that want it doggy style while puttin' on my nuts
And when you aim up her face, shorty, don't be tryin' to duck

True Aquarian, mean I'm freaky as to fuck
Eat that coochie for an hour, after you shower cock 'em up
From the power of the orgasm your legs are lockin' up
Caught a cramp in your thigh, can't even pull your stockings up

But your spike leather collar plus stilettos lookin' tough
Now you're passed out on your stomach, seems though you had enough
Like JLo in that movie where her husband beat her up
Puss appears to be pregnant, swole and wet up

Now you need to go and get up 'fore I set up some more setup
I done caught my second wind, let's begin, lift your head up
It's the battle of the sexes, we can do this shit 'til breakfast
I don't want no mo' babies but I can give you a baby necklace

Now ever since I was a young boy
I would fall for women like you
And even now that I'm a grown man
I'm still in love with the tricks that you can do

I'm used to women, think it's nasty
That's their opinion but that ain't my point of view
Some of them need to take some lessons
And learn how to fuck like porno bitches do

Go thru my phone and choose a victim take it out on the cock (on the cock)
Ma thinking bout gripping ass thats why I hit it swift and fast
I'm a put this log on you you gon' feel it all in your calves
A gangsta so I'm raw with it I know what I'm doing
Thats why she pop up at my residence trying to see what I'm doing
She knocking if the lights on ready to get her fight on
Cause last night she had orgasms all night long
Made her feel like she was married with children
But ain't no Al and Peggy I'm strictly here to do some drilling in your man filling

(Twista! L.A.D.! Devin the Dude!)
We 'bout to do this shit like this
Yo Drama, take that shit back for 'em one time (uh-oh!)

Ha ha, cocaine in the flesh
Been in the game since Brand Nubian was spittin', reign of the tec'
I done spit lyrics for DJ Jam Master Jay and Kid Capri
Now it's DJ Drama, now you all on the dick lil' mama?
Where the fuck was you at when a nigga was on the block? (where you at?)
When the nigga was drivin' dirty Nike's with no knot (where you at?)
Before the Billboard number one spot
It was so hard to get a bitch to get down and suck on a cock
Before rockin' the Bentley and I got so popular
Thuggin' with the G.D.'s you wouldn't see me even with binoculars
Steady actin' like you ain't been ran through
Never gave a nigga no pussy now you sweatin' and talkin' 'bout you a fan too
Before the Vin houses and the trucks and Impalas
Tell me where was you at when the nigga needed a couple of dollars
I remember her off the block, now I can't fuck with lil' mama
Walk off on that hoe, I'd rather let another bitch holla

[Chorus]
Spend the rest of the life in the trap bein' grimy (oh yeah)
On the grind tryin' to stay out the county (oh)
Limit ties when I ain't had no money (oh yeah)
Got bread now, these bitches all on me
Cause underneath all the cars and clothes (cars and clothes)
The lights, the bling, and oh
Oh oh oh, diamonds and gold
Underneath all the diamonds still cold, yeah

Yeah, L.A.D., uh,
Bitches used to say ""ugh,"" now I got pull
My life like Ace, from ""Paid in Full""
Low like a turtle, my queen mad fertile
Run a marathon, same time, jumpin' hurdles
Put a broad on a plane, brick in her girdle
Why I'm still here, got my life in gear
Fuckin' a rich white bitch like Britney Spears
Runnin' in her hard like a car hit a deer
Live life no fear, boxed in like a square
Two Coronas with lime, sip my beer
My vision's so clear from the front to the rear
That's why I'm reclined in a La-Z-Boy chair
Can't see me like I'm air, but I'm there
Mean I'm here, like Ray Lewis or Steve McNair
Real Hall-of-Famer, real big gamer
Semi-automatic or a four-fifth flamer, blaow!

[Chorus]

It's a blessin' to be still in the game
Considerin' where I came from the music changed
Some would continue to hang
I'm, right where I oughta be
Whatever obstacle in the way, won't let it bother me
Grindin' since the early teens in my dirty jeans
Now I'm on the scene fulfillin' my worldly dreams
So get yours, I'll get mine in due time
We'll be able to survive some lunatic rhymes
But nowadays you gotta find different ways
To keep your pockets on fat, who got it? Where it's at?
Shit, you gotta go get it
The road you gotta hit it, the show money's splitted
Yeah, and if everybody wit it we can make somethin' happen
With the push of these buttons and some cut-cuttin' and scratchin'
I've been rappin for years, and I think I'm gonna
Sang or do anything other than slang on the corners
I'm gone

The Rain Is Fallin' And The Weather Is Cold
Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll
The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll

The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold
On The Light Cuz I Know That I Could Spin Outta Control

[Verse 1]

What part of the voyage is this?
Friendship and business don't mix
Wit anyone else its just business
Wit friends I'm personally pissed
Is this a curse or a gift?
Guess i was blessed wit my wish
Don't tell me that u feel my pain
That I sayin' its best if we switch
You take the fortune and fame
And see if its what u expected
Take the money and change
And be careful where u invest it
Just take the test and don't stress it
You get stopped by a detective
Tryna get in ya personal life
The gotta do yo best to protect it
The answer rests in a message
When I go I'll go in a blaze
But it wont be no captain savin'
Cuz where I'm goin ya saved
Tryna rain down on my parade
Till that umbrella get raised
They thinkin' that they can read me
Then they ain't knowin' my page
Tryin' to keep a smile on my face
Even at times when I engage
In business conversations
Wit people I know are snakes
If life is a piece of cake
Part of the icing is venom
Spent a lifetime tryin to bring me down
But I jus ain't gonna let em
Ya betta tell em

[Verse 2]

I'm back and forth and I'm pacing
Bein more patient than patience
Tryin to wait for the good news to show up
But im unfortunately waitin'
Gotta be group participation
If its intercourse that we making
I was unfortunately done
And she was unfortunately fakin'
Cuz the only sexual spark


Is the spark he got for the dough
They say till death do us part
But that part is where she says no
There are too many emotions
Emotions like pins and needles
Actin' like emotions are evil
Like showin love is illegal
I thought that it was a eagle
But I've seen this vulture before
He thinks this is where i stop
'Cause he sees that I'm walkin slow
But no I think you should know
That soon as I get where I go
You'll remember the fact that
I had a purpose fa'sho

[Hook]

I Hope You Know Where Your Going
I hope You Know That Today
On The Side Of The Road
You Gon See A Whole Lotta Snakes
When The Bad Weather Comes
To Rain Down On Ya Parade
Jus Raise Up Ya Umbrella
And Try To Keep Goin Straight

[Verse 3 - Devin Da Dude]

This road has many curves
Many bumps and potholes
It can even take you thru a loop if u ain't got yo
Shit togetha unpredictable weather could leave ya
Dehydrated frostbitten washed away or eitha
Ran ova by heavy traffic watch where you roam
Cuz its a challenge jus tryna make it home
But still I walk I keep my pace I keep my stride
Would hitchhike, but there's too much pride
I must find a narrow path
So I can walk and laugh out loud
Cry and sing without bein judged by the crowd
Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now
I'll jus beat my feet and get there someway somehow
And mile after mile after mile I'll smile
Keepin my head up even though rain's pourin down
And the road gets rough and the journey is long
I might get tired but I must move on

Devin the Dude,"They said no when I told them that I'd find a way to get to the top
They didn't know that eventually I'd be the one to worry about
When someone would mention me, they always tried to say I would flop
But this the sound of revenge

Yea
On the path to find out who's true
The only person you can really trust is you
And if you feel like you can't even trust you
Then you can always trust you know who
And if you don't know who you know who is
Then I feel so sorry for you
Cause that's really the only person that can judge you
Critics, people that wanna see you fail will tell you what you can't do
Shouldn't do and must do
But when you got that glow
Nobody else's words can really budge you

Revenge has always been looked upon as a sin
And sometimes you feel like you had to sin to win
Sometime it sound like :gunshot: 
Is what it coulda been
When you get to the gates of Heaven they probably wouldn't let ya in
But ya change that meanin' up and success is what it is in the end
And instead of worryin' about what shoulda, coulda, woulda been
Ya turn your head toward the future and keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Well say it again
Keep it movin'
Know what I'm sayin'?
Screw it then
Know what I'm sayin?

If you're waitin' for me to fail, your time is runnin' out on that clock

(Aight, let me do it something like this)

I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no
I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no

I don't chase bitches, I let these bitches chase me
They pop up at my shows, they know everywhere I be
Like big Snoop, we got all your CDs

And we'll do anything if you put us on your team
Well aight bitch, I sell a ho a quick dream
Then back on the road so fresh so clean
Pimps up hoes down, nigga that's the theme

And when they choose up, they get broke for everything
I ain't mad at 'em, they just wanna be seen
Flossin' witta boss a picture in the magazine
(Cheese)
The bitches all scream chasing down my limousine

And when I hit the hotel, they waiting at the wind
My down South southern bitches out in New Orleans
I can't forget my Texas bitches faded off that lean
I don't chase bitches, these bitches chase me
For my playa partner rest in peace Pimp C

I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no
I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no

It's like a 9 to 5 but I be high
I'm like the captain and my partner Curtis bout to come by
And beam me up, you don't see me much
'Cause I be in top this better believe ho when up in ya

Sluts don't get much, freaks I make 'em geek
Like dope fiends on this pipe, yep this meat
Hoes they want clothes and shit, expectin' me to unfold it
Oh no, no bitch

Off to work, I go to the studio or another show
Some people spend dough just to see a brother flow
So blessings I gotta get 'em and grind all the time
A piece of pussy be the furthest from my mind

Sometimes when I be traveling, niggas be asking me
Where are my bitches like I brought 'em all with me?
And some niggas be asking, can they go find me a bitch
But I have to dodge mo' pussy than they'll ever get, shit

I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no
I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no

She keeps on taxing me
She won't stop calling me, oh no, no
This ho keeps stalking me
That bitch won't leave me alone, oh no, no

I told this bitch that I was cool on it but she just wouldn't listen
And now she tryin' to blame me for her current condition
Hey bitch I ain't even trippin', I told you I'm into pimpin'
See I'm a hustle boy, baby and I don't chase bitches

All I do is check hoes in every city I visit
And put they number in my phone and later on I hit it
Bitch jock from a distance, quit burnin' my minutes
Either you comin' through or not, it don't make me no difference

I don't chase bitches, bitches chase me
I don't need to chase a ho, no no

Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stop blowing these days than my sight
Winds start blowing I'm paid trump tight
Got to have papers these days in my life
I got to have paper these days of my life

Money makes the world go round

Without a doubt
They all want to see about a clout
They don't know
Don't want to know or see what its about
We faced with danger do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life of the street mentality done made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money makes the world kill all niggas quicker
Its reala, the haps
The cheese, the scraps
The cheddar, whatever you call it its all ?

Money makes the world go round

Some people gots to have it
Some really need it
A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it
I see that money's good for me
Money's good to me

You go crazy without, do strange things for it

If you ain't got it you nothing
But when you come up than they hound you

I take me a shit and try to gather my thoughts
But where the southwest be, that's why I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rap
You see you got to be something, until this rap shit happen
Its been a long time since I got my hand on some cheese
Its been addictive, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope
I go days without eating, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down and get sprayed
Hey man I got to reason with ya
No, fuck trying to reason
I'm tired of struggling so now its hunting season
I hope you understand by now what I'm thinking
Get a bag of that dank, of the hemp and I'm steady drinking
Contemplating on what should I do

They don't give you no pussy if you don't give them no money
But you know what time it is when I'm in your spine with this
You know that you'll never find a dick like I possess

Devin the Dude,"Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces

[Chorus]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange

[Too $hort]
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But every time I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch

[Chorus]

[Devin]
Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
Piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
Nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know that's my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuck her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my side
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and only
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces

[Chorus]

[Tela]
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her nieces
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fucking for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my surprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces

Alright we gon' party, let's go! (Let's do it)

After the club we usually go straight to Chubby's
That's where the 3 in the morning grub be
And even though Icons is lovely
Tonight the pad is gonna be a must see
'Cause hussies are coming to give up they pussies, trust me
They comin' to muff me, plus three:
Makzilla, Irv and Big Nick we's 'bout to bust V
Open until we lust free, she sucked D
Gushed me, then roughly rode this ding-a-ling like a Huffy
Luck-ily, another 36 cup D abruptly, came into the room to fuck me
She said, ""Tecca Nina touch me, your dick is thick and husky
It must be like a ride at Cedar Point in Sandusky""
Well, what do you know, baby girl rushed me
The TNA was so silky and fluffy, unjustly I crushed, B!
And not one of these broads is ugly, 'til the next morning
When they crawl in they hubby Snuggie, looking rough as rugby

[Chorus]
Yeah, we hit the spot if we choose her
Then she dipping out
To take her to my house (It's the after party)
We can all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

You can take the under-route
Tell your man you at your mama house
No but really (It's the after party)
And we all (Get naughty)
And take our clothes off

Full of that liquor, ready to stick all this dick up in a-uh
Bitch out at Nina's, I never seen but I'm fixing to fuck
Already popping I'm running late, but just minutes away
Was told to grab condoms from up at Wal-Mart and bring 'em with me
Soon as I enter, my cock's attending a chicken brigade
Somebody's pussy's about to get cooked, rather chicken filleted
Found me a victim, we made our way through the kitchen escape
Into the garage and the lip massages was about to began
Lethargically sucking, hardly fucking with Pinky to me
So I told the slut to hike up her butt and let Kutt intervene
All in her guts in between, the Benz and the bucket and screamed
""Nigga you're fucking my whole lining up with my husband to be
Drowning too much and if he-"" shut the fuck up and I ease out
Take off the condom and I sprout on her butt with relief
Just another episode of back to naughty
Tecca Nina I can't thank you enough for the after party

[Chorus]

When freaks come out at night, the freakiest stays out the latest
They hit the after party, they got somebody take care of they baby
So it's cool, no rules, no security guards
Let your hair down, yeah, now do what you want
Man fire up the weed, whenever you please, best believe
That you got the green light, the special guest is me
And we've, been drinking and smoking all night
It's time to find a ho to be stroking my pipe
A bitch quickly grabbed my dick and asked why it was so soft
I said that it wouldn't go off, she gave it a quick blow off
And she did and me dick start to rise
She opened her eyes to a surprise and
Her thighs was moist, it was my choice to go up in it
For a minute put my dick up in it, she said it was splendid
She usually charge niggas, they like to rent it
I told her put it on my bill bitch and send it

Devin the Dude,"My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break 'em
Be about your paper nigga take it
Everyday's a hustle, got these haters at my neck
Suckers tryna get a check
The boss Dogg does it, hoes wanna call it what it wasn't
Tryna kiss a nigga all in public, bitch, is you crazy?
I preach pimping not pussy, shit I heard it all before
I ain't no mother fuckin' rookie

I'm a long beach, grown twenty playa 'bout his Gs
I ain't tripping off these walls
You know these rats is after cheese
Messing with my focus, the locust on his grind
They be focus on his dick and keep your focus off my time
Stay in the lane that I made for you to chill
Until then it's been real, I gotta handle business
And you I know we're in it, see tripping gets you nowhere
'Cause bitch I'm on that

I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin' and calling my phone, always lying
I don't need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don't even try it
I'm out here grinding, that's why
I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch

We used to rock to the rhythm that didn't stop
Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch
'Cause it's over and through
But why do I need a bitch when I got you
I don't mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team
Yo, we used to have a dream yo, we used to put our things together
Now it's dividing, hiding, bottled up negative feelings inside
These bitches, they come a dime a dozen
Fuck one that one sucked my dick and find another (bitches)
I don't need 'em, don't buy 'em nothing to drink, I don't feed them (bitches)
Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them
No, I don't wine and dine them 

I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin' and calling my phone, always lying
I don't need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don't even try it
I'm out here grinding, that's why
I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch

Hell no, I don't need one
And all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me
I put these size twelves down on a ten speed
Before I let a bitch get the best of me
(I don't need no bitch bitch bitch)
The recipe for danger, phone checking, recipe for anger
I'm from a gang but I don't wanna bang ya
And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my Benz and my ears, bitch?
Really I'm a perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker

Body like Miss Parker, maybe a little darker
But I'm a have to pass on that ass you was too much in the first place
Never understood when it was work day
And then she all up on your boy in the worst way
You need to detox, bitch see Dr. Dre
'Cause crazy ain't gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere
'Cause bitch I'm on that, bitch I'm on that

I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch all on me
Trippin' and calling my phone, always lying
I don't need no bitch, bitch constantly checking on me
Bitch don't even try it
I'm out here grinding, that's why
I don't need no bitch, bitch, bitch

Woke up at the Ritz Carlton, damn sun in my face
Racks in my jeans, gun still on my waist
And I ain't leaving shit in my cup, that's such a waste
You know I'm sipping on that straight like that ""oh, what a a taste!""
Tip the valet a hundred, I love to stunt
Pulled up in that mean machine, leave it up front
This passed out thing beside me, I barely know her
But you can just imagine the shit I'm 'bout to show her
Snow way, them streets too cold, them bitches polar
Expectations out of this world, I'm thinking solar
That's why I do it for that Kalamazoo
And then NOLA, that's what happens
When you learn to mix it with that soda

I wake up just to bake up, get my cake up and rise up

Put some purple rain on your brain, unravel the flame
Maintain my fame, get you new pictures
Just to put in your frame
We in the hood blowing kush with The Game
Foot in the cane, walking just like I'm an Indian chief
With no beef, real brief, with a wreath
You may think it's a leaf!
With the residue stuck deep down in your teeth
When you smoking with the dogg, shit, you might not eat!
It's OK, cause we lay, in the cut, on the hill, on the dip
With a fit on Crip, don't trip

The coffee that I had, it was good to the last drop
But now I'm fresh out and you know it don't, stop
So please man, somebody call the weed man
I'd call mine, but he's been low on herb even
I'm fiending, daydreaming of the times when I had
Much mota, many different kinds in the bag
I fell hard for the funk, I can't fake the love
I smoke dro, good Reggie, smoke shake to nugs
If it's weed, then I'm with it
You got a paper? Then twist it. You got a bowl? Fill it.
Got a blunt? Let me split it down the gut

Devin the Dude,"Check,
Shorty was a sweety, believe me she was a darling
Even come cook up some grub, when I was starving
Never interrupted the thug, she said pardon
Only eighteen, and still was fucking with Marvin
Her mother was a schoolteacher, her father was a sergeant
Them chickens in the club, my baby be out joggin'
Would even go as far, as giving the god noggin'
But when it came to the coochie, she just would not bargain
Did it all, takin' her shoppin', the ice department
Even put shorty up in a real nice apartment
Would come over at night sometime, with some roses and white wine
Tryin' to create the right time
For her to give me some behind, let me get it in
I know if I hit it once, she gon' want me to hit again
But she sayin' she tryin' to use discipline
I said look lil' mama, your not listening
Go head

If your in love with me
And I'm in love with you
Then it's alright for us to do what the lovers do
Just follow my lead
I'll show you what to do
'Cause I know cuttin' is something your accustomed to


They say I gotta put a ring on her finger
Before I ding-a-ling her
I understand but the man ain't tryin' hear
My brain wanna shake her mother's hand
My dick wanna hit her father with a car, just for doing his job
Shit was coming so much of a problem god
Was stressin' me like them white broads, that seen me in Entourage
Seen what's in the car garage, shit is a mess
Brand new CLS, dressed up
I funkflex
That's besides the point, nigga I'm stressed
Either she give me some sex,
Or this relationship is put to a rest
Rather leave her than do her dirty son, this birdies the best
I had to show that respect,
She didn't deserve less
Step two, I'm like boo either we do what it do
Or you can give me the keys to the view cus' we through
She started cryin' like, how could you do
As I turned to walk away, I heard a soft voice come out the blue, say

After all the time you needed me
How could you just turn and leave me here
Never to look back and see me
Didn't you swear that you would treat me fair

Yeah, but I was lyin' yo
And I ain't no thundercat

The shirt you got on boo boo

I wanna see your booty, get do to do the thunderclap

But I ain't really seeing how I can't

Without my hand
Boo, Boo
I know you think I'm a rude type dude
Spend all my money at the Moulon Rouge

Thunder cracking, another day to be chillin'
Nothing to do but roll up and po' up and catch that feeling I had
Back when I was younger, used to bum from my partner's uncle
Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster
Something missing, I'm way too high to talk my pimping
So I sip my Remy, that's when I first got tunnel vision
Yea I saw it clearly, sunshine never shine like this
When I was sober off in the yo I never rhymed like this
I think I'm tripping, no I'm high, no I'm throwed
Well all I know is that my world is super slow
I like this better, light as a feather, too fly too land
Too throwed to drive in this weather

It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned
High as fuck, money stuck so don't call my phone
See I was young when I was tipping, but I wasn't tripping though
Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow
Fall asleep while we ride, cloud surf to my house
I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch
And dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go
Tried to play it cool around my folk but I was fucked up on the low
Eyes bloodshot red, can't get to my bed
Cup of lean in my stomach, ounce of smoke in my head
I ain't been this way in a while, it's cool, I need to relieve the stress
All the worries of this life and blew it out my chest

Tryna train my lungs, to hang
Cause I'm gonna be smoking 'til Kingdom Come

Wanna stay grounded but somehow gravity pulls me up
Am I upside down? Man what the fuck

Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh

I roll up something, nah I don't fuck with the drink
Would have wrote this verse down, but I'm too high to think
Pupils is pink
Like my nigga Spitta, I'm too fly to sink
Devin, light the stink
Let's go, I'll smoke a zone playing P3
My nigga Shiest got that E.T.,
Got a nigga sleepy, yah
I used to coast down posts
Lookin' real nonchalant

You go to coppin', don't get more than one!

Now salute ooh

Even before I get my pad and my pen
I must have my weed, I grab my bag, then dig in
Mix my shit together so that it's all different kinds of flavors
They think I'm baking pies to distribute to the neighbors, no
I'm smoking weed, that tastes like, kinda cake-like
Bud is getting better, but the price is starting
To skyrocket, so I said fuck it, bought an Aerogarden
So I can get high, smoke big, and break even
No longer have to wait for harvest season
For strictly smoking, why do I have to push
Sitting back with a fat sack of pineapple kush
I wish a motherfucker would try to take my weed
So I take it and I stash the shit, so no one can see
Then I make it safe grab a brew to equalize it
Every day I'm smoking weed, I'm hoping soon they'll legalize it

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me
Is smoking on your Kush, or the Sour D (Light it!)
Jus' come ride with me
Now salute eh yo
While you puff 'til your eyes get low
Now salute ooh
To all my potheads across the globe

The bud brownies that I ate just kicking in
I got my Jordan Number Eights, black, aqua, and grape
These niggas try'na duplicate the Pilot DNA
Copycats see the big dog comin' and run away
Bitches fall through at the crib and can't get up, they want to stay
I got your old lady in my '88 Z-28
Haze got her dazed, she's stuck, she don't know what to say
I have the best week ever every seven days
In the magazine pictures, so high I might fly off the page
Rap, smoke, fly, drive, do it all with grace
For the Kush, I got a Jones like Grace
I call my house first, cause first is my place, yeah

All my smokers get high with me, just Marley & me

So I hit it slow
Flea flicker, give and go

I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up

Weed is where I'm needed, it's a necessity
If I ain't got it, little shit get the best of me
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece, man, your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so

I smoke like them old players
Only put it in the paper
I just started recently letting niggas smoke blunts around me
Known to keep the room cloudy
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking
Smell it through the bag so it's potent
Even get it on the plane, TSA don't even notice
Ran in the burner, he done taught a young nigga how to grow it
A pothead but I be focused

Devlin,"I remember when I was twelve years old
No worries in my brain with a pound in my pocket
And a chest full of smoke
I remember all the chordies we drove.
We used to play football all day and use jumpers for goalposts
And throw egg yolks at windows to wind up the old folks
Started learning about the birds and the bees
So there's birds from my class on their knees behind trees.
My favorite emcee was Sharkey Major
Way before I hit one double O three, Temptation, Kiss 100, or Flava
Get off from school and take
Ninety two point three but let's skip forward in time
Seven years down the line and it seems the spotlights on me
Sometimes I still wish that I was still twelve or thirteen.

Fifteen, bag of weed, bag of beers in the park
Duckin' out from Feds in the dark.
Then we appear with grass stains up and down my legs and arms
And with a fresh beer clenched in my palm.
Sixteen, my bars are different class
I've been rolling with Dogz and Glamour and Shotz for a year
I've been steppin' up fast.
I guess I got around in the bits.
I was selling bags of bud and Tales from the Crypt.
I met Ghetts when I was fourteen, lost touch.
By sixteen, I'd linked up with Ghetts again
Rolling with The Movement and started doing sets for them.
Mercston, Scorcher, Unique and Wretch and 'em.
Two thousand six, I was seventeen when I finished my first solo CD
But this time there's an album in the midst.

Life can pass you buy, just watch how fast it flies
Nineteen eighty-nine's when I started mine, now I'm like 'what happened to the time?'

By the time I hit seventeen, I was the coldest younger on the scene
With bars you never heard and flow you never seen.
Before I come around it was 'cock it and shoot'.
Emcees being cocky and rude, then I moved to some deep concepts in my tunes.
Monitor my brain waves, tell me if I'm crazed but I think the games changed
And emcees are opening doors in the same ways.
As I did when I was a kid, on Rinse radio waves
And now I'm paving the way for a fatal display
Might blaze in a haze till I'm dazed then wave a grenade in your face
Seventeen with bars that I regulate and generate pace
I'm only scared of who my enemies face.

Now it's time to prove what Devlin can do.
From the very first time I ever crept on a tune
I've immensely improved, the ascendance is due.
Original spitter, not remnants of you.
Swear I can see success in my view.
Crazy what letters in a sentence can do
'Cause my lyrics are the only thing sending me through.
Kanye called me a gangster rapper; I'm not a gangster rapper
Devs, I just spit it real.
You're an emcee like C difficile.
I look skinny 'cause I keep on missing meals.
I'll get cold like you know how frigid feels.
No children, sticking them rigid still
I guess my life's f***ed up but I'm only nineteen and I've got a lot of living still.

And spoke about common affairs, and various ways to build and repair

Where wages are cut but tax keeps growing
When the globe collapses on it's axis

And if it ain't me against the world 
Then I feel like I'm going against this whole country. 
Nobodies on my side they wanna take my soul, 
Body and my mind but I still got a problem with authority 
So what should I decide?

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

First off, for too many years I've been worse off now 
Every single verse is bloody worth dosh, 
It's hard to always stay on track sometimes I swerve off, 
Life's a lesson, in one second you could learn a lot. 
Give me the chance to accelerate and I'm burning off. 
Because I've been left too long to rot in the eternal fog 
And I was always told to aim for the stars 
Now I'm cruising through space like Scotty and the captains log. 
Deep space mind, don't hate me just make yours how I make mine? 
Take time to stay tight, 
And when times get messy like a cage fight, 
We will soon see which individual suffers stage fright. 
I'll be ready on the double, 
My flows flexible and supple leave you buried like a dead man in the ruble. 
Fully proud how my teams emerging from the tunnel full of never ending trouble!

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of 
(I finally found something I can be proud of)

I was on the road all day or I was getting locked up. 
Had find some other way to change my life up, 
I was on the path but sometimes I fucked it right up. 
I was either thinking I should leave or I should quit, 
But something always telling me I don't know what it is, 
I got something I am proud of, I'm enjoying this, 
I know, I know, I know. 
I would always try my best but nothing ever worked, 
So someone please just tell me straight 
'cause now I'm feeling worse. 
Now my pockets on fire all my credits burnt. 
I always paid the price and I never learned. 
I was just a crazy kid, broke and I was lost, 
Cause anytime I would flip and they would call the dogs, 
Always scrapping, always fighting, 
Show my teeth music changed my life now I'm never lost.

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of

I will be gone before oh yes
I will be gone before you wake
I will be gone)

Yeah, carry on whinging and whining
And get left to regret what you said
I'll be out the door in a sec
Like you [?]
I'm tired of rowing
And hours on end, the bickering, fighting
I blame my surroundings
A relationship defined in violence
It blossomed, and it bloomed
Now it's rotten and all blue
And even though I still love you
I can't go through with the doom and gloom again
That's the truth my friend
I'm not leaving for another lady
I felt I had to depart
Cause if I didn't I'd kill you, maybe

[Chorus]
Ah, empty days of pain
The sun goes on and on
[?]
You gotta let it go, let it go
Ah, empty days of rain
The sun goes on and on
You gotta let it go, let it go
I just wanna be left alone,
It's time to let it go
I just wanna be left alone
I think it's time you let it go

The sun doesn't always shine
I'm stuck in a solar eclipse
Even though I love you to bits
I'm done with the pain that we both inflict
Upon one another
It don't make me happy to watch you suffer
Run back to your mother
Tell her I turned out the same as the others
I don't know how to handle ya
All you do is make me angrier
Till I wanna manhandle ya
I'm contemplating whether to kiss ya or strangle ya
But I can't put my hands on ya
Like a burning flame in the burning flames
In hell with a dibs ain't walkin away
I can no longer stand with ya

[Chorus]

You took me high you took me low
You sold your soul with lies you told
And now it's time to ride alone
The lights will guide me home
The more I gave, the more you take
Now I'll be gone before you wake
Cause I just can't ignore my fate
Forget the day you saw my face

(I will be gone)
In the blink of an eye
(I will be gone)
With the stars in the sky
(I will be gone)
And you're askin' me why

Devlin,"Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep
Moving with me.
Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep
Moving with me

Bud, sweat and beers!

And tonight we're in London city.

I'm on the A13 on the way to the city, where the lights
Are bright with some boys that like to fight, I'm leaning. 
Out the window, smoking a spliffy.
Through the wind in my eyes, like tears that I cry,
Getting high on the essence of life.
'Cause tonight we're in London city. 
And I got 'bout four hundred with me
Fifteen minutes ago we left barking, now we're approaching
The city, I'm a laughing.
Wanna hit a restaurant first cause' I'm starving. 
Eat well for the start of emptying glasses. 
This is London city.
The best city in the world when everybody's not shanking
And blasting, young men moving to music and females
Shaking their a**es.

Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me.
Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, 
Just keep rolling with me.

Alright, I've finished my plate. 
Now I'm walking out the restaurant, 
lighting up the cigarette and then I pass half to my mate.
Many clubs and bars await. 
We're gonna drink and dance till it's late.
And my name is Bait, 
So a lotta young ladies wanna glance at my face. 
One a' got a glass in their hand and
A wiggling their ass and their waist.
It's the old t-show, sexy ladies who wind down low. 
And if ya get approached by a bloke, who smells of weed,
Smoke, don't act like you don't wanna know.
'Cause we got the city on smash. 
As the strobe lights flash, all I do is drink more champs
And spend more cash, London City no match.

Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me.
Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, 
Just keep rolling with me.

As the night comes to a closure I'm far from sober, 
But I carry on drinking like a soldier, 
Even when the night club's over.
Straight up in the morning and I still look smart but I'm far from a poser. 
I'm sporting, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste, Lyle and Scott
I'm nineteen with more grades than my Dad's got 
And your girl's still trying to watch. 
Well I guess my face just lights up the spots.
And now I'm pissed up running in the road, staggering,
Looking for a cab back to Bagenham to kick back and cotch,
With this sexy blue eyed brunette girl that I got.
With the light in the cab it was more than a lot.
London City just pop.

Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, just keep rolling with me.
Let your hair down in London City, 
Everybody just keep moving with me, 
Just keep dancing with me, 
Just keep rolling with me.

Devlin,"I look down on this race I created and all I see is violence and hatred,
I shake my head as I whiz by in my space ship, 
The world is like my movie screen plus eighteen 'cause peace is far and few between. 
Ever since Eve took the Apple off the snake humanity sealed it's fate 
And then tragedy laid in wait. 
Killer tsunamis caused by tectonic plates, changing shape, at the the oceans base, 
Releasing explosive rage. 
I'm just sat here in my burgundy robe observing the globe, 
Pondering if the life that I created will ever learn to evolve. 
I filled your oceans full of fish and I put birds in the sky, 
And everyday you sit and curse on your lives, you ain't worshiping I. 
How did you manage to ruin such a beautiful planet? 
The turn of the times left my continents and countries ridden with murder and crime, 
Earthly decline.

People look cold like the freezin' rain, 
All truth be told, we don't see the same. 
People look cold, like the freezin' rain, 
Like the freezin' rain, my son died in vain. 
I'll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you, 
I made this world for you. 
I'll see you, I, I, I, I, I I made this world for you,

And then he rested on the seventh, now everybody's sinnin',

Rest In Peace to everyone who lost their lives in Haiti and September the eleventh, 
As well as seven and seven. 
'Cause I was on the train an hour before, 
I guess I got a higher purpose in the eyes of the Lord, 
Who looks down from the sky into the fire and storm, 
And sees governments in unison like one big global Mafia, 
They're paying soldiers for a foe to blow a strap at ya'. 
From heaven's door watch him maintain the war, 
To continue selling metal to the masses like Metallica. 
I feel although a lot of love has been lost, 
If I was God I'd be cross that my son had to die on the cross, cross cross. 
If I was God I'd be cross that my son had to die on the cross

Devlin,"Listen, yeah
A lifetime of dreaming, visualizing paradise
I woke up, rolled over and told my girl we're leaving
It's time to sacrifice a lot
'Cause you ain't happy with your job
And round here it's like nothin' seems appealing
So let me know you feel the same
Throw your life into a case and we'll depart from Victoria this evening
And then embark upon a path of rediscovery
Searching for the fruits from the lost garden of Eden
I'm wondering if I runaway and came back another day,
Then would the young men who roll with metal put the guns away
And would the devil have took charge or would the slum be safe
I pray the latter's right for everybody's mumsy's sake.
And if I disappear for years and reappear
Would my natural intuition still be crystal clear?
Or would I have lost clarity?
In this trivial pursuit we're walking through so casually

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

We share a last cigarette, then walk into the station
Purchase two tickets to an alien destination
Board the train and witness pain on all the faces of multi-cultural races
But not me and my girl we're breaking free
Like an escapist, 'cause we need to escape this
And I for one have got my mind made up,
Even if where we stay is make-shift
I can't remain in this domain of semi ape shit, because all I see is hatred
I wonder if I disappeared how many men would miss me
Or would they all forget like I erased my name from history?
I'm still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery
And vanish off the planet like a mystery.
And if I did return and things were the same or worse?
You'd see the gear stick shift and
Then the I would reverse and I'd be straight back on my travels
Burning rubber over gravel 'til we see the English Channel

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

As the carriage pulls away,
I pull my lady closer and I tell her she's okay
'Cause if we never broke the barricades today we'd always be afraid
And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze
But now I've come of age,
And as the train starts enterin' suburbia a smile comes across my face
The unwinding of eternal rage,
That was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates
If I could runaway and come back another day,
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day.
Kick back and just enjoy the raves,
With a lager and a spliff to blaze.
If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place
I'd leave it long enough so they don't recognize my face
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day
While I roll upon the roads along the motorway

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.",Runaway,2010

Postpone my attempt to kill my bars,
Well you better have an army,

So long that my brain has gone delirious inside
I think back on all the years that I've survived
Holding back the tears that keep appearing in my eyes
But now I'm yesterday's news
And I'm tomorrow's promise but I've got my mince pies

Open wide trying to visualize devils in disguise

I'm walking under rainy skies but the flame never died
It stayed alive cause I was made to ignite
Like dynamite I'm from the cold with heavy night

Like a tire in the snow cause there ain't no grip on ice

So welcome to my life, I've cleverly designed minds
Lost souls just trying to live the higher life

So let me stick my teeth into the game and bleed it dry

When I witness blood seeking through his veins
This has become apparent I've got a talent that these other rappers haven't
So what would be the point of bloody keeping it in chains
About my rhymes but when I'm talking about?
So cut the conversation cause I've been lower rating
Taking anything I'm pleasing taking off the aviation
To a better place in time better for leaving this place behind

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me

'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper

Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal

People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can be the lyrics when I'm singing them out (wow)

From day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
'Cause it's another day plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling cds from my rucksack aiming for majors
Nationwide til' we're just jack, soon as I get the bus back

Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a French church tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the myspace and youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 

'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

You need me, man, I don't need you

Devlin,"I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
""'Cause real will recognize real"" is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close.

Five o'clock with lights off
Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed, it's D-E-V to the Z
Overtired, pale-faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
It's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by

[Chorus]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be...
The times I'm living in lately.

I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron
But they won't Slytherin too easy, believe me I'm Snape minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro, living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie
Await death, take deep breaths, try to never die.
Never die.

Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like screws
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them, true!
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,
I keep my pupils engaged,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.

[Chorus]
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free, it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free, it could be... [x4]

Devlin,"Devlin, yeah
Wretch 32 in the building
Let's take it back there, time to go in
Tell 'em Wretch, tell 'em Wretch

I'm on some off with your head shit
I keep firing, I'm not The Apprentice
Devs told me to go in, ah yeah
So I wrap blocked all the exits
Yes I'll be here forever
The chair's so far I'll leave here in leather
So dark, so cold
With a couple girls sitting on my lap
I'm never gonna say I'm back
I'm a little too in love with plaques
I moved in to the hall of fame
So I wipe my feet on tracks

I'ma kill it, I'm a killer
See me with one glove, it's a Thriller
I already had a number one for my dinner
Me and Devs go in there, inner

And we're out of here, I doubt you're near
I've already been a thousand 'ere
But if you live for the money, then you die for the money
So I ain't even trying to count it, I swear

And if you don't think I'm fucked
Middle finger up
Fuck me, fuck you
I'll make you feel small when I big you up

Up, up and away, I can't see ya
On my own scale, I'm a Libra
Told 'em leave me alone, I wanna leave, uh
Had to give 'em so dough to get a pizza

Every day I have to take away
Tomorrow won't be the same today
I don't score when I'm at home
I strike more when I play away

Shut down the asylum
Before I creep through the exit, find it
Jump any fence inside then drag a man
Out of a car that he just was driving

And then put the pedal to the floor
I'm back and I'm ready for the war like a Viking
I ain't gotta tell 'em any more, me and Wretch
Already killed this UK Grime thing

And there's not a lot left that could swing with shit
And the doctor of death flying
Wretch 32 said it's off with his head
Got cold feet then it's frost on your creps

Never mind where you're walking, watch where you step
Mind what you're talking, I might dissect
Any guy trying a bullshit vibe on a sec
Can't fuck with me like my wife on the reds

Too unorthodox to let it go
So I let 'em know that I'm pro, but my name ain't Stephen
Soul seems to be involved
I'm burying men six deep in a hole, no reason

You're getting buried alive, I'm tryina better my life
While some men are cutting up suits
With scissors and severing ties
I let 'em know that it's Devlin's time

No disputing I shift to the move
This game from the days of The Movement
Using the only utensil I knew to
Now I need loot, this a like to my figures on YouTube

Retreat or advance then, you choose
At the present I'm king like Presley
Test me, then I'm running out full of anger
And envy and stamping you out in my blue shoes

Ride a beat like a Traktor, ey
But I ain't getting on a train, 'ey
Everybody wants to act up, yeah
'Til you put 'em in the frame

And I ain't got time for shit, patience's thinner than my toilet roll
I'm a fixed up brother from a broken home
I remember I used to watch Home Alone
Now I'm home alone in my owner home

This millennium, got a loada dome
Rome then roam
Came home smelling like hot Cologne
Had a success overdose, woah

You see my roll-on flow
And I'm so sure that I can't be old
Yet all my heels I carry on toe to toe
When we take this game now, so cologne

You couldn't play my post
I'm an old soul like an ancient ghost
That created his name in the game and he
Took shit to another level on the whole

I can't really explain my brain
But if you peeked inside of my skull
You'd see shit so deep in my rear
Eye low deep, know why I feel this cold

And I feel like the caped crusader
Here on the brink of a dangerous caper
I'm always collected and calm in battle
Can't be rattled, go sample a shaker

OT, I'm an out taker
I'm taking out any men that are minor
And think that they're major, there's a devil and a
Wretch that just broke out of the chamber

Yes, now I'm going for the hat-trick
One singer, one model, one actress
But I might disappear if you're acting
Or singing me a new tune on a mad pitch

Back to my rap shit
I'ma go hard this year
Can't be looking at the past this year
That won't help me get past this year

In an extra zone next to tracks
Multiple hits but with extra swag
I've divided my time
Royalties won't forget to add

And I ain't adding nobody on my BB
iPhone when I want you to see me
I plane, You tube
See me on Wretch32 TV

I'm getting flashbacks from the past
Head full of hate and a mouth full of bars
Me and Wretch just stretched this game to a next span
Taking the extra yard

We're going extra hard, no I can not be barred
Say what you want, but you couldn't keep Devs out
Anyways, I've already broke through the fence now
And I'm quite relentless when I vex out

Everybody wants to the the best out
But he gets stripped like a bitch when I dress down
Think you're a face round 'ere?
Get left lying face down in a next town

Pull strings like Robbie Lamont
On the beat and I'm dropping the bomb
I'll make you all feel sick like Sue Bo dropping her thong

Devlin,"When the sky breaks it rains
So just let the H2O splash upon the graves
Of all the souls I used to know but now have passed away
Men say that time can heal a situation
But this pain is not a passing phase
Now I'm curious how many years a heart can ache
Feel like a Minotaur meandering this darkened place
Trying to find a way to maybe find the light of day
If I could rewind then I'd re-live my life again
And sit and hold my nan's hands while she felt the pain
And say hello to old mates behind the pearly gates
Given the chance to glance back at my childish face
I'd try and smile the way I smiled just like a child again
Before I had to say goodbye to anybody
And the loved ones I've lost all had life within their bodies
My side was less lonely then
You wanna cry well come and hold me then
I think I need the blessing of some holy men

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind

If I had minutes on my hand just like a time piece
I'd turn the clocks back and maybe try to find peace
As well as my ID, so rewind me
Just like a video cassette cause I'm upset that I ain't seen
Some faces in a while just apparitions in my dream
That ends abruptly when they try to hug me through the screen
Of smoke that's engulfing me
Like the coastline with its high tide
And you can see the sands and the oceans meet
No one told me when this ride began to hold my seat
Time flies like Emmet Brown was in the driver's seat
You talk of irony
Well now I'm lonely
But I'm searching for my privacy
This life won't comply with me
I think I need some dead relatives either side of me
To keep me company and guide me through the library
Of neverending stories full of lies and deceit
Hi Ho Silver, Lone Ranger riding to the beat

'Cause everything is different now
I'd really like to tell you how
How I wanted you here by my side
I know what I said but I lied
It looked like I laughed but I cried
But I wish I could push rewind

If I could rewind time to its slowest
I'd look at life at its heights and its lowest
So I could maybe try to recollect
What made me who I am besides a poet
Besides a poet

Not many man have been in the wars that I've been in
I can work here but it's not a place that I could live in
Getting new money though but I've already made a killing
I've already made a scene, I already live a dream
And the king's road's lonely, you can't go with him
When it's time for a test

In the hood every day, it's heroin, living like they're dead

About this collabo
Historical events unravel

My man said he feel paro
Bloody cuffs, heart on my sleeve

When I spit and my arms start swiniging, I'm bringing
More raw shit than a Beckton works
Smell it and know why Kano writ it
Wrote it, fuck me, alright, don't quote it

Comparing me with these seeds
Too rare a breed of MC and the flow shifts
More than once a minute
Getting off like dharma, I come and I kill it
A Dagenham'er strapped with a bunch of lyrics
That bang harder, where the fuck's the gimmicks?
There ain't nada
I've got the heart and spirit they can't harbor
Silly men pass the limit and then scarper
When it comes on top with the urban legend, I get 'em like Carter

Spitters can't better these levels of terror
I leave my brain in my car but my head is together
I make a team of dons quit when I'm put under pressure
Rate Devlin, why? He's a grime treasure
In grime, I've lined my catalogue up, prime seller
I'm never too far from the hype that I set up
I step up like a bredda who's livin' in nice weather
At work, puttin' words together with ice letters
I spray, make a big tree lean in the road
Trees drop on your house to leave them a cold
Trees drop on your car, the windows smash
Eski brought O2 Indigo back
But this whole time, fam, I've been holy in grime
Even a first time who don't know me in grime
But you love my stage vibe when I'm holding a mic
I'm a pro now, bro, I jump over the spike

Any hardcore fan of grime
Go mad when you hear this bang inside
I got the keys like pianists, black and white
I've been a beast in the scene all my adult life
Ever since Will said ""Hello, hi""
I was sat in the shadows, high
Concocting the maddest vibe
With a way less narrow sight
Than a Homosapien eye
X-Ray, make way for my death ray
Nikola Tesla reborn to a next stage
Technology stole our children
The world's in debt and our men are all templates

Loves telling the poor they're rich
Then he wonders why they're getting rolled 
On when he wanna try and walk round in the bits
This is real life no thrills hype
On a reals it feels like
I've been impaled on a steel spike
But still fight, for my girls and real guys 
In the real grind that write real rhymes
It's the boy next door that kicked down doors 
And I'm back on an ill vibe
(Alright)
Twenty pounds on my weed
Five pounds on my pint
No swagger at all, just me
And I bet I can draw your wife
Comply with anything please
I'm gutter, I'll do what I like
I had a pipe dream in the grime scene
Now I'm flying at withering heights

50 Grand for my chain
Quarter mil' for my whip
10 Mil' for my house

Ten pounds for my cab
Some cheap wine for this skank
I'm streetwise, you ain't - fact
I'll fleece guys, you're getting wrapped
Outside of the East Side is where I'm at
Where fiends lie and make traps
For these sweet guys that flash
But when it's beats time it ain't that
(Alright)
These times I'm in the lab with terms
These guys are on a madness learn
No peace signs, I'm gonna stab this verse
Just to kill it, I'm able and willing
Rep for the boys, the kids and the women
Tryna get by in the times that we live in
Tryna make a life and a living

50 Grand for my chain
Quarter mil' for my whip
10 Mil' for my house

(That's not me)
(Skepta)
(Trust me)
(Yeah, yeah)

I never had it, made it, saved it
Spent it, lost it, gave it
To people who needed it more than me
Guys in the ends getting shanked for the P
More time I'm tryna show man the vision
But it's like man are still too poor to see
So I let man do their ting
I ain't judging anybody, I don't wanna law degree
You see the rap lifestyle, if you wanna live
Celebrities and the worthless riches
I ain't saying I don't want to make money
But right now I'm tryna do the right tings with it
If I eat food, eat food in my crew
See me and Dev in a cinema near you
And when I pull up to the premiere
Don't ask why I ain't wearing a suit, you're tired

Well I heard they think they're grimey now, okay
I think that we're gonna need fireman out 'cause I'm Jim McVeigh
When I run up in the game, I'm firin' out, mind out of the way
10 years in the game, no tirin' out, I'm here, what the vitals say?
What goes and don't, I keep rollin' like I've got broken brakes
Any foes I face, wanna meet in a public, open space
So you know my brain's one sandwich short of a picnic
James don't play no games, Creegan here with a hand grenade
I make people cheer when I rant and rave
I ain't nowhere near to a diva mate, I'm just bait
I make kids from the bits, wanna re-relate and write pages full of what freedom ain't
It's outrageous, hey man, I beat the rain
I'm out-takin' still, I'll steal your fame
No need, they know my name
It's D to the E-V, L-I-N when you see me, don't watch my face
You wouldn't wanna be me, at times I think I'm lost in space
Scotty just beam me or I'll end this shit like a Boston race
There's a problem wait, there should have been a lot more flames

You know I'll blow your mind, my friend, again
And I'm here to show you I ain't never left
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend
Loaded on that green floating on your genes
I'll be that lion to your queen

Back on the riddim with a bang
And there ain't no bitin' this with a fang
Insultin' me, how dare you, damn
I'm nuts, you're mad
I'm comin', get down when I'm reachin' around inside this coat
Don't know what I just might find
I hope it's a knife and rope
High grade I thought I smoked
Some money for the cab that'll get me home
Don't wanna roll
Well if it's 'cause I'm white then let me know
And I'll bite your faces, racists
Hate this, wanna be changin' places
Makin' moves on a regular basis
In Satan's grove, I'll conquer the beast
No way will he take my soul
Then gain control of the scene like back in the day
Then let them haters know that my ancient throne ain't vacant no
No, no way José, who the fuck's José?
I'll see him on the road and leave him slain
I'm goin' on cold, I'm back on the wave
You've been told
Don't ask me why I'm past deep
Every time these stars speak, I'm sick they turned up last week
And they think they're the shit, well guess who's back?
The boy from Dags is going on rags
And if you don't love me, then fuck you

You know I'll blow your mind, my friend, again
And I'm here to show you I ain't never left
You know I'll blow your mind, my friend
Loaded on that green floating on your genes
I'll be that lion to your queen

To everyone that finds that life is kinda fucked
To everyone that died before their time was up

Devlin,"Oh shit, is it my go?
I'll just let everyone spit when I lie low
Then strike when the time feels right
Self instructed, fuck your advice
I don't want much but a slut for a wife
Money in the bank piled up would be nice
We're all after a luxury life but the ugliest sights are corrupting our minds
Until your brain can't think for itself, it's just driven by the rage inside
Best not slip like a baby on ice
Some man are sharp to react like Arabian knights
I'm at a stage in my life
Where I don't care for the hype
I just wanna better my career
If you've got a vendetta though, I'm here
We can make arrangements right
No snake, I'm a crane in flight
The dangerous heights
Painting a page like Damien Rice
When it's late and I'm high
Tryna bring the painting to life
Like my boy Rawz Artilla, I can do what I want, I can say what I like
I can make dead ravens fly
In the jaded sky when I spray these rhymes
I got pointed a gun at my lyrics
Clicked on the trigger then I waved goodbye
I'll put the bar in the sky
I ain't alive, and dead men don't die
Tell them all that it's Devlinstein
Infecting minds 'til they're F'd like mine
When I'm in effect I'm electric
I'm like Jay Fox, I'm electrolive
But there ain't no Spiderman
They try to defy the plan, I'm insighting this fiery land there's no hiding here
Come and find me right where I stand
No budging, faking, bluffing, all I can do is play with a hand
I was given in a place called Britain, where the sun don't shine when the rain comes down
I ain't no liar
Doggzy and Siah
All the first man in grime are the fire
That make me feel like taking a wire
I'm wrapping it around your neck when I step
Dev's the messiah
Hybrid fire
Cloning my genes with the genie of hire
Understand I'm gonna wreck this set
I bite, I don't bark, get a tetanus check
Whoever you select or dissect in so many sets when I send these threats
I'll treble any bet that you've set
Wait until my lyrics start taking effect
Breaking the spirit of the jaded
Backslash faded, and new-comers with the rep
'Cause I'm watching, so watch it
I'm clocking every goddamn step
Mic check, if you wanna be in set well stiffen up your Exoskeletons
Insects wanna creep and crawl around me 'cause they heard that I'm Devlin
In jest I should slaughter you all and then bury 'em for acting feminine
Contest, and I'm making you subject one in my strange experiment
Malevolent, pain indefinite
Dark development, Drugnam resident
Periodic when I store every element
You'll never know what's in store for your regiment
J don't give an F to the K
I know you see the inside of the presidents
Brains sprayed by the great
Country that we gave birth to that buried them
I've never been credited fully, I know
That's why I've gotta play this bully-ish role
You don't wanna fuck with me, I look nice, but I'm not like the Annabelle doll, you know
Devlin is going on cold, you know
This is the OT show, you know
I ain't never sold my soul, you know
Devlin's ruthless, like a house in a hurricane, quick here I come again
Well equipped for this shit when I run away
When my tongue get burnt like a ginger on a sunny day
Don't care what he'd fucking say
Telling me I'm nothing great, you muppet wait, I'm big like Puffy's mate
I'll put your name in a letter and I'll seal your fate

And went in, step back from the mic
You don't wanna scrap nor fight
Corned Beef City is haunted and gritty
Run for the hills, be scared for your life

Dead men's shoes, you don't really wanna be inside them clogs
We're alive but we're lost
Tell me what does irony cost?
Well my name's Devlin
But they wanna look at me like God
You know what? I ain't nobody's savior

Devlin,"When I was young, I knew this kid
And his life was always madness
His mum was on them crack rocks
When he was young, his Dad left
Kids would call him 'have-not'
And worse, I bet you can guess
Scummy, tramp, jack-pot
His mum's still at the crack spot
He's hungry and he's hacked off
There's blood all down his tracktop
Them bullies caught him slipping
He curls up when they're kicking
Punching, biting, spitting
Now there's phones out with the cams on
He dies some more inside
Then he cries when he gets stamped on
It's damn wrong
Any part of him that was man's gone
They finally knocked him out, he saw a light and thought he'd found God
Only then to wake, right back inside this town, lost
Cold but he don't care much, his only friend was Jack Frost
His skinny little frame aches
There's cuts upon his grazed face
Trying to find a safe way home, that may be long
He looks above and screams ""Why'd you bring this hell on me?""
At night I try and sleep but can't, I hear this song

I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby

Years pass and he was chilling
On this park bench spitting
Freestyling to himself
About his life, that it was hell
When this crazy local villain
Sat down and told him ""Listen
I've seen how hard your life has been, I think it's time I helped""
If you like, you'll work for me, the boys will welcome you as well
If you've got beef then we've got beef, we'll ride on them with shells
You never deserved the cards you got
Here's your chance to passed them off
Take a gamble, cast the rod
It's time you showed this world
Says ""Yeah man, fuck it
I might as well be thugging
This life has gave me nothing""
Can feel inside himself, the accumulated hatred
Was soon replacing basic
Human moods a face with
A past and you can tell
But it's all about his future now
Olders got him moving round
Running guns, moving grams
Flick-knife on his belt
He's dying to use his blade though
For years you made him scapegoat
Now take note, you try him now, you're getting straight poked (Oh well)

I ain't seen no man falling like a raindrop
There's no life to live here, this town is a graveyard
Well every day the problem seems to multiply
And everybody's keeping busy getting by
Well if you listen closely you can hear them cry
It's just my city's lullaby

He's the man now, stand down
He's shotting up this mad town
Taxing other shotters with yoggers and his mad pals
I called him Sonic, wherever he went there was always tales
Of clarat and vomit, I think he's trying to even the scale
He feels euphoric, a hoodrat that was beaten down ironically giving the beatings now
It's all evened out, a child that was screaming out
Is a man with an evil scowl
Oh shit! What's this?
Someone that he's seen in town
Used to punch him around (ho)
Now he's reaching around (yo)
And his heater is out so
Now he's blasting rounds
And his target's down
Like Warren in Barking town
And he's laughing proud
His heart is drowned
Nobody can save him now
He's a monster made by man, Mary Shelly ain't around
So this ain't no act of fiction
When I find these words and fix 'em
To the page to make you see where this child went off the rails (I'm done now)

I just wanna be me
'Til the day that I'm free
You do you, I'll do me

I look back now and I can't explain it
Always knew that I was waiting for greatness
Mum wanted me to work in the slave shift
But I was writing my lyrics in the grave shift
Perfecting the style so amazing I rose through the ranks so quick I was blazing
Sorry to upset you mother but right now I've gotta do me, time's wasting
I had a scheme and a dream. Time that I prove I could stand on my feet
Jab or weave here in the city full of feats and fiends
Life don't stop, time don't sleep
I feel like I'm lost
My ears are on fire, they speak
And they all think they know what's best but

I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me

To let your heart be driven

Keep shit real in the field no fibbin'
Real we can feel 'cause that's how we're living
We're all different here in Great Britain
So embrace yourself and envision that your skin never left you imprisoned
Be whatever you wanna be man, kill 'em
You're unlike any other, aim for the sky my brother
Do it your way, this life is a bitch but love her
In the doorway I see the ghost of a soul that I knew last summer
Love to your girl and your kids and your mother
We can't hold joy without stifer

I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me
'Til the day that I'm free
You do you and I'll do me

They're like Devs do a grime track, I'm like why, would you like that?
Would you lend me your score if things got raw like before on the floor no money up in my bank
I didn't think so mate so let me do me in this life while I wait to right my mistakes
Wipe these slates, everyday is a new blind date
I'm unsure of what I just might face
But as long as I'm true to myself, what this path might lead to is fate
I'll follow this road like that Dorothy girl
Even if the bricks ain't golden and I bet I do it historically well
I ain't no big shot in your focus just me in this illogical world

I just wanna be me
I just wanna be me

Need drink, do I need skunk

Whys that? I don't really know but I worked on impulse
Writing tracks all about where my life's at
I never knew I'd be a live act many years later
When you're breaking through they all rate you
But when you make the cut they all hate you

Explorers lost at sea when the siren seems so sweet
It's enchanting 'til you don't know who you are and your fate's advancing
Look around you're getting older now and still wasting chances
Raised in carnage now I feel like Bane in darkness
But I'm still dancing to an unknown beat with the speakers blasting

Nobodies aware of what I'm covering up 
But one thing I'll erupt my bloods bubbling.

Give me the chance to accelerate and I'm burning off.

And I was always told to aim for the stars

And when times get messy like a cage fight,

But something always telling me I don't know what it is, 
I got something I am proud of, I'm enjoying this, 
I know, I know, I know. 
I would always try my best but nothing ever worked, 
So someone please just tell me straight 
'cause now I'm feeling worse. 
Now my pockets on fire all my credits burnt. 
I always paid the price and I never learned. 
I was just a crazy kid, broke and I was lost, 
Cause anytime I would flip and they would call the dogs, 
Always scrapping, always fighting, 
Show my teeth music changed my life now I'm never lost.

How different is my life to another mans,
I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place.
Then escape to the summer sands, 
Until my time has expired I'll be trying and
I finally found something I'll never give up, 
Finally found something I can be proud of

Devlin & Labrinth,"(I will be gone before you wake
I will be gone before oh yes
I will be gone before you wake
I will be gone)

Yeah, carry on whinging and whining
And get left to regret what you said
I'll be out the door in a sec
Like you [?]
I'm tired of rowing
And hours on end, the bickering, fighting
I blame my surroundings
A relationship defined in violence
It blossomed, and it bloomed
Now it's rotten and all blue
And even though I still love you
I can't go through with the doom and gloom again
That's the truth my friend
I'm not leaving for another lady
I felt I had to depart
Cause if I didn't I'd kill you, maybe

[Chorus]
Ah, empty days of pain
The sun goes on and on
[?]
You gotta let it go, let it go
Ah, empty days of rain
The sun goes on and on
You gotta let it go, let it go
I just wanna be left alone,
It's time to let it go
I just wanna be left alone
I think it's time you let it go

The sun doesn't always shine
I'm stuck in a solar eclipse
Even though I love you to bits
I'm done with the pain that we both inflict
Upon one another
It don't make me happy to watch you suffer
Run back to your mother
Tell her I turned out the same as the others
I don't know how to handle ya
All you do is make me angrier
Till I wanna manhandle ya
I'm contemplating whether to kiss ya or strangle ya
But I can't put my hands on ya
Like a burning flame in the burning flames
In hell with a dibs ain't walkin away
I can no longer stand with ya

[Chorus]

You took me high you took me low
You sold your soul with lies you told
And now it's time to ride alone
The lights will guide me home
The more I gave, the more you take
Now I'll be gone before you wake
Cause I just can't ignore my fate
Forget the day you saw my face

(I will be gone)
In the blink of an eye
(I will be gone)
With the stars in the sky
(I will be gone)
And you're askin' me why
(I will be gone before you)

[Chorus]",Let It Go,2010
Devlin & Yasmin,"Listen, yeah
A lifetime of dreaming, visualizing paradise
I woke up, rolled over and told my girl we're leaving
It's time to sacrifice a lot
'Cause you ain't happy with your job
And round here it's like nothin' seems appealing
So let me know you feel the same
Throw your life into a case and we'll depart from Victoria this evening
And then embark upon a path of rediscovery
Searching for the fruits from the lost garden of Eden
I'm wondering if I runaway and came back another day,
Then would the young men who roll with metal put the guns away
And would the devil have took charge or would the slum be safe
I pray the latter's right for everybody's mumsy's sake.
And if I disappear for years and reappear
Would my natural intuition still be crystal clear?
Or would I have lost clarity?
In this trivial pursuit we're walking through so casually

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

We share a last cigarette, then walk into the station
Purchase two tickets to an alien destination
Board the train and witness pain on all the faces of multi-cultural races
But not me and my girl we're breaking free
Like an escapist, 'cause we need to escape this
And I for one have got my mind made up,
Even if where we stay is make-shift
I can't remain in this domain of semi ape shit, because all I see is hatred
I wonder if I disappeared how many men would miss me
Or would they all forget like I erased my name from history?
I'm still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery
And vanish off the planet like a mystery.
And if I did return and things were the same or worse?
You'd see the gear stick shift and
Then the I would reverse and I'd be straight back on my travels
Burning rubber over gravel 'til we see the English Channel

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.

As the carriage pulls away,
I pull my lady closer and I tell her she's okay
'Cause if we never broke the barricades today we'd always be afraid
And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze
But now I've come of age,
And as the train starts enterin' suburbia a smile comes across my face
The unwinding of eternal rage,
That was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates
If I could runaway and come back another day,
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day.
Kick back and just enjoy the raves,
With a lager and a spliff to blaze.
If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place
I'd leave it long enough so they don't recognize my face
I'd let the song play, on the summer's longest day
While I roll upon the roads along the motorway

I gotta leave, I gotta go,
There's nothing here for me no more
I gotta be free, I gotta be
Somewhere that I can just be me.
And I run run runaway, run run runaway,
Run run runaway, I runaway.",Runaway,2010
