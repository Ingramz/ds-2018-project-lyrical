Softies,"I've been away and suddenly
you're a poet musing my return
what I did while I was gone
is none of your concern
you can write that I have changed
from how I was back then
just don't think that you could ever cry to me again

you can add this to your growing list
of heartfelt disappointment worn
like charms around your wrist

you're taking pictures every time I turn away
cutting pasting and making fun of everything I say
you can tell the whole wide world I don't know anything
just remember that everything I say I might not mean

you can add this to your growing list
of heartfelt disappointment worn
like charms around your wrist

and it's so sad if I was all you had
that wasn't how I planned it
it doesn't help you to demand it
if it's not there

you can add this to your growing list
of heartfelt disappointment worn
like charms around your wrist
you can add this to your growing list
of heartfelt disappointment worn
like charms around your wrist


 ",Charms Around Your Wrist,1995
Softies,"how could I let you do this again
how could I let myself be sucked into this thing
called friends
how could I let you hurt me this way
torturing myself day after day after day
you'd have thought I'd learned by now
want to let you go but don't know how

how could I let you kiss me like that
all of my hopes up only to be squashed flat
how could I think that you'd love me too
you're just a scared boy, the only kind that will do
I hope you'll soon lose your charm
that might save my heart from harm


",Could I,1995
Softies,"something you said is on my mind
I'm the one you thought you'd never find
a sudden coastal holiday makes you see me in a
different way
your voice sounds so hollow
I'm glad to have you following me

listing off my favorite things
you say I have too many dreams
but first I wished and now it's true
I'm becoming awfully fond of you
your voice sounds so hollow
I'm glad to have you following me

you didn't know me and still you called
I didn't find it strange at all
seeming like the thing to do
I knew it then and so did you
your voice was so hollow
I'm glad you've come to follow me
follow me, follow me
follow me, follow me

",Follow Me,1995
Softies,"last time I wrote you I meant to say sorry
I didn't mean for your eyes to get starry
trying to say it got stuck in my throat
but I meant every word that I wrote

next time I see you I'm sure you'll be better
easily past the effects of my letter
it looks not so sad written down
and it lessens with each passing town

it's fragile
fragile like you
like you

breaking your heart was not what I hoped for
I've said too much and can't possibly say more
maybe that's not being fair
so it's lucky I'm here and you're there

put it inside your cigar box forever
and maybe someday you'll forgive me for never
doing what you wanted most
but you can't send true love through the post

it's fragile
fragile like you
like you

","Fragile, Don't Crush",1995
Softies,"fireworks the night that we were going
to meet tiffany
flashbulbs popped and all the stars
fell into the sea
or was it a river you were walking
single file with me
oh my goodness what a charming personality

heart condition, you give me a heart condition

my days are full and nights are planned but I just
want to be with you
let's go out and shoplift low top converse tennis shoes
hey I heard your favorite colors
are brown and baby blue
or I mean it when I say that this
brand new love is true

heart condition, you give me a heart condition

my head is in the clouds and I'm not even tall
you're the one for me, boy there's no doubt at all

heart condition, you give me a heart condition

",Heart Condition,1995
Softies,"packing boxes all night
reading letters from you for the last time
for real
leaving you behind was easy
now I know how little you feel

now I wasted all my wishes on you
I have nothing left to gain
so goodbye, wishing you well and hello rain
I made a paper boat and watched it going down the drain
so goodbye, wishing you well and hello rain

thought I'd thrown them all away
finding one last souvenir behind
my bureau drawer
feeling sad all on my own
I don't need you for that anymore

and I wasted all my wishes on you
I have nothing left to gain
so goodbye, wishing you well and hello rain
I made a paper boat and watched it going down the drain
so goodbye, wishing you well and hello rain

you can't stand to see me losing
all my precious sinlessness
now my heart is out of your hands
you couldn't possibly want it back
any less

",Hello Rain,1995
Softies,"there's no competing with him
I can't keep you warm like that
I can't love you the way he does
I can only love you more

there's no convincing me
that you'll still talk to me like you did
I can't bear to see you like this
it makes me love you more

and more than anything ever
you're beautiful and always so clever
you're everything good, I hope that I might be
I hope he sees even half of what I see

there's nothing keeping you with me
you can go away with him
there's no sense in rubbing it in
it makes me love you more

I can't compete with that boy
I can't make you feel like that
I can't love you the way he does
I can only love you more

and more each time you ignore me
this jealousy is starting to bore me
you can have him and I'll have my own
or maybe I'd just rather end up alone

",I Love You More,1995
Softies,"you're a sure sign of heaven above
and you're past the line between I like and I love
but I'm trusting you to always be mine and be true

and there's no reason we can't call it what it is
it's love it's love, it's love it's love

there's a good chance any time of the day
I'll be thinking of you in the nicest way
I haven't slept in days and I know that I'll feel this always

and there's no reason we can't call it what it is
it's love it's love, it's love it's love

I can't help but tell everyone
this is the best thing I've ever done
I owe you everything
you turned my winter to spring
this must be love
",It's Love,1995
Softies,"on a perfect afternoon
thinking you would be there soon
by the evening time
it was obvious you were no longer mine

you should have written, you might have called
you should have never led me on at all
but you were always a few days ahead of me
and there was always someone else instead of me
instead of me

sitting perfectly still
barely fighting off the chill
feeling cold, feeling dumb
it was becoming clear that you wouldn't come

you should have written, you might have called
you should have never made this plan at all
but you were always a few days ahead of me
and there was always someone else instead of me
instead of me
",Perfect Afternoon,1995
Softies,"since you asked me not to go I won't
but if you asked me if I know why
I'd have to say I don't

so silly me I thought you were the one
silly me are you having fun
and a promise is a promise still
if I have to stay up all night I will
waiting here in the dark until you tell

you're stumbling over what you say
and if I haven't hurt your feelings then
why do you act this way

so silly me I thought you were the one
silly me are you having fun
and a promise is a promise still
if I have to stay up all night I will
waiting here in the dark until you...

tell me when did this get old
when did you get so cold
I'm losing trying to figure how
and please don't try to spare my heart
it's much too late to start
caring what I'm feeling now

excuse me if I've lost my smile
I'm a little disappointed and this
might take me a while

",Until You Tell,1995
Softies,"He put her heart into his pocket
He didn't think to give it back
She didn't do a thing to stop it
Just one less thing now to unpack

Oh, now she's home
And since he never calls her
Then he'll never have to know

He drove away to watch the sunrise
She only saw it set away
He doesn't think of her the way she thinks of him
He fell asleep, she stayed awake

Oh, now she's home
And since he never calls her
Then he'll never have to know

She tries to write him a letter
All she can write is ""I love you""
This envelope will never make it to the postbox
She's feeling stupid and confused

The mirror image of fear in your eyes

",Anywhere But Here,1997
Softies,"I want you to see boats, so you took me to the sea
I felt like I could fly in this new sky you showed to me
Airplanes passed above us, so only i could hear
When you whispered ""I love you"" so sweetly in my ear
These are the best days (2x)
Night time on an empty shore - foggy like my head
Drifting off to sleep to all those silly things you said
Waking for a moment, to say that we'd be fine
You hid your smile with one hand and with the other you held mine
These are the best days (5x)

",The Best Days,1997

to make a fool of me

but I'm alright this way

I feel so naive next to her

So close but never close enough

You wrote it down

I've been thinking about you and only you

You are like the morning time
Full of promise yet to find
I'm dazzled every time I realize you're mine

I never thought that I would see
The day that you would come to me
And ask forgiveness
For the time we let go by

I've been thinking of you and only you

Did you find a four leaf clover
Did you hope that I'd come over

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I'd never known
When you smiled, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

Si hace falta por ti me parto los dientes 
Olvidar el pasado me enseñó 
Que pensar en el futuro es la amargura del presente 

La distancia es un veneno que nos mata 
Y para venenos me quedo con tu mirada 
Algo que me atrae, una droga que me ata 
La heroína que me salva, pero que vuela sin capa 

Y no no no
Me buscó perdida y por eso no me encontró 
Yo sano mis heridas con tu voz 
Qué pena que esté lejos de mi oscura habitación 

Me despierto, pero sigo estando triste 
Me afecta todo, lo sabes, lo viste 
Que me he pasado una eternidad buscando 
La razón para entender por qué te fuiste

Sigo sentado en el banco de este parque 
Oliendo el perfume que dejaste 
Prefiero abrirme para amarte 
Que cerrar mi corazón con alcohol para olvidarte

Lo malo del cero es que no sabe dividirse 
Si no existe una persona que sume también 

Yo sé que toda mi vida la puedo perder solo en una mañana 
Que si no me quedo contigo al final lo que no quedarán son las ganas 
Qué fácil es decir “te quiero” pa’ nada, sólo te daba mis alas 
¿Quién tiene culpa, yo que las daba o tú que nunca valorabas?

Informier dich warum du glaubst warum du hier bist

war durch dumme Menschen
und ihr Handeln immer zugegen
Es gab böse Blicke und es gab harte Worte
Ein Mensch bist du vielleicht,
aber eine andere Sorte
Ein 'Neger', ein 'Nigger'
oder 'Bimbo' das bist du

auch noch Schläge hinzu

These racist cats hating me ‘cause I'm an African
I married white, racial times had my life in danger
I grew up all alone and that became the perfect stranger
1980 when the war was almost at its peak
Like helicopters in the sky, coming down the streets
I saw them kill a lot of people right before my eyes
I fought the white mob, black, had me picking sides
‘Cause no one wants you when you're mixed
I was caught between a game of chess
Nightmares every time I dreamed
The day he struck was sucking blood like apartheid
I couldn't cry so I bottled it inside
These crazy dogs biting flesh off my people
I grew up wondering why we weren't born equal
Fight the power, yeah, let the battle start
A lonely soldier in the war, we're torn apart

Manchmal klebt Blut daran, 
Schaut euch ihre Zäune an, 
Manchmal klebt Blut daran, 
Schaut euch ihre feste an, 
Manch einer glaubt fest daran,
Er hat die weiße weste an und hält sich für den besten Mann.

Es gibt eine kleine Lücke,
Durch diese kannst du fliehen,
Mach dich klein wie eine Mücke und lauf bist du berge siehst
Dann sind es noch vier tage
Bis der Fluß durch Felder fließt,
Doch die zahlen sind nur wage,
Also warte, bis du es selber siehst

Schaut euch ihre Hände an
Manchmal klebt Blut daran,
Schaut euch ihre Zäune an,
Manchmal klebt Blut daran
Schaut euch ihre feste an
Manch einer glaubt fest daran,
Er hat die weiße weste an

Und bei den ersten Sonnenstrahlen,
Versteckst du dich im Wald
Denn wie die ersten strahlen suchen sie alsbald
Und dann erzähl von den Höllenqualen,
Erzähl von de Gewalt
Sollen sie nur weiter prahlen
Der Herr erhört

Schaut euch ihre Hände an

So wie die Nacht über die Welt
Schnellt Gefahr aus der dunkelheit
Bin ich zum ersten Schlag bereit
Ich bin der erste, der dich befreit
Und einer der letzten, der um dich weint

Und wenn ein Lied meine Lippen verlässt
Dann nur damit du Liebe empfängst
Durch die Nacht und das dichteste Geäst
Damit du keine Ängste mehr kennst

In unserer Sanduhr fällt das letzte Korn
Ich hab gewonnen und hab ebenso verloren
Jedoch missen möcht' ich nichts
Alles bleibt unser gedanklicher Besitz
Und eine bleibende Erinnerung
Zwischen Tag und Nacht legt sich die Dämmerung

Und wenn ein Lied meine Lippen verlässt

Manche Wesen sind so schön.
Innen wie aussehen.
Sie verwöhnen
Deine Sinne und gewöhnen
Dich wieder an Liebe, die du kennst,
Zu der du immer wieder rennst.
Diese Liebe ist real,
So real wie Höllenqualen.
Doch Höllenqualen sind egal,
Wenn sich die Liebe dir entfacht.

Doch es ist gut wie es ist.
Der Mensch lernt nur, wenn er Scheiße frisst,
Sonst reift er nicht.
Er weiß doch nichts.
Ich weiß noch nicht,
Wann verstreicht die Frist?

Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen.
Trotzdem ist Liebe wunderschön,
Ist unsichtbar und trotzdem da.
Freude und Leid das ganze Jahr,
Man nimmt das Leben sonst nicht wahr.

Denn mit dem Herz sind wir meist blind.
Wer von uns ist schon wie ein Kind?
Offen für alles wie der Wind,
Der doch dem Meer den Regen bringt
Er ist so frei und doch gewillt.

Gib mir einen Koffer für mein Herz,
Der ist unendlich viel mehr wert,
Wenn du ihn mitnimmst, wenn du gehst,
Ihn bei dir trägst von früh bis spät,
Ihn dann zurück bringst unversehrt.

Ich lauf des öfteren Gefahr,
Zu vergessen wie schön das Leben bisher war.

Wir lieben das Leben und sind dafür bereit.

Söhne Mannheims,"So wie sich´s darstellt
Ist auf keinen recht Verlass
Bis auf die, die man liebt 
Und auf die, die man hasst
Die Politik ist nicht an allem schuld
Das ist natürlich Quatsch,
Doch schuldlos ist sie auch nicht
Und manches ist echt krass
Doch wir machen alle Fehler
Und wir bauen alle Mist,
Es wird wohl keiner hier behaupten
Dass er fehlerfrei ist
Ich sag das nur so deutlich
Dass es keiner mehr vergisst
Die Lieder dieses Albums gehen mit manchen ins Gericht
Und zwar mir denen die uns verführen
Und denen die uns bedrohen
Denen die uns täuschen, 
Doch deren Kampf ist nicht verloren
Deswegen singen wir davon
Denn dafür sind wir geboren
Deswegen dringt der Klang der Instrumente
An eure Ohren

Wir haben alles in Musik verpackt
Was wichtig erschien
Aber prüft lieber zweimal
Ob es euch zu Wahrheit dient
Denn wir sind nur Menschen
Und sicher nicht unfehlbar
Das behauptet nur der Papst von sich
Dass das nicht stimmt ist eh klar
Noch was ist klar
Und zwar dass wir Vergebung brauchen
Jeder Tag könnte der letzte sein
So wie die Dinge laufen
Nichts ist mehr unmöglich
Nahrungsmittel tödlich
Keiner klärt uns auf
Aber Aufklärung wär nötig
Man hört immer wieder Menschen sagen
Diesen Wichser töt ich
Wichser heißt Politiker, Chefs und Polizisten
Wenn wir bei dieser Meinung bleiben
Sind wir nichts als Faschisten
Doch wenn wir gleich davon sprechen
Dass wir die Armen und Schwachen rächen
Dass wir mit Worten töten ist es dann ein Verbrechen
Wahrscheinlich schon, doch wie sollen wir das Joch sonst brechen
Die Ebenen auf denen wir kämpfen sind geistige Flächen
Die dem was wir kennen nicht in geringsten entsprechen.

Wir brauchen keine Waffen
Und bei uns fließt kein Blut
Bei allem was wir aussprechen
Brauchen wir Mut
Denn wir sprechen Dinge aus
Und sprechen Dinge an
Die nicht jeder wissen soll
Mit denen nicht jeder kann
Der HERR ist unser Hirte
Und ich glaube seinen Worten
Er hat uns jetzt die Macht gegeben
Feinde zu orten
Und so wandten wir sie an
Und haben sie gefunden
Und drehen nun im Geiste über ihnen unsre Runden
Und tun keinem was zu leide
Mit den Songs auf dieser Scheibe
Oder glaubt ihr etwa wirklich
Dass wir solche Macht besitzen
Um mit der Macht unserer Worte
Unsere Feinde aufzuschlitzen
Manche von uns glauben dran
Andre wieder nicht
Wer weiß ob man uns glauben kann
Glaubt uns besser nicht
Es ist ein Traum, den man nicht rauben kann
Beraubt uns besser nicht
Wir ihr merken könnt
Sind wir nicht immer einig, nicht immer einig, nicht immer einig.
Jeder hat ne eigene Sicht
Auf die Dinge
Jeder wirft sein eigenes Licht
Auf die Themen die ich bringe
Doch ich weiß dass wir Licht ins Dunkel bringen wollen
Und dass alle die uns zuhören mit den Themen ringen sollen

Das ist vielleicht die letzte Platte ""best of's"" ausgenommen

We've lost our trust
Now pay they must
Give way they must
We'll be coming to kill all psychopaths

It's a science when you deal with the molecular structure
Of energy and you are the conductor
Life is your symphony notating reality
On a planet that's stranded somewhere in the galaxy
The complexity of the cosmos is immense
I absorb my surroundings, capture these events
Form a quick sentence, sink deep into a verse
That explores all corners of the universe
Describe as far as the boundaries of words can
So that my words can be heard by all man, my plan
Capture and expose moments in poetry lyrically
Describe it graphically, my capacity
No matter the weather, come rain, sleet or snow
Portray the architecture of man to let the world know
This is my new assignment
Escape this earth's environment

I will kill you with some lyrics
Coming out of my life
Won't kill you with a hammer
But my words are like dart
Coming at you like flying fists of martial arts

It's that unexplainable feeling I get in my heart
It's the same components that turn words into art
It's that inner part of me that's still in the dark
I depart searching for life, birth was the start
On a magnificent voyage I quest the earth's surface
I know it seems worthless, I know I have a purpose
Adjust to the moments, adapt to situations
Life simulation, infinite variations
The stimulation helps me soothe the beast
From the tropical savanna to these concrete streets
My reflection reflects like the sun from a mirror
Mind and body connect and explode like nuclear
I stride on a stage like a model does a catwalk
Talk in poetry and expression, may teach a lesson
Maybe stressing on some free style tip
No matter what style I pick you know I'm feeling it 
It's how I adapt to the linguistics 
Using methods derived from within the mystic
Elements of word construction, verses run deep
Don't sleep

Hab keine Angst vor morgen.
Denn es liegt heute schon, der grösste Zahler vorn, wurde mir verborgen
Die Zeit läuft schnell ab und bevor sie zerfließt
Das Leben ist ein Privileg und deshalb genieß', ich
Nicht nur die Erinnerung an mich, lass sie geh’n
Ich will lieber ein neues Jahr für uns und lass die Zeiger stehn'

Alle Zeiten ab und wir bleiben steh’n
Das ist ein Augenblick für’s Leben
Wir holen uns zurück, was verloren ging
Lass dein Moment nicht ziehen

Alle Zeiten ab und die Welt bleibt steh'n
Lass Dir den Augenblick nicht nehmen
Wir warten keine Sekunde länger
Kein Schritt geht mehr zurück, kein Schritt geht mehr zurück

Und genieß' den Augenblick
Solang Du noch kannst
Solang's Dich noch gibt
Solang Du's noch spüren kannst
Solang Du noch kannst
Solang's Dich noch gibt
Solang Du's noch spüren kannst

Alle Zeiten ab und die Welt bleibt steh'n
Lass Dir den Augenblick nicht nehmen
Wir warten keine Sekunde länger (Keine Sekunde)

Genieß' den Augenblick
Solang Du noch kannst
Solang's Dich noch gibt (solang's Du's noch spürst)

Und genieß' den Augenblick

They had to count them all

Will I remain the same?
The cost of getting forced into something

If there's anything to regret, I would've been told

Is there anyone, who can get it done?

Away from me, away from me?

Was I meant to get old?
Repressing the agonies

Still waiting for a constant thing to react
But I will save myself some of the time
Keep aiming for a constant thing to react
As the sleeper awakes

Mesmerized by the memories that walk by my side
Shelter comes easy
As soon as the sadness sets in
By an impulse the search will begin

Searching, collecting all the things I possess
Detecting, the insight I've earned in distress
Learning, finally I know how to breathe
Turning, turning away from the greed

So unpleasant, it strikes whenever I call
So relentless as I fall
A grand awakening will kill it all
Nevertheless I'll be my own precious god

I can't resist
The things I've missed
And I'll make sure
It will last this time, I will insist

And its never gonna be it again
'Cause we got nothing prepared for what is coming up
When the dollar is the focus of men, and you know
All the solutions we don't talk about
'Cause wed rather talk about ourselves right now
And if we are whats killing US
We take the form of the storm up ahead, now follow me

Its rising all around
And I've seen those roots, they're ripping
And they rip out from the ground

And we will, just look around
And you can watch us tear it down

The situations coming down to this
What matters to us all in the end? And you know
Total destruction is on the horizon, if you are
Standing on the out looking in.
And our congress and president never ever mention it,
Can't even figure out same sex marriages
While we kill each other every day,
And while we kill our earth in every way,
It's coming down.
We've got this love inside us,
And we've got this hatred too
We've got this battle raging,
And we've let the soldiers loose
We sit and watch and wonder
Possible outcomes
Will what we need deep inside
Become what we want before

Sojourn,"My child arrived just the other day
Came into the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin’ ‘fore I knew it, and as he grew
He’d say “I’m gonna be like you, Dad
You know I’m gonna be like you.”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

My son turned ten just the other day
He said, “Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let’s play
Can you teach me to throw?” I said, “Not today
I got a lot to do”, he said, “That’s ok.”
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed
And said, “I’m gonna be like him, yeah.
You know I’m gonna be like him.”

And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, Dad?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, son
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man I just had to say
“Son, I’m proud of you. Can you sit for a while?”
He shook his head and said with a smile,
“What I’d really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later. Can I have them please?”

Well, the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon
“When you comin’ home, son?”
“I don’t know when, but we’ll get together then, Dad
You know we’ll have a good time then.”

Well, I’ve long since retired; my son’s moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said, “I’d like to see you if you don’t mind.”
He said, “I’d love to, Dad, if I can find the time.
You see, my new job’s a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it’s sure nice talking to you, Dad.
It’s been sure nice talking to you.”

And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He’d grown up just like me
My boy was just like me

Lyrical, blink your eye, the storm

Never saw me comin' but I made sure you was warned

In a blaze I run a gun high, I'm soundin' a horn

See my glarin', stunnin' runnin' by negative four

When I see you shunnin', gimme when I need it or I take it

Fuck game, pass the blame, ain't no need to be fakin'

Motha-fuckas want to bring it to the point where I'm brakin'

Feel the wrath in the heart nigga, ain't no mistakin'

Do away until the corn comin', follow the rain

In it goes, swallow pride like you swallow my pain

Where the grain, feel my fire, don't you wish you was tame

Can't you say it, made it clear, keep ?em yellin' my name

In tight situations we niggaz run off

Done off, when the guns go off

Blaow, 'bout to light shit up

Quicker than cops write shit up

If it get to hectic then you might get stuck

Locked and tied up

While the key players still keep playin'

Never burn bitches cause you might need faces

Bust seven caps, stack the three layers

Or the house by the mile before see neighbors

Suspects, what the fuck next?

I double up tecks like I shuffle up decks

Move relationships for those who cut checks

I want what I want, nothin' less

Not even one second a memory I had
Since you came my way
I hope you know I'll gladly go
Anywhere you take me ain't no limit to this love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above

The first time I met you
I didn't sweat you
My Juliet I knew that I catch you
Gave you the key to my heart you unlocked it
A perfect match you the plug in the socket
As time moved on we became friends
I knew was love at first sight and it wasn't 'bout to get wit this
You was there when I needed you
I remember writing letters on the road I want to be wit you
I know we young and we got time
Little soldiers need love so girl I want to make you mine
We could row together, go to shows together
My best friend girl lets grow together


We could walk together rode buses together
Ya moms call us telling things we stuck together
We at park playin' hide-go-seek
I find you, or you find me
This was meant to be
They call us little one and shorty
Find us hugged up at every school party
We study together, ball together
Somebody said cupid must've brought us together
I love your cute eyes and you love my tight braids
Play video games almost everyday
And when we not together we on the phone
Talkin' 'bout our first kiss and we don't want to be alone


And I remember so while how your smile
Made me feel bright like the sun shine
I'm so glad that you mine, you my Juliet
I never let the jealous ones in between and that's a safe bet
And we could get the study in after school is over
Homework is a must so we can come over
And have the words we could hit the mall zip ices and cotton candy
And after that come chill wit the family

Got to tell you how you have me
I'm so happy that you came in here and changed my world
Bye Bye sadness hello Rome
You're the only boy that found someone that's so in love
I'll follow you to the moon and the sky above",True Love,2002

That I'd end up really feelin' you

But what if he tells that to every girl he talks to
'Cause I'm not the only
But actually wish that I could be

He's what I've been lookin' for
Like no other guy that I know

Some people say that life is full of pain but I look at life as it 
Were a flower taking all the good instead of all the bad and turning 
It around with what we have. And everything we do and everything we 
Say soon will all become what we have made, when walking out your 
Door remember there's much more so why don't you just...

I will take you on a fantasy 
And we can get along in this wonderland

In this wonderland, woahhh.....

You never use more than just words can say,
But I can explain how it holds its power.
Remember every dream that kept you in your sleep,
The places you would go, you've never been,
And everywhere we go, everything we do, 
Soon it all becomes a part of you.
When wishing on your star,
Remember who you are,
So why don't you just....

Woahh, 
Won't you come with me,
No, no, ohhh.

Life is whatever you make,
Sometimes it's never enough,

Come and go with me,
Let your self be free,

Freedom
Come along, come along

Sing my song, sing my song

So I'll make a choice to be me for money
'cause they say both are impossible for me
But I know that there is room to learn and to grow
So I'll show them that whatever life brings me I'll cope

When life feels rough, where do you go?

When compromise won't work on life...

(It's just not enough, just not enough for me)

When time regrets you're on this place...
(It's just not enough, just not enough for me)

I wanna be free
I just wanna be free
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

So I'll live to survive and to be real
And I'll give my story as long as my will...

I'll be free of all the living boundaries set for me
And I'll see whatever this world offers for freedom-dom-dom-dom-dom-dom

I feel so claustrophobic in here
Leave your labels, leave with no patience
Hear my voice and fill with your ears
I'm no soul, girl, equipped with no afro
I'm just my God given name

I'm not becoming expectations
I'm not her and never will be
Two girls gone in different direction
Striving towards the same galaxy
Let my star light shine on its own
No, I'm no sister, I'm just my God given name

And I'm sorry if this planet that I'm living on is quizzical
My lyrical ambition some times don't ring a bell
I'm sorry if my visual don't lie to put my feelings
And my physical exhibit doesn't represent me well
I'm sorry if I'm curious, delirious and I don't take life serious

I'm here at the life of a million debts
And I'm sorry if I'm talking shit
But I really do mean well

We gotta long, long moon to glow
At least the long road to travel
I gotta dream to keep my eyes open
We gotta long, long moon to glow
At least the long road to travel

I wanna know where we going
I'm right beside you 07 

Street lights twilights
There's a liquor store
By his playground
It's raining a cash flow
But it sits well at home
It's a hustle
Now a mother use to hustle
To a different tune
There's a midnight thrilling
And oh the traffic's heavy burning light
Don't slow you down

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where the
Way I want to know. 

Street life crowded
That's his way out the illusion
Teachers failing
Our hero lives on TV
No my break keeps all eyes closed
While his are so open
Take it in three ways, I know it
Nowadays nothing wrong
Cause everything goes
We think trouble fulfilling 

Don't let me fall victim to this human nature
I know the way it is don't mean that's how its suppose
To be, oh I wonder where this broken
Place is going to take us, and where's the

Solange,"Who would've known, the wind and the sunshine
Would oh baby, baby
Build up these walls of mine
And I can't see you or breathe you
Cause there's trouble right beneath you
It's all in the night
But oh baby, baby
Come pick me up in your ride

I'm a cool low Jane
With the skip on my feet
I play tough as nails
With my heart on my sleeve
I'm nothing but a sand castle

You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away
Baby I know, you do that to all the girls
You know that I'm fragile, oh
Bay ba ba ba baby, don't blow me away

Who would've known, the storm of my past time
Would oh baby, make me
Losing the song of the eye
And I can't believe you or read you
Cause there's pleasure in your preview
It's all in your eyes
But oh Mr. DJ, baby
Can you meet me outside

You're an old school dude
With the kick on ya shoes
You've got groove in ya hands
The way you spend those tunes
I'm nothing but a sandcastle
Baby don't blow me away, away

Baby I know, you do that to all the girls

Lays right there behind me
Look over my sandcastle
And there's a sight to see
Don't blow me away

Where the girls feel like girls
And the world is painted cotton candy (cotton candy)
Where the sweet lemonade of McGregor street (sweet lemonade)
Was the best damn thing of the summer breeze
Your dad drives a foreign car (a foreign car)
And your mama looks like a beauty queen

Now the sour bitter taste (sour bitter taste)
Of a colorless waste
Seems to light up my nights somehow
And the music I play must be 
Loud, loud, loud, loud
Loud as can be
So I don't have to hear myself think (no, no)
So I don't to wake up from this dream (no, no)

I don't wanna sing no single mama blues
I'm not singing look at me I've been abused
Oh I'm another silly lost girl staring at you (staring at you)

And soar the night away (ba, ba,)

I'm not suicidal (no)
Not an alcoholic (no)
I'm not out here hoein'
So just shut the fuck up (shut the fuck up)

Once in a while (once in a while)
When the sun does its job
Lets the clouds take a nice day off (day off)

So I got reason to fly

Sitting right there beside me
On a spring day

Different by the proof that
I was feeling

Can sneak up on you
And tell you just what to do
It has no time, no place
It's just chooses you

In a lifetime

A longing and hatred of myself
But one or two end up alone
So the night I saw you, I could pretend I felt you
You’re beautiful and I felt like everybody saw
But the truth is, so much that I hated your endorsement
Try and deny it, I tried to fight it
But I bought you red color with a 99 buff
Looking for the diamond line to us
But eventually become a asshole
To the others, the group from the outside world
So now I’m calling out for a way
To give myself in
Remember when you kissed me, when I was 17
Your skin so soft and you were the shit
But you loved me

So maybe then we’re better off
Well maybe if this is all you wanted it
Leave me alone

Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes
Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of greatness
Who knows what stands in front of our lives

Silence tells me secretly ev'rything, ev'rything
Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star

Solas,"I sat within the valley green
I sat me with my true love
My sad heart strove the two between
The old love and the new love

The old for her the new that made me
Think on Ireland dearly
While the soft wind blew down the glen
And it shook the golden barley

T'was hard the woeful words to frame
T'was worse the tide that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame
Of foreign chains around us

And so I said the mountain glen
I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men
While soft wind shakes the barley

While sad I kissed away her tears
My fond arms 'round her flinging
When a foe man's shot burst on our ears
From out the wild wood ringing

And a bullet pierced my true love's side
In life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died
While soft wind shakes the barley

And blood for blood without remorse
I've taken at oulart hollow
I've lain my true love's clay full corpse
Where I full soon will follow

Around her grave I've wandered drear
Noon, night, and morning early
With a breaking heart when ever I hear
The wind that shakes the barley

",The Wind That Shakes the Barley,1997
Solas,"It's a mighty hard row my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have travelled this hot dusty road
Out of your dustbowl and westward we roam
Through deserts so hot and through mountains so cold

I've wandered all over your green growing land
Wherever your crops are, I'll lend you my hand
On the edge of your cities, you'll see me and then
I come with the dust and I'm gone with the wind

California, Arizona, I've worked on your crops
And northward up to Oregon to gather your hops
I've dug beets from the ground, I've cut grapes from the vine
To set at your table that white sparkling wine

Green pastures of plenty from the dry desert ground
From the grand Coolie Dam where the waters run down
In every state of this union we migrants have been
We work on the land and we'll fight until we win

It's always we ramble, that river and I
All along your green valleys I'll work till I die
Travel this road until death sets me free
Because pastures of plenty must always be free",Pastures of Plenty,1998

But would you change me back to a witch
And let me live in the arms of a sorry old elm?

In the flesh of your newly-cleaned frescoes
Where Jesus holds John to his breast

Wrapped around and rocking slowly
No one bound to be so holy
In your gown of fleur de lis

But would you change my back to a witch?
As a witch would I love you more than any man

Coming out of 112 one late night
Seen some scandalous hoes in my eye sight
Now being the bitch I am, payed it no mind
Gave niggaz that then hoped in the ride
Pulled out the heat from under the seat
Make sure the doors locked and the guns cocked
Pulled out the lock
Now I'm leavin the spot
Made a right on Cheser Bridge
Now I'm rollin down the block
Floatin across 80 by north
I seen some headlights rollin tight behind the Porche
MotherFucker bumped my shit
Oh now it's on
Thinkin it's an accident
Though I could be wrong
{motherfucker} Payin myself if niggaz really want it
Hit another exit so a bitch wouldn't get cornered
Couldn't keep going, niggaz will follow you home
Smack you with the chrome and take everything you own
I was taught better than that
So I grabs the gat
Holds my own
Don't need no one to watch my back
Lookin towards the heavens through the sun roof
Shit, I know I ain't untouchable and I know I ain't bullet proof
But I'll put it on these niggaz if need be
Your dead, On some two to you chest and two to your head
Lord please don't let it go there
All I see is a BP and I'm in the middle of nowhere
I'm ready for whatever and I know the routine
Before I get out the whip I check the gun magazine
Hoped out like ""What the fuck ya'll got to be crazy""
Some tall nigga talkin bout ""Yo hold on baby, it was just an accident""
I can't believe this happening
Then I see the Cherokee pull up in the back of him
Now I'm really on p
Oh, that's them same bitches from the club that was grilling me
So I pulled out the fifth
You niggaz coming for me
Money had his hands up, I smacked him with the heat
that's when one bitch hoped out the jeep, I fired a shot
I missed her
But it cornered the drivers side and hit her sister
I ducked behind my whip
Bitch still popping
Wait for her to stop so I can hit her with a hot one
It's getting hard to maneuverer
I kicked my heels off
Had him knocked out
Stumbled to his shit and them he peeled off
Perfect distraction
GS is passin
I rose platinum sounded like a round of applause
I pack a line when a cock it back and I rore's
Now I'm the type that will get at the drama to it's gone
You bitches want to dance then they playin our song
I'm done fucking with you
Jumped behind the dumpster
Reload the pistol
Pucker up until it kiss ya
I can't explain why this is going on
But tonight ot's on
Fuck who right and fuck who wrong
I got you in my sight, gun in my palm
Surprisingly calm
Lick of a shot, hit her in the arm
She running got my gun hot
Try to escape she pulled her dead friend out of the driver's side
Licked off a shot
Put it in the leg
I ain't gonna kill you quick, bitch I'm gonna make you beg
She still got in though and mashed the gas
I put four in the door and got out of the way fast
The jeep swerved and started to stray
Heading for the gas tank guiding my stance
Hit it with the last one, contact,it blows up
I bolted out before the APB shows up
Throwed my shit and fifth
Bucked forty on the dash
In my rear view
I seen the aftermath of the blast
To protect mine I send demons to hell
Stay strong just to live long
Those who weak they and fell
Knowing happened shouldn't have went down but it did
If it's me and you, bitch I gots to live
I know with guns hell
Only one can prevail
Either it's a done deal
Live by steel or behind steel
Ain't nothing fair
We in this for real
Could have ended up dead tonight or ended up in jail
Pacing in my cell
Trying to raise bail
And on top of all that, this bitch made me break my motherfucking nail
Fucked my shit up
I told Tricky ass I ain't want to go out tonight
Now I got to get this shit fixed",Da Story,1999
Solé,"[Intro]
Yeah, at one point, I thought I couldn't live without you
But now, I don't how the fuck I lived with you
But I just take that shit as a lesson learned 
That what goes around, comes around
And yours is comin' muthafucka, believe that

[Sole']
Nightmares of love gone wrong
Got me writin' this song 
Played it out, back in my mind and heart you used to belong
Rewind it back, thought it was nice when 2 became 1

Bet you never thought Sole' would turn and leave you with none
Would of thought I gave you life, had me bent like a comma
Love turned to hate for fillin' my life with bullshit and drama
Played games, told me lies, steady pullin' these strings

And put me up in fly ass cribs and had my flossin' them things
While you was runnin' wild, had me busy shoppin' and shit
Hittin' the clubs with my girls, wasn't no stoppin' a bitch
Throwin' bills like I'm Mickey, I was spendin' it fast

Sure money nice but sure as hell don't make relationships last
Gave my all, did it all, tryin' to make sure it worked
While you ran the streets and even had me doin' your dirt
Dumb tricks and dumb skits I was pullin' for you

A dumb bitch and dumb shit I went through
For the love of you

[Chorus: x2]
And you know
I didn't want to live without you babe
Never thought I would throw your love away
Now I'm gone and you're lonely, it's a shame
But I did it for the love of you, babe

[Sole']
Would of gave my life to save yours, nigga
Push came to shove
A bullet with your name I'd change to mine
And nigga, that's love

Prayers that you'd be spared from wickedness that lived in the streets
And when them niggas you was beefin' wit start bringin' da heat
I got involved in dumb shit that didn't involve me at all
Had bitches scratchin' up my car and then you havin' the gall

To say it wasn't your fault and that you wasn't to blame
Thought you would come home after drama, have me screamin' your name
Young and dumb, I took you back pretendin' I couldn't see
You havin' babies on the side while you still fuckin' wit me

Things was never right, forever fight that's what we would do
Then I saw the light my game was tight from runnin' wit you
You had me stressed out and thinkin' that its time that I quit
So I wouldn't leave, had me believe I wasn't worth shit

It's crazy, yo it amaze me, these afairs of the heart
I look back and realize it wasn't love from the start

[Chorus: x4]

[Sole']
How things can change, one day infatuated, washin' your drawls
Another day, it's screams and fightin' dishes breakin' on walls
Walk in relationship, I'm sane thinkin' that you were too
A year later, I'm fuckin' crazy, throwin' glasses at you

And scratchin' up yo car, I take it far, I'm cuttin' yo tires
Don't understand it, why my heart is steady playin' wit fire
I turned psychotic, you got it, in this sick relationship
I'm tryin' to run you off the road, you and that broke-down bitch

I'm too fly for that shit, I'm lookin' back in disgust
The nights I cried, the times you lied all blown away with a gust
Things I did for your love, they was never returned
Gave all the jewelry to my moms and then your pictures I burned

You can't turn no little boy into no grown ass man
So change yo game and get it tight, if that's your previous plan
Boots is made for walkin', finally learned what life was about
Pulled it together, grabbed my Gucci boots and stepped the fuck out

The shower when the phone rings lookin' for me, now that figures
Then the door bell, who could it be? It's my niggas
Wanna get up in my closet and floss it
Make a move never used but I'm grabbin' and tossin'

Comin' too, still new, but I'm lookin' fo' shoes to rock wit' it
Get the tightest jeans, Gucci the theme, lock wit' it
Little panties but I'm ditchin' the bra, no back in it
Got the tightest strings know what I mean, no slack in it

Yell for KC, see if she ready, let's ride
Hear my other girls pull in the drive outside
Last brace, see the angel will last all night
Check the locks, blow this nigga a kiss from last night

Get my keys and I'm droppin' the top S K
Blowin' in the wind, wavin' or not Parlay
With the range and the six in the rear, it's all woman, we stunnin'

Havin' niggas throw the finest of riches at my crew

Sayin' nothin' and these niggas is sweatin' come wit' it
Know they want the ass, watchin' 'em bettin' on who get it

Screamin' niggas follow closely behind outside
Time to go, leave 'em wonderin' why dreams die
Thought you come wit' me, heard it from who? Damn lie

Puttin' it down, me and Santa forever, blazed that
Hit the door, and my nigga is waitin', I'm wit' that

Your girlfriend's lyin', baby; it wasn't me
Your girl said I hit it, baby; it wasn't me
Your girl wants to do it to me
She wants to give it to me
She will not stop until I let her come and do it to me

[Sole]
I need to ask you a question
This thing that I heard; it got me stressin'
I'm guessin', baby, comin' to you for your confession
If you did it, then you besta tell me straight up
'Cause what I heard completely overwhelmed me
Don't try to sell me, then compel me to be packin' and gone
Or better yet, I'll pack you up before the end of the song
But if I'm wrong, then my complete apology; you will see
This cannot happen; now you know that I don't want to believe
That you would be forever lettin' other women receive
The love you give me everyday
I find it hard to conceive
But if it's true, then I'm a have to tell you this is the end
I'll ask you once, not again
Was you f***in' my friend?
Tell me now

[Chorus x 2]

[Sole]
Now let me tell you what she told me
She said that you was fake and phony
F***in' my homie, actin' like you don't even know me
Sayin' time and time again that you was leavin' me lonely
Ridin' my pony, Angie and this chick named Romie
Tellin' me the way you hit it when I left for the Keys
Talkin' 'bout the carpet burnin' she received to the knees
The multiple orgasms with the greatest of ease
And orally the way you had her screamin', beggin' you please
And she was trouble from the start when I met her one night
If I leave, ""Dear John"" will be the letter you find
If you want her, you can have her
It ain't wetter than mine
It be another man's gain
It ain't better than mine
Now tell me

[Chorus x 2]

[Sole]
I know she lies, but the details was all too clear
And I know better than to run with everything that I hear
Trust was never a problem for us
It was perfectly clear
It's been like happy ever after for the past two years
I know she wants you though
She said it on the night that we met
Now she takin' drastic measures
Tryin' to see if she get
She fightin' in a battle that she know she never could win
Step it down to a six when you workin' with ten
Want to walk in my heels?
Want to walk with my deals?
Want to know how it feel?
I'm just bein' for real
I take your word for it this time
I'm stayin' with you
Make sure it never happen
I ain't playin' with you

Never thought I'd be this tight, what

It's a trip how people change in this game
But it's still the same

Never caught behind, twist-ups of the mind
Why I can't bring that body ?
Flipped it last time, press rewind
Script it, that time, got ya mind
Boys wasn't wit it, had to recline
Laid back, fade back plenty of times
Tommy boy's filled with plenty of rhymes
Back there niggas never called me fine
One of the guys that scouts the scene
Roughed up, stuffed up, left the scene
Why'all bitches wouldn't never believe
That their niggas was checkin' for me
Little girl, curls, that was me
Little world, swirls, that was me
Drama unfold, that was me
Drama fun, girls that was me
Scrawny little thing, as a child
Men would chuck, runnin' wild
Me called names?
Not allowed
Gotta be something that was vile
Wide eyed, cried, takin' 'em blowin'
Start ridin', cried, ??
Flip that, start lookin' for shows
Spit that, time I have to go
On the car 'round the block, runnin' with boys
Only girl got slick mccoy
Had a little crush, name was troy
Got a little rush, loved the joy
Bent adolescent tryin' to get down
To werin' a frown
Steady comin' up, wonderin' how
Never been as fly, so look at me now

Started growin' up, started to bloom
Same damn thing, chased out the storm
E-lay see-lay caught at noon
Write more, fight more, stay in my room
Gettin' with the wrong guy, never again
Get it from the wrong guy, never a friend
Try to go straight, world tryin' to end
No such thing, 'cause I'm tryin' to mend
Niggas try to see me, never before
Bitches want to be me, never before
Niggas that would dis me, tryin' to score
Bitches now jealous of me whore
Heard they relay many of lines
Got played, got laid many times
Crushed inhibition, lookin' for signs
Love didn't live here, it was blind

Write more, then make a buck

Now I'm the hottest thing on the scene
Straight line, got mine, know what I mean?
Keep it on top, not a raid
Hope it don't fly, masquerade..
Myself from them days of play
Stories like this that I relate
Hopin' that, don't start to slip
Hopin' that, can keep a grip
Write rhymes that I can flip
Mothafuckin' business, it's a trip
Learned that life ain't a game
Passed up, passed by, it's a shame
Never let ya life go insane
Time go by, it's chain
Look up, look by, it remains
Still be sittin' there, still complain

I stayed there helpin' you through it
I f***ed up too and you knew it

Many times I thought that you blew it
But then you'd always make it right with me
No fight with me, forever kept it tight with me
Sometimes you ditched the fellas 

Just to come and ride with me
Then stripped me down, licked me up, every night with me
You never made me feel I owed you for the deeds that you done
Re-payed you with my loyalty, promised to give you a son

Can't nothin' come between us ever boy
You know you the one
And love I give you everyday, you know it's second to none

Yeah, feel my pain
Filled with pain
It's a struggle everyday
Did I walk in the right door?
I don't know
Yeah

I never back down, I do what it takes me
Things gettin' shaky, can't let it break me
A lot love us, some hate me
Some friends snake me
Sometimes the shit just make me
Wanna grab the tote and lose it
It ain't just tracks and raps
It's a whole other side to music
Things you can't see on mtv, but it's here
Lord, what's happened to me?
I'm really out there
Was this the right door to walk in?
Lips movin', but ain't nobody talkin'
I plead and I cry to the heaven skies above to show me love
Wish that I could backtrack and make it like it was, but I can't

1 - when the pain's in me
I wish that it would let me be
But where can I run and where do I turn
When it's chasin' me?

Repeat 1

I got to deal with the what is, fuck what if's
Got to put it down and make it right for my kids
How many parties, how many bottles gotta pop?
How many more gots to die?
When this shit gon' stop?
I feel it in my heart, but I plays my part
It's a whole bigger picture so stay true to your art
Until I'm hauled off in the car
Swear it wasn't this dark when I got my start
Internin', been chart burnin', kept learnin'
Kept earnin', and the wheels kept turnin'
But after all the hit songs and the fame is gone
Your money right, but everything else done gone wrong
You're lonely, a lot of bitches is phony
Wanna know me just to tell niggas we homies
Whole time bitch schemin' on my rolley
It's hard to watch everyone you with
When you rich, niggas with you try to get you
Plenty wanna hit you, I learned it now
It was no way out, now it's no turnin' around
Niggas that was with me, I praise 'em now
A toast to the red zone, raise 'em now

Repeat 1

Silence, all eyes on me
But I can see through 'em like I knew 'em, so I walk to 'em
Extend my hand, try to talk to 'em
Stand while others ran and try to understand
Two sides of a story, let me tell my side of it
It's evident, it's there, I can't hide from it
How much for the soul in the window?
Most wanna be rich and famous
It's dangerous, you'll find out in a minute though
I love the close ones, sometimes feel like I got no one
Those that was there, I know I owe 'em
Backstabbers, I brush 'em off
In a room with straight faces, can't trust 'em all
Rush and fall, pause, let nature take it's course
Stand firm 'cause I serve a higher force
And I can scream 'til I'm hoarse, hear me lord
See I'm ? like 3 dice, riskin' it all in street life

At the fork in the road, I made a hard right
I put the work in, then escaped the hard life
I put it down 'til it's time to lay me down
Wanna be free, but a lot of shit weighs me down
The light's dimmin', who gon' save me now?
It's all good, but it ain't gravy now
We gots to do it for the babies now
And bring 'em up to correct all the wrong we've done
And don't let 'em sing the same song we sung
Like, killin' each other off one by one
And turn 'em from slangin' the drugs, into some'in
You can make it out the ghetto in more ways than one
But for now I'mma pray for better days to come

Holla at ya man tomorrow
Aight, I'll get up with you tomorrow
You get up with me tomorrow?
Aight I'm going up in here

Coming out of 112 one late night
Seen some scandalous hoes in my eye sight
Now being the bitch I am, payed it no mind
Gave niggaz that then hoped in the ride

Pulled out the heat from under the seat
Make sure the doors locked and the guns cocked
Pulled out the lock, now I'm leavin' the spot
Made a right on Cheser Bridge

Now I'm rollin' down the block, floatin' across 80 by north
I seen some headlights rollin' tight behind the Porsche
Motherfucker, bumped my shit, oh, now it's on
Thinkin' it's an accident though I could be wrong

(Motherfucker)
Payin' myself if niggaz really want it
Hit another exit, so a bitch wouldn't get cornered
Couldn't keep going, niggaz will follow you home
Smack you with the chrome and take everything you own

I was taught better than that
So I grabs the gat, holds my own
Don't need no one to watch my back
Lookin' towards the heavens through the sun roof

Shit, I know I ain't untouchable and I know I ain't bullet proof
But I'll put it on these niggaz if need be
You're dead, on some two to you chest and two to your head
Lord, please don't let it go there

All I see is a BP and I'm in the middle of nowhere
I'm ready for whatever and I know the routine
Before I get out the whip I check the gun magazine
Hoped out like, ""What the fuck y'all got to be crazy""

Some tall nigga talkin' 'bout, ""Yo hold on baby, it was just an accident""
I can't believe this happening
Then I see the Cherokee pull up in the back of him
Now I'm really on p

Oh, that's them same bitches from the club that was grilling me
So I pulled out the fifth, you niggaz coming for me
Money had his hands up, I smacked him with the heat
That's when one bitch hoped out the jeep

I fired a shot, I missed her
But it cornered the drivers side and hit her sister
I ducked behind my whip, bitch still popping
Wait for her to stop so I can hit her with a hot one

It's getting hard to maneuverer
I kicked my heels off, had him knocked out
Stumbled to his shit and them he peeled off
Perfect distraction, GS is passin'

I rose platinum, sounded like a round of applause
I pack a line when a cock it back and I rore's
Now I'm the type that will get at the drama to it's gone
You bitches wanna dance then they playin' our song

I'm done fucking with you, jumped behind the dumpster
Reload the pistol, pucker up until it kiss ya
I can't explain why this is going on but tonight it's on
Fuck who right and fuck who wrong

I got you in my sight, gun in my palm, surprisingly calm
Lick of a shot, hit her in the arm, she running got my gun hot
Try to escape, she pulled her dead friend out of the driver's side
Licked off a shot, put it in the leg

I ain't gonna kill you quick, bitch, I'm gonna make you beg
She still got in though and mashed the gas
I put four in the door and got out of the way fast
The jeep swerved and started to stray

Heading for the gas tank guiding my stance
Hit it with the last one contact, it blows up
I bolted out before the APB shows up
Throwed my shit and fifth, bucked forty on the dash

In my rear view, I seen the aftermath of the blast
To protect mine, I send demons to hell
Stay strong just to live long, those who weak, they and fell
Knowing happened shouldn't have went down but it did

If it's me and you, bitch, I gots to live
I know with guns hell, only one can prevail
Either it's a done deal
Live by steel or behind steel

Ain't nothing fair, we in this for real
Could have ended up dead tonight or ended up in jail
Pacing in my cell, trying to raise bail and on top of all that
This bitch made me break my motherfucking nail

Fucked my shit up
I told Tricky ass, I ain't wanna go out tonight
Now I got to get this shit fixed

Hey, look here

[Sole']
What's up?

[Gipp]
Shorty, I don't think this thing between us is gon' work no more

[Sole']
Oh, you don't think it's gon' work?

[Gipp]
Nah

[Sole']
You tryin' to say that's it?

[Gipp]
Man, it's over shorty
I gotta move on
Ya know, be gone, ya know

[Sole']
Ya know, I think I was feelin' the same way anyway
So it's over?

[Gipp]
I'm out

[Sole']
Cool

[Gipp]
We been down this street
Down this block before
Bout to let it all go and hit the front door
Down and up, up and down

Told you I was in it big
This the last time that me and you will have this conversation
In a situation goin' back and forth
About, who right, who wrong

The same ol' song
See I'm a fresh hit
Another girl goin' get
Slow rides, through the park

Gettin' hugs in the dark
I know you don't trust me
That's why you beeped my thirty times
But I wasn't doin nothin but in the street gettin mine

And everytime I tried to explain you wouldn't listen
So I left irratated, confused on what to do
You, used to bring light, now you bring pain
So I gotta let you go and let you do ya thang

You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Chorus: x2]
We've been trying too long
(uh, yeah, to get it right but it just won't work)
We've been trying too long
(yeah, uh, to get it right but it just won't work)

[Sole']
Don't mean to press ya but I'm needin to know
If this the end
And if you leave, am I your friend or your foe?
Don't want to go, you see me turn and look

I walk away slow
Motion be the way
Make sure you catch the kisses I blow
I see you lookin like you want to take me back in yo' arms

Like when you used to hold me tight
And you protect me from harm
But now we can't resolve the problems that we share
It's a mess

I thought we'd work it out
But now it seems I have to confess
That this the end
But you still knowin that I wish it's the start

You slowly breakin my heart
I gave you everything, you tore it apart
Can't go in circles anymore 'cause we been trying too long
Sometimes you just can't work it out

That's why I'm crying this song
You, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'm a have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain

So now I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Chorus: x2]

[Gipp]
Me and you, used to be cute
But now we paint a different picture
Love'll get 'cha, and leave ya deaf, dumb, and blind
Everytime, we had some good days, remember those

Momma told me that's the way love goes
So I'ma leave it at that, get my hat, get my strap, get my bags
Be gone in the wind, baby girl

[Sole']
But now I hear you so I guess it's nothin left to be said
It's time that I fled
It's feelin like a blow to the head
I thought that soon I'd see the day that you and I would be wed

But now the end has come, the love is gone, I'm cryin instead
And you, used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I'm a have to let ya go and let ya do ya thang

[Gipp]
Nah, you used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang
You used to bring light, but now you bring pain
So I gotta let ya go and let ya do ya thang

Why did I make this place? 
I'm far away from home and I have no home. 
Why did I come to this place? 
Far away from home and I have no home. 

So I sleep under papers and talk to myself in public places, 
I stagger and twitch, and drive a 400 dollar car. 
I'm taking it on the road again, this time I'm never coming back 'til I'm dead. 
Pour another keg. 
Shake my leg it's broken. 
That's my name run it through the mud I still remain 
A beast, a mountain of moss purging all the stagnance. 
This stage is the saddest place I've ever been. 
Let this be a lesson, 
Let us be cheapened. 
Let's not be the lesser, 
Let's beat around the bush 'til my brain rots, and apples fall 
And everyone indulges and enjoys, and maybe dies of cancer. 
We all gotta go, it's all gotta go, and I've changed my mind again. 
I'm not gonna go out like I should. 
For I'm so humbled, I have no shame, many dignities, and an inability to simplify. 
So throw things, I'll catch them, and hopefully in time you will to. 
Let me breath for you, you're choked up and afraid to show it. 
I'm a person, not a poet and it's wack to rhyme poet with show it, 
But see it's obvious I can't change and I'm not finished. 
But I live in this space so give that much to me. 
The freedom to be in a space, 
A space like my own air, 
Heir to no one's throne. 

La la la this song is not a message. 
Arrogant people make me. 
Silent people interest me. 
Why can't anybody leave me in peace? 
Why bother? 
Brothers, sisters, orphans, and dolphins. 
No one person is that special, we ride the short bus to oblivion, 
Living in a commune. 
It's a small rock we're standing, 
I wanna understand, I need to lay down. 
The background moves so fast it's hard to see the faces of my loved ones. 
But their voices I follow and somehow end back in the same place, 
'Til everything stops. 
And nobodys there, and I'm walking down the street mumbling over the sound of my footsteps echoing off; 
Looking for a place to lay my feet 
But nobody's home
Nobody's home, excuse me sir, nobody's home.",Home,2000
Sole,"[Sole]
Thank God I never made it to Earth, what a happy place
how I long to be depressed, to be a grouch, get away

Yo, Yo Here I stand in the desert sands 
There I lay in a dust storm, brain storms 
Some day we may form a massive collective mind with no bandages 
I kneel down to fantasy of what is real 
Thus far the only signs of freshness 
I came across upon this quest was nothingness 
possessed to find truth at all costs elementally 
I walk a thin line of good and evil coincidentally 
We all believe in god and nature and higher levels 
Yet we dwell with devil's machinery in lower levels of raped scenery 
It's seemingly endless 
Demeaning and mindless, we're friendless and meaningless 
Living in darkness walking with candles 
And while I'm on the subject of difference is lame 
I've noticed the more things change the more things stay the same 
To stay in focus 
It's hopeless to go against the grain while new to this 
Till I'm menopaused and then ejected from the uterus 

Chorus 
And I've seen so far into the night 
And lingered in the land of no night 

Day two I've left the earth and all is alien and foreign 
Females are wailing and I'm swimming in a cest pool 
It's pouring 
It ain't dark no more, no more worth the fight 
My old candles turn to sunglasses, I can't stand the light 
Yet I can't stand the rain these bodies I live with are numb 
And I can't stand the pain these children I play with are dumb 
A figure points a finger and whispers, ""leave"" 
This small porcelain tomb
It will be all I will have achieved 
And I refuse to be excrement 
dash to the left and to try to and break for my life 
A large hand grabs me now, there's no escape 
I'm thrown into a whirlpool, spinning until infinity 
Grasping for an oxygen breath, but I don't breath that yet 
Inhale the H20 and thank life I'm still living breath 
Giving death a hell of a run until the movement stops 
Bubble to the surface almost dead ass out 
Starving cold and alone until I pass out 

chorus 

Living ain't all that, I want to go back to non-existence 
The womb was not meant to be a tomb, but once I've gone the distance 
Won't sleep to see revenge for my dead sibling, I miss her
I watched my brother be impaled as I held the hand of my sister 
Kissed her when she was void 
Missed the missile, I'm docile
Amongst dead soil and fossil till I'm deployed 
None of it ever happened 
As far as I'm concerned I'm barred 
Should've died months ago in the condom 
and this wouldn't have been so hard 
Should'nt of, but it's not that way 
I fought that way 
I lay until I no longer thought that way 
None of this was worth the fight, I should have been disposed 
At night time, laying only half of the trash can 
Not white trash in a trailer park 
Or a dismembered rash lashing utter last sole 
member of a coathanger tailored art 
With no formed identity blanketed by newspapers 
Remedy be levity, life be the penalty 
This body in a mask grow fast carry out the masquerade 
I lay in the cut to hear lies, pawns, peons, and tricks of this trade
In this eon let me be on and beyond the next decade 
There I stayed remain of flux to be another child saved

Sole Giménez,"Es la historia de una voz 
Templada por el blues
Es el canto que arrastró 
El hambre y el amor
Y la música nació vestida de mujer 

El lamento que acunó 
Su dulce oscura piel
Sentimientos en su son 
Gardenias del querer
Y la música cantó por boca de mujer

Alma de blues en su voz 
Dando vida a la pasión
Triste canción es su blues 
Acaricia una oración

Su lucha y su dolor
Nadie como ella sintió

Frágil corazón de mujer 
Se dejó abrazar entre besos y silencio 
Conoció el amor en su piel

Era tan hermoso caminar hacia ningún lugar 
Confundiendo sueño y realidad, todo era verdad
No había nada por lo que rezar, si acaso una oración 
Suplicando la continuidad de aquella sensación

Es tan triste recordar 
Que cada historia tiene su final
Como sol de amanecer hay que nacer 
Partiendo del ayer
Es muy triste recordar 
Que cada historia tiene su final

Poco a poco se quebró la dulzura de ese amor
Algún día perdió su poder
Y el final llegó, entre lágrimas el tiempo 
Todo lo acabó por romper

Se hizo tan penoso caminar hacia ningún lugar 
Distinguiendo sueño y realidad, ¿cuál es la verdad? 
Aún quedaba tanto que pedir en cada oración 
Suplicando volver a sentir la dulce sensación

Libre!!! como el ave que escapo de su prision why puede alfin volar.
Libre!!! como el viento que recoje mil lamentos why libertad.
camino sin sesar detras de la verdad
why saber lo que es al fin la libertad.

con solo por bandras se marcho cantando una cancion marchando tan feliz que no escucho la voz que le llamo.
why tendido en el suelo se quedo, sonriendo why sin hablar sobre su pecho flores carnes why frotaban sin sesar.

Buscando la luz, de un amanecer
Cuando llegue el alba
Viviré, viviré

Noche adentro irá, vencida de amor
La tristeza gris, de mi corazón
Cuando llegue el alba

A un costado del olvido, mis sueños maduraran
Reventando en luz, florecidos
Cuando llegue el alba
Viviré, viviré

Encontrarte fue, intuición de Dios
Todo nace en ti, como nací yo
Cuando llegue el alba
Viviré, viviré

Tus palabras son, fresco manantial
Sintiendo tu voz, aprendí a cantar

Cuando llegue el alba

Si te encuentro en la calle
No me atrevo ni hablarte
Se bloquean mis palabras
No me atrevo a mirarte a los ojos
Y aunque suene imposible
Si pudiera amplificar el latir del corazón
Sentirías al baterista de una banda de metal pesado
Y hoy por eso estoy aquí parado
Porque me sale mucho más fácil con una de mis canciones
Para lograr que sientan hasta muros y platones

Y para no telefonear te digo todo cara a cara
Como si la pena no me importara
Soy muy tímido
Escondo amor en mi, no fallo
Para decirte que desde que te vi siempre es mayo
Y en mayo el mundo es bello
Y está lleno de colores
Y todavía en los árboles
Habitan sólo flores
Tarde que temprano van a
Derramar su fruto
Y dime cómo estas
Ansiosamente espero

Espero que este sentimiento sea correspondido
Yo estoy aquí delante y te quiero y te sonrío
Asómate a la ventana amore mio

Asómate al balcón
Responde niña por favor
Solo vine hasta aquí con torna mesa y un micrófono
Traje aquí a mi banda a cantarte lo que siento
Si tú me quisieras besar yo estaría contento

Es que esta serenata es mi cita con el destino
Pues quiero que en la vida estemos
Tu y yo siempre unidos
Una serenata rap para decir a ti
Me gusta como miras y lo que piensas de mí
Me gusta tu nariz en sinfonía con el mundo
Me gusta tu trasero, casi redondo
Que torna en un satélite a cada ser viviente
Me gustas por que eres, inteligente

Se ve muy claro en tus manos como las mueves
Y haces que hasta los sentimientos siempre me renueves
Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento
Una flor que así creció entre el asfalto y el cemento

Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Serenata rap, serenata metropolitana
Confía un poco en mí
Aquí estaré cada mañana
No debes creer las cosas que otros te digan de mí
Es que son muy envidiosos
Quizás porqué
Yo no te prometo historias de pasión como de guiones
De cine de romances solo falsas ilusiones
Yo te ofrezco la verdad, cuerpo, alma y un cerebro
Amor es solamente amor
Es solo solo eso

Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Amor que nadie ama se resigna a no lograrlo
Lo escribe en los muros
Y luego en el subterráneo de esta ciudad
Millones de habitantes que van día con día
Ignorándose hacia delante
Y después no sé porqué
Porqué, quién sabe cómo
Después no sé porqué
Porqué quien sabe cómo
Dos almas de repente se generan un destino
Palacios, ruido, smog son como un jardín divino
Personas entregadas intercambian un anillo
En un departamento que sera como un castillo
Asómate a la ventana amore mío

Tus caderas son los andes y tus pechos los volcanes
Me gusta tu buen gusto en la ropa con que sales
Que está muy por encima de la moda del momento
Una flor que así creció, entre el asfalto y el cemento

Ohhhh, 
Can anybody hear me, 
Cause I've been down, that road, so long. 
I'm trying to clean up my ways
Some times I feel like I can't
When I repent all my sins
Then I just do it again

I never wanted to be a regular nigga
No funds, chased by crack hittas
So I poured my soul out, like liquor
But I guess ya'll niggas didn't get the point, like scissors
I told cats I went to church and got saved
Old heads looking, like 'NO', do not say
Called my old hoes, told them I'm gone stop pimping
They looking at me like, you mine as well stop living
Trying to rid the demons from my system
But da game won't let me, it's steady pulling me in
But I thank you, since you kept a nigga breathing, eating, sleeping
Been up another week, another weekend
Days, hours, minutes, seconds
Feeling like I could, never pay you back 4 this blessing
So when a nigga pray, I don't pray for wealth
I pray for my family, I pray for health
If anything, I just pray we get closer
To the point, you become my main focus
Focus on, every word I say, I hope you soak this

Soler Mesh,"Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Where do we start time apart, so many years so much heart
So many tears but still I couldn't cry them
Knew I was hurt but all I do is hide them
Wish you was here to see the places I've been,
I knew you would be proud to see the cars that im driven,
The home that I live in, I know that you listen'
But if you were here, I wonder would it be different?
What would it be like if I could add a few years
To the times she wasn't here to experience so you could see life
Man that would be like, changing the ending of a book that we like
But that ain't the story that I wish you would rewrite
Gotta keep going until they give me the green light
Livin' it up but still somethin' don't seem right,
Be gone in a physical but lifted my dreams like
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Even though it's a dream to me,
It still seems to be what I perceive to be perfect scenery
What if your lost could come back at a cost
But they told you the price would be whatever your fortune is
Would you spend it in a minute, for a minute,
For a second just to ask one question about how life is in heaven
I would give it all back, to the point of no return
Just to feel one hug, or to hear one word
But it's the same what we learn what to value
But we still mall when there's no one around you
But mama I miss you, one day ill be with you
As long as I live you know you lifted my men too
Ill never forget you, you know that I love you
You know that I am the that I am because of you
Before I leave, you see, imma believe that you ain't in the flesh
You will come in my dreams
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Last night I had a dream and it felt so right
You held me in your arms and it felt so tight
And it felt so real, why would I wake up
I even day dream now, I don't wanna stay up
So you can take me to a place where I can go
And let my mind draw the picture that I control
Cause I'm dreamin', yes im dreamin'
If you catch me asleep just leave me
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)
Every night (every night) and every day (every day)

To the stars up above

Waiting patiently by the phone

Keep me warm

I ever stride
Among the shores of tranquil nights
Between the set and dawn of light...

I dropped my sorrow among the leaves
I took my place as wise men do
As the storm prepared its release
Through raging winds and weeping skies
I sat in the loneliness of solitude
I washed my eyes in growing streams
Earth's resistance
True magnitude
As black sky faded to blue
And again the Earth felt the sunrise
A silver mirror stood before me
Bequeath of the silent rainbow
A beautiful mirror of radiant splendor
As ominous as the autumn moon
It brought upon me endless wonder
Yet spoke of some unknown doom
As I reflect back on this day
No words could ever tell...

But could not see myself
In strange visions
And through the windows of dreams
We solemnly gaze beyond
What is revealed to our eyes
Exists already in our minds

We shall find the Kings from the East
Do not seal the words of the prophecy
The time is soon at hand

He who righteous - let him be righteous still
And let he who walks on the path which is clear
Find peace within himself

We reap what we sow
Heed the warning cast among ye

Floating endless through the sea
On the other side of knowledge
Through the pliancy of dreams
And voices there upon the ship
Spoke of radiant place's splendor
Beautiful shores with sands of gold
Wherein exists no torment or pain
What was I looking for
What could I have hoped for
On the white ship I sailed through the night
As we traveled for the Land Eternal
We passed many peaceful harbor
Where we could have found vibrant life
In a world known only in dreams
But vibrant was not eternal
So we continued upon our quest
Through misty lagoons of sparkling blue
And on through the pillars of the West
The land mist be adorned by beauty unknown
Never before beheld
The land of eternal life
Which ocean secrets had held
And as we left those shores of hope
And neared the end of the quest
The waters rose up before me
And fell there sharply beyond

Into man's withered and dying arms

What could I have hoped for

Armies fill Towers of Greed
Ultimate drones of deceit
Selling you won hopes and dreams
For nothing is nothing it seems

There is only pain within
There is only pain for sin
Still trapped inside the hourglass
Toil and break our backs 'till death
Chained to our dying breath
Behind the mask of loneliness
Forever burning golden pyre
Weeping tears of crimson flame
For ashes that shall bear your name
So I ask you once again
Why must you forever exchange
The peace that gold can buy
For the vanity that it may?

If there's a God, then why does he let me die?

Catch my soul 'cause it's willing to fly away

Mark my words, believe my soul lives on

I must be wrong could I be wrong am I just foolish
He gotta know I ain't the type of girl to fool with
And god I hope I don't run up and see some bullshit
I tried to tell myself don't lose it just turn up the music

En esta esquina solo me acompaña esta
Tímida neblina el sabor de tus besos
Impregnados al vapor de este solitario invierno
Quizás me olvidaste
O quizás la verdad tú solo me borraste
Este amor es un chiste triste triste
Como se siente cuando todo lo perdiste
La miel la piel y el riel
Cual es el sentido cuando la vida luego es tan cruel
Dame más tiempo un fervento un momento
Juro que mi sombra sera tan discreta como tu silencio
Pero nunca me respondes
Descarrilada en la locura de este monte
Sabes que te espero pero por dentro

Sabes que no tengo control de mayor a menor

Que tú me apartas pierdo

Buscando quien me explique la razón de esta flama
Que me tumba en la avenida que me nubla que me quita que me deja a la deriva
La herida de la espuma de tu sal sobre
Cada recuerdo que llevo de tu nombre
Dos mil tres mil cuatro mil horas
Cuanto tiempo solo me devoras
Más te demoras más me ignoras
Estas horas son tan matadoras
Sabes que te espero pero por dentro

Got that pump in my truck I ain't talking about Donald

Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow

Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess

Solomon Burke,"When a man loves a woman
Can’t keep his mind on nothin’ else
He’d trade your world for the good thing he’s found
If she is bad, he can’t see it, she can do no wrong
He'll turn his back on his best friend if she puts him down

When a man loves a woman he spend his very last dime
Trying to hold on to everything he needs
He’ll give all of his comforts just to sleep out in the rain
If she'll say that’s the way it's gotta be

Oh, this man loves this woman
I give everything I have
Trying to hold on to her sweet fine precious love
Baby please don’t make me feel so bad

When a man loves a woman
Deep down inside his soul she can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he’s the last one to know
Lovin' eyes always too blind to see

When a man loves a woman he can do her no wrong
He can only love one woman at a time
When a man loves a woman he got to treat that woman right
If he don't he'll lose that woman
That woman surely someday'll be mine

When a man loves a woman he got to do the best he can
Love her and keep her and treat her in every way
When a man loves a woman he should make that sacrifice
Promise he got to give to her his life

Solomon Burke,"I went up to the mountain
Because you asked me to
Up over the clouds
To where the sky was blue
I could see all around me
Everywhere
I could see all around me
Everywhere

Sometimes I feel like
I've never been nothing but tired
And I'll be walking
Till the day I expire
Sometimes I lay down
No more can I do
But then I go on again
Because you ask me to

Some days I look down
Afraid I will fall
And though the sun shines
I see nothing at all
Then I hear your sweet voice, oh
Oh, come and then go, come and then go
Telling me softly
You love me so

Just over the mountain

Every day I'm born again

And out of fear I pull myself loose again
For you I die
You are everything I need, what I desire,

But will I ever understand?
Come on!
I die for you

Woman, when you get rid of me

Without you, true love never could be found
You see all my life I've been lonely, sad and blue
I thank you for all the things you do

Yes, I thank you, you turn my life around
And without you, true love never could be found
All my life I've been lonely, sad and blue
Oh, I thank you for all the wonderful things you do

First I thank you for understanding
And not being so demanding
I thank you for caring when nobody else cared
I thank you for just being there

I thank you for the love that you share
And the thoughts and you're always by my side
Never letting me go and letting me know
That you care, you love me

Well, I thank you for turning my life around

I thank you for turning my life around
I thank you for the love I truly found
Because without you I've been lonely, sad and blue

Solomon Burke,"Here I am at home (hrum, hrum hrum)

I was afraid, to get out of the car
So I just sat there, I just sat there
How was I gonna tell them?
That I lost my job
Gotta go in there, gotta go in there
So we gathered 'round the table
Told them the news
And the look of desperation
Nearly broke me in two

Son, I know you wanted
Them running shoes
Gonna have to wait, they going have to wait
Darling, I know you wanted
That dress in the window
We gonna get it,
But it won't be now

Then my little girl looked at me,
With those big round eyes
And the words she told me,
Almost made me cry!

(Chorus)

We don't need it,
We can do without it,
We going to make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you

My son said;
Daddy, I got sixteen books
Why don't you take it, I want you to take it
The next door neighbor 
Asked me to rake the leaves
And I'm gonna do it, I'm sure gonna do it
'Cause I wanna help you out
Anyway I can
It's about time I learn, just to be a man 

My wife said;
Darling, we got so much stuff
Just sitting around here, just sitting around
Like grandmom's china, and the sterling silverware
Just sitting around here, just gathering dust
Ever since she past away
We ain't used it yet
So let's put it out in the front yard
And see what we can get

(Chorus)

And we don't need it
We can do without it,
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you

Days and weeks,
And months went by
The big boss called,
In a lickup town (?)
Got my check
And brought it home
Yeah, it's been tough
But we've been blessed
Let's get them shoes
And that brand new dress!

(Chorus)

We don't need it
We can do without it,
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
Make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you (you)

We don't need it
We can do without it,
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together
And make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you (loving you)

We can do without it
We gonna make it
No doubt about it
We're going stick together (begin fading)
And make it better
We don't need it
All we need is you
