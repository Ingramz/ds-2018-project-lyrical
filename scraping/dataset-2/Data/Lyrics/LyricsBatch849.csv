Philippe Falliex,"Va savoir c'est peut-être ça l'amour
Une lettre froissée, un disque rayé
Qui tournera encore pendant des années
Même s'il est usé
Va savoir c'est peut-être ça la vie
Battements de secondes, minutes de plaisir
Et des heures encore à s'appartenir
Même si le temps gronde
Et si le hasard un jour nous sépare
Faudra surtout pas lui en vouloir
Même quand tout va bien
Pourquoi toujours penser a demain
Allez viens
Va savoir c'est peut-être notre histoire
Si j'pleure c'est pour rire
Juste pour te dire
Que tu m'as laissé
Comme un goût de miel
Pour l'éternité, babe",Va Savoir,1999
Philippe Falliex,"Qui ose dire qu'il peut m'apprendre les sentiments
Ou me montrer ce qu'il faut faire pour être grand
Qui peut changer ce que je porte dans mon sang

Qui a le droit de m'interdire d'être vivant
De quel côté se trouvent les bons ou les méchants
Leurs évangiles ont fait de moi un non-croyant

La vie ne m'apprend rien
Je voulais juste un peu parler, choisir un train
La vie ne m'apprend rien
J'aimerai tellement m'accrocher, prendre un chemin
Prendre un chemin

Mais je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là
Les lois ne font plus les hommes
Mais quelques hommes font la loi
Et je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là

À ceux qui croient que mon argent endort ma tête
Je dis qu'il ne suffit pas d'être pauvre pour être honnête
Ils croient peut-être que la liberté s'achète

Que reste-t-il des idéaux sous la mitraille
Quand les prêcheurs sont à l'abri de la bataille
La vie des morts n'est plus sauvée par des médailles

La vie ne m'apprend rien
Je voulais juste un peu parler, choisir un train
La vie ne m'apprend rien
J'aimerai tellement m'accrocher, prendre un chemin
Prendre un chemin

Mais je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là
Les lois ne font plus les hommes
Mais quelques hommes font la loi
Et je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là

Je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là
Les lois ne font plus les hommes
Mais quelques hommes font la loi
Et je n'peux pas, je n'sais pas
Et je reste planté là

Philippe Heithier,"Wir sind noch lang nicht am Limit
Leg noch 'ne Schippe drauf
Wir haben vampirrote Auge, wie Boxer am taumeln
Verschwinden im Rauch
Unsere Körper verschmelzen
Schaut, die Sonne geht auf
Ohne Zeitdruck und Sorgen empfangen wir den Morgen 
Und zerfallen zu Staub (und zerfallen zu Staub)

Yeah, ich gebe nicht auf
Ich geh' all-in, nehm' es in Kauf
Ballin', ich seh' im Nebel 'ne Frau
Ihre Strähnen sind braun, sie zeigt mega viel Haut und (geil)
And're regen sich kaum
Und manche regen sich auf, ich
Fühl' mich an der Theke zuhaus
Ich verwese im Rausch, es ist eh viel zu laut (viel zu laut man)
Doch ich geh' noch nicht raus (ich bleibe hier)
Meine Kehle fängt Staub
Und alles dreht sich im Bauch
Doch gib mir noch ein Gläschen, ich glaub'

Wir sind noch lang nicht am Limit
Leg noch 'ne Schippe drauf
Wir haben vampirrote Auge, wie Boxer am taumeln
Verschwinden im Rauch
Unsere Körper verschmelzen
Schaut, die Sonne geht auf
Ohne Zeitdruck und Sorgen empfangen wir den Morgen 
Und zerfallen zu Staub (und zerfallen zu Staub)

Was 'ne unvergessliche Nacht! (Yeah)
Ich schlafe nicht, es ist sechs, ich bin wach (niemals)
Ich hatte zu viel Sekt, zu viel Schnaps
Zu viel Action und Krach, doch bin längst noch nicht satt
Also gib mir noch ein Glas, bitte brems mich nicht ab
Auf mei'm Weg zu 'nem menschlichen Wrack (bitte lass mich)
Doch sie sagen, „Es ist spät, düs jetzt ab!“
Also finde ich den Weg in die verregnete Stadt
Grade chillte ich im Club mit Dornröschen
Und jetzt rieche ich den Duft frischer Brötchen
Sehe Menschen an der Bahnhalte stehen
Die gleich arbeiten gehen doch

Wir sind noch lang nicht am Limit
Leg noch 'ne Schippe drauf
Wir haben vampirrote Auge, wie Boxer am taumeln
Verschwinden im Rauch
Unsere Körper verschmelzen
Schaut, die Sonne geht auf
Ohne Zeitdruck und Sorgen empfangen wir den Morgen 
Und zerfallen zu Staub (und zerfallen zu Staub)

Mir ist schwindelig
Alles dreht sich im Kreis
Die Sonne blendet mich
Meine Haut ist kreidebleich
Ich find' das Ende nicht
Auch wenn ich morgen nichts mehr weiß
Ich bin der Erste, der kam, und der Letzte, der geht
Also sag mir nicht, es ist spät

Wir sind noch lang nicht am Limit
Leg noch 'ne Schippe drauf (leg noch 'ne Schippe drauf)
Wir haben vampirrote Auge, wie Boxer am taumeln

Philippe Heithier,"Ob es morgen ist oder in zehn Jahren
Eines Tages werd' ich sowieso sterben
Ich denk' an alle, die ein Teil auf meinem Weg waren
Aber vorher muss ich noch was loswerden (yeah)
Ich weiß auch, dass es mit mir nicht immer leicht war
Wie oft kriegt man sich in die Haare wegen Kleinkram?
Ich würd' die Streitereien bereu'n, für die es keinen Grund gab
Und meiner Exfreundin sagen, dass es meine Schuld war
Meine Freunde, in schweren Zeiten waren sie da (immer)
Als ich noch Mayjuran und noch nicht Majoe war
Danke an die Feinde, sie waren zwar keine Freunde
Doch ich wurde immer stärker, weil ich's ihnen beweisen wollte
Schöne Momente bleiben unvergesslich
Und jeder Mensch in meinem Leben unersetzlich
Und sollt' es wirklich eines Tages mal zu Ende gehen
Am letzten Tag will ich euch lächeln sehen!

Immer wenn es schwierig war, war einer von euch hier
Wir haben den Regen und die Sonne gesehen
Ihr steht ein Leben lang zu mir
Ich dank' euch dafür
Dass ihr den Glauben nie verliert
Und wenn ich irgendwann mal gehen muss
Bleibt in euch ein Teil von mir

Ihr seid ein Teil von mir (ein Teil von mir)
Ihr seid ein Teil von mir 

Wir waren immer Jungs von der echten Sorte
Und wenn ich gehen muss, wären das meine letzten Worte
Wir waren höflich und konnten auch Respekt zeigen
Doch kam uns einer schief, gingen wir drauf mit 'nem Brecheisen
Yeah, ich bin immer noch mit den Gleichen cool
Jetzt will jeder dazugehören, doch der Kreis ist zu
Ich weiß genau, dass wir im Kopf bisschen anders sind
Doch ich will meinen Brüdern sagen, dass ich dankbar bin
Egal, ob die Musik mir eine Goldene bringt
Ich will meiner Schwester sagen, dass ich stolz auf sie bin
Es mag zwar toll klingen, denn der Porsche ist bezahlbar
Doch die Familie steht über allem, mein Vorbild ist mein Vater
Und mein großer Bruder hielt mich immer fern von der schiefen Bahn (Danke)
Ich würd' so gern mehr sagen als nur „Vielen Dank!“
Ihr könnt mir alles und das Geld aus der Tasche nehmen (nimm)
Ich bin zufrieden, wenn ich meine Mutter lachen seh'

Immer wenn es schwierig war, war einer von euch hier
Wir haben den Regen und die Sonne gesehen
Ihr steht ein Leben lang zu mir
Ich dank' euch dafür
Dass ihr den Glauben nie verliert
Und wenn ich irgendwann mal gehen muss
Bleibt in euch ein Teil von mir

Ihr seid ein Teil von mir (ein Teil von mir)
Ihr seid ein Teil von mir",Danke [Instrumental],2017

On va crier et rire aussi

Philippe Petit,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1994
Philippe Petit,"How much do I love you?
I'll tell you no lie
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How many times a day do I think of you?
How many roses are sprinkled with dew?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?
How deep is the ocean?
How high is the sky?

How far would I travel
To be where you are?
How far is the journey
From here to a star?

And if I ever lost you, how much would I cry?

Philippe Petit,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996
Philippe Rault,"Le rond-point à Châtellerault
Les néons cafés déserts
Un aquarium, un mégot
Mon visage sur un poster
Je ne connaîtrai jamais
La fermeture à minuit
La vie des gens qui m’aimaient
N’aura pas été ma vie

Les hélicoptères, les avions, les nuits
Une vie à l’envers, à l’envers je vis

Les échangeurs, le trajet
Le péage, la Ford Escort
La poche arrière, le billet
15 heures, ouverture des portes
Et les stands, et la buvette
Moi je n’y suis pas allé
Ces briquets, ces allumettes
Je ne les ai pas allumés

Les hélicoptères, les avions, les nuits
Une vie à l’envers, à l’envers je vis

Philippe Saisse,"Some are born to plough the fields of home
Some are born to happiness and never start to roam
I bent the bow, I Let the arrow fly
Your children go - do you ever wonder why?

Cross my heart, there's nothing I'd regret
Just that single perfect path, I haven't found it yet
Let's work it out, ifs not too late to try
I said Get real, I didn't say Goodbye

'Cos I was born to tell the truth and run
Remember me, remember me
It was all for love, the crazy things I've done
Remember me, I'm still your native son
Remember me, I'm still your native son

Oh, native son 
Oh, native son

Some are born to watch the years go by
Some are born to happiness, it comes as no surprise
I bent the bow, I Let the arrow fly
I said Get real, I never said Goodbye

'Cos I was born to tell the truth and run
Remember me, remember me
It was all for love, the crazy things I've done
Remember me, I'm still your native son
Remember me, I'm still your native son

Oh, native son 
Oh, native son

Remember me, I'm still your native so",Native Son,1997
Philippe Saisse,"The Riviera
On every street a gay casino
Where continentals sip their vino
And leave their fortunes to chance

The Riviera
Where matrons draped in Paris fashions
Prolong the twilight of their passions
In mad pursuit of romance

Every gay mademoiselle
Is disarming some Maharajah
With the daring of her [Incomprehensible]
Life is so completely zany and free
By the Mediterranean sea

Ah, the Riviera
Where every golden coat of sun tan
Has cost the gold of more than one man
Who wasn't warned in advance

He may take to his heart
All the wonders of France
Then as a token for the dough that he's sunk
He gets a little label slapped on his trunk

Philippe Saisse,"I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love
So don't forget it

Philippe Saisse,"You know the feeling of something half remembered
Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on the train that is passing through
Those eyes, how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream",Laura,2003

They possess a gift or two
One of them is this
They have the power to make a wish come true

When you wish upon a star
Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme
When you wish upon a star
As dreamers do
Fate is kind

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star

Philippe Saisse Acoustique Trio,"In the mornin' you go gunnin'
For the man who stole your water
Then you fire till he's done in
But they catch you at the border

And the mourners are all singin'
As they drag you by your feet
But the hangman isn't hangin'
And they put you on the street

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

When you know you're no high climber
Then you find out your only friend
In a room with a two timer
And you're sure you're near the end

Then you love a little wild one
You bring to a smile [unverified]
All the time that you know you're smilin'
You'll be on your knees tomorrow cryin'

Now you swear and kick and beg us
That you're not a gamblin' man
Then you find you're back in Vegas
With a handle in your hand

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

Your black cards can make you money
So you hide them when you're able
In the land of milk and honey
You must put them on the table, yeah

You go back, Jack, do it again
Wheel turnin' 'round and 'round
You go back, Jack, do it again

And wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I could have just one more chance to prove, dear

You know I'm yours for just the taking

Maybe haven't got shoes

That's all I meant to do

I could tell you knew
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well you knew
I never lived at all
Until the thrill of that moment

My lips could move and talk

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run

I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe, I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist

In an everlasting kiss

And keep that love underground

Busy scenery
So transfixed on transparent things
An eye for her tiger a bee for her bloom
She crosses her fingers and crosses the room

So catch your salted tears
Before they hit the ground
And keep that love underground",Sunshine Dub,2007
Phillip G. Proctor,"Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the childhood I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me.

Have you seen my childhood",Childhood [Theme From Free Willy 2],2008

The brothers, I can't believe it
I can't believe it

I can tell we've got an awful lot in common
Even though we look as different as can be
We don't even have to try to see things eye to eye

Come to think of it, I think we fit together
Playing cat and mouse won't get us, very far
There's no need to feud and fuss
When it isn't really us, let's you and me be who we are

We're a duo, a duo, a pair of lonely ones
Who were meant to be a two
Oh, a duo, it's true-o
Wherever we go, we're going me and you

No matter what, now, we've got one another
We'll be be there to pick each other off the floor
Anytime you're feeling glum
Count on me to be a chum

If ya get an itch attack
I'll be there to scratch your back
Now who could ever ask for more

Oh stop, oh stop, no, don't stop
More, more, we're friends
And that's what friends are for

We're a duo, a duo, a pair of lonely ones

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow

And sour to the bone
Salty like an ocean

I know you want out, I know, I'm such a whore

And do that funny little thing you do
Sleeping with the dogs was never this good

A fair ground's painted swings

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

At night he becomes a bartender
He works at Mister Cacciatore's down
On Sullivan Street
Across from the medical center
Yeah and he's tradin' in his Chevy for a Cadillacacacacacacacac
You oughta know by now
And if he can't drive
With a broken back
At least he can polish the fenders

And It seems such a waste of time

Threw them in the fire to burn
Left me cold out in the rain.
But now I'm moving on without you baby
Without you by my side
I'm finally feeling free.

But I know that
The sun will shine for me
Even when the skies are grey
And I feel like I'm missing something
But the bridges build their own way

I know you've moved on without me girl
But I still think
How the time moves so fast
I still think of how the world
It goes around and round and round
But it all stopped when you said
Not for now, oh ohhh

But I know that
The sun will shine for me
Even when the skies are grey
And I feel like I'm missing something
But the bridges build their own way

The sand to the shore

Why don't you open up and let me in?

I'll take it out of your head
I'll take it out of your thoughts
Give you a reason to stay, give you a reason to not

'Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more
So I picked up my heart, brushed it off
And walked out the door

I found what you need
Come on and give me what I want, a taste of you with me
The further I go, the closer you seem
Why won't you leave me alone, why won't you leave me be?

'Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more
So I picked up my heart, brushed it off
And walked out the door

'Cause you saw my heart
And you saw how much it broke and I
Could not ask for more

When you find your way back in
Darling, I won't give my heart again

When you find your way back in
Darling, I won't give my heart again

When you find your way back in
Darling, I won't give my heart again

When you find your way back in

How should I give up, how should I survive?
Leaning to the side of the busy street
Looking down, these people never notice me
Am I the only one who thinks it's hard to breathe?

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over
It's only so much closer
I reach my hands to the sky
And fly

Ten thousand faces here, but who am I?
Am I the only one with a reason to hide?
Searching through a maze only to find
Another wall to break, another wall to climb
It's when I lose myself, then I realize

I feel it's hard to say what's on my mind
I feel it's hard to say what's not inside
You think your fight is over

Tell me

What you're made of
My sugar and wine

Seeing it now
Saying it loud
You know it's true
That I'm just a fool for
I'm just a fool for you

Everyday I wake up
And I'm twisted in a dream
In between who I am
And the things I want to be

Then there you are raining down
Like water from a fall
You wash me down, dry me off
You keep pouring out your love

You are the blur in my eyes
As I wake up through the night

Ten thousand hands can't hold
This heavy heart of stone
I feel it break like glass
Still I keep coming back

So pick me up then throw me down
Shine the light then turn it out

You make your way through the fire
I stand inside and I get burned
You make your love a liar
I'm hanging on to every word
I can't quit you
And I'm fine with being used
Lead on, lead on and I'll follow
Lead on, lead on

And I'll follow wherever you go
Right down that rabbit hole
Then everything gets dark
And I feel pulled apart

Running through my blood
You are the rarest drug
With every word I breathe
I see the way you've changed me

Around then throw me down

Should I go or should I stay
I'll come around again
I'll come around again

Always feel it as you grow
It comes around again
It comes around again, so

Lead on lead on and I'll follow
Lead on lead on

In a mirror that you cannot clean

The cracks in our skin

Let go of the fear that’s inside your head
So stay strong live on
And chase the midnight sun

We can build again to more than what we
Once could dream
We’re bigger than we seem

So break off these strings
That tie around you
Take smaller things
To make up something more to see
Make it bigger than it seems

Phillip Sandifer,"Christopher Robin and I walked along
Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore
As our days disappeared all too soon
But I've wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the wood

So help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (chase the clouds from above)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
He came to me asking help and advice
And from there no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear

So help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky (chase the clouds from above)
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh

It's hard to explain how a few precious things
Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there, with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going
I swear that old bear whispered, ""boy, welcome home""

Believe me if you can, I've finally come
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
What do you know, there's so much to be done

And Sin is why it held

Like a distant voice who called
And beckon me to follow
Where I had never gone
And though my heart is willin'
I just stood there at the wall
Prayin somehow it would fall
But in a cross I found a doorway
And a hand that held a key
And when the chains fell at my feet

This is what it means to know that 
I am forgiven
This is how it feels to be free

Of the prison I was in
Like a livin nightmare
Burning from the viel
I can feel the voice of evil
I can hear the call of sin
But I won't go back again
See, once I tasted freedom
Then the walls could bind no more
Since mercy gave me wings to fly
Like an eagle I can sore

I found the cross was calling even then
And even though it took dying to survive
I've never felt so much alive.

For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live
Not I but Christ that lives within me
His Cross will never ask for more than I can give
For its not my strength but His
There's no greater sacrifice
For I am crucified with Christ and yet I live

As I hear the Savior call for daily dying
I will bow beneath the weight of Calvary
Let my hands surrender to His piercing purpose

And with His suffering I identify
And by His resurrection power I am alive

And the earth began to shake
With justice no longer in the way

Past all my failures to the point of my need
When the sin that I carried
Was all I could see
And when I could not reach mercy
Mercy came running to me

Once there was a broken heart
Way to human from the start
And all the years left it torn apart
Hopeless and afraid
Walls I never meant to build
Left this prisoner unfulfilled
Freedom called but even still
It seemed so far away
I was bound by the chains
From the wages of my sin

So far from where I really should be

Held my head to His chest,

I knew I'd broken His heart.

Line the fields of peace

The battle lines were drawn
As soldiers took their place

The Father watched in silence
As a cross was raised
With freedom drawing closer

He took His final breath
He drank our cup of guilt
And took the sting from death

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1996
Philly Joe Jones,"Just friends, lovers no more
Just friends, but not like before
To think of what we've been and not to kiss again
Seems like pretending it isn't the ending
Two friends drifting apart
Two friends, but one broken heart
We loved, we laughed, we cried, and suddenly love died",Just Friends,
Philly Joe Jones,"Lately, I find myself out gazing at stars, 
Hearing guitars like someone in love.
Sometimes the things I do astound me, 
Mostly whenever you're around me.
Lately I seem to walk as though I had wings, 
Bump into things like someone in love.
Each time I look at you, 
I'm limp as a glove, 
And feeling like someone in love.",Like Someone in Love,1957
Philly Joe Jones,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1957
Philly Joe Jones,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside
Then the elevator starts it ride

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for 
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
In a spin lovin' the spin I'm in 
Under the old black magic called love
I should stay away but what can I do 
I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Under the old black magic called love",That Old Black Magic,1957
Philly Joe Jones,"Say, have you seen a Carioca
It's not a foxtrot or a polka
It has a little bit of new rhythm, a blue rhythm that sighs

It has a meter that is tricky
A bit of wicked wacky-wicky
But when you dance it with a new love, there's a true love in her eye

You dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone we say goodbye

Two heads together, they say are better than one
Two heads together, that's how the dance is begun
Two arms around you and lips, that's why I'm yours and you are mine
And you are mine

Now that you've done the Carioca
You'll never care to do the polka
And then you'll realize the blue hula and bamboola are through

Tomorrow morning you'll discover
You're just a Carioca lover
And when you dance it with each new love, there'll be true love just for you

Now you'll dream of a new Carioca
Its theme is a kiss and a sigh
You'll dream of a new Carioca
When music and lights are gone and we're saying goodbye
Goodbye",Carioca (El Tambores),1959
Philly Joe Jones,"I'll never be the same
Stars have lost their meaning for me
I'll never be the same
Nothing's what it once use to be
And when the songbirds that sing
Tell me it's spring 
I can't believe their song
Once love was king but kings can be wrong
I'll never be the same
There is such an ache in my heart
Never be the same since we're apart
Though there's a lot that a smile may hide
I know down deep inside
I'll never be the same never be the same again
 
I'll never be the same

Philly Joe Jones,"Let's build a stairway to the stars
And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!
Let's build a stairway to the stars
A lovely stairway to the stars",Stairway to the Stars [Take 6],1961
Philly Joe Jones,"It begins to tell,
'round midnight, midnight.
I do pretty well, till after sundown,
Suppertime I'm feelin' sad;
But it really gets bad,
'round midnight.

Memories always start 'round midnight
Haven't got the heart to stand those memories,
When my heart is still with you,
And ol' midnight knows it, too.
When a quarrel we had needs mending,
Does it mean that our love is ending.
Darlin' I need you, lately I find
You're out of my heart,
And I'm out of my mind.

Let our hearts take wings'
'round midnight, midnight
Let the angels sing,

Philly Joe Jones,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1968
Philly Joe Jones,"What good is the scheming, the planning and dreaming
That comes with each new love affair
The dreams that we cherish, so often might perish
And leaves you with castles in air

When you're alone, who cares for starlit skies
When you're alone, the magic moonlight dies
At break of dawn, there is no sunrise
When your lover has gone

What lonely hours, the evening shadows bring
What lonely hours, with memories lingering
Like faded flowers, life can't mean anything
When your lover has gone",When Your Lover Has Gone,1972
Philly Joe Jones,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Philly Joe Jones,"Ask me how do I feel,
Now that we're cosy and clinging,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bell I'd be ringing!

From the moment we kissed goodnight,
That's the way I just gotta behave,
And if I were a lamp I'd light,
Or if I were a banner I'd wave!

Ask me how do I feel,
Little me with my quiet upbringing,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a gate I'd be swinging!

And if I were a watch,
I'd start popping my spring,
Oh, and if I were a bell
I'd go ""Ding dong ding dong ding!"".

Ask me how do I feel
From this chemistry lesson I'm learning,
Well sir, all I can say is
If I were a bridge I'd be burning!

Well, I knew my moral would crack
From the wonderful way you looked,
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack,
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!

Ask me how do I feel
Now that we're fondly caressing,
And if I were a salad,
I know I'd be splashing my dressing!

Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?

Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story

That I have to go away
I know, I have to go

Philly Joe Jones,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Philly's Most Wanted,"""Ayyo, let me tell y'all somethin'. We ball like the ballers ball,

Ay, for the most part, I'm smart. Keep birds
I'm the type 'get head in the whip, won't swerve'
In the winter rock Timberland boots, long furs
Usually if I shot at you niggas, we had words
Aim might be off a little, it's bad nerves
Mister, a step above like street curbs
M-are D-O-T, somethin' nasty
Price it but ain' gon' cop? Don't ask me
Hot as the drop. Cold, my top glassy
You don't really think I'm grown? Kidnap me

Sixteen shots in your front left door

Layin' on the deck, blood pressure gettin' low
And it's fucked up because you was never gettin' dough

It's me and Mister, 's like A.C. and O.J.:
Everybody know we all about that all day
Tell ya again, don't fuck wit' A. Jones,
Kill you while you talkin' to broads on pay phones
Sick flow, I know how to get dough. (""Yeah."")
Ski mask outta ya house and get low
I don't see you when you talk? That's invisible threats
See Boo iced out in invisible sets
Niggas must think that I'm outta my mind
Like I'm out in the streets without the nine
Come on, use your brain before I put 'em on the floor
One shot, I bet you won't walk no more
Reason why, you went sick-up crazy
Now your mom over top of you like 'Get up, baby!'
But not today, he gone and that's that

Big dick? (""Mister."") Fuck yo' sister
Bitch you call, she call to talk about Mister
Whole time, thinkin' it was all about rap
Knowin' I'ma playa. How the fuck you think that?
Compare a brick of raw to an ounce just of crack

You can catch me in your bitch ear sayin' I'm fuckin' nice
At the bar. Cristal and a bucket of ice
You can catch a nigga lookin' at me, mad 'cause I'm eatin'
Type: crack on my bitch just to tell her I'm cheatin'. (""Sucka."")
I talk that shit and walk it like beat cops
'Bonic all over it soon as the beat drops

Buy the mall out while you niggas there browsing
In the latest six coupe, a 120,000
Score more proud, 'bout pile reclinin'
We gonna make changes listening to Phyllis Hyman
Cops want to search for guns and can't find 'em
They ask for my name, I tell 'em read it in diamonds
Mr. fuck hoes and put down the bricks
Advance my drink game for Mo' Don and Cris'
Bought whips in the order of 4, 5 and 6
Man I never been broke I kept money to count
Get it down in dice games, win money and bounce
A milli-on motherfuckers, it's how the word's pronounced
I keep my bank account, the banks amount
My niggas play freeze tag with big rocks that's costly
Bonic iceman and of course I'm all frosty

Drop they gorgeous bitch, drop they shit soon as I hop out

And plenty ho's in tattoo parlors getting my name
Probably think I'm highed up, pot, spit and flip game
Snorted out my mind with six bitches like Rick James

SLow up, you want me now cause I'ma blow up

Yo, I'm not concerned wit the rhymes you wrote
I'm at the Sixers game seat close enough to trip Kukoc
Niggas mad tryin to catch me slippin
But instead in out of town nigga catch me trippin
I guess I sold out if they don't see me this winter
The only thing I sold out was the CoreStates Center, Chi Ching
Its BooBonic got blocks that stay bouncin
You got baby weights six pounds and nine ounces
I'm heavy out here get your shit together
Tryin to sell it lightweight like Floyd Mayweather

Is the waking after dreaming you were in my arms
And then I open eyes and I realize

If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Although it meant my life

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Is a lovely shade of teal
From his duck-billed nose to his web-bed toes
And his nerves were made of steel

What does this have to do with Christmas?
Well, I'm, I'm just describing him
So that people have a mental picture
It, it matches the original song

The night before Christmas
'Twas a crisis at the Pole
'Cause old Doofenshmirtz, he had done his worst
And a sleigh that day he stole

Doof took it on a joyride
Just as far as he was able
But Doof, that goof, he lost control
Ran into the reindeers' stable

Now all the reindeer
Were on crutches or in traction
So old agent P, he knew that he
Must spring right into action

Look at that platypus, look at that platypus
Look at that platypus go
Look at that platypus, look at that platypus
Flying o'er the snow

""O'er,"" sir?
It's a contraction, it means ""over""
It's a bit archaic
It's traditional, Carl, get o'er it

So the reindeer were out of commission
And Santa's sleigh was trashed
I'd explain it more but we've been there before
It doesn't need to be rehashed

Santa Claus was freaking out
Thought he'd have to scrap his run
He was torn inside, for without a ride
He knew Christmas Day was done

On the rugged trail toward the balcony
A child of the twentieth century
A dried up Goliath and a weasel named Fee

Far away in another place
A fading beauty named Milly Grace
And a bamboo cane to help her keep the pace

Fee was a Buddhist prodigy
Long past the age of maturity
Someday he knew it would set him free
Like it did for Floyd the chimpanzee

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free.
You're racing with the wind
You're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee
And catch your breath

Fee first met Milly in a bar in Peru
His heart was jumping like a kangaroo
Like a beast in a cage in an old Dutch zoo
It was hopping and thumping in wooden shoes

But Floyd was jealous and alone
He wanted Milly for his own
A desperate craving in his bones
""Their love"", he said, ""I will not condone.""

Then one day on a ship to Quebec
Floyd found Milly on a lover's trek
He picked up a bottle and broke off the neck
It sliced through the air, and Fee hit the deck

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
You want to stay with Milly
Until you're dead
But you just got a bottle
Upside your head

Milly turned and began to scream at Floyd
said ""You think you're pretty mean""
And though she was as thin as a small string bean
She slammed him in the face with a nectarine

Floyd fell back over the edge of the ship
Till he hung from the rail by his fingertip
said, ""Floyd I'll make you lose your grip
With this tiny piece of paper I can make you slip""

So Milly took that paper and did the deed
Floyd hit the water with astonishing speed
And as the sharks circled and began to feed
Milly knew her weasel was finally free

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free

Cause Milly took that paper
And sliced him on the nipple",Fee,1988

Phish,"(Doctor Davis, telephone please, Doctor Davis, telephone please)

I'd catapult downtown
To see the galleries
And my favorite fiancee
In a lavender gown

But I'm hooked up to a machine
It performs my daily functions
Through a tube in my wien

And today that thing malfunctioned
Like a forest fire
It burnt a hole in me and I perspired

So there ain't gonna be a wedding
No love affair
No art to which none compares",Catapult,1991
Phish,"Your time is near, the mission's clear
It's later than we think
Before you slip into the night
You'll want something to drink
Steal away before the dawn, and
Bring us back good news
But if you've tread in primal soup
Please wipe it from your shoes

Just then a porthole pirate
Scourged the evening with his cry
And sanctuary bugs deprived
The monkey of its thigh
A dust arose and clogged my nose
Before I could blink twice
Despite the stuff that bubbled up
I gave some last advice:

The flesh from Satan's dogs
Will make the rudiments of gruel

Deduct the carrots from your pay
You worthless swampy fool

Exploding then through fields and fen
And swimming in the mire
The septic maiden's gargoyle tooth
Demented me with fire
I drifted where the current chose
Afloat upon my back
And if perchance a newt slimed by
I'd stuff it in my sack

Soon I felt a bubble form, Somewhere below my skin
But with handy spine of hedgehog
I removed the force within
Suzie then removed her mask
And caused a mighty stir
The angry mob responded
Taking turns at grabbing her

The foggy cavern's musty grime
Appeared within my palm
I snatched Rick's fork to scrape it off
With deadly icy calm

The brothel wife then grabbed a knife
And slashed me on the tongue
I turned the blade back on the bitch
And dropped her in the dung]

The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue
And used her like a rag
To mop the slime from where the slug
Had slithered with the bag

In summing up, the moral seems
A little bit obscure...

Give the director a serpent deflector
A mudrat detector, a ribbon reflector
A cushion convector, a picture of nectar 
A virile dissector,a hormone collector

I'd call him instead

Before he could be heard

Like he had closed the door

And scampered quickly out of range

Spoken by Trey [with asides by Fishman]:
Once upon a time Far far away from here 
There, in a small town...
A small town... 
Small town...
Small...

And on the outskirts of this town 
There lived a mean, nasty, furry, ugly hound named Harpua. 

Harpua roamed the outskirts of the town every day and he'd walk around looking for a little action. 
So of course this day was no different from any other day and here we start the story and we see Harpua walking around on the outskirts of town near the forest kind of at the edge of the forest and he's walking in toward town...
Harpua walked toward the town...
Innocently...
And meanwhile in the town...
In a whole different part of the town 
There lived a young boy all alone in a suburban neighborhood 
And every day he'd sit in his room 
And sit on his little couch [AND SMOKE POT!]... 

he'd sit on his little couch and 
He'd listen to his stereo...
And he'd lay back and 
He'd look down next to him and 
He'd pet his favorite little [DOG!] 
Furry little...
Oh, he loved his little...
Furry...
Thing that he pet every day while he listened to his stereo 
[while sitting on the couch] 
He'd pet his furry [thing on the couch] his furry...
And he looked down and he said 
""I love to pet you, my little furry...
Thing that I ... 
I love you so much that I decided to name you 
This name that I love and so I named you...
I love you so... 

that's why...
That's why I pet you every day...
That's why I named you...
That's why when I first got you and 
I knew how much I loved you...

I decided that I'd give you the name of... 
The moniker of...
I'd call you...
Your name is... 

I DECIDED THAT YOUR NAME WOULD HAVE TO BE...

Poster Nutbag sat on the couch next to Jimmy... 
Poster Nutbag, the furry little kitty-cat Jimmy's pet sat next to Jimmy and he looked up at Jimmy...
And on this particular day Poster Nutbag decided to go for a little walk so Poster Nutbag got up and walked toward the door and Jimmy went to the door and he opened up the door and Poster Nutbag went outside and he started walking across the yard.. 
And he walk onto the sidewalk and he started walking innocently down the street and he walked down the street and suddenly he found himself wandering... 
Into a new part of town that he'd never been to...

Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN
Let me take you to...FUNKYTOWN

And when he got there he was walking along and suddenly he rounded a corner and in front of him he saw...
He saw Harpua...
Harpua, the ugly dog from the beginning of the story...
And they looked at each other...
Tension filled the air... 
There was going to be a nasty fight...

Harpua saw Poster Nutbag and began to growl and let a hungry drop of saliva fall onto the floor... 
Poster Nutbag coiled his body into a deadly arch... 
The fight was about to begin...

Phish,"Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight
Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor
He was on his way to see the king
Wilson Wilson Wilson
He led me through the streets of Prussia talking
As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his boot heel
He said there was a place where we should go
So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which
We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring
The knight grew very quiet as we stood there
Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing

He said I come from the land of darkness
He said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died

He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct
From doing things smart people don't do
He said that he was once a Lizard too
His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save
His people from the fate that lay before them
Their clumsy end was perilously near
The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened
By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book
In all of Prussia only one existed
And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook

He said I come from the land of darkness
He said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died

The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets
Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor
The trick was to surrender to the flow
We walked along beneath the moon
He lead us through the bush 'till soon
We saw before our eyes a raging river
He said that we could swim it if we tried
And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms
Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk
And as his body disappeared before me
I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk

He said I come from the land of darkness
He said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died

But Rutherford and Forbin weren't alone. Suddenly, an unexpected movement caught his eye
On the far side of the river, he saw a shaggy creature standing in the weeds who stared across at Forbin with an unrelenting gaze
A gigantic mass of muscles and claws
The hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in the water and swam toward the region where Rutherford lay
And in a flash, the beast was gone, underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while Forbin, bewildered, waited alone
The seconds dragging by him seemed like hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream. Defeated, he bowed his head and turned to go
Suddenly with a roar, the creature emerged before him and held the brave knight's body to the sky. And the creature laid the knight upon the shore
And the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer that he'd survive
And Rutherford, brave Rutherford was alive",The Lizards,2001

Come from the North where the oceans freeze
Spent three long months at the open seas
Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more
Till I hit the ground on Prussia's shores

How was I to know that day
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way
But soon towards me from the East
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beast

Hey!

Well, it seemed he didn't like my face
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip

Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack
And told me not to worry 'cause they'd soon be back
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed

Singing, ""Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, punch you in the eye""

Hey!

Now Wilson knew that I was loose
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree
So angrily I paddled to the open sea

But the sea was eager to beat me back
And the waves grew huge and deadly black
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead

When the morning came and the storm had passed
The dismal fog began at last
To open up before my eyes
And there I saw to my surprise

Chains and specks of islands curved
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved
Parked my kayak on a stone
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne

Once upon a time there was a mountain that rose out of a vast green forest. And in the forest there were birds and lakes and rocks and trees and rivers. The forest was also inhabited by a small group of people called the lizards. The lizards were a simple people and they had lived in the forest undisturbed for thousands of years in utter peace and tranquillity. Once a year when spring came, and the first blossoms began to show, the

lizards would gather at the base of the mountain, to give thanks for all that they had. They thanked the birds and they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks and the trees and the rivers; but most importantly, they thanked Icculus. 

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain, or at least everyone thought so, for no one had actually ever seen him. But they knew he existed, because they had the Helping Friendly Book. Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book to the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift. It contained all of the knowledge inherent in the universe, and had

enabled the Lizards to exist in harmony with nature for years. And so they lived; until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge. His name was Wilson and he quickly became intrigued by the Lizards way of life. He asked if he could stay on and live in the forest; and the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider, were happy to oblige.

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years, studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book, and all was well. Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone. Wilson explained that he had hidden the book, knowing that the Lizards had become dependent on it for survival. He declared himself king and enslaved the innocent

people of Gamehendge. He cut down the trees and built a city, which he called Prussia. And in the center of the city he built a castle, and locked in the highest tower of the castle lay the Helping Friendly Book out of the reach of the Lizards forever. But our story begins at a different time, not in Gamehendge, but on a suburban street in Long Island, and our hero is no king sitting in a castle, he is a retired colonel shaving in his bathroom.


Colonel Forbin looked square in the mirror and dragged the blade across his cold creamed skin. He saw the tired little folds of flesh that lay in a heap beneath his eyes. Fifty-two years of obedient self-restraint, of hiding his tension behind a serene veil of composure. For fifty-two years he had piled it all on the back burner, and for fifty-two years it had boiled, frothing over in a turbulent storm inside of him. It had escaped through his eyes, reacting with the cigarette smoke and the fluorescent lights and slowly accumulating into a sagging mass. He ran his dripping palm across the stubble on the nape of his neck and thought again about the door. He had discovered the door some months back on one of his ritualistic morning walks with his dog McGrupp. It had started out as a typical stroll with McGrupp bounding joyously ahead of the preoccupied colonel. As they reached the apex of the hill, he saw it and he knew it had always been there, and felt foolish for overlooking the door for so long. At first, he tried to ignore it, but he soon found that it was impossible, and slowly his newly acquired knowledge transformed his dreary life into a prison from which there was only one escape. And on this morning, Colonel Forbin stepped through the door...

Phish,"Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens,
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode,
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell.

[Chorus]
Go Go
Go Johnny Go Go 
Go Johnny Go Go 
Go Johnny Go Go 
Go Johnny Go Go 
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Oh sit beneath a tree by the railroad track
Oh the engineers would see him sittin' in the shade,
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made,
Oh n' people passin' by they would stop and say
'Oh my but that little country boy could play'

[Chorus]

His mother told him 'some day you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big ol' band
Many people comin' from miles around,
To hear you play your music when the sun go down,
Maybe some day your name will be in lights sayin'
'Johnny B. Goode' tonight

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,

In fact it's getting pretty tame
It's just not that great anymore

I guess I'll go outside
And flag a weasel for a ride
And take it on down to the shore

Was all the waiting in vain?

The day that you arrived

But you sent him home on the train

I detected faint axilla scent that put me off my appetite,

Then reveling in mirror mask I soon was lost in foggy ditch,

Without a feather gray or white to tickle that piano witch,

Fearing that I must expose my worm to holographic haze,

My Clinometer error rose and spawned in her new mawkish ways,

I woke the witch with reverence reserved for serpents, snails, and slugs,

I pulled the witch from out the ditch and turned to face the furry thugs,

The sheep they smiled with teeth agleam,

The weapons in their hooves revolved I detected a prostatic ream,

And wiped away the beads of sweat

That glistened on his brow

His tired feet were buried in the quagmire

And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him

And fulfillment of his vow


And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root

And pulled his body upwards

To a sea green mossy boulder

And he dragged his weary carcass [or ""shit-ass""] up the mountain


And he climbed so slowly

He climbed so slowly

Ahead

Ahead


Suddenly he heard the crack of thunder

And the rocks began to crumble overhead

And tumble down the mountain to the

Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs

through which his path had led

And the earth began to quake beneath his feet

And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes

And he stood amidst a sea of dust and rocks and stones

Cascading down the mountain

And a thousand birds were headed for the sky. Oh...


The sacred creed will be yours

And if you wait until tomorrow

The sacred creed will be yours

To devour

Yours

To seize

And to obey

Obey


When the dust had cleared, the colonel lifted up his head

And was driven to his knees by a blazing beam of light

And he saw the silhouette that stood before him

And he bowed in reverence

Trembling in the shadow of the mighty legend's form

Icculus the prophet stood before his eyes

Looking down on Colonel Forbin

Where he shuddered in the puddles and the muck

And he quietly addressed him


And he spoke so slowly

He spoke so slowly

Ahead

He said


Colonel Forbin I know why you've come here

And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack

I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird

To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack

And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow

And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed

But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure

Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice

And greed


The sacred greed will be yours

And if you wait until tomorrow

The sacred creed will be yours

To devour

Yours

To seize

And to obey

And to obey




And the famous mockingbird swooped down out of the sky and landed on

Icculus's shoulder, and Icculus whispered into the bird's ear, and it flew

off toward Wilson's castle in the valley below.

The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly Book at their feet. The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years that it's sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what their next move should be. The shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of his plan. He would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for him. With Rutherford's aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole, with glue and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a King.

If the lord ever comes
Descending from the skies in some fiery fashion
As so many say he will
You will not see me
Going joyously to greet him expecting my deliverance
But running for the hills
For if such a day should come to pass
This is no God come to save the human race

But a big boat, like the ones our forefathers sailed
Having made it across the great ocean to our shores
From outer space

And friends
When that boat finally comes
Ascending from the depths of our imagination
To appear within our sight
We'll be born again
As we've been so many times all throughout the ages 
When we find that we're not right

Scoping up close
With mic cords choking
Deliver the final blow

Somehow our happy romance ended suddenly
Still in my heart you'll be forever mine

Phoebe Snow,"Oh, majesty of life, please don't escape me.
It's getting later and the window shades are drawn.
I'm not the best that I could be
But I'm trying to wait and see
What can happen to a girl in her hometown 

[Chorus]
Oh, the wilderness
The unmade bed
The aching head
And oh the greying afternoon
The diary that ends too soon 

Oh sweet belief in love, I know you're somewhere
No love is perfect but a true one must exist
It's getting farther down the year
I hope my autumn eyes will clear
And let me recognize his soul
When we have kissed

And if I don't make it, You know my baby will.
