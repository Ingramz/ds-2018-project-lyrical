The Mello-Moods,"You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity, eternity

You're mine
Your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me
For eternity, eternity, eternity

You're mine my baby and you'll always be
I love you so much
I swear by everything, everything I own
[Incomprehensible]

You're mine
And we belong together
Yes, we belong together
For eternity, eternity, eternity

You're mine
Your lips belong to me
Yes, they belong to only me
For eternity

For eternity
For eternity

The Mellomen,"Everywhere you go sunshine follows you
Everywhere you go skies are always blue
Children love you they seem to know
You bring roses out of the snow,
The whole world says ""hello""
Everywhere you go

Teeth like the pearl,
Eyes with the heaven's blue)

You made me love you

This is that once in a lifetime
This is the thrill divine
What's more, this never happened before
Though I have prayed for a lifetime
That such as you would suddenly be mine
Mine to hold as I'm holding you now and yet never so near
Mine to have when the now and the here disappear

Couldn't sleep, and wouldn't sleep
Then love came and told me, I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

Lost my heart, but what of it, he is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it, although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to him, bring spring to him
And long, for the day when I'll cling to him

And the tombstones quake
Spooks come out for a singing wake
Happy haunts materialize
And begin to vocalize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

Now don't close your eyes
And don't try to hide
Or a silly spook may sit by your side
Shrouded in a daft disguise
They pretend to terrorize
Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize

As the moon climbs high o'er dead oak tree
Spooks arrive for the midnight spree
Creepy creeps with eerie eyes
Start to shriek and harmonize
Grim grinning ghosts come out socialize

When you hear the knell of a requiem bell
Weird glows gleam where spirits dwell
Restles bones etherealize
Rise as spooks of every size

Grim grinning ghosts come out to socialize
Grim grinning ghosts come out
Grim grinning ghosts come out

The Mellowmen,"When I was mustered out
I thought without a doubt
That I was through with all my care and strife
I thought that I was then
The happiest of men
But after months of tough civilian life

Gee, I wish I was back in the Army
The Army wasn't really bad at all

Three meals a day
For which you didn't pay
Uniforms for winter, spring and fall

There's a lot to be said for the Army
The life without responsibility

A soldier out of luck
Was really never stuck
There's always someone higher up where you can pass the buck
Oh, gee, I wish I was back in the Army

Gee, I wish I was back in the Army
The Army was the place to find romance

Soldiers and WACS
The WACS who dressed in slacks
Dancing cheek to cheek and pants to pants

There's a lot to be said for the Army
A gal was never lost for company

A million handsome guys
With longing in their eyes
And all you had to do was pick the age, the weight, the size
Oh, gee, I wish I was back in the Army

Gee, I wish I was back in the Army
The shows we got civilians couldn't see

How we would yell for Dietrich and Cornell
Jolson, Hope and Benny all for free
[Alternate line from sheet music:
Crosby, Hope and Jolson all for free]

There's a lot to be said for the Army
The best of doctors watched you carefully

A dentist and a clerk
For weeks and weeks they'd work
They'd make a thousand dollar job and give it to a jerk

Three meals a day
For which you didn't pay

And it sure would be dandy

Bring happy times

It was on a Sunday morn'
Of course it was against his religion

Shot some very fine quail
One little measly hare
On his way returning home

Bear walked around, stood on the ground
He walked straight to the preacher, you see
Preacher got so excited
And then he ran up a Sycamore tree

Bear walked around, stood on the ground

Cast his eye to the Lord above
And these are words he said to Him

He said, ""Oh Lord, oh, Lord, Lord
You delivered Daniel in the lion's den
Samson strong and the hundred men
Hebrew children in the furnace of fire""

""David went to kill the lion
The good book do declare
But Lord, if they don't help me
Don't You help this big black bear""

I think it was all night
Said, ""Oh Lord, if You don't help me
Treat us both alright""

The preacher come tumblin' down
You should've seen him getting that razor out
Before he struck the ground

He struck the ground cuttin' left and right
He put up a very good fight
About that time the bear told the preacher
Just hold him a little too tight

Preacher lost the razor
Bear held on with the [Incomprehensible]
Cast his eye to the Lord above

As I look back on a love so sweet
I cry like a baby
Oh, every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby
I know now that you're not a plaything
Not a toy, or a puppet on a string

Today we passed on the street, and you just walked on by
how my heart just fell to my feet
and like a fool I began to cry

Oh when I think about the good love you gave me
I cry like a baby
Living without you is driving me crazy
I cry like a baby
I know now,that you're not a plaything
I cry like a baby, cry like a baby

Every road is a lonely street
I cry like a baby, cry like a baby
Living without you is driving me crazy
I cry like a baby, cry like a baby

You take the bitter with the sweet.

You'll be down again, oh

They say, Shirley, did you really do that?
Did you really buy him all those cars
And the clothes like you said on the record?
Yeah, love'll make you do these things

Can make you lie in bed night after night

Hoping that any minute he'll call
And tell you, baby, I'll be there shortly
You just hold on, I'm coming

So woman to woman
I don't think it's being anymore than fair 
Then to call you and let you know where I'm coming from

Now Barbara, I don't know how you're gonna take this

You see, I make it possible

Ha ha, I buy them

So I'm telling you these things
To let you know how much I love that man 
And woman to woman
I think you'll understand just how much I'll do to keep him

If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
And woman to woman

Wouldn't you have done the same thing too

Can't you see where I'm coming from
Woman to woman
Ain't that the same thing you would've done

The Memphis Horns,"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me ""Why had I run""
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I said ""I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead""
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head

Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together 'til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

If only half of this was true
That you believe of me

I close my eyes
I seem to hear the raindrops saying
You won't come back

You still heal me

Uhu baby, I want it so bad to find some way
Of just coming out and telling you
That I did not want to love you so much
Oh, but I just couldn't, so I just walked away

You'll be down again, oh

Don't you do that, baby

To save the love that's slipping away
Away from me

Are probably criticizing me this evening
I even run into some ladies occasionally out there
Have the nerve to ask me

They say, Shirley, did you really do that?
Did you really buy him all those cars
And the clothes like you said on the record?
Yeah, love'll make you do these things

It's a funny thing how these men
Can make you lie in bed night after night
Wondering if they coming home
Laying there by the phone

Hoping that any minute he'll call
And tell you, baby, I'll be there shortly
You just hold on, I'm coming

Comes in three days later, yeah
I know you know what I'm talking about
You see, it ain't no fun to have to sit there

Count them four walls

How we ladies can get on that telephone
Talking day after day about how sweet
And how good our love life is

Commercial that comes on TV
How's your love life?
Knowing all the time that it's rotten

I've always believed in
Whatever makes me feel happy
I try to do whatever it takes
To keep it that way

But you see, it ain't no fun
Being in love all by yourself
Knowing all the time that the one you love
Is loving somebody else
I'm standing here to tell you today, ladies
That it ain't no fun

It ain't no fun

Barbara, this is Shirley
You might not know who I am
But the reason I am calling you is because
I was going through my old man's pockets this morning
And I just happened to find your name and number

So woman to woman
I don't think it's being anymore than fair 
Then to call you and let you know where I'm coming from

Now Barbara, I don't know how you're gonna take this
But whether you be cool or come out of a bag on me
You see it doesn't really make any difference

But it's only fair that I let you know that
That the man you're in love with, he's mine
From the top of his head, to the bottom of his feet
The bed he sleeps in and every piece of food he eats
You see, I make it possible 

The clothes on his back
Ha ha, I buy them
The car he drives, I pay the note every month

So I'm telling you these things
To let you know how much I love that man 
And woman to woman
I think you'll understand just how much I'll do to keep him

Woman to woman
If you've ever been in love
Then you know how I feel
And woman to woman
Now, if you were in my shoes
Wouldn't you have done the same thing too

Can't you see where I'm coming from
Woman to woman
Ain't that the same thing you would've done

Woman to woman
Now should I just step aside
And let her take what's rightfully mine

Oh, oh, woman to woman
Was I right or was I wrong
I ain't gonna let you break up my happy home

Now woman to woman
Now you see I don't want no trouble now
I hope you understand
I love that man and he's mine

I'm talking to you

You should be woman enough to understand

Where the chimney's hushed and the cotton mills closed

He didn't come home
My husband dead
Without a service, without grace

Said the machine went down so hard
He didn't feel a thing
What were those knife wounds
What were those bruises on his face

Invisible guilt
Invisible shack back in the trees
If they ever even find me
I haven't had a name since I came

My stomach swells, the putrid smells
Even worse the past few days
My soul is leaving me
My heart is hiding in his grave

My fears turn to something worse
Jam the hole with your jagged key
Would you please push me down
Or would you spare the boy in me?

Could I have found my way out?
Could my two girls grow up to be free?
If you ever touch a hair on their heads
If you ever look at them the way you do me
I'll wash away my faith and stayed in red

You point to the fucking door

Pick up your bra and pick up your blouse
And get the hell out of my house

That I could make those people dance

With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep

Now the half-time air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune

The Merry Macs 

When she walks along
On the street fellows shout
""Here, pretty Kitty,
Here pretty Kitty blue eyes.""

You can hear 'em shout 
Every time she goes out,
""Here, pretty Kitty,
Here pretty Kitty blue eyes.""

But she looks at no boy
She's lonely in New Your,
'Cause she loves a doughboy 
Named Johnny O'Rourke.

That's why she'll never 
Hear anyone till he'll shout,
""I'm here, pretty Kitty,
Here pretty Kitty blue eyes.""

And my heart is wond'ring still

When you whisper ""I can't live without you,""

You tell so tenderly

You can't kill him 
'Cause he's already dead
He's got the strength 
Of darkness now
The strength of twenty anyhow
He's got girlies in his mind
Scarred fingers and a
Rageous brain
Six bullets buried in his chest
We'll never stop him

He does his work
What he gave started
He won't shirk
You won't laugh and he won't cry
On his anniversary you could die
He's wetted his chops and now he's out
But you won't see him move about
He's out for blood 
He's got a thirst
Goodbye to that happy

Slow down you grave robbing bastard
Stop right there I hear the constable scream

A crowd of locals heading my way
Why can't they leave me alone

He ruled his world with a vicious hand
And he didn't fuck about oh no
Kings and queens and mighty rulers
Handed over money to stop him getting mad
And made sure they smiled has they handed over money
And had a drink to the good king vlad

With his bold army from Transylvania
Nearly just as black heart as he
They slaughtered all nations that would not bow to him
It was a bloody sight to see
Prince and paupers sons and daughters
Show him respect or he'll nail on your hat
So give up your treasure and don't be sad
Just have drink to the good king vlad

Fly the dragon flag stained in blood
Impale people every day
Long live the legend of this great king
His memory will never fade away

Fell to nothing and gave all they had

Stole him self a hooker just to keep himself warm

I've got too much going on and I don't know what to do.
The pace is getting frantic, everything is falling through.
I'm way over my head and the load is way too much to bear.
I brought it all upon myself.
I still keep going on moving as fast as I can.
Can't stop to pick up the pieces try to fill every demand.
Moving twenty directions simultaneously.
I lost my ehad along the way.

[Chorus]
Slow down.





",Slow Down,2001
The Methadones,"I'm gonna hang out with myself.
I won't be in debt to anybody
Or have to worry about pushing anyone
'Cause I don't want them around.

And everybody around me has told me things that I don't believe
Seems like everyone around is pleased when I'm not happy.

I'm all alone again,
And I'm perfectly content for now.

As I dream of somewhere else,
I won't have to answer to anybody
Or have to listen to the moronic views that I hear everywhere.
As I wonder, I start to doubt that anyone would have relief
To a lie he's gonna say before I walk away
There's no use in trying to explain?

I'm all alone again,
And I'm perfectly content.
Yeah, I'm all alone again,
And I'm perfectly content for now.




",Solitude,2001
The Methadones,"

You keep hoping someday you'll have it all.
It keeps your mind chasing dreams down it's slick and darkened hall.
You just can't be happy with what you got.
Unless you own the whole damn lot.
Think about what you have, instead of what you don't have.
And you would find that you're doing better than most.
When you finally hold the things you've been longing for, you immediately think about the next.

[Chorus]
Have you ever looked around you? Have you ever enjoyed the moment?
Have you ever let yourself just simply be?
Can you think of strengths that you have, instead of what you think you need.
Did you ever question what you believe?

The grass just gets greener on the other side.
While the moment keeps passing by.
And it will never be good enough to appreciate what's already there.

And if you'd take a look, take a look around.





",Take a Look,2001
The Methadones,"There's a very peculiar way you see the world
You scan it through a pair of colored lenses
You package it neatly in your head
Choose to see it the way you want to

[Chorus]
Which doesn't reflect the way they really are
It's just a one dimensional view
As the truth unfolds the look of disbelief is in your eyes
It didn't turn out the way you thought it would

It takes a long time to really know anyone
Don't make your mind about what you think you see
You might always have some biases
Look at the facts to replace the skewed beliefs

[Chorus]
Which doesn't reflect the way they really are
Its just a one dimensional view
As the truth unfolds the look of disbelief is in your eyes
It didn't turn out the way you thought it would

Don't sell yourself a false bill of goods
Be more practical before you make your assessment
You're walking into a downward spiral
I wish you luck in trying to get out",Wake Up,2001
The Methadones,"

You keep hoping you'll wake up and have the answers to your life.
The more you search, you find the reckless driver of your mind.
You think if you keep trying to figure out where it all went wrong.
You can move one step further to a place where you belong.

You keep asking yourself - who am I?

Trying to be everything to please everyone you can.
Don't know which way to turn to, but no one can hold your hand.
And make you find the answers that you need.
No one outside yourself can lead your destiny.

You keep asking yourself - who am I?

Don't want to believe that any of this is real.
Yet you can't turn off the emptiness you feel.





",Who Am I?,2001
The Methadones,"I sit here waiting for you to acknowledge me with a greeting or a simple smile
These things I once took for granted now go a long way with me
They can make it all worth while

I hope you'll listen to what I have to say
You're so far away now
Everything turns into a game
You're so far away even though you're right here next to me
I keep hoping that you'll let me in

I've got this sick feeling in my gut that's been lingering for weeks
From the things that you have and have not said
Please don't turn away something I find important to me
Should I roll over and play dead?




",Far Away,2003

There was a flicker of familiarity
As we passed each other by

There was a time I knew you well

How did it ever come to this?

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

While I slept you came in through the window.
(morning sun)
I heard you whisper my name.
Your voice was the singing of birds.
From where I was you sounded far away
But slowly I floated towards the sound I was hearing.
The sound of you whispering to me.
I let go and opened my eyes.
Once I let go I forget where I was.
I squinted my eyes in the sun.
I caughht a few glimpses and everything was bright.
It was you I was seeing in sunlight.",Wake Me Up,1999
The Microphones,"You swam further out into the ocean.
I climbed higher in the tree,
At the top it started bending,
I swayed down to you in the sea.
When I saw you I called out your name,
let go and fell into the water.
And in between the crashing waves,
I swam out right underneath you.
Above me, you began to evaporate.
You floated up while I was reaching for you
And now, as a cloud, you visit me
Every night and every morning.
In between these times,
I'm floating towards you.",Ocean,2000

I want what I see
You, fireball, have rolled away and shaded valleys

What treasure map?
What breaking of day?
What stream used to flow here, and now what dusty decay?

The Middle East,"Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you'll hear your sister sleep talking
Say ""Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be""

And she'll wake up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
She'll lay it aside

Older father, weary soul, you'll drive
Back to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce
And a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings

And you'll find somebody you can blame
And you'll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you'll find the peace of the Lord.

Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die

It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread and it ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing you can do about it now",Blood,2009

Born is the King of Israel.
They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the East, beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued, both day and night.
And by the light of that same star

Three wise men came from country far,
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
This star drew nigh to the northwest;

O'er Bethlehem it took its rest.
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place whcre Jesus lay.
Then they did know assuredly

Within that house, the King did lie
One entered in then for to see
And found the babe in poverty.
Then entered in those wise men three,

And all that we had, is now just a mistake.
I guess it got boring and old,
So what have you done, you left me alone

You got your things, you got them all,
You know there's nothing you won't have,
And I'm afraid I don't got the cash,
To keep you happy, and I'm upset,
Cause you show me that your not free, that you need big fat limosenes,
To keep you high, to keep you safe, keep you in love.

What if I change for you, then will you see me, still with you.
I 'd never do it; I'm no fool.

So here we fall, and here we break
And all that we had, is now just a mistake.
You look so young, feel so misled
And your stuffy friends have gone to your head

And I'm afraid I don't got the cash,

What if I change for you, then will you see me, still with you.
I 'd never do it; I'm no fool.

Honey I'm not you.

I walk away, thinking back to the days, that I held you close
With your puffy white coat, and you told me joe, I could never let go
""I need you more, then life it's self"", and the rain poured down
And I kept you dry, and I took the tears fallen from your eyes, and the snow came down
And I kept you warm, and I kept you safe from your daddys dorm, when he said to you
That you can't see me, ""all those pools boys got nothing good to be"", now they got to you,
And what do you say, you want some rich guy instead of me.

What if I change for you, then will you see me, still with you.
I 'd never do it; I'm no fool.

That makes you not want to leave though you're all bent and tattered on this night. She said think about the time we've had, the moons we watched with pride. (How can you be so strong?) Think about the love we shared, the Junes that over ride. (No I won't, how can you be so strong) is it the morning dew that glistens in your bright eyes? Damn me for loving you, it burns a million fireflies. And if you only knew I doubt that you'd be dying. Here I'm a selfish fool to think that you'd be lyingâ?¦ on the couch. And its Sunday when everything was gold, you're on the couch. And you're floating along though everything's turned gray, you're on the couch. And it's Sunday and everything is gray, you're on the couch. How I want you to stay. Is it the falling breeze out on the peaceful pattern?

I was weary, worn, and sad 
I found in Him a resting place 
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord, 
how could He love me, 
I have sinned against Your will 
But He said, repent and I will forgive you, 
The question's who will you serve? 

You might be dirty, messed up inside, 
You may even have lost your will to live; 
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel, 
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me

The Mighty Clouds of Joy,"Sunday morning, very bright, I read Your book by colored light
That came in through the pretty window picture.

I visited some houses where they said that You were living
And they talked a lot about You
And they spoke about Your giving.
They passed a basket with some envelopes;
I just had time to write a note
And all it said was ""I believe in You.""

Passing conversations where they mentioned Your existence
And the fact that You had been replaced by Your assistants.
The discussion was theology,
And when they smiled and turned to me
All that I could say was ""I believe in You.""

I visited Your house again on Christmas or Thanksgiving
And a balded man said You were dead,
But the house would go on living.
He recited poetry and as he saw me stand to leave
He shook his head and said I'd never find You.

And while my dad was sleeping
We would walk down to Your house without speaking.",Hymn (Yes Yes),1998

The Mighty Diamonds,"[Chorus]
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Life in the shadows ain't no fun  
  
It's easy getting up there  
Never think of coming down  
Not hard to say 'I want you'  
When you're floating on a cloud  
But you know that lonely feeling  
When nothing's going right  
'Cause it's only the beginning  
Of a cold and sleepless night  

[Chorus]  

You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run  
  
It's harder getting up there  
And it's painful coming down  
And now you can't see clearly  
Beneath the thunder cloud  
And the loneliness gets longer  
When nothing's going right  
And things ain't getting any better  
With another sleepless night

You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun

I learned to love you and I thought you'd love me, too
But now that's all in the past and I'll forget somehow
I don't worry 'cause it makes no difference now

Now that we have really parted, I can't believe we're through
I don't blame myself and I'm sure I can't blame you
There was something had to happen and it happened somehow

Checked the clock when I got home
And realized I was alone
Sat for hours by the window
Wonderin' where did you go?
Couldn't eat or sleep at all
Took the pictures off the wall
Paced the place as time moves slow
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know
Lit a cigarette I couldn't smoke
Wound the clock until it broke
Went to bed then took a shower
Stared at TV for an hour
Did the dishes, made the bed
Read a book I've never read
Any minute you will show
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
I want to know

Where did you go? [Repeat x4]

And played a tape I couldn't hear
Emptiness began to grow
And I'm wondering where did you go?
Watched the sun come up from the back stairs
Thought about the last few years
I lost control, I screamed, I cried
I punched a pole and went inside
Packed my things called a friend
Wished this emptiness would end
Wrote a note then tore it up
Poured the beer into a cup
Sat on the couch, drank it slow
Wondering where did you go?
I realized I couldn't stay
Grabbed my things and I went away

Without any training
It's pouring, it's raining
Training or a trade
Hey, you bet I'm afraid
Unepuipped with a skill
But I'm thrilled with the thrill
Underskilled, unprepared
Hey, who wouldn't be scared
Bring on the obstacles
And burn me a bridge
I'm not sure, should I call
This my range or a ridge?
There ain't none too high
If I'm up for a climb
I'll go zero to sixty
And stop on a dime
A dime for a dozen
If that's what you're after
A moment of silence
A lifetime of laughter
On the brighter side
And ona happier note
The noise, well it's just love
That gets caught in my throat
The end of the line's
Not the end of a rope
Just a salesman
Selling a bucket of hope
When the bucket gets kicked
And my chips are all cashed
My intention, conventions
Are finally smashed

Demons never exorcised 
Appeared before my very eyes 
To no one's just my own suprise 
A scenario just so surreal 
Demons once so well concealed 
Were now throughout my whole ordeal 
So real and painfully revealed

You're not being honest really 
You're really not and ought to be 
Take an honest look at yourself
Try a little honesty 
You're not being honest really 
And honestly you've never been 
You ought to take a look at yourself 
Let the honesty begin 

In flew the accusations, the razor-toothed insinuations
Each ghost my own creation, and every monster my invention 
Beasts they came to burden, hell I let whatever stirred in 
And I couldn't get a word in, at this unearthly intervention

They let up when they knew they got through 
They knew I'd never be the same 
With little left to say or do 
They left as quickly as they came 
The life was scared half out of me 
Some way somehow I survived 
A part of me was proud of me 
The day my skeletons arrived

You're really not and ought to be

poured the beer into a cup

And I was wrong and its nearly near a year
And you're still here.

At my place then I lent you

Come single guy and gal unto me pay attention
Don't ever fall in love

For once he fell in love with a maiden so bewitching
Miss Henrietta Bell down in Captain Kelly's kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

At the age of seventeen I apprenticed to a grocer
Not far from Stephen's Green
Where Miss Henri' used to go sir
Her manners were sublime she set my heart a-twitchin'
When she invited me to a party in the kitchen

With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

Sunday was the day that they were to have their flare-up
He dressed himself quite gay
I frizzed and oiled my hair up
The Captain had no wife and he had gone a-fishin'
She groped me on the stairs beneath the old man's kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

Her arms around my waist she slyly hinted marriage
When to the door in haste came Captain Kelly's carriage
Her eyes were full of hate and poison she was spittin'
The Captain kicked the door in and stormed into the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

When the Captain came downstairs he saw my situation
In spite of all his prayers he was marched off to the station
For him they'd take no bail
To get home I was itchin'
He had to tell the tale how I came into the kitchen

CHORUS:
With me toora loora la, me toora loora laddie
Me toora loora la and me toora loora laddie

I said she did invite me
But she gave flat denial
For assault she did indict me and I was sent for trial
She swore he'd robbed her house
In spite of all her screechin'
I got six months hard
For his courtin' in the kitchen

...well that's my story and i'm sticking to that. So let's have another drink and let's talk about the blues. Blues is about dignity, it's about self-respect, and no matter what they take away from you - that's yours for keeps. I remember how it was, how every medium - T.V. and papers and radio and all those people were saying: 'you're on the scrap-heap, you're useless', and I remember how easy it was to start believing that. I remember how you'd hear people take it for granted that it was true - just 'cause someone with an ounce of power said so. And that's a problem now, too many oddballs, too many pocketbook psychologists and would-be philosophers with an axe to grind. But there's a solution, it's not easy, but it's a matter of coming to terms in your heart with situation you're in, a matter of choosing how things go for you and not having things forced upon you. There are plenty of forces against you, forcing you against your will, your ideals - you've got to hope for the best, and that's the best you can hope for - you've got to hope against hope... I remember something Sal Paradise said, he said: 'the city intellectuals of the world are debauched from the full body blood-of-the-land and are just rootless fools'. So listen, when the smile, the condescending pat-on-the-back comes and says: 'we're sorry, but you're nothing, you've got nothing for us and we've got nothing for you', you say: 'No', and say it loud: ""NO!"", and remember, people who talk about revolution and a class-struggle without referring explicitly to everyday life, without understanding what is subversive about love, and what is positive in the refusal and constraint...since people have a corpse in their mouth.","Story of the Blues, Pt. 1-2 [*][Mix]",1982

I got the Story of the Blues
Try to believe me
'Cos it could be front page news

I say I live with it like it hasn't happened yet
I keep thinking of everyone
How I'm the one, the one they're trying to get
To tell the Story of the Blues

First, they take your pride
Turn it all inside
And then you realise
You've got nothing left to lose

So, you try to stop
Try to get back up
And then, you realise
You're telling the Story of the Blues

Feeling browbeaten
Day after day
I think it's over
But I just can't get away

You say forget it
We'll don't jump the gun
You're laughing this time
Next time you might be the one

Jeff, you'll never get rid of me (Good news!)

We're closer than pages that stick in a book (Me and my shadow)
We're closer than ripples that play in a brook (Perfect)

Happy new year!

And now to repeat what I said at the start (Me and my)
They'll need a large crowbar to bust us apart (Sha-a-a-a-adow)
We're alone but far from blue

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll change the name Redskins, 'cause that's such a chore

Yes, you phrase-maker
Well put
Hey,recently I've been keeping out my butter
Out at night so it's soft in the morning
Is that risky? I love soft butter
That's not risky, you can do that with butter, you can leave it out
Okay, I'm taking that to the bank
What was I gonna say? Oh oh oh, I know
Could you do me a favor, Sarah?
Yes, anything
Could we take it just one more time?
From the top?
No, from the ending, I love that ending!

Before we get finished, we'll make the town roar
We'll, just like Michael Corleone, we'll settle old scores!
Oh then we'll talk to the Tarot, and dress up like whores!

Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will calm a storm with His hand?

Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod?
When you kissed your little baby
You've kissed the face of God

The blind will see, the deaf will hear
And the dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb

Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations?

Did you know that your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect Lamb?

It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the Spirit felt its worth.
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, the night when Christ was born;
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!
O night, O Holy Night , O night divine!

Led by the light of faith serenely beaming,
With glowing hearts by His cradle we stand.
O'er the world a star is sweetly gleaming,
Now come the wisemen from out of the Orient land.
The King of kings lay thus lowly manger;
In all our trials born to be our friends.
He knows our need, our weakness is no stranger,
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!
Behold your King! Before him lowly bend!

Truly He taught us to love one another,
His law is love and His gospel is peace.
Chains he shall break, for the slave is our brother.
And in his name all oppression shall cease.
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
With all our hearts we praise His holy name.
Christ is the Lord! Then ever, ever praise we,
His power and glory ever more proclaim!
His power and glory ever more proclaim!",O Holy Night,2000

Of a dirty airport town
What was I doing on the road to ruin?
Well, my mama laid me down, my mama laid me down

Around my hand was a plastic band
With a picture of my face
I was crying, left to die
In this godforsaken place, this godforsaken place

Only mama knows what she laid me down
In this godforsaken town
Well, she was running too, what she ran from
Oh, I always wondered, I never knew

On the road, no ETA
I'm passing through, no fixed abode
And that is why I need to try to hold on
I've got to hold on, to hold on

Was it planned as a one night stand
Or did she leave in disgrace?
Well, I never, will I ever
See my father's face, see my father's face?

Only mama knows what she laid me down
In this godforsaken town
Well, she was running too, what she ran from

The Miller Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2007

The Mills Brothers,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso 
I fell in love with a Mexican girl.
Nighttime would find me in Rose's Cantina,
Music would play and Felina would whirl.

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina,
Wicked and evil while casting a spell.
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden,
I was in love, but in vain I could tell.

One night a wild young cowboy came in, 
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing,
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love.

So in anger 

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden;
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore.
My challenge was answered, in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor.

Just for a moment I stood there in silence,
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done.
Many thoughts ran through my mind as I stood there;
I had but one chance and that was to run.

Out through the back door of Rose's I ran, 
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one; he looked like he could run,
Up on his back and away I did ride.
Just as fast as 

I could from the West Texas town of El Paso,
Out thru the badlands of New Mexico.
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless;
Everything's gone in life nothing is left.

But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden,
My love is stronger that my fear of death.
(Nothing's missing. It really is only half a verse.) 

I saddled up and away I did go, 
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me,
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart.
And as last here 

I am on the hill overlooking El Paso,
I can see Rose's Cantina below.
My love is strong and it pushes me onward, 
Down off the hill to Felina I go.

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys,
Off to my left ride a dozen or more.
Shouting and shooting; I can't let them catch me,
I've got to make it to Rose's back door.

Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel 
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle.
I'm getting weary, unable to ride.
But my love for 

Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen;
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest.
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle,
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest.

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me,
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side.
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for,
One little kiss and Felina goodbye.",El Paso,1968
