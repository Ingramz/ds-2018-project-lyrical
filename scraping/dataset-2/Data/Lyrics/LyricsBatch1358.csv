Buck 65,"[verse 1]
Driving with a yellow dog, I95
He's got a smile on his face and big shiny eyes
Up at a decent hour, never ate yet
Got a little Johnny Cash in the ol' tape deck
Nothing in the trunk but some base ball gloves
A pair of jumper cables and a set of golf clubs
Blanket on the back seat, we're in rough shape
Sunroof held on with a bit of duct tape
Looking for a gas station, better make a list
Fill'er up with regular, I need to take a piss
Sexy girl air freshener, snacks and that pinwheel
Top up the fluids, clean the bugs off the windshield
Not a care in the world, not a how and a why
No destination, not a cloud in the sky
Back on the road not a moment too soon
Dish ran away with some other spoon

[chorus x2]
Wicked and weird, I'm a road hog with an old dog
Singing slow songs, tryin'a hold on
Wicked and weird, I'm a rat fish
Tryin'a practice doin' back flips on your mattress

[verse 2]
Hole in the muffler, ghosts on the shoulder
Cough drops, loose change in the beverage holder
To roll down the window, you gotta use a wrench
Been thinking about brushing up on my french
Right there in the glove box, if you should look
You'll find 40 parking tickets and a copy of the Good Book
Don't bother looking, you'll never find me
I'm starting from scratch and leaving trouble behind me

[chorus x2]
Wicked and weird, I'm a road hog with an old dog
Singing slow songs, tryin'a hold on
Wicked and weird, I'm a rat fish
Tryin'a practice doin' back flips on your mattress


Wicked, wicked, wicked and weird

[verse 3]
Christ Almighty, there's a rattle in the wheel well
Dog fell asleep and man, I don't feel well
But all I need's a half decent breakfast
And I'll be back at it, dirty and reckless
Five o'clock shadow, lips like mudflaps
Hands like eagle's talons, eyes like hub caps
The further I get, I keep goin' faster
Whispers in the wind and cows in the pasture
I have no plans and nothin' to prove either
I eat out of a bag and sleep in a movie theatre
The highway's a story teller, I just write it down
Already been beaten, there's no way to fight it now
I just kick back and keep warm on the cold days
And laugh 'cause it ain't like it was in the old days
I figure when I make it to the Heavenly gates
They'll be working on my car and playing '78's

[chorus x2]
Wicked and weird, I'm a road hog with an old dog
Singing slow songs, tryin'a hold on
Wicked and weird, I'm a rat fish
Tryin'a practice doin' back flips on your mattress",Wicked and Weird,2004
Buck 65,"Cardboard crown across the side says ""Fragile""
Shirt unbuttoned, pleasure fool, I'm agile
Ripped up forms, men with swords, tear the flesh
Eyes like shadows, one-way ticket, Marrakesh

Both doors and windows caught on fire, high speed train
Smashed up lives, torrential downpour, I need pain
Stuntmans' wife, back alley, mattress, wrath of addicts
Underwater, second language, mathematics

Run like a racehorse
Outright madness
Under the bridge
You'll make out like bandits

Make it stop 
Hurry up 
Go away
Fight it off
Hit it hard
Dig a hole
Show the way
Take it off
Break it up
Make it bleed
Try it now
Call it off
Kick it out
Let it breathe
Tie it down

Motion sickness, dry and yellowed, heaven beckons
Tornado boredom, target practice, seven seconds
Cimetiere, do mon prinaz, fair decision
Russels' viper, 3AM, midair collision

Silly girls and beat up boys all goin' fast
Lightin' fires, killin' music, blowin' glass
Whispered fury, deepest secret, separate treasures
The eyes go pink, I slap your forehead, desperate measures",Bandits,2004
Buck 65,"Vultures and helicopters overhead I'm broken down 
Used car blues, it's no time to joke around. 
The only solution I can think of so far 
Is to smash out the windows with a crowbar. 
And as the headlights shatter into stars one by one, 
I curse the at the road and try to knock out the sun. 
I kick in the corner panels, son of a whore. 
The paint starts to chip off as I rip off one of the doors. 

Same hotel room again with the right mixture 
Of terrible smells and dead flies in the light fixture 
I listen to the oldies station, half asleep and kind of smokey 
Girl in the next room is howling like a coyote. 
Hand in my pants, feeling like a phyllistine 
All eyes empty, every door way a guillotine. 
I'm drunk on lonliness, out of shape and half eaten 
The phone don't work and god's in a staff meeting. 

Out of breath at the end of a long summer. 
Waiting for a phone call that isn't a wrong number. 
A smile from a pretty girl, feet don't fail me. 
I sleep like a baby and get out of jail free 
I spit my teeth in my hand and read the classifieds. 
Poke holes in my memories until I'm satisfied. 
I'm drawn to familiar environments and dangers. 
I look at my photo albums and all I see are strangers.",Sore [Album Version],2004

Oh my god, I'm hot to steal, beside myself in friendless number
I ain't got no culture, nothin', dirty words, but that don't count
Flight attendants, waitresses, superstition - good amount
There's work to do, hell to pay, memories & finger prints

Still I'm stuck, I can't afford it. Picture postcards, small memento
Echo-shadow, echo-shadow-sterling silver, burning furnace
Frozen, nowhere, just a kid I had a friend named deadly earnest
Cross my heart & hope to die, stick a needle in my arm
Praise the heavens, call the cops. Relax. There's no cause for alarm
Diamond rings & little babies, 'startlements' & miracles
I remember pretty faces so severe & lyrical
I'm talkin' Amelia Earhart, Neko Case or Frida Kahlo
All alone the way it should be, I don't even need a shadow
Seeds of wisdom found no purchase, we don't even have a chance

Buck 65,"Ma foi, ma force, ma voix, my vows
Gypsy Madonna, all your beauty's in your eyebrows
Don't touch them, je fais le dernier pari, silently
Finally, I feel all the furies of love violently
Flowers in the rain, wild fires in the orchard
Singing in the pain, I beg to feel tortured
Sugar and chaos, everyone else is boring
Let's make dirty babies until the morning

Love sick how much deeper still can this get?
Show me where it hurts and let me kiss it
Je joue à l'envers de l'amour étroit 
Je jouis le mystère de l'amour courtois 

Making the fortune of fools seems believable
You're naked except for my diamond, impure evil
I'm searching for explosions in the dark, I'm dying
Blinded, I want to spend the rest of my life trying
Tout contre, swallowing, le monde, hoping
Je dessine à la sanguine le lit, blowing kisses where you open
Filthy, I was guilty at first sight to be possessed
Facing your waterfall my frenzy is confessed

Love sick how much deeper still can this get?
Show me where it hurts and let me kiss it
Je joue à l'envers de l'amour étroit 
Je jouis le mystère de l'amour courtois 

Passing fire back and forth, until the legs dance hysterical
Trying to vanish, I enter the miracle
I pay everyday my heavy pleasure to be your sin
You're taming my measure being out or being in
For la pluie, for religion, for la glace, forbidden
It's continuous, I come and go between your kidneys hidden
After the holy mess we make you wash my hair
While the smoke makes pretty designs in the air

Love sick how much deeper still can this get?
Show me where it hurts and let me kiss it

Buck 65,"Hey boys, I've come a long way
Along in the sun and the rain

What am I doing here? No-star hotel
Wasting my wealth
Telling myself to go to hell
Arm in a cast, heart like a corncob
Do noyt disturb sign hangin' on the door knob
Brain unplugged, my whole life in my luggage
My cruelty is dependable
And my ugliness is rugged
Smoke still slow dances out of my barrel
In the distance I can hear a kid
Singing a Christmas carol
And this is terrible, gorgeous and sinister
The pillow still smells like the secrets of my visitor
Nobody needs to know about this kind of thing
Blood on my back from the attack of her diamond ring
Me of all people, my mind's in a tail-spin
I'm just a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman
Part of me feels like dirt, the rest doesn't
She said I'm a way better lover than her husband

I've had a whole lot of fights
Along in the sun and the rain

Where am I going? Backwards to nowhere
In another man's shoes instead of my own pair
I promised discretion and to be at her beck and call
I look like a dandelion and feel like a wreckin' ball
I ran out of wishes and then she came to offer hers
Lookin' at myself in the mirror
I'm at a loss for words
I'm good at my job, goin' out of my mind kinda
Holding my face in my hands like fine China...
I've seen a whole of towns
Along in the sun and the rain

We met up again, went undercover literally
I told her about Cuba, I told her about Italy
Physics and photography, a little Russian history
Everything about her to me was such a mystery
I gave her the once over
She gave me the blood blister
She had no idea that I was fallin' in love with her
Call me mister
Crucial inspiration
All she wanted was my lust and useful information
What am I putting myself through this crap for?
Feels like I'm standing on top of a trap door
Lost at sea, tangled up in golden hair
Scavenger-hunter my life is a folding chair
My daily routine is down to a system
I give regular people truth and wisdom
That's what I do, it's my job, the prophet/profit
I can see the future and make money off it

I've kissed a whole lot of lips
Along in the sun and the rain",Drunk Without Drinking,2005
Buck 65,"I can remember being 7 years old and having gold fish that circled around in a bowl
And I would watch the forest burn and listen to the wind blow
I can remember the table, the drapes and the window
The dark brown everything, decorations, styling
Most of all I can remember my mother smiling
Worn out and faded, my home town was scrappy
More than anything she wanted us to be happy

Little to eat, back and forth to the hospital
She was right, it's better to be happy if possible
But the old man was under attack and was weak
And continued to beat us several times a week
He lived like a king even though we were piss poor
I tried to be strong and careful what I wished for
My outsides ache and my insides stung
From the long leather belt that replaced his tongue

Not knowing how to run or how to hit the brakes
A white picket fence was built around a pit of snakes
Both a wonder and frightening, the thunder and lightening
These were the sounds and sights of a thousand fights
My mother, the poor fish, staging eternal 
Cherades and parades for the raging inferno
Wanting to be happy, beaten all the while
Asking me always 'Why don't you ever smile?'
And she'd show me how to do it, mother and wife
It was the saddest smile I ever saw in my life
And it hurt worse than death but for her sake I tried
And one day all of those gold fish died

Hurricane, forest fire, out of control
Eyes open, floating on the water in the bowl
And when my father came home, he walked through the door
And threw those fish to the cat on the kitchen floor

And the wind died too
And I was still a child
And the three of us watched
As my mother smiled

And the wind died too
And I was still a child
And the three of us watched
As my mother smiled

And the wind died too
And I was still a child
And the three of us watched
As my mother smiled

And the wind died too",The Floor,2005

Buck 65,"I'm going down the road feelin' bad bye and bye
Deep fried blues but I'd rather die than cry
Gas station food bound to go stale soon
There's a curse in the air and a toe-nail moon
Yay, some of these towns are still non-friendly
And this is the hammer that killed John Henry
I'm sick of being tired, sick of the circus life
Here daydreaming of a waitress as the perfect wife
Utterly inappropriate, taken out of context
Degenerate nervousness, developing a complex
No good with money, left-overs in a bitch bag
Fryin' pan soul and a face like a dishrag
A million old movies, I figured I'd tell
Childhood memories triggered by smell

""So now what?"" you may ask
Well that's hard to say
Because that old jack of diamonds is a tough card to play

All the wrong reasons
Just another skull to crack
Askin' the dust, I'm struck in a cul-de-sac
And it may sound silly but to me the threat is very real
So that's why I sing love songs and carry steel
Women and warfare, roaches and roadkills
No easy answers, no deadlines and no frills
Catchin' your drift, receivin' the warning
Packin' my things, I leave in the morning

I drive all night, gone to see my friend
One day this highway will be my end
Now the hills are alive and the motor is dead
That man has a zero floating over his head
I follow my instincts, sometimes follow dogs
Drink muddy water, sleep inside hollow logs

Jacket and shoes, pistols and pens
Poor boy, feels like, I ain't got no friends
I wake up nervous, Sunday is gloomy
Eyes on the sidewalk look right through me

I hear myself breathing, trying to focus
Goodbye Babylon, wandering hopeless
The drifter, singing the lament of a non-tryer
The isolation makes me want to set myself on fire
I don't live anywhere

Black angel, carry me down

I pick all the flowers and extinguish the flames
The insanities, I remember all of their names
Bottom of the barrel, it's no way how to be
The cold and the silence beats the shit out of me
But the windows are wooden
And I shouldn't complain
I'll just be digging until I'm good and insane
Cobwebs and apple cores, old ghosts and vestiges
Woman at the desk says I got no messages
I don't live anywhere

Black angel, carry me down

Lost in a haze of fantasy and folklore
The woman I love don't want me no more
Inebriated, alleviated of pain and speaking wild
Full grown man reduced to a weakling child
Hard of hearing, short tempered and long viewing
Completely disappeared and cleared of all wrong-doing

Buck 65,"Fightin' with the neighbours and screwin' the wife
Hip hop music ruined my life
I bitch and I moan, I lie and I cheat
Waiting for the night when I die in my sleep
I listen to the jukebox and sit by the bar
Taking care of a dog that got hit by a car
Praying for salvation, needing a miracle
Drowning in new music and reading material
Shoe laces untied, telling people I'm rich
Who can't tell the difference between real art and high kitch
Mouth like a broken bottle, crooked and bottomless
Half wolf, half crow, half hippopotamus
Sturdy as a paper bag, as well, my face is flawed
But keeping the fire going by the grace of God
And I'm loathe to think that we missed our chance
To find a way out of this downward dance
We got it all wrong

Singing a song with a rock in my mouth
Nobody knows what I'm talking about
Lost without a marketing plan and a stylist
Here comes the vilest nihilist finalist
Once and for all, barbed wire and rope
The most beautiful woman is strung out on dope
Slowly the music, died, died, died
Three white horses side by side
Last change to change, you better hurry, quick
Laying in a bed, wide awake and I'm worried sick
Completely out-foxed, I hide from the phone
And I swear this pen has a mind of its own
Jaws that go through solid steel, a clenched fist
A breath of fresh air for once and a French kiss
The weight of the world and collapsable me
I'm talking about trouble with a capital T
We got it all wrong



",Surrender to Strangeness,2005
Buck 65,"I was raised on a dirt road ghost town.
Stray dogs, whole nine the gold mine closed down.
I knew the woods like the back of my hand,
And I would shoot the breeze with the roots of trees. 

Or go down by the river, watch the way the devil danced,
But never took his hand even though I did have several chances.
Everybody slept when the morning dew turned to frost.
Darkness moved in and somebody burned a cross.

Girl named Stella Kewen was prettier than you'd imagine.
The town should've gave her the crown for the beauty pageant.
But instead, some local pinhead started spreading rumors
About the Kewen's being inbred, and what's worse:

People believed it. The family was dirt poor,
Down on their luck, so that made it hurt more.
Picking up garbage or mowing the grass,
At this point, Stella stopped going to class.

You know how they ridicule a kid in school
And this shit's enough to make anybody feel like a misfit.
She made herself invisible and hid in a house of mirrors.
Whenever the fear stops, so do the teardrops.

Fear is forever, and lies become legend
Growing slowly exponentially.
She should've been a cover girl treated like a princess,
But she's an enigma haunted by the stigma of incest.

Chorus (x2):
She tried to hide the scars;
Her name reminds me of the stars
I saw diamonds dividing
The corners of her eyes

......Stella
......Stella

One horse town known for the most softness.
Little old school house, burned down post office.
Blueberries and bull rushes a tree with a tire(d) swing
Volunteer fireman's affair, the whole entire thing.

Stella was heartbroken, decided to start smoking.
Bad taste in her mouth, she grew into her sad face.
Her few friends were worried, her parents were proud of her.
But she never escaped from under the cloud cover.

A woman reduced, she was eaten by a monster.
And after all these years, a past that still haunts her,
That whispers her name when she's trying instead 
To listen to music in her bed.

Now, the story of Stella is one that every child knows,
But the witch in the woods is more like a wild rose.
.......Stella
.......Stella

(Chorus x2)

Buck 65,"I'm a lot like my dad I would have to say
He's been wearing a beard ever since mom passed away
She would have hated it
Inspiring he likes to go to church to hear the choir sing

Roses and Bluejays
Winner comes game over
He's in the driveway removing snow with a flame thrower
Drives a hard bargain, knows how to get the deals
Spring fever hits he needs a new set of wheels
Every year it never fails
Roaming around in his home town beachcombing
Roses and Bluejays
I'm a lot like my father
He knows he should go to work but sometimes
He doesn't bother
Reads books of every sort
And gets all the news he needs from the weather report
The door stays open a few days and closes
What's more important than blue jays and roses?
Son of a gun, the old man is something else
In addition to being a bullfighter and magician
He's a lazy river, slow moving train
Future hall of famer, playing through the pain
He's a grizzly bear
And do you know one time he even saw a UFO?
My dad's favorite things are roses and bluejays

And I set down with my fishing pole

And Jerked me out in the middle of the lake
Huh, it was some jump boy
I got sunk, kinda baptized on credit

Fishin' down on th' muddy bank
Felt a pull an' give a big yank
I drug out three old rubber boots
A Ford radiator an' a Chevrolet coop
(Nothin' but Junk so I handed it in for National Defence)

Settin' in a boat with a bucket of beer
Hadn't caught nothin' but didn't much care
I guess I was pretty well satisfied

Find you a good shady tree and then just set down
(Go to sleep, forget all about it, can't catch nothin' here anyways)

Well, I walked out to a sandy bar
And I caught myself a big alligator gar
Drug him home across my back
Tail was dragging a mile and a half
Flippin' an' floppin', I sold him for a quarter

Jumped in the river and went down deep
There was a hundred pound cat-fish lying there asleep
Well, I jumped on his back and rode him all aroun'
Saddled him up and I came into town
People came runnin', lookin', dogs a-barkin'
(Kids a-squallin')

Early one mornin' I took me a notion
To go out fishin' in the middle of the ocean
Well, throwed me a line, I got me a shark
I didn't get him home till way past dark

(But he wasn't quite tough enough)

Late last night I had me a dream
I was out fishin' in a whiskey stream
Baited my hook with apple-jack

When I cheated on sarah
I couldnt bring my self to speak
I couldnt sleep
I couldnt conentrate
I was weak
I was strangled by guilt
My heart with glass balls
stone in my throat
I acted like an asshole
Sick to my stomach
knowing I should burn in bed
mad at myself
I took it out on her instead
Pushing it down
beign nice just felt phony
afraid of the phone ringing
Not alone but feeling lonely
Digging a hole
Now that I got a taste
I couldnt get rid of it
what an idiot what a waste
Paranoid and dissapointed
Living a nightmare
my every oppurtunity to wash my hands was right there
When I cheated on Sarah
there wasn't a star  in the sky
It was covered in clouds
and I started to cry
I was cold and I deserved to be
hardened and worthless
Windows painted shut
rebel without a purpose
Clowns smoking ciggarretes
I think I thought I heard her name
killing time with my hands
waiting for the hurricane

I'm tired out, pave the way, to low on gas to save the day
Slaves and outlaws king and pharoes, no tomorrow slings and arrows I'm tired out
I'm tired out, make the bed, scream loud enough to wake the dead
Light a match, break the bread, all I can do is shake my head I'm tired out

[Verse 2]
When Sarah found out I cheated on her
everything went to peaces
hatches were dug up
my desperate words were meant for jesus
I wanted to die
the future wasn't awfly stable
photographs burned while I stared at the coffee table
The little dog laughed
shaded the cealing fan
words like broken glass this is what I really am
Eye of the storm
we passed damage back and forth
cool of her to be so kind
she said I made a fool of her
I ruled the sand castle
skeleton feeling mourn
people were dying out and babies were beign born
caught in the headlights
the rest of the day coming
I pulled in my sleeve while she begged me to say something

[Chorus]
I'm tired out, pave the way, to low on gas to save the day
Slaves and outlaws king and pharoes, no tomorrow slings and arrows I'm tired out
I'm tired out, make the bed, scream loud enough to wake the dead
Light a match, break the bread, all I can do is shake my head I'm tired out",Tired Out,2007
Buck 65,"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed. 
Devoid of conviction, conflicted, annoyed. 
Kicked at and worn down, 6 6 6. 
Beat. Looking for the next quick fix. 
Unpopular prophets with problems 
Up against angels in disguise who want to rob them; 
Who didn't want to end up crushed by god?s embrace 
In the age of the cold wind blowing and dogs in space; 
Who's faces are fading. 
They're the loneliest drunk. 
In empty rooms haunted by Thelonious Monk. 
Felonious punks and plate glass squares 
That see empty eyes that look straight past theirs. 
Street walking cheetahs with a gun in each hand 
Who are lost at sea and are desperate to reach land. 
Orpheus descending. 
Swimming in the crooked waters. 
Hello Sid Vicious, goodbye Brooklyn Dodgers

No joke. Hit the low note. 
We all go to heaven in a little row boat. 

1957 Chevy Bel Air. 
Interior velvet especially. 
Bloody probably. Stereo, 
Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley. 
Black Flame Trilogy. 
Quadruple louder bass. 
Battle sites. Little Rock. 
Satellites in outer space 
Words won?t help but a few bucks can. 
Crew cuts and black leather. 
Ku Klux Klan. 
Men wear hats. 
In fact, harems are shared. 
Opiates addicted to and parents scared. 
The underground is real. 
Delivered greens to river queens. 
Perpetual motion of free-thinkers and libertines. 
Who suffer alone all night with pains 
Hooked on drums and who fight with chains. 
It?s Faulkner and Baldwin. 
Insult and curse reality. 
Spy vs. spy and the cult of personality. 
What can the numbers 
And the words in my head mean? 
Killroy was here 
And so was Buster Crab and Ed Gein. 

No joke. 
Hit the low note. 
We all go to heaven 
In a little row boat. 

The pen keeps moving 
In attempt to sink the jingoes. 
Fight ?em with hula hoops, 
Frisbee's and pink flamingos. 
Up running all night. 
Late sleep ordered. 
?Have gun will travel?. 
Great leap forward. 
Man on the corner 
With dark glasses free and preaching. 
Appetite is monstrous. 
Diet is Dionysian. 
All over the world, 
So much peril in one show. 

Playwright Arthur Miller 
Marries Marilyn Monroe. 
Hard rain falling.
Babies sleeping in God's palms. 
Alarm clocks ringing. 
Warrior monks and bomb squads.

Clairvoyants and mediums. 
Believers in nothing. 
Speed freaks and bohemians. 
Red is the new black. 
Identity files. 
Rebels and grand dragons. 
Obscenity trials. 
Lolita and Bobby Fisher country. 
No part is red, 
Just black and white. 
Humphrey Bogart is dead.

Buck 65,"Long arm, that's me, 
Strong supporter of law and order
Along the border. 
Some of these bums should be drawn and quartered,
As far as I'm concerned. 

I'm becoming submersed
In some of the worst perverts and scum of the earth.
I've taken ink prints of a sequence of delinquents,
Adults and juveniles and haven't had a drink since
High noon. 

It's a typhoon of deep trouble underground.
I wonder how she got so lost before I gunned her down.
A true hater of bad guys, I'm a civil rights crusader,
Few greater, but there's more work to do later.
For example, tomorrow I may handle the day's scandal
With sunglasses and a hat on and a suit made of gray flannel.
Raid the headquarters of the guy that supplies the trash.
Confiscated some of the contraband for my private stash.
Survived a crash, stab wounds and gunfire,
Some liar with one prior. 
King of rock, there's none higher.
One, two, three and four. 
Fought in the Korean war.

Marine corps. 
Sea and shore. 
Danger, I'll be seein' more.
Drug busts and young lusts. 
In my line of work
One must fight day and night against the unjust.
Obscenity. Amphetamines.
Everybody has positions on
Bad conditions created by beat poets and jazz musicians,
Hoodlums and perverts, the worthless variety.

Taking a free minute.
Mistakes it's OK to be making if he did it.

Corruption, had to sentence bad lieutenants,
Denied crimes.

She did would change my life

She'd be unhappy without me I know

Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true.

That's why I seem to have more than my share,

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,

End it all and let her go to some better man;

Send me off forever but I ask you please

On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

Gaze at the moon till I lose my senses
I can't look at hobbles and I can't stand fences
Don't fence me in

Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle
Underneath the western skies
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder
Till I see the mountains rise

I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
Gaze at the moon until I lose my senses
I can't stand them hobbles and I don't care for fences
Don't fence me in
Don't fence me in
Don't fence me in

A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub, thinkin' everything was all right
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me and I opened the door
And then a splish splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
 
Bing bang, I saw the whole gang dancin' on my livin' room rug (yeah)
Flip flop, they were doin' the bop, all the teens had the dancin' bug
There was Lollipop with Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was a even there too
A well a splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on
 
I was a splishin' and a splashin', I was rollin' and a strollin'

I didn't mean it
When I said I didn't love you, so
I should have held on tight
I never shoulda let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I could not fathom that I would ever
Be without your love
Never imagined I'd be
Sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you
'Cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right here, cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby, please

Who's gonna talk to me on the phone

And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
It ain't even half of what
I'm feeling inside
I need you
Need you back in my life, baby

Some place where we can live a life of our own

When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind
For the answer could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you I'd come running back to you

And to pay the rent I must leave you all alone

To an old memory

I couldn't find anywhere else
Hey, I'm not trying to be nobody
I just want a chance to be myself

I've spent a thousand miles of thumbin'
Yes I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
Here on the streets of Bakersfield

Hey you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Have ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

Spent sometime in San Francisco
I spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man

Left him my watch and my old house key
Don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as I was leaving
And I headed out for Bakersfield

Hey you don't know me, but you don't like me
You say you care less how I feel
But how many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

When the storms of life are blowing and no sunshine can be seen
When there's nothing left but darkness your rock hard love lays next to me

Stood beside me then to guide me rock hard love everyday

Kissed those southern belles that stroll the avenue
Laid on the bench in Waikiki and watched the ocean roll
But none of this could hold a light to you

And you will be the leader of a big old band

Buck Owens,"I came here in looking for somethin'
I couldn't find anywhere else
Well, I don't want to be nobody, 
Just want a chance to be myself.

I've done a thousand miles of thumbin',
Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
On the streets of Bakersfield.

You don't know me but you don't like me,
You say you care less how I feel
How many of you that sit and judge me
Ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?

Spent some time in San Francisco,
Spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell,
I took fifteen dollars from that man.

I left him my watch and my old house keys,
I don't like folks thinking that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as he was sleeping,
And I headed out for Bakersfield.

Buck Owens,"I met her out in Oklahoma down where the old Red River flows
I vowed my love to her forever she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
We walked alone down by the river just as the sun was sinking low
And in her eyes I saw big trouble like the muddy waters down below
Her lips were soft and sweet as honey her hair was bright as yellow as gold
Her cheeks were red as summer roses she was my sweet sweet Rosie Jones
And then one day a tall dark stranger with hair as black as winter coal
Rode into town as night was falling and there he met my Rosie Jones
I woke next morning just after sunup to find a note from my Rosie's hand
And it read I'd rather die than ever hurt you but I'm in love with that tall dark man
So now I walk alone down by the river where my sweet Rosie used to stroll
And soon I'm gonna join those deep dark waters for I can't live without Rosie Jones
Her lips were soft...",Sweet Rosie Jones,1992
Buck Owens,"(Chorus)
Beware of a tall dark stranger
If he comes ridin' into your town
A tall dark stranger is danger (danger)
So don't let no stranger hang around
For he can capture the heart of a woman
With one glance from his flashing brown eyes
Like a bolt from the blue he can steal her from you
Then jump up on his pony and ride ride ride
(Repeat Chorus)
They say a tall dark stranger is a demon
And that a devil rides closely by his side
With no warning he can strike like the thief in the night
Then jump up on his pony and ride ride ride

And I'll close my eyes and pretend

My wife run off with my TV set,
Didn't bother me none that she had to go,
'Cept I's gonna miss all my TV shows. 

So I looked up to heaven, got down on my knees.
An' I cried, ""Dear Lord, will you help me, please.""
""I need a TV by tomorrow night,
""Cause Rick Flair's involved in a title fight.""

Well I guess my tytheing finally paid off,
Cause early next mornin' shoulda seen what I saw.
Reached in my overhorse for my inhaler,
Cause there's a big brown box there, right in my trailer.

I used my truck keys, cut open the box,
I was hopin' for a Sony or a Magnavox.
I looked at the name and thought, ""Oh my gosh!
""This must be a new one called Macintosh.""

Well my last TV was a whole lot wider,
But this'n here come with its own typewriter.
It had all the letters from A to Z,
I guess you just type in what you wanna see.

Well I thought I punched up, ""You done help,""
But the TV Screen said World Wide Web.
Then I broke out in a cold, cold sweat,
I's the first redneck on the internet.

He was the first red neck on the internet,
A bona fide, countrified, cyber-threat.
He went on line just one time,
And now they won't forget,
The first redneck on the internet.

It was all so new, I shoulda taken my time,
But I slammed that mouse up in four-wheel drive.
Last time I did so much pointin' and clickin'
I had a .22 rifle shootin' at chickens.

Then, all of a sudden it occurred to me,
The power I had with this fancy TV.
I could get back at my ex-wife,
With the touch of a button, I could ruin her life.

So I got the number off her Mastercard,
I bought a new lift kit and four new tires.
Then, I got on line to her bank account,
Went ahead and closed that sucker out.

I had her power and her water shut, slap, off.
The I sent an e-mail to her dead plain boss,
Lettin' him know that she told me,
She'd have his job by the end of the week.

He was the first red neck on the internet,
A bona fide, countrified, cyber-threat.
He went on line just one time,
And now they'll never forget, (Won't forget.)
The first redneck on the internet.

Now the moral of the story, as a matter of fact,
In a couple of days I got my TV back.
She said she'd like to come back, as well.
I told her to go straight to AOL.

Now, thank the Lord that the UPS,
For droppin' that box at Cledus' address.
If they ever wanna find him, it won't take long,
Type www.cledus.com

To reach the first red neck on the internet,
A bona fide, countrified, cyber-threat.
He went on line just one time,
And now they'll never forget, (Won't forget.)

She's dancing where the music's loud and lights're low

So close up the honky tonks lock all the doors
Don't let the one I love go there anymore
Close up the honky tonks throw away the key
Then maybe the one I love will come back to me

I took fifteen dollars from that man

To the land of the aftermath
But don't frolic in the midst, crazy ass Crooklyn kids
'Cause they always throwin a body on my lawn
I'm gettin' a Rott-weiler, without a collar
Get off my block boy and give me a dollar
For the trouble, or get blown up, like a bubble

Let's take a sec to think back, the year of the seven-oh
When Brooklyn was the place to go
Flow, on a journey up to Crown Heights
Ebbets Field, feel the reel to reel on your life
Trife, individuals live in the PJ's
Dee Evil, check my DJ
Hey, play what I want to play in the day
But in the night, I feel the right took a left
Bucktown, Brooklyn break it down
Heads from state to state, travel as I unravel the rate
How it, tapped Scott and Sutter
I remember way back in the days playin' hot peas and butter
Brother, if you want another lesson, Crooklyn, session
Take it back, Black Smif-N-Wessun

Press your luck, you get stuck by Buck
For your bucks, Masta Ace, has the taste
For ducks, and duck sauce, so tell Lord Digga
Dig a grave for the bones, sticks and stones
While I kick some ancient poems, through your domes
'Act went back, to attack your homes
So Tip, can I flip? (Yes you can)
I'm in the World War, with Muhammad my man

Feels so good to be a Crooklyn Dodger
Uh-huh, what's happenin, to ReRun and Roger?
I think I seen 'em wearin' Timberlands and runnin' down the block
From D'Wayne and D'Wayne had a glock
'Cause he be sellin' rock for the Partridge Family
And Ruben Kincaid drives a 300-E
And he be pimpin' Chrissy from Three's Company
Plus he stuck Mr. T for all his jewelry
This is a 70's thing from the days
When kids didn't act so crazed, in Crooklyn

Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn
Never takin' shorts, 'cause Brooklyn's the borough

Never takin' shorts, 'cause Brooklyn's the borough

Robinson waits, here comes the pitch
And there goes a line drive to left field

Buck Trent,"There's a garden, what a garden
Only happy faces bloom there
And there's never any room there
For a worry or a gloom there

Oh there's music and there's dancing
And a lot of sweet romancing
When they play the polka
They all get in the swing

Every time they hear that oom-pa-pa
Everybody feels so tra-la-la
They want to throw their cares away
They all go lah-de-ah-de-ay

Then they hear a rumble on the floor, the floor
It's the big surprise they're waiting for
And all the couples form a ring
For miles around you'll hear them sing...

Roll out the barrel, we'll have a barrel of fun
Roll out the barrel, we've got the blues on the run
Sing boom tararra, ring out a song of good cheer
Now's the time to roll the barrel, for the gang's all here

With the sun in my heart

When you taught me how to say

And that happy tune is your step

Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone

And Rose, my Rose of San Antone

But the cold, the dark and hunger couldn't take away their joy

Buck Wild,"Intro: 
Mmm mmm yeah East coast no doubt 
Hip hop is somethin you live rap is somethin you do 

Verse One: 
Sorta distorted yo that's a fact 
Bad news gave a nigga in the mind contact 
I react on blues then use it within 
Blend conscious thoughts to make man mortal men 
see right ways to shell out this thing hip hop 
I pledge O.C. will only season the crops 
And never stop side drops or shot, I'm fiendin 
Covering more ground than news on CNN 
Being in the state of vast consumption in this game 
it's like drugs only quantity is run throughout 
Quality is walking through the valley of the reaper 
True deceivers are coming through your receivers 
Solid foundation to me is the true meaning of hardcore 
We need a little bit more... 

Chorus: 4X (layered on samples) 
Love and affection 
""What I represent is MC's gone mad"" --> Q-Tip 

Verse Two: 
I'm living in the time where life be a buck 
more worth than a child this rap shit suck 
Very few or should I say a handful of MC's 
Talk live, calling themselves kickin life, indeed 
I listen and take a look around only seein who's 
all about frontin and who's profilin 
While my glock I had, guess what I forsaw 
True for now I'm not surprised we didn't rise not at all 
Too many clicks for dolo, weak hitting solos 
My scrolls, they always paint visual photos 
O.C. worth more than a million 
Building nuff respect on the circuit of rap like Sicilians 
You might see the be	-boy when I walk New York 
Crew of brothers recognized so I stopped to talk 
Even the girls be hawkin sassi-fraskin askin 
What's going on and am I still rapping 
Things will change with hope galore 
But when it comes to rap, we need a little bit more... 

Chorus 
Verse Three: 
Big you hold your head and God bless your wife 
Got your little baby girl so I know she's alright 
I strike the mic anytime smashing yours 
Word are wise with wisdom with the width of a wall 
and way describe I prescribe antidotes 
Curing, reassuring my lyrical notes 
Make an impact a fact on the backs of men 
Magnified to the fullest magnificent 
Brilliant, my composition is efficiently prone 
to set fire to a waste and char your ass to the bone 
Figure, I trigger, bigger, bold bad men 
Come against O you'll be walking away a sad man 
Miles of red tape had me stunted for growth 
but when I took off on wax I maxed the globe 
Didn't happen so far, respect be just building 
Watch for the devils in the forms of chameleons 
Kick the raw slow down on the score 
Think before you write or find yourself falling 
Final calling, you're spreading infection 
When it comes to rap, we need a little bit more...

It was a cool and lovely breezy afternoon 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel it cause it was the month of June 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
So I left my gate and went out for a walk 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
As I pass the dreadlocks camp I heard them say 
How does it feel when you've got no food?

So I stopped to find out what was going on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
'Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on
How does it feel when you've got no food?
There was a ring of dreads and a session was there in swing 
How does it feel when you've got no food?
You could feel the chill as I seen and heard them say 
How does it feel when you've got no food?

'Cause me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass 
Give me little music make me wind up me waist 
Me say listen to the drummer, me say listen to the bass 
Give me little music make me wind up me waist, I say 

Pass the Dutchie on the left hand side 
Pass the Dutchie on the left hand side 
It a gonna burn, give me music make me jump and prance 
It a go done, give me the music make me rock in the dance",Pass the Dutchie,1998
Buck-O-Nine,"Where is time 'cause I'm feeling much older
Well, I'm alive and living with your cold shoulder
You say those days are over
Well, I say they've just begun, I say they've just begun

It's been awhile and I got carried away
You're bored and you've had your fun
Don't say those days are over
'Cause mine have just begun, mine have just begun

I've seen my little brother
Freaking out and seeing colors
Feeling green with jealousy
Seeing red and Olivelawn

All along, all along
All along, all along

Is it me or is your mind getting hollow?
In need of leading and you need to be my follow
How we were that summer
Instead you seem much older, now
Instead you treat me colder, now

Where's my friend, I think he's running away
From all those things we've done
Wanna get you back up here
'Cause you're already gone, you're already gone

Heard about the others
They're at home and being lifeless
Forgot to read a magazine
I guess my constitution's strong

All along, all along

I could be most anything if I could be the one
I could be most anything if I could be the one

All along, all along
Hey

I could be most anything if I could be the one
I could be most anything if I could be the one
I could be most anything if I could be the one
I could be most anything if I could be the one

All along, all along
All along, all along

Buck-O-Nine,"

junior's got the groove
He don't need to go to school
His musical insperation
Comes from his soul
And all the other kids envy
His ability to play
If you can catch him live
Then this will make your day
This boy has got ambitions
That are so unreal
His music is so unique
It would be hard to steal
He's got a vivd future
And a shiny path ahead
He plays with force and power
And it doesn't seem to go to his head
He's got the look
He's got the hair
He's got everting that sells
He stays in line and plays on time
He musically excels
There ain't nothing for sure
In this like we endure
But for junior that might not be true
Cause when it comes to music
There ain't nothing he can't do






",Junior,2002
Buck-O-Nine,"

I want to rise from my seat
Don't want to be held down
I want to get off the couch
I want to find a new sound
I want to step outside
I want to say I'm alive
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Courtesy of a condition
My condition, my condition
Is something that you can't see
I'm just looking for a better way
I'm on this mission because of my condition
And its the only thing I can see
Don't want to try hard to be something
Just want to let it come naturally
I can only see one thing and that's
A bright future for me
Cause you're my friends I hope you'll
Never think again about my intentions on this stage
Its not just what I say but its what I believe
And now the only thing I now is get up & go
And find my destiny
I'm on a mission, I'm on a mission
Courtesy of a condition
I've got a vision, I've got a vision
Of all the things we can do together

Buckcherry,"Buried way beneath the sheets
I think she's having a meltdown
Finding it hard to fall asleep
She won't let anyone help her

The look on her face, a waste of time
She won't let go, gonna roll the dice
Losing her grace, starts to cry
I feel the pain when I look in her eyes
I wanna be, I want everything
I want everything

Somewhere she is on the streets
Tryin' to make things better
Praying to God and breathing deep
Gotta break this long obsession

The look on her face, a waste of time
She won't let go, gonna roll the dice
Losing her grace, starts to cry
I feel the pain when I look in her eyes
I wanna be, I want everything
I want everything

If I had everything
Would I still want to be alive?
I wanna be high

Now and then she talks to me
And sometimes writes me letters
The look on her face, a waste of time
She won't let go, gonna roll the dice
Losing her grace, starts to cry
I feel her pain when I look in her eyes

I wanna be, I want everything
I want everything
You know I wanna be, yeah, I want everything
I wanted everything, everything

Faded jeans and politics and shooters in the sky

You always fill me up (It's scary out there)

You always bring me love

A drop of anti-matter and I'll blow up all mankind

Live in fear of God is real there's nothing left to hide

I'm trying to find out who I am with no illusions and my color-coated canvas is all red
I want to know just how it ends I want to know because
I never want to wind up here again

Mother Mary I am dying, it fucking hurts and I don't want to wind up dead
My heart bleeds I can't stop crying I'm out of words, locked up in the prison in my head
I got this problem in my head with no solution and my troubled mind wants me dead

Buckcherry,"Started out with nothing but a beat up car and a new beginning 
But inside everything seemed out of reach
Saw you there and you filled my eyes sent shivers up and down my spine 
I knew right then that you were meant for me

I drive all night thought about those days when the life I loved started slipping away stayed on track and I don't look back it took so long just to get it started

Give me what I want it's all about love and not about money
I don't want to stop I'll never give up it's sweeter than honey
I can't be here by myself 'cause to me there's no one else
You're as pretty as a rose I can't live without you

I got so many good time memories
Left a lot friends behind and still I kept this dream alive

We faced the challenge of our lives
And it can't be bittersweet without the fight

But I am yours and you are mine
Baby, we got all this time
All this time

This is all I do, I keep holding on
And I see what's in the way
I can't erase all my mistakes

And our love is so bizarre
Am I standing in the way?
Or do you wish that I would change?

You got everything but you're brokenhearted

Remember how we used to like the same things?
Van Doren shoes and faded blue jeans
Sneaking out of the house for a late-night movie
Smoke cigarettes, sit around and daydream
Turning up the stereo without a care in this whole world
Always laughing, never crying
It must be bad 'cause you're always hiding

Many times I passed there but I never stopped
I go on all alone a wishin' 
I could be in that house down the block

When we meet upon the street 
I just bow my head
They don't know how often 
I wish that I was dead
To our name I brought the shame 
But still I long to be
In that house down the block with my family

When Gabriel blows his trumpet 
And time will be no more

And God will let me be
In that house down the block with my family",The House Down the Block,2016

We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear
Some place where we can live a life of our own
Oh I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone

They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart
But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all with my heart
