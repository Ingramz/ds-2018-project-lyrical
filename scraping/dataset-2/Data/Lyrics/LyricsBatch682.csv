Away Team,"Where do I begin?
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love he brings to me
Where do I start?

Where do I begin?
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love he brings to me
Where do I start?

Like a summer rain
That cools the pavement with a patent leather shine
He came into my life and made the living fine
And gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
He fills my heart

He fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
He fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
With him along, who could be lonely?
I reach for his hand, it's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I'm going to need him 'til the stars all burn away
And he'll be there

He fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
He fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
With him along, who could be lonely?
I reach for his hand, it's always there

How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now but this much I can say

Awesome,"How do rumours get started? 
Started by the jealous people 
They get mad 
See something they had 
And somebody else is holding 
They tell me that temptation 
Is very hard to resist 
But these wicked woman 
Oh, they just persist 
Maybe you think it's cute 
But girl I'm not impressed 
I tell you what I'm only 
With my business please don't mess 

When you look at all these rumours 
Surrounding me every day 
I just need some time 
Some time to get away from 
From all these rumours 
I can't take it no more 
My best friend said 
That's why I'll never 
Be with the girl next door 

Did you hear the one about Tina? 
Some say she's much to loose 
That came straight from a guy 
Who claims he has the proof 
Did you hear that one about Michael? 
Some say he must be gay 
I tried to ague but they said 
If he was straight, he wouldn't move that way 
Did you hear the one about Susan? 
Some say she's just a tease 
In a camisole 
She's six feet tall 
She'll knock you to your knees (when you)... 

When you look at all these rumours 
Surrounding me everyday 
I just need some time 
Some time to get away from 
From all these rumours 
I can't take it no more 
My best friend said 
That's why I'll never 
Be with the girl next door 

I can't go no place 
With somebody pointing a finger 
Can't show my face 
‘Cause when it comes to rumours 
I'm a dead ringer 
It seems some rumours 
I just can't get away 
I bet there will be rumours 
Floating around on judgement day 
I think I'll write my congressman 
And tell him to pass a bill 
For the next time they catch somebody 
Spreading rumours shoot to kill 

When you look at all these rumours 
Surrounding me every day 
I just need some time 
Some time to get away from 
From all these rumours 
I can't take it no more 
My best friend said 
That's why I'll never 
Be with the girl next door 

Stop stop spreading those rumours around 
Stop stop spreading those lies 
What's mine is mine 
I ain't got time 
For rumours in my life 
I'm a man who thinks 
Not a man who drinks 
So please let me live my life 

When you look at all these rumours 
Surrounding me every day 
I just need some time 
Some time to get away from 
From all these rumours 
I can't take it no more

Lil Fame's a trigga nigga.
Billy Danze a trigga nigga.
Aight? Keepin' it real.
Brownsville, still nigga.

Bell ringer, gun slinger, survivor.
Raise your right and I'll blaze the living proof;
The godfather to truth, clak, clak, salute.

Since we came here we got to show and prove
The M.O.P. is rugged, never smooth.
We tearin' this shit down, just like construction.
Flip like kilos, with this Primo production.

No doubt, hit 'em wit' that hilltop flavor.
Hardcore niggas on your doorstep neighbor.
And this year, here, niggas can't compare.
Spectators, haters, 'cause we're fuckin with Premier.

Fillin' 'em up wit' raps, in fact they can't get wit'
A code red; the dope shit, got you niggas addicted.
Mr. Danzenie and the Fame stayin' true to this game.
Since you nice was that hip hop gangsta.
M.O.P. guaranteed to keep bringin' this dopeness
For the real thugs and ghetto niggas slingin' toasters.
On all coastses, north to south, east to west;
Got high clientele for shit you least expect.

M.O.P. from the hill kid, what you tryin' to tell me?
Still grippin mo' steel, a machine gun deli.
I mention, and flinching, and waitin' for you to duck the gate,
And sellin' shit that I won't tolerate.
WSUP?! My whole team's in the house.
The gat is 1-5-4-5, not four 5's in your fucking mouth.
Same ones, burner on blaze.

Membawa erti untuk selamanya

Engkau bagaikan oh permataku
Engkau pun jua ratuku

Engkaulah segalanya
Engkau hanyalah untuk diriku
Aku hanya untukmu
Itulah janjiku padamu

Tidakkan terpisah lagi
Walaupun pasangnya
Walaupun surutnya laut

Ratapan naluri
Memanggilkan namamu
Kerana pertemuan ini
Akanku abadikan
Segala memori
Kulewati waktu itu

Meredahi masa meniti usia

Marilah oh sayangku
Dekat padaku
Sayangilah diriku ini

AWOL One,"Heaven must be missing an angel
Or the devil counted one demon short
Knock knock who's there. Nobody, go to hell
People go away. Don't bother me today
The statue of liberty's mouth is three feet wide
The earth will open up and swallow everyone inside
But my band will break up just to have a reunion tour
But only if the crowd wants more
I get drunk and make beautiful things fight each other
I get drunk I make pretty things get ugly
I make dead things come alive and die twice
So precise
Everyone's worried about saying something they'll regret
But let me out of this ugly shell and represent
I've grown out of my physical presence
I never let people know my real emotions
Now are you part of a musical revolution?
I can drink my way out of an ocean

Liquid love, baby, never cheat on me
Let me watch you dance
Liquid love, baby, looks like a bottle
Let me watch you dance your way to my liver

Liquid love, baby, never cheat on me
Let me watch you dance
Liquid love, baby, looks like a bottle
Let me watch you dance your way to my liver

Don't be afraid to admit your down falls
We all got 'em and I think that I've got 'em all
It was my homie that I used to hit trees with back in the day
Lets get some beer that's all that we say
I have more dirt on you than you have on me
Give me a shot and put it on my tab
A picture is worth a thousand words mad
A thousand words is only worth a memory
Don't do stupid stuff just to get attention
Like the other suckers with fake addictions
Don't be the leader of my fan club
at the Walrus One convention
Appreciate 2 o'clock and all of its lessons
She wants to meet a man and squeeze out his kids
But downing Colt 45's that's all he ever did
You will never amount to nothing

AWOL One,"Watch me cut my tongue out of my mouth, because I love you
No more stupid words can leak out
I walk around my house in my bear feet and dead silence
and listen to the stairs squeak
Bumping around, the lights off, in the dark
In may silverware drawer where I'm feeling knives and forks
I get the sharpest utensil I can find
or maybe just a pencil to grind
Lead poisoning in my mouth
But any thing I can find is to cut my tongue out
So I could stop all the stupid things I say
and music will probably change my wicked ways
Smile with my blood stained teeth
Just talk with my hands when it's time to scream
A butter knife, started sawing at my gums
Chewing on some stainless steel
till my mouth gets num
and then, and then...
I take a jab at my tonsils, the center consol
Now I'm spitting out chipped teeth no relief
Will this chill me, to stop those lives I mislead
I let the world watch my mouth bleed
Now I cut my tongue, it's only hanging by a little piece of meat
but I try not to wake my family when there asleep
I get some rusty scissors and now I'm trying to cut this thing out
It's like the bad it's always curios about the good
and there's no doubt that the cured it's always curious about the bad
still trying to cut my tongue out
with every cut I try not to wake my daughter up
I'll end up a babbling idiot with my lips sown up
Haven't found a way to kill me yet
or take this animal away to the vet
they come from far to spit on me
and all this time the good stays curious but the bad stays furious
cut my tongue out. but by this time I'm dizzy and nauseous
Slitting with a knife as obviously cautious
kitchen tile now it's all full of spit and blood
see, but I try not to slip
away I creep back the stairs and go to sleep
I wash the blood of my face and lay my head on my pillow case
I've succeeded
Watch me cut my tongue out of my mouth because I love you
so no more stupid words leak out, no one above you
I will never amount to nothing if I can speak
It's tongue and cheek, it's tongue and cheek",Solitude,2001

Cuando dentro nuestro
Sopla un huracán
No hace falta que me reces mil rosarios

No podía mirarte why tratar de pensar
Un segundo en el mundo
Mi querida princesa
Pasa el tiempo why sigo enamorándome
Cada día un poco más
Es que no te das cuenta
Que me das ganas de seguir adelante
Lado a lado
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo

Eternamente brillando
Mucho más que el centro del sol
Sabes siempre que hay loco enamorado
Cuidando tus pasos, tus pasos
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí
Sos mi sol, sos mi estrella
Mis días, mis sueños
Mis noches why mucho más
Nada es malo mientras nos sigamos amando
Porque sin ti hare frío
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a dejar
Que te pase de todo aquí conmigo
Nunca voy a dejar que te pase nada
Pero sí voy a intentar
Que pases tu vida aquí conmigo.

Axel,"Hay miradas que sin dudas
Dicen más que mil palabras
Y que al verlas todas juntas
Son como espejos del alma
Hay miradas que cuando miran
Son hirientes y lastiman
En cambio hay otras tan serenas
Que consuelan y acarician

Hay miradas insistentes, misteriosas, recurrentes
Y las hay indiferentes, como las de tanta gente
Hay miradas que ocultan verdades
Que mucho danan
Y las hay que en la diaria lucha
Fortalecen y acompanan
Hay miradas que perdidas entre miles de miradas
Andan solas por la vida

En busca de otras miradas
Y hay miradas que cautivan
Por lo bellas y profundas
Como tu mirada azul
Que me atrapa día a día
Hay miradas que por tristes
Enlutan a quien las viste
Y hay esas miradas dulces

Que ennobleces a quien las luce
Hay miradas que derriten
Hasta el corazón más duro
E iluminan suavemente
El pensamiento más oscuro

Más cerca está el cielo.

Y sabe que nada yo hago sin ella
Pero el 13 no quiere ni verme
Y yo que la extraño no puedo entenderla

Porque ella me mira tan dulce
Que a mi me enamoran todas sus rarezas
Y al mirarme se pone tan mía
Con esas costumbres, con esas creencias

Que yo acabo creyendo que es cierto
Y corro por todo lo que desea
Y aunque siempre ella toque madera
Se que voy a amarla por la vida entera

Ella usa al revés su camisa
Como un amuleto de la suerte buena
Ella apuesta al siete de pleno
Aunque en la ruleta le salga una letra

Ella cruza la calle aterrada
Porque un gato negro la mira de cerca
Ella pide en silencio un deseo
Cuando desde el cielo se cae una estrella

Y pide que nunca yo viva sin ella

Axel,"Desde mi ventana solo veo el mundo ajeno
Donde no me pertenecen las caras ni los gestos
Ni la música triste del campanillero
Que me vende los claveles rojo fuego

No se si es el verano no se si fue el invierno
O es el frio de tu ausencia que me recorre por dentro
Y te veo en esa foto que es mi cielo en el infierno
Por tus ojos que se clavan en mis ojos
Como si fueran espejos

Y es que otra vez estoy pensando en ti, en ti
Otra vez estoy pensando en ti, en ti

Y si tal vez mañana cambie el rumbo de este viento
Y se lleve al fin las nubes que oscurecen hoy mi cielo
Yo caería por tu espalda como el sol que va muriendo
Y entre tus piernas sigue ardiendo

Y cambio mi vida entera el haberte conocido 
Y que si valió la pena, haber esperado tanto

Tampoco yo te ofrezco un castillo de ilusión

Paz y movimiento

Ven a mi rincón
No le tengas miedo
Y aunque mi pasión
Tenga su revuelo

Porque un ser distinto
Visita su suelo
Te he de demostrar
Que yo a tí, te quiero

Tu ombligo embriagante

Seré inaccesible

Axel Mackenrott,"Recruiting the ill-fated for ""The War""
A legion of uneducated, bankrupt souls
With a lust for revenge, answering the call
From New Yorqatar to Califarabia

Desperation provides fertile ground for religious extremism
This glorious brainwashing where prejudice lies
Like a crouching tiger
Tormenting peasants till they erect an army
Under everyone's nose
In the end propaganda destroys their DNA
God help them

All that they envisioned of what things would come to be
Turned into a pink mist when they blew to smithereens
We are just a war away from Amerikhastan
When God versus God; the undoing of man

Promising a vapor,in the end they become one

No rules of engagement,this enemy hides
Amongst women and children

And to beat violence,you must ignore the focus groups
You must send in the Mossad, turn of the BBC, CNN
And don't look back
Rest assured there'll be no more Middle Eastern crisis, hell!
There'll be no more Middle East!
These are your people Lady Liberty
Pull up your dress today
And tattooed is ""Property of the USA
A subsidiary of Halliburton""
Surprise?
But a roaring lion is about to be unleashed on earth
Hey, Jihad Joe?
Guess what?

There's no blisters on his fingers

Is there life beyond the light
In the valley of the souls we'd lost long ago
Is there life beyond the light
Only in our dreams or in reality

When they were young, silly things in their heads
Enjoying life to the limit
The tide has turned with endless days of pain
But the wish remained to survive

From the distance I hear you callin',
'Cause you're on the run.
You're one out of millions and
There's no place that you call home,

Nobody cared where you're comin'
From.
Where are you runnin' to, escape
From yesterday
Is this the price you have to pay.

Hidin' in the cave

Take you to the grave

Angels,
Terrorize you with no soul.

Shots in the night leaves your blood

Remorseless desires,
They don't care if you see
Tomorrow,
If you live or you die.
You can't hide if you're chosen the
Victim,
You won't be sacrificed
Can't escape from the screams and
The anger,
You can tell by the look in their
Eyes.
Shoot your mouth again,
Can't get away from it, it's the talk
Of the guns.
Get me outta here,
'Cause you can't turn your back
From the talk of the guns.
Lost in the race, you're caught in
The war zone,
Standing in the line of fire,
One foot in the grave, the other is
Runnin'.

Higher"".

Imprisoned in chains (and) don't know what it means
Locked up in a cage of broken dreams

(And) they carry on",Under the Gun,2004
Axel Rudi Pell,"VERSE:
The world's falling down
On our way to the promised land
Have we ever been
To this twilight zone before
We touched the rainbow
We cross the castle of the Kings and Queens
Believing what we see
In the night where even eagles aren't free

PRE-CHORUS:
Mysterious journey
On our way through the gates
Black moon on the horizon
Sailing on through the oceans of time
Will we ever arrive?

CHORUS:
Mystica
We travel trough shadows
Try to hide in the night
Mystica
Surrouned by darkness
We fell into (the) light

VERSE 2:
As the edge of the world's passing by
We saw an angel
Crossing the line on the way down to earth
We cross the hellfire
Magical truth from down below
Paralyzed knights
On the run still not sure which way to go



",Mystica,2006
Axel Rudi Pell,"The show is over
Still hear the ringing in your ears
Another day on the road and no time for fears
The lights turned off
The stage is cleared and empty
The enery level you had turned down completely

PRE-CHORUS:
Hots nights of thunder
All fists up in the air

CHORUS:
We are the wild creation
And we will rock this town
We gonna rock the nation
So shout it out loud

A thousand miles away from home
You're locked inside the circus
Stragefright you try to stay cool and not getting nervous
The countdown starts, a few second to go, all hell breaks loose
And you're giving all that you can and sometimes even more

PRE CHORUS:
Hots nights of thunder
All fists up in the air

CHORUS:
We are the wild creation
And we will rock this town
We gonna rock the nation
And there is no doubt

we are no strange sensation
But wanna teach you loud
We gonna rock the nation
And there is no doubt

be-PART
This is your life and it means all to you
This is your life for breaking the rules



",Rock the Nation,2006
Axel Rudi Pell,"1. Verse (mellow)

Life is unreal, in the darkest dreams
We felt it all, al long time ago
Can't find our way through silent screams
Searching for the way to go
Too blind to realize
Our way will lead through fire 'n ice
Dreamings of paradise, prophecies of scary nights

2.Verse (hard)

Higher and higher, through the mist and snow
Through the fog, a long time to go
Out in the cold, but still feel the fire
Hearing echoes of darkest desire

Pre-chorus

On and on
We travel through the danger zone
On and on
You're out on your own

Chorus

In the valley of sin (sin, sin, sin)
Bad nights to remember
Sin (sin, sin, sin)
They don't let you go
Valley of sin (sin, sin, sin)
Bad nights to remember
Sin (sin, sin, sin)
Hear the siren's call

3. Verse (mellow)

Masked fools are screaming, death is dancing in the dark
Life without a soul is like a flame without a spark

4. Verse (hard)

The faces of doom told us all wrong
Whispering tales from the shadow zone
Up down the hill, in this fullmoon night
Warriors are waiting for the final fight



",Valley of Sin,2006
Axel Rudi Pell,"The heart is a bloom
Shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room
No space to rent in this town

You're out of luck
And the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck
And you're not moving anywhere

You thought that you'd found a friend
To take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand
In return for grace

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

You're on the road
But you've got no destination
You're in the mud
In the maze of imagination

You love this town
Even if this doesn't ring true
You've been all over
And it's been all over you

It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Oh, touch me
Take me to the other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a helpless case

See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
And see the tuna fleets clearing the sea out

See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out, yeah

It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away

Oh, touch me
Take me to the other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case

What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Need it now

But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me

I stay at home and ask myself, where is she?

Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly little memories, my little memories
Remind her of our crazy schemes

I've grown accustomed to her face.
She almost makes the day begin.
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon.
Her smiles, her frowns,
Her ups, her downs
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I was serenely independent
And content before we met.
Surely I could always be that way again - and yet,
I've grown accustomed to her look,
Accustomed to her voice,
Accustomed to her face.

Marry Freddy. What an infantile idea. What a heartless,
wicked, brainless thing to do. But she'll regret it. It's
doomed before they even take the vow.

I can see her now, Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill,
In a wretched little flat above a store.
I can see her now, not a penny in the till,
And a bill collector beating at the door.
She'll try to teach the things I taught her,
And end up selling flowers instead.
Begging for her bread and water,
While her husband has his breakfast in bed.

In a year or so, when she's prematurely grey,
And the blossom in her cheek has turned to chalk,
She'll come home and lo,
He'll have upped and run away,
With a social-climbing heiress from New York.
Poor Eliza. How simply frightful!
How humiliating! How delightful!

How poignant it'll be on that inevitable night
When she hammers on my door in tears and rags.
Miserable and lonely, repentant and contrite,
Will I take her in or hurl her to the walls?
Give her kindness or the treatment she deserves?
Will I take her back or throw the baggage out?

But, I'm a most forgiving man,
The sort who never could, never would,
Take a position and staunchly never budge.
A most forgiving man.

But I shall never take take her back
If she were even crawling on her knees.
Let her promise to atone,
Let her shiver, let her moan,
I'll slam the door and let the hell-cat freeze!

Marry Freddy, ha!

But I'm so used to hear her day,
""Good morning"" ev'ry day.
Her joys, her woes,
Her highs, her lows,
Are second nature to me now,
Like breathing out and breathing in.

I'm very grateful she's a woman,
And so easy to forget, rather like a habit
One can always break - and yet,

Of something in the air,

And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean

It steals cross my pillow
As soft as a will-o' the-wisp

How softly they're sighing
'cause summer is dying
they know that in my heart there's no gladness because
There's no you

The garden we talked in
How lonesome they seem in the fall
stormy clouds hover and falling leaves cover
Our favorite nook in the wall

We'll kiss and recapture
That summertime rapture we knew
And from that day never more will I say

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;

So don't let them begin the beguine 
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember 
When they begin the beguine.

Axel Stordahl & His Orchestra,"There's no business like show business like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing, everything that traffic will allow
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling when you are stealing that extra bow

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Even with a turkey that you know will fold, you may be stranded out in the cold
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold, let's go on with the show

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk
Are secretly unhappy men because
The butcher, the faker, the grocer, the clerk
Get paid for what they do but no applause
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye for anything theatrical and why?

There's no business like show business and I tell you it's so
Traveling through the country is so thrilling, standing out in front on opening nights
Smiling as you watch the theater filling, and there's your billing out there in lights

There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low
Angels come from everywhere with lots of jack, and when you lose it, there's no attack
Where could you get money that you don't give back? Let's go on with the show

(There's no business like show business like no business I know)
You get word before the show has started that your favorite uncle died at dawn
Top of that, your pa and ma have parted, you're broken-hearted, but you go on

(There's no people like show people, they smile when they are low)

Next day on your dressing room they've hung a star, let's go on with the show!",There's No Business Like Show Business,2006

Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

Axel Stordahl Orchestra And Chorus,"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

Axel Stordahl Orchestra And Chorus,"Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
Became impatient to be free

So I told the friendly star,
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

Now I shout it from the highest hills,
Even told the golden daffodils
At last my hearts an open door,
And my secret love's no secret anymore

Of things I can't forget, journeys on a jet
Our wond'rous week in Martinique and Vegas and roulette
How lucky I was

And thanks for the memory
Of summers by the sea, dawn in Waikiki
We had a pad in London but we didn't stop for tea
How cozy it was

Now since our breakup I wake up
Alone on a gray morning-after
I long for the sound of your laughter
And then I see the laugh's on me

But, thanks for the memory
Of every touch a thrill, I've been through the mill
I've lived a lot and learned a lot, you loved me not and still
I miss you so much

Thanks for the memory
Of how we used to jog even in a fog
That barbecue in Malibu, away from all the smog
How rainy it was

Thanks for the memory
Of letters I destroyed, books that we enjoyed
Tonight the way things look, I need a book by Sigmund Freud
How brainy he was

Gone are those evenings on Broadway
Together we'd go to a great show
But now I begin with the Late Show
And wish that you were watching, too

I know it's a fallacy
That grown men never cry, baby, that's a lie
We had our bed of roses, but forgot that roses die

I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely
Then I only have this to say

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my every prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care

Son como espejos del alma

Que mucho danan
Y las hay que en la diaria lucha
Fortalecen y acompanan

Enlutan a quien las viste
Y hay esas miradas dulces

No era igual al mío

Me alimentaba de mi fe

Axel Witteveen,"Yo sé que tú piensas
Que soy algo tímido
Y que no coincido
Con lo que te escribo

Que cuando estás
Cerca te miro y te miro
No digo palabras
Parezco un niño

Te hablo de a gotas
Amarte es un rito
Una ceremonia
Que yo solo practico

Te observo entera
Te radiografío
De pies a cabeza
Paisaje divino

Me acercas tu boca
Me arden los labios
Parezco sediento
Desesperado

Más mudo que nunca
Por señas callado
Te digo te amo
Te digo te amo

Es que yo sólo sé porque
Callo y no te hablo
No es difícil de entender
Si lo vieras de mi lado

Vales tanto para mí
Que colecciono tus frases
Y atesoro tus halagos

Sería mi peor pecado
Perder un solo detalle
De ti no poder guardármelo

Por eso mi amor
No soy tímido
Sólo contigo me pasa

Porque si siento no hablo
Por eso no hablo

Si me preguntaras
Por cada momento
Te haría un detalle
Un detalle perfecto

Riendo tus risas
Llorando tu llanto
Y en las despedidas
Muriendo en tus brazos

Me acercas tu boca
Me arden los labios
Parezco sediento
Desesperado

Y más mudo que nunca

Te digo te amo

Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose

If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like
If Mae West you like
Or me undressed you like

The set thats smart
Is intruding on nudist parties
In studios
Anything goes

When Mrs. Ned McClean God bless her
Can get Russian reds to yes her
Than I suppose

When Rockafeller still can hoard
Enough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows

And good's bad today
And black's white today

Who still can ride in Jitney's
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitney's

When Sam Goldwyn
Can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Than Anna shows

Now turns a handspring landing up
On her toes

Who was woken with an open door

Holding everything that I was ever looking for
