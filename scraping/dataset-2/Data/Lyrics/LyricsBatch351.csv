Hazel Dickens,"Just a few old memories
Slipped in through my door
Though I thought I had closed it
So tightly before
I can't understand it
Why it should bother my mind
For it all belongs to another place and time

Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised they're still left
Just a few old love letters
With the edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down

Just a few old memories
Going way back in time
Well I can hardly remember
I don't know why I'm cryin'
I can't understand it
Well I'm surprised myself
First thing tomorrow morning
I'll clean off that shelf

Just a few old keep-sakes
Way back on the shelf
No, they don't mean nothin'
Well I'm surprised that they're left
Just a few old love letters
With their edges all brown
And an old faded picture
I keep turned upside-down
",A Few Old Memories,1987
Hazel Dickens,"There ain't much that's left here that ain't all run down.
Gone all the echoes of old familiar sound.
Families are scattered, parted, and gone.
Left a lot of good things to wither away back home.

(Chorus:) Can't you feel those hills around you?
Can't you feel that touch of home?
And don't you wish you'd never gone?
There are some things memories can't bring home.
Hills of home, hills of home,
Families scattered off and gone.
These old hills that have been passed by,
Well, they've seen their share of leavin' in their time.

Old familiar dirt roads wind through the piney glade,
Where all the longing of childhood dreams were made,
Where we passed the mossy mounds where I could run and play,
Never a care to cross my mind all the livelong day. (Chorus)

Yes, they've seen their share of leavin' in their time.",Hills of Home,1987
Hazel Dickens,"She's lost a lot of herself that time cannot replace
Bits and pieces of herself gone without a trace
She's been holding on to everything that happened to be there
She's all used up and forgotten and scatterd eveerywhere

She's not an angel, so don't look for her wings
She's a hurtin woman who lives the song she sings
She learned them all the hard way on the streets all alone
That's why it's hard to tell the singer from the song

One by one her young years were gone before she knew
Wasted on some loser who was only walking through
Each time her bruised and lonely heart tried to break the fall
Rather put the pieces of the life on the wall

She's not an angel, so don't look for her wings
She's a hurtin woman who lives the song she sings
She learned them all the hard way on the streets all alone
That's why it's hard to tell the singer from the song
",It's Hard to Tell the Singer from the Song,1987
Hazel Dickens,"MAMA'S HANDS

I said goodbye to that plain little miner town
With just a few old clothes that layed around
I knew I was leavin' a lot a things they were good
But I thought I'd make a break while I still could;

As I looked back to wave once more
To mama cryin' in the door
For me and what the world might have in store
For she knew I'd never be her little girl no more;

But she was driftin' back to another time
When she was young and hoped to find
A better life than what her mama's had been
But it was so they'd go of mama's hands, my mama's hands;

CHORUS
One old paper bag filled with hand-me-downs
Plain old country girl raised on gospel sounds
With only the love she gave me and pride in what I am
It was hard to let go of mama's hands, my mama's hands.

I thought of all the love she gave
I thought of all the years she slaved
To try and make this run-down shack a home
A dream that really died 'fore it was born;

But she pulled us thru the hardest times
And made us hold our head up high
A gift we carry with us all our lives
For we were special in mama's eyes

As I looked down the dusty road
To mama and her heavy load
I knew I was leavin' i'd never find again
It was hard to let go of mama's hands, my mama's hands.

CHORUS

It was hard to let go of mama's hand, my mama's hands.",Mama's Hand,1987
Hazel Dickens,"Fly away little pretty bird
Fly Fly away 
Fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'll always stay

I see in your eyes a promise
Your own tender love you bring
But fly away little pretty bird
Close    the spring

Loves own tender flame warms this meeting
And loves tender song should sing
But fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'll always stay

I cannot make you no promise
For love is such a daily good thing
Fly away little pretty bird
For he'd only clip your wings

Fly away little pretty bird
And pretty you'd always stay
Fly far beyond the dark mountain
To where you'll be free ever more

Fly away little pretty bird
Where the cold winter winds don't blow

",Pretty Bird,1987
Hazel Dickens,"I held him as close as I dared to go
All his sweet love has started to show
I know that I need him, but trustin his love
But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough

Yes the battle is over, but healing takes time
Leave it all them old memories behind
I know that I love him, need him so much
But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough

Yes the battle is over, and the victor has fled
Wounded and dying, one lonely heart bled
Now love sounds her bugle, playing loves old sweet song
While the scars from an old love haven't quite all gone

Yes the battle is over, but healing takes time
Leave it all them old memories behind
I know that I love him, need him so much
But the scars from an old love haven't quite healed enough",Scars from an Old Love,1987
Hazel Dickens,"Hey I got the early Monday morning working blues
I put on my worn out working shoes
Well the weekend was too short but I can choose
When the lord made the working girl, he made the blues

Well I'm tired of working my life way
And givin someone else all of my pay
While they get rich on the profits that I lose
And leaving me here with the working girl blues

I do oh lay eee Working Girl Blues!
And I can't even afford a new pair of shoes
While they can live in any penthouse they choose
And all I got is the working girl blues

My boss said a raise is due almost any day
But I wonder will my hair be all turned gray
Before he turns that dollar loose and I get my dues
And lose a little bit of these working girl blues

Well I'm tired of working my life way
And givin someone else all of my pay
While they get rich on the profits that I lose

Hazel Dickens,"As you go from me, you want all that's left, 
The last thread of pride in my heart. 
'Til you've wrung the last teardrop from my eye, 
You won't be satisfied. 
[Chorus] 
So, take your cold, unloving heart, 
Your eyes too blinded to see 
Oh, you never found the door to this heart of mine, 
You'll get no more of me. 
You have raked my heart like a cruel winter storm, 
Bending my branches so low. 
Oh, your wayward heart and your tortured soul 
Leave no memory worthy to hold 
[Chorus] 

So, I'll take back my heart from the $%^&*# (wh-something) 
I'll hang my tears out to dry. 
And I'll hang my head in sorrow no more, 
And no more tears will I cry.

Hazel Dickens,"You pull the string
She's your plaything
You can make her or break her, it's true
You abuse her, accuse her
Turn her round and use her
Then forsake her any time it suits you

There's more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided bleached-out hair
And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

She hangs around
Playing her clown
While her soul is aching inside
She's heartbreak's child
She just lives for your smile
To build her up in a world made by man

There's more to her than powder and paint
Than her peroxided bleached-out hair
And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

At the house down the way
You sneak and you pay
For her love, her body or her shame
Then you call yourself a man
And say you just don't understand
How a woman could turn out that way

There's more to her than powder and paint
The men she picks up at the bar
And if she acts that way
It's 'cause you've had your day
Don't put her down, you helped put her there

Hazel Dickens,"Ten years ago
On a cold dark night
Someone was killed
'Neath the Town Hall light

Few were at the scene
But they all did agree
The slayer who ran
Looked a lot like me

The judge said, ""son
What is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else
You won't have to die""

Well I spoke not a word
Although it meant my life
For I had been in the arms
Of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The scaffold was high
And eternity near
She stood in the crowd
And shed not a tear

But sometimes at night
When the cold wind moans
In a long black veil
She cries o'er my bones

She walks these hills
In a long black veil
She visits my grave
When the night winds wail

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me",Long Black Veil,1996

You hate yourself, so you hate everybody else
People can make you feel small
Small is a size when age just won't rise fast enough
So you wait for the day, to be up get away
Run run as fast as you can
Over and Over and Over the hill far away

Runaway
Is there something you're trying to say
Runaway
Please come home one day
Runaway
Is there something you're trying to say
Over and over and over and over again

I remember the day in a grey misty way
When we boarded the boat to the hook
I was sick to the sea that was beckoning me to it's end
In the light of the dawn, feeling ragged and worn
I pointed my thumb to the sky
Over and over and over that road again

[CHORUS]

Now in the light of experience
There's something I want to say
Now in the light of experience
There's nowhere to run to
If from yourself you're really running away

Searching frantically the place where you belong
Gave you a map that showed you your direction
A shadow tore it up and told you it was wrong

And danced a little song

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care
Life just isn't there, if you can't share it
So why not dare it?

Feed your eyes on cold grey city concrete
An extra pair of arms is what you really need
But keep the secret, today no one can touch you
Dine on passion, then let your heart bleed
Alone at night it's dark
Hear a lonely dog bark

Come into the air, cast your body like a care
You belong nowhere and you can't bear it
Come into the air, cast your body like a care

Hazel O'Connor,"{Words & Music: Hazel O'Connor}

You hate yourself, so you hate everybody else
People can make you feel small
Small is a size when age just won't rise fast enough
So you wait for the day, to be up get away
Run run as fast as you can
Over and Over and Over the hill far away

[CHORUS:]
Runaway
Is there something you're trying to say
Runaway
Please come home one day
Runaway
Is there something you're trying to say
Over and over and over and over again

I remember the day in a grey misty way
When we boarded the boat to the hook
I was sick to the sea that was beckoning me to it's end
In the light of the dawn, feeling ragged and worn
I pointed my thumb to the sky
Over and over and over that road again

[CHORUS]

Now in the light of experience
There's something I want to say
Now in the light of experience
There's nowhere to run to
If from yourself you're really running away

[CHORUS 2x]

Runaway!



",Runaway,1981
Hazel O'Connor,"{Words & Music: Hazel O'Connor}

Sometimes I find it so hard to understand
We had some laughs together
Together we tried to change hand in hand
But now it's come to this, for now goodbye
And I must love you and leave you
And you must love me and leave me
And I must love you and leave you

But if ...

[CHORUS:]
If I had another chance
I would have the same romance
With life and you
The lands we travelled through
If I had my time again
I'd change it not another way
With you and life
The happiness and the knife
That's life (life)
That's life (life)
That's life (life, life, life)

A penny for your thoughts right now
Hey, I think I know
It's sad but I'll not let you see
One single tear when it's time for you to go
Hey we can say our goodbyes with a smile
And I must love you and leave you
And you must love me and leave me
And I must love you and leave you

But if ...

[CHORUS]

And I must love you and leave you
And you must love me and leave me
And I must love you and leave you

But if ... if ...

[CHORUS 2x]

If you ever, change your mind,
About leaving, leaving me behind
Won't you bring your
Your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me.

You made me cry
Honey when you left,
But you only, only hurt yourself
So won't you bring your
Your sweet loving,
Bring it on home to me.

I gave you jewellery,
And all my money and then it all,
All I do for you
But did it bring your, your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me.

Oh won't you bring your lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Why don't you bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me
Why don't you bring your sweet lovin'
Bring it on home to me

Here comes my friend Michael,
Grin written over his face
Walking with a kind of a swagger,
Walking with a kind of a grace
He talks the talk, he tries to walk the walk
He makes you laugh, he makes you really mad,
He'll lick you with an acid tongue
Make you feel he's right,
When you know he's wrong
He says life's a bitch and then you die,
And then you die

But in the meantime, maybe in the meantime,
He keep on smiling
In the meantime, maybe in the meantime
Like Michael says it's Mardi Gras

I don't think that life's like that,
Choice of word is bad
Maybe it's a kind of a lesson,
Maybe it's a sort of a map
We talk the talk, we try to walk the walk
It makes you laugh, and makes you feel
Like you've been had
And maybe we will live many lives

Keep coming back 'til we realize it's in our hands
We choose to do wrong or do right

But in the meantime, maybe in the meantime,
He keep on smiling
In the meantime, maybe in the meantime
Like Michael says it's Mardi Gras

The sun comes up and the sun comes down,
In the meantime
And the world keeps turning and
We're living and learning
In the meantime
And I think of you and wonder what you're doing,
In the meantime
Do you think of me and
What there could have been in the meantime

Here comes my friend Michael,
Grin written over his face
Walking with a kind of a swagger,
Walking with a sort of a grace

Down by Blackwater Side
And when staring all around me
An Irish lad I spied

All through the far part of the night
We spent in sport and play
Then the young man rose and put on his clothes
Saying faretheewell today

Go back, go back to your father's garden
Go back and cry your fill
And think upon your sad misfortune
You brought on by your wanton will

That's not the promise that you made to me
When you lay on my breast
I would have believed with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west

Go back, go back to your father's garden
Go back and cry your fill
And think upon your sad misfortune
You brought on by your wanton will

There's not a girl in this whole wide world
As easily led as I
And when fishes do fly and seas do run dry
It is when you will marry I

Go back, go back to your father's garden
Go back and cry your fill

And it suddenly reminded me I didn't sleep allnight.

Lyin' in the fatal position,

How can I sleep?
How can I sleep when it cuts too deep?
It cuts too deep.

Take a handfull of magic,
Weigh it up on the scales
Of the wrong place, the wrong time
Take one body of a memory
Of a bright bright eyes
I can't erase from my mind

Oh, take one girl who said yeah
I can handle it, in the voice of a child.
Does that child weep?
Does that weep,
No it cuts too deep,

And I've cried at night,
I've stamped on the pain of too much longing
I've cried in the morning
And I've cried at night

Now it's all done.

I shall dream again eternally speaking

Looks blank into the face of time

I find my way back home

To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
(Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
Might satisfy his mind.

The First approached the Elephant,
And happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side,
At once began to bawl:
""God bless me! but the Elephant
Is very like a wall!""

The Second, feeling of the tusk,
Cried, ""Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp?
To me 'tis mighty clear
This wonder of an Elephant
Is very like a spear!""

The Third approached the animal,
And happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands,
Thus boldly up and spake:
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a snake!""

The Fourth reached out an eager hand,
And felt about the knee.
""What most this wondrous beast is like
Is mighty plain,"" quoth he;
""'Tis clear enough the Elephant
Is very like a tree!""

The Fifth who chanced to touch the ear,
Said: 'E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most;
Deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an Elephant
Is very like a fan!""

The Sixth no sooner had begun
About the beast to grope,
Than, seizing on the swinging tail
That fell within his scope,
""I see,"" quoth he, ""the Elephant
Is very like a rope!""

Disputed loud and long,
Each in his opinion
Exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each was partly in the right,
And all were in the wrong!

Shut their windows, sought their beds,
Stopped their ears and covered their heads.

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings

How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me

Should I have lost the love tonight?
Are we running out of time?

It's dark and cool there tonight and I feel fine
And if kissing the fool makes it right
I feel fine sweetheart

There's my story though sad and tragic it is true
I've watched the sun set on the hills and lost the one I knew
I'm lonely and aging
Now I know where I am going
But never knew the grass was growing
I'm still alive, it's still vivid
I'm waking up under the table
I don't mind that my lip is bleeding
Its ok, I just need silent love

And he lays on his bed
Covers his head and closes his eyes
He sees a smoking gun
And the coward he ran
And in his arms is the bleeding,
Love of his life

And she cries,
Kiss it all better,
I'm not ready to go
It's not your fault love
You didn't know, you didn't know

Her hands are so cold
And he kisses her face
And says ""Everything will be all right""
He noticed the gun,
And his rage grew inside
He said ""I'll avenge my lover tonight""

Kiss it all better,

Now he sits behind prison bars
Twenty-five to life and she's not in his arms
He couldn't bring her back with a bullet to the heart
Of the back of a man and tore his world apart

All it is, is a memory

H.N.B. robbery, in Manhattan for currency
Sittin' up in the crib, drawin' out a map
On where security was gon' leave the door open at

Park the van around back, the M.P. jet black
We should be in and out 60 seconds flat
So son what's the deal? He ain't takin' his route
He rather stay home like a bitch, and have a alibi

What his cut look like, he think he takin' half
While we do all the dirt, he sit home on his ass
I got a funny feeling son, somethin' just ain't right
Kinda glad, I didn't go wit Rum and them that night

And sure enough nigga, you best to believe
Duke snitched under the hot light, like steady people
Wit a vote than a Clinton, Rum and me
Him in cell 2, and me in cell 3

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

Me off the job would of been easy, if son wouldn't have been greedy
I told him to parle, 'cause he one high jet speedin'
Laughin', countin', tryin' to play with money he ain't got
No knowledge of himself, and the trigger gave him heart

He just finish biddin', some remote federal prison
D said he was quotin' niggas, word to word shittin'
To get a light of sense, evident as I remember
When Dunn Dunn got knocked, I just seen him last summer

At Soul In The Hole, it was a King E. King game
First time out his crib, the kid got body, he got blamed
For being the last one seen, fleein' from the scene
Walk was with him up there, he said Duke was held obscene

On some in and out a cell, C.O. slayed him on his mail
His family got banked, he out on 200 foul bail
Myself I don't trust, and that's ya man, so you bust him
'cause every man, know a dead man don't answer questions

It was all love, when push came to shove
I had back, till one kid got clapped
They lock G, for conspiracy
He turn around tryin rattle me, Arabic

I know about this type of shit, snitches do exist
To all my dunns, holdin' guns
Gettin' funds, watch ya self
Through most of ya crimes by delf

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

She said she love me, but she took me for granted, when she panic
Flip the whole street, to some shit I couldn't handle it
From my man from up the hill, what the deal?
The block is heatin' up, and I need to cop steel

Come and see me, come bring dough 'cause, I can't afford a freebie
And come alone son, 'cause cats know to be snitchin' on TV
Be easy, I'm out but my love wanna tease me
Shorty want some attention, not to mention wanna please me

Hold tight, I'll be back in a flash, don't worry
You got money honey, stop actin' funny
Out the door, to care of my B.I.Z.
And I know this muthafuckas that's eyein' me

Is it a set-up, I peel but I make a detour
And come back, and see my shorty talkin' wit the law
I witnessed her trappin' 'bout my business
Where I be goin', who I know in the industry

She sex me good, but I should of known
Come into this world alone
Leave this world alone
Word is bond

Now some of these niggas are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you ever been bit by a snake
Take a minute to think if you can truly trust the click you click wit

And some of these niggas look just like you

But I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone.

Really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none.
In my eyes, you're everything.

To lend a guiding hand.
But you turned into a lover, and, mother, what a lover!
You wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed,
And, in the morning, kick me in the head

'Cause you didn't want to be alone.
You stole my heart. I couldn't leave you if I tried.

And get on back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue
And make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock 'n' roll band
That needs a helping hand.
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first-class fool out of me.
But I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.",Maggie May,1992
Head East,"Hey brother Jacob
I trust you're well today
You've been dealin' with the devil
And cast your soul away

Ol' brother Jacob lived 93 years
Not a second of it on his knees
He lived in a little wood shanty
Down the road a little piece

All he ever seemed to care about
Was his money that he saved so long
Always tryin' to get a few dollars
Any way, right or wrong

Hey brother Jacob
I trust you're well today
You've been dealin' with the devil
And cast your soul away

The only part that you have to doubt
Is where it says you don't have to pay
Ol' brother Jacob gambled and lost
When he sold his soul today

The story came down from the mountain town
Brother Jacob was called away
They say that the devil came for him
And they swear it to this very day

Then again, there's another tale
That's told around the town
Says Brother Jacob is still alive
And livin' underground

Hey brother Jacob
I trust you're well today
You've been dealin' with the devil
And cast your soul away

Hey brother Jacob
I trust you're well today
You've been dealin' with the devil
And cast your soul away

When the days and nights have gone all wrong

Headless Chickens,"Sometimes days seem to move just like a big fat man
Sometimes days seem to end up where they first began
I've got my T.V tuned to channel ""you""
Because there's nothing else that I can do
Maybe I should set my heart for cruise control

You know there's something else 
But still you try to act surprised
I can see your camera filming sweat above my eyes
There's nothing left to save
But, still you know that it was right
To try to make the dream bigger than the night

Maybe I've got a lot of you inside my brain
Maybe I'd better shave my memory again
Then I'll smile and blow it all away
And send you postcards from anaother day
Maybe I should of set my heart for cruise control

When panic over-rides my soul give me cruise control

You check your watch again
I try to hum a tune
But I can see some one else's shadow in the room
Sometimes love gets itchy
It needs to go to far
I think our love just left in some one else's car

Sometimes days seem to move just like a big fat man
Sometimes days seem to end up where they first began
And then it looks like I drove you away

It would appear that you lie and you cheat

Want to howl 'cause it feels like torture

Wipe away the teardrop from your eye

A doorway that I run to in the night

But only didn't realize it and you were scared

To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see

Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form

You can achieve dream control

How's that then, better?

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin

You're safe from pain in the dream domain

A round trip journey in your head

Headshots,"Â??Dungeons and Dragonsâ?? by Dr. Demento

Narrator: Dungeons and Dragons, Satan's game. Your children like it or not, are attracted in their weaker years to the Occult and a game like D+D fuels their imagination and makes them feel special, while drawing them deeper and deeper into the bowels of El Diablo. This afternoon the Dead Alewives watch tower invites you to sit in on an actual gaming session. Observe the previously unobservable as a hidden camera takes you to the inner sanctum of Dungeons and Dragons

Graham: Galstaff you have entered the door to the north. You are now by yourself standing in a dark room, the pungent stench of mildew emanates off the wet dungeon walls.

Nightblade: Where are the Cheetos!

Graham: They're right next to you.

Galstaff: I cast a spell.

Nightblade: Where's the Mountain Dew!

Graham: In the Fridge. DUH!

Galstaff: I wanna cast a spell.

Nightblade: Can I have a Mountain Dew!

Graham: Yes, you can have a Mountain Dew just go get it.

Galstaff: I can cast any of these right, on the list?

Graham: Yes, any any of the first level ones.

Nightblade: I'm gonna get a soda, any one want one? Hey Graham I'm not in the room right?

Graham: What room?

Galstaff: I wanna cast magic missile.

Nightblade: The room where he's casting all these spells from!

Graham: He hasn't cast any thing yet.

Galstaff: I am though if you'd listen. I'm casting Magic Missile.

Graham: Why are you casting Magic Missile, there's nothing to attack here.

Galstaff: I- I- I'm attacking the darkness.

(laughing)

Graham: Fine fine you attack the darkness there's an elf in front of you.

Picard: Whoa! That's me right?

Graham: He's wearing a brown tunic and he has gray hair and blue eyes.

Picard: No I don't, I have gray eyes.

Graham: Let me see that sheet.

Picard: Well it says I have, well it says I have blue but I decided I wanted gray eyes.

Graham: Whatever, ok, you guys can talk now if you want.

Galstaff: Hello.

Picard: Hello.

Galstaff: I am Galstaff, Sorcerer of Light.

Picard: Then how come you had to cast Magic Missile?

(laughing)

Graham: why- why- why- You guys are being attacked.

Nightblade: Do I see that happening!?!

Graham: NO! You're outside by the tavern.

Nightblade: Cool, I get drunk!

Graham: Ugh. There are there are seven ogres surrounding you.

Picard: How can they surround us? I had Mordenkainens Magical Watch Dog cast!

Graham: No you didn't.

Nightblade: I'm getting drunk! Are there any girls there?

Picard: I totally did. You asked me if I wanted any equipment before this adventure, and I said no, but I need material components for all my spells, so I cast Mordenkainens Faithful Watch Dog.

Graham: But you never actually cast it.

Nightblade: Roll the dice to see if I'm getting drunk!

Graham: Ugh. Yeah you are.

Nightblade: Are there any girls there?

Graham: Yeah!

Picard: I did though; I completely said when you asked me...

Graham: No you didn't. You didn't actually say that you were casting the spell so now there's ogres. Ok.

Nightblade: OGRES!?! Man, I got an ogre slaying knife! It's got a +9 against ogres!

Graham: You're not there, you're getting DRUNK!

Nightblade: Ok, but if there's any girls there I wanna do them!

Narrator: There you have it. A frightening look into Americas most frightening past time. Remember that it's not you children's fault that's their being drawn into a satanic world of nightmare. It's their gym teachers fault for making them feel out cast when they couldn't do one single pull up.

Like some familiar melody
A hidden chapter from a story left untold
I gotta feeling, I could believe in

There is an angel in my heart
Feels like I'm guided by a candle in the dark
It's taken all this time
To finally find out what I could never see
You were there for me
Now there is no doubt that there will always be
An angel in my heart

You were the friend, you were the one I could confide in
You gave me strength that I could never find
Deep emotions that I've always been denyin'
I believe in, it's so close now it's you that I'm feeling

Well I don't think so because you let me know
You make me feel like you're mine
Well I feel like you're mine and I can't remember
When the feelings have been stronger
And all I know is I can't let go of you
Or be with you just a little while longer
All my feelings come together
All I need is here
Never know when I felt better
'Cause I know this won't disappear
Could it be forever or is my mind just rambling on
Well maybe it is and if it is I'll just be moving along
Well I feel like you're mine and I see in your face
I'm not wrong to have these feelings
Well I feel like you're mine and I've never known a time before
That's had so many meanings

And my spirit is crying for leavin'
In my thoughts I have seen, rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand lookin'

Ooh, that makes me wonder
Oh yeah

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And the new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

Your head is hummin' and it won't go, in case you don't know

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know?
Your stairway lies on the whisperin' wind

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold

Heart,"There I was with the old man
Stranded again so off I'd ran

Said no, no, no, no, no child

Up in the air he likes to fly

Below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground, laughing
She don't know why, she don't know why

Safe in the trees you had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers
Stealing your fires, the message hit my mind
Only words that I could find

Dog and butterfly below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground

We're getting older the world's getting colder
For the life of me I don't know the reason why
Maybe it's livin' making us give in
Hearts rolling in taken back on the tide
We're balanced together ocean upon the sky

Another night in this strange town
Moonlight holding me light as down
Voice of confusion inside of me
Just begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through
Then the old man's words are true

See the dog and butterfly
Up in the air he like to fly
Dog and butterfly, below she had to try
She roll back down to the warm soft ground
With a little tear in her eye
She had to try, she had to try
Dog and butterfly, yeah

She held him close and he felt just fine
He warmed her up, she know he was just right

And man that axe could sing and scream
Crying for a big breakthrough
Only small time local news

Just about to pack it in

Paid the way and broke the band

You`re only one I can really bend with
Take me `cross the river Styx

Anything you tell me, Johnny, I`ll believe

Heart,"I been trying a long, long time
To write a love letter, perfect lines
What I want to say is hard to find
No cliches or tired rhymes
But words turn on me hard as I try
Your look of love, I can't describe

I'll use the language of love
The language of love
You'll understand what I say
Words are never enough
The language of love is the only way

Bad, bad heartaches when I'm alone
Fighting with feelings I've never known
Scared and lonely, half gone mad
'Coz I need what I just can't have
I write a love letter like a kiss in the night
Wanna tell it to you just right

I'll use the language of love
The language of love
You'll understand what I say
Words are never enough
The language of love is the only way

I need love so very bad
You are the best I've ever had
I need to say, I need to show
In the way only lovers know

We were feelin' out of place
So we made our own escape
In that New York cafe place to be
Outsider, traveler you and me
We were laughing about it
Kept us out of reach
I won't forget that night
I won't forget that light
Through the window and the lace
Making patterns on your face
Exposed with all your pain
I know it hurts the worst
That very first love mistake
You said we'll still be sitting
Here again someday,
Laughing at ourselves this way
After time has healed and made it right
We'll still be looking in each other's eyes
And through it all
It's friends who will survive

Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while

Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night

We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note
I told him I am the flower you are the seed
We walked in the garden we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

One night of love was all we knew
All want to do is make love to you

All night long

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way

Didn't we know right from the start
That we would have to keep this secret
Or forever stay apart

I watch you coming to me
Walking in the pouring rain
I can't help looking at you
Wishing I could stay away
So many times I've tried in vain
To close my eyes and pray it goes away
But I can't stop myself from feeling
To let you go would be too much
For me to take

How do we ever keep this secret
How do we deep it in the dark
And if we dare to taste our weakness
How could we tear ourselves apart
Why do we keep this love together
Didn't we know right from the start
That we would have to keep this secret
Or forever stay apart

I can't help thinking
When I look into your eyes
How much I need you
It's so hard to hide

Heart,"Out of the street, get on home
Tail shaking filly running on her own
They say she got loose on the night
She was born
Cranking it up in a school zone

""Kick it out, kick it out"", she said
""kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive, kick it out!""

Sitting in a bar in a seaside town
Sweet little love getting high getting down
Sailors see her running along the beach
Laugh and jump out of reach

Wild music blowing in her mane
She needs a bareback rider won't give her
No pain
A hard racy game of give and take
Leaves them dazed, half crazed, in her wake

""Kick it out, kick it out"", she said
""kick out your motor and drive
While you're still alive, kick it out!""",Kick It Out,1995

You went so far
Where my feelings are

You stopped running
You knew I had something
To show you

Like an angel came
Made music of my name

Engines were screaming and still I was asking myself why
High on the wind I was feeling my sweet darlin' cry

On the road home, in the early spring
Locked up in my silence, alone with everything

And if you find the words won't come
Just you stand and sing

And oh, oh, the highway runs so clear
Oh, oh, grinning from there to here
You know I love singin' it, the silence that is home
And now we've put the same on the road

On the road home, yeah, goin' home

On the road home, we see the yellow moon rise
And I feel what you are feelin' 'cause I see it with your eyes
You see romance, your sweet love song
Standin' in that moonlight, two hearts can't be wrong

Heart,"Is it that we´ve been together much too long
The answer may not be in black and white
We´re always trying to prove who´s right or wrong
Yet now we´re giving up without a fight
But I know when you´re gone
I´ll wish I´d held in

So baby surrender to me
There´ll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me tonight

I don´t want our love to cause you so much pain
If this is how it´s going to be, I´ll walk away
Neither one of us should ever say goodbye
Let´s forget about the past and who´s to blame
´Cause when this is all gone
We´ll wish we´d held on

So baby surrender to me
There´ll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me tonight

How could this love be in danger?
That used to be so good, so right
To think that fate could make us strangers
Has thrown me in your arms tonight

So baby surrender to me
There´ll be no holding back now
So baby surrender to me tonight",Surrender to Me,2000

Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around.
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights.

Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen.
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen.
I was introduced and we both started groovin'.
I said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on.
Keep movin' on.""

I had yet to know well In peace as I lay I look back on the day And the voice of my father 
I still hear him say ?Oh well, Oh well. 
It's just another noel. Where is the king of Israel? 

On the next noel I remember it well 
With my own little boy and the stories to tell 
'Bout a star in the sky on a beautiful night 
And the shepherds and cattle alone in his light 

Oh tell oh tell me about the noel 
Born is the king of Israel Little stockings hung with care 
Hoping Santa will be there Little footsteps on the roof 
Down the chimney there's your proof there's your proof

And then she turned to go
The prince of peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone

The ring wraiths ride in black

Same old day same old race
Just in case find a place for love
All to taste little grace of love
When days are gray we go downtown
We'll walk around and talk and talk it out
Under the cover of the old marquee see colors on the twilight street
We find a shelter in each other now the rain is like a symphony

Through her windows, darkness she don't see

Heart of Darkness Chorale,"Across the vein of night
There cuts a path of searing light
Burning like a beacon
On the edges of our sight
At the point of total darkness
And the lights divine divide
A soul can let its shadow stretch
And land on either side --
Either side

And balanced on the precipice
The moment must reveal
Naked in the face of time
Our race within the wheel
As we hang beneath the heavens
And we hover over hell
Our hearts become the instruments
We learn to play so well

That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

Outside the pull of gravity
Beyond the spectral veil
Within our careful reasoning
We search to no avail
For the constant in the chaos
For the fulcrum in the void
Following a destiny
Our steps cannot avoid

Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

In a spiral never-ending
Are we drawn towards the source
Spinning at the mercy 
Of an unrelenting force
So we stare into the emptiness
And fall beneath the weight
Circling the Nexus in a
Fevered dance with fate --

Wealthy the spirit 
That knows its own flight
Stealthy the hunter 
Who slays his own fright
Blessed the traveler 
Who journeys the length of the light

For everyone

Let there be peace on earth
Let every voice be heard

Le there be peace on earth

'til it's felt around the world

There's only one world in which we all mus live
Heaven shoe us how to forgive
And on that marble wall which holds a million names
Generations of dreams gone down in flames
Isn't, isn't it a shame

For every boy and every girl
Under the sun...

Let there be peace on earth
(why don't you try just a little harder)
Let every voice be heard

Let there be peace on earth
(oh, if we could just get it together)
'til it's felt around the world...

We're running out of time
As our leaders roll the dice
The human spirit cries
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.

Save the babies, save the babies
If we only get it together
If we could only get it together
I think we could make it
Think we could make it
Save the children...

Heartbeats of Rafael,"Cast aside with broken shield
I was abandoned by my god
Left as dirt among the lonely race
It painted dark my space
Open wound from a dagger hand
Left open for no cause

Rewinded thoughts I endlessly gazed
I found conviction in it's claws
Reunion in war
Traumatic point in a useless breath
I'm choking on its curse
Faded role into dark absence

I was divided into half
A serpent's sting and a spit within
Soon the poison starts its search
Open casket headless bones
And my fight revived much worse

It tortures my thoughts
It leaves me in vain
It tortures my nights
It drives me insane

The real me is to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love
But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated

I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like
Do you know what it feels like?
'Cause with you
I can let my hair down
I can say anything crazy
I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground

Now that I'm with you
With you
Now that I'm with you

You speak and it's like a song
And just like that all my walls come down

I relate to you naturally
Everybody else just fades away

This friend went to Birmingham
And he's a State's Farm Insurance man
And makes a hundred thou
He calls me every now and then
Keeps saying he can cut me in
But it's too late now
Cause I've seen so much Delta rain
It must've seept into my veins
Been here long enough to see
One thing for a man like me is

A little house, a piece of land
Making things grow with my own two hands
Coming home weary to the bone at the end of the day
Country stores, beat up Fords
And songs with only two or three chords
Somehow I think I fell in love with this Mississippi mud

Hang around here long enough
It'll get into your blood
Comes up like a cotton seed
Before to long all you need is

Making things grow with my own two hands
Coming home weary to the bone at the end of the day

Watching our team getting beat like a drum by a private school
They were giving high fives and acting cool
Tommy fouled out and the coach looked around
Said, 22 it looks like it's down to you
You're back in, do you think you can go again

All they could say was, we're happy for you, son
It's about time, you left your rowdy ways behind
She figured out she was destined for some other place

I got the ring back, ups

But sometimes I seem to ignore you
That's because I don't deserve
To have your love for me ever

All this time, I wanted you to know
That if you're ever, ever feeling low
You can always count on, on me
To be there whenever you need

Since you took my breath again
Would you share your oxygen?
I can breathe one breath of air
Intoxicated by your stare

Standing in the middle of the street
Oh, please don't run over me

Reach for a sun that shines

We're going to Oklahoma to the family reunion for the first time in years
It's up at uncle Slayton's cause he's getting on in years
You know he no longer travels but he's still pretty spry
He's not much on talking and he's just too mean to die
And they'll be comin' down from Kansas
And from west Arkansas
It'll be one great big old party like you never saw

Uncle Slayton's got his Texan pride
Back in the thickets with his Asian bride
He's got a Airstream trailer and a Holstein cow 
He still makes whiskey 'cause he still knows how
He plats that Choctaw bingo every Friday night
You know he had to leave Texas but he won't say why
He owns a quarter section up by Lake Eufala
Caught a great big ol' blue cat on a driftin' jug line 
Sells his hardwood timber to the shipping mill
Cooks that crystal meth because the shine don't sell

Where they do things different 
Thought he'd just come on down

You know the one they built up on that great big ol' bridge
Across the Will Rogers Turnpike
Took the Big Cabin exit stopped and bought a couple of cartons of cigarettes
At that Indian Smoke Shop with the big neon smoke rings
In the Cherokee Nation hit Muskogee late that night 
Somebody ran a stoplight at the Shawnee Bypass 
Roscoe tried to miss 'em but he didn't quite 

Bob and Mae come up from little town
Way down by lake Texoma where he coaches football
They were two A champions now for two years running
But he says they won't be this year no they won't be this year
And he stopped off in Tushka at that ""Pop's Knife and Gun"" place
Bought a SKS rifle and a couple a full cases of that steel core ammo
With the berdan primers from some East bloc nation that no longer needs 'em
And a Desert Eagle that's one great big ol' pistol 
I mean .50 caliber made by bad ass Hebrews

Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then

You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.
I don't think I still could do it
Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now

You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright",Paying the Cost to Be the Boss,2001

Lumiere:
Yes, think of what that means!

Lumiere:
I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm...

I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again

I'll get down to brass tacks and relax

The devil is in hell with the demons
This is the Holy War

They lead us to our temptation
Lead us, take our souls
There is no evil in salvation
There is evil in us all

Just as Satan tempted Jesus
And Jesus slips and falls
He is a station on The Cross now
He is dying to save us all

Oh Allah oh no oh no

Heathen,"Masses form into religion to fulfill their lives
Seeking answers in the bible, hear their helpless cries 
Mindlessly, no thought, they follow false prophets of the flesh 
Depend on the spirit of the One to grant their every wish

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's not too late to change your fate 
You must control your own mind 
You're the only one that can release you 
It's yourself you've got to find

[Chorus:]
Fools give money to the church to earn their place with God 
In our eyes it's contradiction and religious fraud 
Hypnotized by what they say
Your mind is under their control 
Hypnotized you will obey
Your fate will soon be called

You must make your own decision of what you think is real 
Your soul was given on to you and not for these thieves to steal 
Don't be fooled by these hypnotic forces, they will rob you blind 
There is no excuse for their actions
Making a mockery of mankind

I got real street niggas that ride on my side, what
They know the code, either do it or die
You got rich street niggas that ride on your side
They know the code, it's either do it or die

So what the world gon' tell us
Me and mine too strong and rebellious, the petties stay jealous
Find me in the dusty cellars, writing
To feed the 5,000 fellas, hustlers and street dwellers

Heather be devoted, quote it
I feed the desperate and demoted
Want passion? I'm loaded the truth, I uphold it
Wisdom, I tote it
Bet that outdoes me, Heather be self promoted

I know thieves, thugs and crooks
We be ridin' and I don't care how it look
You better take it easy 'fore you get that took
Yo my mans and them be off the hook, PA

My peoples be's behind me so I fears nobody
Foxxx push the Navie, while I'm ridin' shotty
The last nigga that tried me, what, he came apart
He dropped mine and they took his heart so don't start

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, what

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, huh

My walk through life is iller than most niggas that carry toast
I'm ya emcee, lyrical host
Stretch a nigga if he stand too close
My niggas know who the boss is
The 240 pound bald-headed killer that don't know what a loss is

We like black Yukons and Navigators
Real street agrivators and we'll kill you in a suit and gators
Don't get it fucked up, niggas'll run you like plays
And cut you like 'Back in the days'

I got real street niggas that ride, right or wrong
They always on my side, so bring it on
Take ya picture, then we come and get'cha, ya little bitcha
We bust ya with them four pound shells

That split'cha when they hit'cha
My unpredictable style of emceein'
Kinda reflects the unpredictable zone a nigga be in
My niggas seein' what I'm seein'
Bustin' out the back window when we fleein'

We heard your radio record, you bitch nigga
Now we sittin' back waitin' to rob this fake rich nigga
Biters and snitch niggas, get put in PC like lyrical police
Stay the fuck away from me
I'd rather bounce to Jerse' and rock with Heather be
Then fuck with fake ass niggas that ain't like me

You got real street niggas that ride on your side, huh

You got real street niggas that ride on your side baby

You have shattered all of my dreams:

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray

Please don't take my sunshine away

In all my dreams, dear, you seem to leave me

So when you come back and make me happy
I'll forgive you dear, I'll take all the blame.

Come on ev'rybody, I say now  let's play a game.
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name.
The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,
But a ""B"" or an ""F""  or an ""M"" will appear;
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold, 
Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold, 
Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!
 
But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the ""F's"", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.
 
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.

Heather Headley,"This is the moment when the gods expect me
To beg for help but I won't even try
I want nothing in the world but myself to protect me
But I won't lie down, roll over and die

All I have to do is to forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died

It's easy, it's easy
All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start

It's easy, it's easy
Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him
And how he would have been were I to be with him today
Those very rare occasions, don't let up, they keep on coming
All I ever wanted and I'm throwing it away

It's easy, it's easy as life
And then I see the faces of a worn defeated people
A father and a nation who won't let a coward run
Is this how the gods reward the faithful through the ages?
Forcing us to prove that all the hardest things we've done

Are easy, so easy
And though I'll think about him until the earth draws in around me
And though I choose to leave him for another kind of love
This is no denial, no betrayal, but redemption
Redeemed in my own eyes and in the pantheon above

It's easy as life

Gave you all my love and understanding

What she says and what she does 
Ain't no concern to me
She don't really need to be 
All up in ma business

Baby you didn't really take the time 
To talk to me 
You played me and betrayed me

[Chorus fades until the end]",Sunday,2002
Heather Headley,"There's a time I felt I was blessed To be loved by you 
But those blessings turn to regret from all the things you put me through
I remember at night you used to hold me till the sun rose the next day
Now you sleep and just turn away while my heart is on display
And I say

[Chorus: x2]
Why should I cry one more night?
Why should I smile when it hurts inside?
Why does my heart say, get up and walk away
Why do I stay?
Why, why, why

There's a reason why I cry every day
There's a reason why things don't go your way
There's a reason why I kneel down in pray
There's a reason why I'm still around today
Can't you see that I'm hurtin' eternally?
I need affection and good Lord therapy
I need you know as an urgent delivery
To get rid of the pain inside of me

[Chorus: x2]

Why should I put up lies?
Am I afraid to say goodbye?
I've loved you so, baby I can't deny
But now it's time to dry my eyes
It's Hard to think of what was changed when I feel like it was all in vain
Can't be right and feel this wrong
This heart of mine is just

[Chorus: x3]",Why Should I Cry,2002
Heather Headley,"We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out, take others in

I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you now and forever, peaceful, true

I wish I had the courage
To tell you face to face
But I could wait forever
For the perfect time and place

We all live such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
Strangers, lovers, husbands, wives
Hard to know whose loving who

Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to touch your heart, may this confession be the start

Verse 1:

Tried to leave me broken and confused

You tried to hurt me

Throw me out like something used

But now your back and you need me for everyhting

To help you, and keep you, hold you and need ya

Oh, how things have changed


Chorus:

Ain't it funny how life goes around

Same people you meet goin' up

You see them coming down

But ain't it funny how you can need me now

Same women you miss treated is your everything now


Verse 2:

Tryin' to find a place in my heart to forgive you

Maybe some old memory will make me care for you

Seeing you this way oh, makes me wanna cry

To help you, to hold you, love you and teach you

There are rules of life, ain't it funny


Chorus:

Ain't it funny how life goes around

Same people you meet goin' up

You see them coming down

But ain't it funny how you can need me now

Same women you miss treated is your everything now


Brigde:

What goes around, see it always comes around

And I know I don't serve, it's gotta come down

Don't you know you reep what you sow

Baby that is what I know

You need me just like I needed you


Chorus:

Ain't it funny how life goes around

Same people you meet goin' up

You see them coming down

But ain't it funny how you can need me now

Same women you miss treated is your everything now


",Ain't It Funny,2005
Heather Headley,"I'm laying here in my bed, staring at the ceiling
Imagining that you're here, holding me,
See to have your heart in my possession would mean everything,
But would you rather live loveless, or will you live for me and . . .

[Chorus]
What would you give, and
What would it take, for
You to show me, that, I'm worth all the love
Every tear
Will you fight for me until you win
I need to know
Am I worth it?

Now I wanna' give you my all, but I don't know if it's too soon,
See the heart doesn't understand time, it just does what it wants to
See to have your heart in my possession would mean everything
But would you rather live loveless or would you live for me and . . .

[Chorus]

Would you climb the highest mountain?
Would you swim the deepest sea?
Would you put your life on the line?
I need to know, would you do this for me?
Am I worth the late night phone call?
When you really wanna' be asleep
Am I worth you giving it your all?
'Cause you're worth it to me

[Chorus]",Am I Worth It,2006
Heather Headley,"I got a song in my heart
Let me start with I'm over you
Still it can't hurt me to say very plain . . . I think about you
And the laughs and the jokes and the times that I shared with you.
I got this feeling for reminiscing
Wanted to take that trip down memory lane
But what is missing, is that you're not here to sit down with me
So I'm thinking these beautiful things all by myself.
And what's on my mind is

[Chorus]
Back when it was
Simple as breathing
Just the two of us
We were happy together it was
Easy to be in
Our relationship,
You remember when
You used to say you loved me so
Promised one time to never go away
And now you're gone

The smile that you left me with, is the same smile I've kept on wearing
The smile's not so much tied to you
More tied to what we spent sharing
Simple little things
But it was all those simple little things that pleased me the most...
Need I remind you 'bout the good times baby
There were good times from the start
Good times in my heart
A heart that never lied
Remember back in '99.
When we snuck into the neighbor's pool and went for a dip
There were good times in the rain
Good times everyday
Good times Heaven knows
Remember that dirty little joke
Made us laugh all night long.

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The joy you left me with, nothing stronger since
What we did together
I ain't felt nothing better since that time
Those were the days
The nights
The minutes
The seconds
That you were mine

[Chorus]",Back When It Was,2006
Heather Headley,"I tried so many times but nothing happened,
It seemed the task at hand was much too great for me.
I spent my yesterdays wondering if tomorrow would be the same.
I underestimated Your grace.
But you loved me in spite of my ways
And changed me.

[Chorus]
Change
That's the word that comes to mind when I think of all you've done for me.
Oh, oh, change
It's kinda' strange how people say that I act so differently
Oh, oh change
Every passing day I find it easier to say:
""What a wonderful change in me.""

Now I find myself staring in the mirror
Taking inventory of the things I see.
I never realized that there was so much missing deep inside
Until you took control of my life.
Like an eagle now I can fly
Cause you changed me.

[Chorus]

And everyday I pray that you'll open my eyes to see things your way
Cause I wanna love like you,
Walk like you,
Live like you.
Whatever you have to do
Even if you change me Lord.

[Chorus]",Change,2006
Heather Headley,"I gotta' lotta' things to share with you boy
I'm checking for ya', call me baby sometime, I'll tell it to ya
I'm feelin' all this chemistry between you and me
I can't sleep at night I toss and turn and turn
Lookin' for ya' dreams of you by my side, I'm talking to ya

What's this
what's this
I feel
I feel
I'm curious, 'gotta see

[Chorus]
How many ways can I show you how I feel
Let you know my love is real
I'll be the girl for you I will 
Give you all of me
I wanna' hear how it sounds when you say my name
Boy for that I'll do anything
And if you need or you want for more
Tell me how many ways

I'm waiting for the day, you say to me, tellin' me
I'm the one you need and you'll always take care of me
And you take me by the hand and tell me 'Baby it's alright, its okay'
Then you and me can finally live out all our fantasies
Layin' on the beach - fall asleep in the West Indies
Listenin' to sounds of pleasure

[Chorus: x2]",How Many Ways,2006
Heather Headley,"It's bordering on insanity
So blurred
So unclear
Then suddenly eyes focus and realize that
This man should not be here
It's funny how there's no remorse in the moment
But after it's over you wish you could disown it
And as you get up to tell this stranger to leave
The love of your life walks in and sees, everything

[Chorus]
And of all the things that you could have said
What was in your head?
I didn't mean to
All the thoughts running through your mind
All that you could find
I didn't mean to
And the pain of losing everything comes over you
I didn't mean to
All you can say is that 'you didn't mean to'
I didn't mean to

And it's reality now
Pictures of him and your baby
Smashed in broken glass all on the floor
With his suitcase in one hand, your little girl's hand in the other
You hear him say ""Mommy don't live us no more""
And it cuts like a knife but you can't blame him either
You're a mother, you're a wife, but you're also a cheater
Ooh girl, one silly moment of lust
Just cost you everything that you've ever loved

[Chorus]

Oh, the clouds are rolling in
As you prepare to face this punishment and suffer the consequence
Such a price to pay
Was it really worth it?
And you fight back tears
As you watch him take the only thing you ever truly loved away
The tears in her eyes as she waves goodbye
Slowly kills you inside

[Chorus]",I Didn't Mean To,2006
Heather Headley,"Imagine seeing him on the town,
Holding another hand.
She's starin' me down,
So I figure that he told her who I am.
But it don't matter either way,
What they do or say cause ain't nothin' changed.
He's standing with her, but his soul is calling out my name.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.

Saw his momma just the other day,
Said he'd been through a spell.
Had a bad break up, thinks he's on his way up, it's hard to tell.
She said I think it'd do some good if you called him every now and then.
You see he's been through some things and I'm thinking he could really use a friend.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.
Only time can tell if I'm his lady.
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl.

They say if you love something, you've got to let it go.
And if it comes back, then it means so much more.
Fine if it never does, at least you will know,
That it was something you had to go through to grow.

In my mind, I'll always be his lady.
In my mind, I'll always be his girl.
Only time will tell if I'm his lady.
But in my mind, I'll always be his girl.

Always feel this way about ya,
Always be your lady,
In my heart, in my mind.
In my heart, in my mind.
In my soul, in my mind.
Baby you should know,
You're in my thoughts, in my mind.
You're in my prayers, in my mind.
I'll always keep you there.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.",In My Mind,2006
Heather Headley,"At first I wrote it ""dear you,"" then it turned,
""to whom it may concern.""
I began it in this way because
I needed to express through these words,
How deeply I was hurt,
And how distant from you I now was.
I wrote ""normally I would say
These words to your face,
But this time that I just can't do,
Cause I know the way you been movin'
And the things you been doin'
And right now I can't stand the sight of you.""

So this is my goodbye
This means we are not together
This means that you're free,
See who you wanna' see, and me,
Well I know I can do better
So this is my goodbye
This makes it official, you've lost me forever
We are now the past, and it's kinda sad
That you had to read it in this letter
This is my goodbye

By the time you finish this
I'll be gone for good, your lesson learned.
Where it is I'll be, and who's lovin' me,
Sorry baby, that's no longer your concern.
And tell your lil' friend she'll be in my prayers,
Cause just having to deal with you
Is enough to break your soul.
I just hope she knows exactly
What it is she's getting into.

So this is my goodbye
This means we are not together
This means that you're free,
See who you wanna' see, and me,
Well I know I can do better
So this is my goodbye
This makes it official, you've lost me forever
We are now the past, and it's kinda sad
That you had to read it in this letter
This is my goodbye

Not that it matters to you,
But I wrote this with clear and dry eyes.
The years of being mistreated by you,
I've cried all the tears I can cry.
So this is the end, done and over with.
Believe me when I say that you won't be missed.
No hug, no kiss, signed sincerely.
P.S. Forget you ever knew me.

So this is my goodbye
This means we are not together
This means that you're free,
See who you wanna' see, and me,
Well I know I can do better

This makes it official, you've lost me forever

Heather Headley,"I used to think that you were heaven sent
'Cause you appeared to be the perfect gentleman
You would open doors and make those daily calls
Just to check and see if I needed anything at all
You used to be concerned
Then things changed suddenly
And when something went wrong
You were never there to see
When I would tell you that I need comforting
You would tell me you were kickin' it with Ray and them

Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Even though I cried a little and I tried a little
I learned what a good woman really needs
Losing you had to be
The best thing that ever happened to me
Now that I'm over the pain, I found love again
With a man that makes me so happy

You would get mad at me over stupid things
Now why would I be going through 
The pockets of your jeans
I had suspicions and I felt 
Something was goin' on
You blame me for cheatin'
But it was you doin' something wrong
They say that guilt will break ya down
And lately you've been calling 
But it's too late now
And I just wanna thank you
For leaving when you did
'Cause I never would of fell in love with him

Thank you for the silly arguments
You made me realize
And the times you tried
To kill my self-confidence

To expect the same of you
Now, I'm not trying to start nothing

No different than her man

Not some you and some I
Just some me time, oh

I could have anyone I want

You said 'baby I'm tired'
Must have been tired of me cause you left me hangin'

So I think I'm hearing what's not being said

I think I'm hearing what's not being said

You said, but now its time for show and tell
Sent me a letter saying you still care
You say you ain't in love with no one else
And now I'm living everyday blaming my self
So if you have a reason 
And you ain't speaking up
Why can't you just be a man 
And tell me I ain't good enough
No I wasn't dreaming
I know some days things got rough
You must have been tired of me 
To just leave me hanging

What you're saying to me I don't want to believe

'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word
Just to rest upon His promise,
Just to know ""Thus saith the Lord""

O for grace to trust Him more!

I'd rather be His than have riches untold

I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands

I'd rather be led by His nail pierced hand

Than to be a king of a vast domain
Or be held in sin's dread sway

I'd rather have Jesus than anything

Heather Headley,"I'd give you the moon, but you'd never know the warmth of the sunshine,
I'd give you the world, but actually what would that do.
I'd promise you wings to fly, but how would you ever learn to run,
So I wish you all you need, to be more than I can be.
This is what I wish for you.

I wish you rainy days, so you can know the beauty of a clear blue sky
I wish you falling leaves, so you'll understand that seasons change.
Cause, if I gave you the mountains, would you learn to climb,
I pray you'll always see; the forest through the trees.
And this is what I wish for you,
And this is what I wish for you.

If I could I'd say the word and take your fears away,
And I'd stay right by your side and show the way you should take.
But this your life, this is your story, and we know this, go ahead and say,
I hope you live with no regrets.

I wish you ocean breeze, and rivers that can bring you everything you dream,
I wish that the air you breathe, is all that you'll ever need.
And I wish you nights of love, and days of joy and shoulders when you cry,
And just enough hellos, to get you through, goodbye,
And this is what I wish for you.

I pray one day you'll have a home, with arms stood open wide,
And you'll have someone who loves you, always by your side,
And if you lose your will to try, I wish you wings to fly.
I wish you wings to fly.

I wish you everything you need.

Always holding onto the past
I built these walls around me, but somehow you have found me
Now I know a joy that will last
And in this love you gave amazing grace
And healed my broken soul
And from your mighty throne you held me close
Made this wounded whole

You could write a note across the sky
And make heaven testify cause you are awesome
And you could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing your praise
So I wonder how an extraordinary God
Could love an ordinary me
I'll never understand it, how your love has set me free

How can the King of Glory care so much about me?
That You would choose to give up Your life
With every changing season, You love me without reason
Everything I have You provide
I fall on my knees and give you praise, I worship You alone
You are the only God, the highest power,
I live to make You known

You could write a note across the sky
And make heaven testify cause You are awesome
And You could make the mountains shout Your name
While the angels sing your praise
So I wonder how an extraordinary God
Could love an ordinary me

And though I don't deserve
This gift of mercy and abounding grace
You blessed me with it anyway
I'm not ashamed to tell the world about Ya
That You're more than enough for an ordinary girl like me

Of the darkest day,
Christ on the road to Calvary.
Tried by sinful men,
Torn and beaten, then
Nailed to a cross of wood.

[Chorus]
This, the power of the cross,
Christ became sin for us
Took the blame, bore the wrath
We stand forgiven at the cross.

Oh, to see the pain
Written on Your face,
Bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Every bitter thought,
Every evil deed
Crowning Your bloodstained brow.

Now the daylight flees
Now the ground beneath
Quakes as its Maker bows His head.
Curtain torn in two,
Dead are raised to life,
""Finished!"" the victory cry.

Oh, to see my name
Written in the wounds,
For through Your suffering I am free.
Death is crushed to death
Life is mine to live,
Won through Your selfless love.

Heather Headley,"I have always been a fan of Commissioned, and this song, has long been one of my favorites. 
So, when we started the project, it was the first cover we thought of and worked on. 
It's also such a great view of our ""prodigal son/daughter"" relationship with Christ.

How can you forgive me when I've often gone astray
How can you think of me when I do things my way
Turning my back from you
The one who loved me first
Having my own desires
Renewing worldly thirst

You told me you loved me and I should make up my mind
You tell me come back now, but I keep wasting time
Feeling so very weak you say I can be strong
I feel I've gone too far you tell me to come home
You love me still
And I know this is real

[Chorus]
And I am running back to you
I see you're standing there for me
Your arms are opened wide
And I don't have to cry no more
You're standing there for me
And I am running back to you,
Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own.

You told me you could keep me, but I've turned it away
I failed you so much now I don't know what to say
Using the same excuse that I am just a man
You tell me you've been there and hold your nail scarred hands so I can see
Now I know I am free

[Chorus]

You're standing there for me and I am running back to you,
Why do I go away when I know I am no good when I'm on my own.

I have taken advantage of your love and grace
Forgive me Lord and take me home, take me home.
I'm running to you Jesus please take me home,
You see I'm tired of pain and I don't like fear but Lord I want to be more sincere.
And I am running back to you
I see you're standing there for me
Your arms are opened wide

I am not perfect

Means I've pledged my life
Gave Him everything
And just to think 
He loves someone like me

Somebody paid the price for me
I offered up my life to Him

I am not perfect

We'll walk this road together
Take it day by day
By faith I know we'll make this journey's end
Make no mistake about it

So offer up your life to Him
Accept this gift and we'll begin
To walk together

While we yet in our transgressions
Jesus He died for you and me
So offer up your life to Him
Accept His love, and then begin

It sure would be nice for me to go back home
Where there’s love and affection.
And maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me the time I need in my life to grow up.
Time, be my friend, help me start again.

Suddenly the world’s gonna change its face
But still I, I’ll know where I’m going.

And yet I, I’ve watched it growing.

You bring him home, back,
Bring him home, back,

I’m not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything’s okay.
I am only human, only human.
This girl needs more than occasional hugs
As I’m talking about love from you to me.
Uh, baby.

If you’re feeling the heart and you understand me,
Stop right where you want, everybody sing along.

I’m that kind of girl that could be so sane,
But you got to reach out and you got to be sweeter to me.

I’m not your superwoman, no
I’m not the kind of girl that you can let down
And think that everything’s okay.

And can you feel the love this night
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far

And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

Quisiera ser sincero
No sé qué voy a hacer
Decirle la verdad o no
Hay mucho que esconder

Qué habrá que esconder
No puedo comprender
Por qué no quieres ser quien debes ser

Heather Holley,"Can you hear it in my voice
Was it something I let slip
Does the whole world know
Isn't it obvious?

I'm the one who's in control
Now I'm acting like a fool
Do my feelings show?
Is my face aglow?
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Do you see my hands  they tremble
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes
Don't know how long
I can keep this inside
Isn't it obvious?

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?

Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart
Can you see it in my eyes
Every glance, every smile
Must give me away
And I feel so much I can't hide

That I don't know what I'm doing anymore
I'm feeling like a little girl
Caught up in emotions
I'm out of control
Isn't it obvious?",Obvious,2000
Heather Hunter,"[Chorus]
All night everyday
You can have it your way baby
All night everyday
I can give you whatchu need
All night everyday
Beats keep bumpin' 'round my way
All night everyday
Body needs my super cream

Get me paid, get sprayed, hang wit' homies that's made
Come through ya town, put it down like a parade
See I come from Detroit and it's all about Dylan
When I Black Jack five dollas stacked to the ceiling

In my V12 'Boomin' Words' straight from Hell
Blaze green all day, tell me what do ya smell
Bump the beat up in city heat, double-oh-7
East side I ride, AK-47

You can get a lap dance for less than 20 dollas
Playas in my city known for poppin' they collas
The styles that you runnin' 'round wit' is ours
You and them 'Shady' suckas is nothin' but cowards

Bang ya brains in the dirt, make ya go bezerk
If you rap wit' Emily, your ass gon' get murk
I'm the E to the S to the H-A-M
If I wasn't then why would I say I am

Pull a jack, sell a sack ''cause the babies need similac
You remember that rollin' in a Cadillac
You want to' battle rap, I swing the battle axe
Chop ya head off until Hailey go tattle that (da-da)

[Chorus]

All night everyday you can have it ya way
I gotta clock my pay from Detroit to LA
Ok, it's Heather Hunter not the 'Number 1 Stunna'
In the Collady Fair, fast as the Road Runna

The bitches they speak about, the freak of the week no doubt
Ya man was late for dinner ''cause he was eatin' me out
I get it on like that ''cause I was born like that
Ya man jacked off to my porn in fact

'Cause it's too hard to mack me
I be 'Cummin' on America' 'Action and Jack me' 
Cream on, Heather Hunter, twice as nice
Screw the right thing and watch the ice bling

So tell me how you want it, push or pull
2Pac was ridin' me on a mechanical bull
It's all I think about, when I be puffin' on a blunt
Plus I give head like a Shaolin Monk

[Chorus]

I used to pick up a pan 
My friend keep a CD in the van
People to win you can
NATAS back now, suckas don't slack now

No time to act now, me on the East Side
Rollin' the E ride, girls can come slide
Into the dark room, emotional heart room
Bass can bang-boom, X and mushrooms

Hotels paid for, freakin' in all the rooms
Girls, booties get live tonight, spread the lap dance
Why'all get high tonight, ladies in love
On my jock, and cry tonight, suckas say 'Why tonight'

Pick up the hotline, baby, you think ya fine
I'll putcha first if ya want to be the girl of mine
Wine and dine, puffin' chronic, crime
Move ya curse, grab ya purse

Heather Lauren,"I was a hum-drum person
Leading a life apart
When love flew in through my window wide
And quickened my hum-drum heart
Love flew in through my window
I was so happy then
But after love had stayed a little while
Love flew out again

What is this thing called love?
This funny thing called love?
Just who can solve its mystery?
Why should it make a fool of me?
I saw you there one wonderful day
You took my heart and threw my heart away
That's why I ask the Lawd up in Heaven above
What is this thing called love?

You gave me days of sunshine
You gave me nights of cheer
You made my life an enchanted dream

Somebody else came near you

And now I sit and wonder night and day

Than all them other ladies because
You gotta get a gimmick

Do something special
Anything special
Do something special

You're more than just a mimic
When you got a gimmick
Take a look how different we are

Twinkle while you shake it
If you wanna grind it
Wait till you refined it

If you wanna pump it
Pump it with a trumpet
Get yourself a gimmick

Heather Menzies,"There´s a sad sort of clanging from the clock in the hall
And the bells in the steeple too
And up in the nursery an absurd little bird
Is popping out to say ""cuckoo""

Cuckoo, cuckoo

Regretfully they tell us Cuckoo, cuckoo
But firmly they compel us Cuckoo, cuckoo
To say goodbye

Cuckoo!

To you

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good night
I hate to go and leave this pretty sight

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu
Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu

So long, farewell, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
I´d like to stay and taste my first champagne

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
I leave and heave a sigh and say goodbye
Goodbye!
I´m glad to go, I cannot tell a lie
I flit, I float, I fleetly flee, I fly
The sun has gone to bed and so must I

So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye!","So Long, Farewell",1965
Heather Menzies,"The hills are alive with the sound of music
With songs they have sung for a thousand years
The hills fill my heart with the sound of music
My heart wants to sing every song it hears

My heart wants to beat like the wings of the birds
that rise from the lake to the trees
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies
from a church on a breeze
To laugh like a brook when it trips and falls over
stones on its way
To sing through the night like a lark who is learning to pray

I go to the hills when my heart is lonely
I know I will hear what I´ve heard before
My heart will be blessed with the sound of music
And I´ll sing once more",The Sound of Music,1965
Heather Menzies,"Edelweiss, edelweiss
Every morning you greet me

Small and white
Clean and bright
You look happy to meet me

Blossom of snow
May you bloom and grow
Bloom and grow forever

Edelweiss, edelweiss
Bless my home-land forever",Edelweiss,1990
Heather Menzies,"Let´s start at the very beginning
A very good place to start
When you read you begin with A-be-see
When you sing you begin with do-re-mi

Do-re-mi, do-re-mi
The first three notes just happen to be
Do-re-mi, do-re-mi

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
Let´s see if I can make it easy

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do (oh-oh-oh)

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do
So-do!

Now children, do-re-mi-fa-so and so on
are only the tools we use to build a song
Once you have these notes in your heads
you can sing a million different tunes by mixing them up
Like this

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re

Can you do that?

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re
So Do La Ti Do Re Do
So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Now, put it all together

So Do La Fa Mi Do Re, So Do La Ti Do Re Do

Good!

But it doesn´t mean anything

So we put in words
One word for every note
Like this

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything
Together!

When you know the notes to sing
You can sing most anything

Doe, a deer, a female deer
Ray, a drop of golden sun
Me, a name I call myself
Far, a long, long way to run
Sew, a needle pulling thread
La, a note to follow Sew
Tea, a drink with jam and bread
That will bring us back to Do

Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do
Do Ti La So Fa Mi Re

Do Mi Mi
Mi So So
Re Fa Fa
La Ti Ti

When you know the notes to sing

Heather Moran,"From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on

From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-de-doo songs
From this moment on

You've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone

Heather Morris,"It's the most wonderful time of the year.
With the kids jingle belling,
And everyone telling you,
""Be of good cheer,""
It's the most wonderful time of the year.

There'll be parties for hosting,
Marshmallows for toasting and
Caroling out in the snow.
There'll be scary ghost stories and
Tales of the glories of Christmases
Long, long ago.

It's the most wonderful time of the year.
There'll be much mistletoeing
And hearts will be glowing,
When loved ones are near.
It's the most wonderful time of the year",The Most Wonderful Day of the Year,2010
