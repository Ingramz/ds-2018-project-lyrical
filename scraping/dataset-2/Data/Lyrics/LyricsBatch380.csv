Imelda May,"I like a little bit of bad in a good, good man
A little bit of mad can be a whole lotta fun
When you get mean babe, your second to none
Outta 7 billion beings, you are my one
You got me good, yeah you got it going on
You do it for me, your the right amount of wrong

You have the edge on a world that's round
You are lost but don't wanna be found
You stand alone when your in a crowd
You don't dream but you scream out loud
You got me good, yeah you got it going on
You do it for me, your the right amount of wrong

A pinch of salt goes good with sweet
A hint of pain is great with a treat
Just like a cute dog baring it's teeth
I love a little strange and I dig a bit of a freak
You got me good, yeah you got it going on
You do it for me, your the right amount of wrong

Your bad is good and good you're not
Your wicked is great and your cool is hot
You got me good, yeah you got it going on
You do it for me, your the right amount of wrong

Yeah, you got me good, got me all the way
This girl could fall, could be led astray
Your kiss is soft but not too weak
You keep me on my toes then you sweep me off my feet
You got me good, yeah you got it going on
You do it for me, your the right amount of wrong

You got me good, yeah you got it going on
You do it for me, your the right amount of wrong",Right Amount of Wrong,2014
Imelda May,"You play your music when I try to sleep
You talk and talk when you're supposed to eat
You bite your finger nails, when you know it makes me mad
And you burst out laughing when you should be sad

You shout at TV and the radio
You swear at drivers driving way too slow
You leave your coffee cups until they're growing mould
And you rant and rave about reality shows

Yeah, you drive me honey honey round the bend
Yeah, you drive me honey honey round the bend
My be bop bunny bunny boy you send me right round the bend

You never put the pots and pans away
Don't listen to a damn word that I say
You snore, you smoke, you smell
Oh lord, you're going to hell but you do it anyway

Yeah, you drive me honey honey round the bend
Yeah, you drive me honey honey round the bend
My be bop bunny bunny boy you send me right round the bend

I wouldn't have it any other way
I love you though you're always on ebay
It's never ever dull, that's one thing I can say
So I bite my tongue and swallow words away

Yeah, you drive me honey honey round the bend
Yeah, you drive me honey honey round the bend

Imelda May,"We all got our marks to what or who we belong
Apart we are weak but together we're strong
Don't knock one of us or we all take offence
For a quiff or a crew we can jump to defence
With the drum that you bring or the song that you sing
Tribal, oh oh oh oh
Tribal, oh oh oh oh

Fashion is something that comes and goes
Fickle as fables of emperors clothes
What you put on tells a lot of your mind
If you're part of a pack or one of a kind
With the drum that you bring or the song that you sing
Tribal, oh oh oh oh
Tribal, oh oh oh oh

Standing in a crowd, I hold my head up proud
What's right for you for me it may be wrong
It's great to be different but have something to belong

When you look in the mirror, tell me what do you see
Someone new or your ancestry
You're a king, you're a queen, you're a wizard, a fool
Or if you're me then rockabilly rules
With the drum that you bring or the song that you sing
Tribal, oh oh oh oh",Tribal,2014
Imelda May,"Gotta get you alone
Gotta get you alone
Gotta get you all on your own
Gotta get you alone
Wanna give you my love
Wanna give you my love
'Cos all this talk is not enough
I wanna give you my love

Wanna have my wicked way with you
With no one else in view
Oh this fire in my heart so hot
That it's burnin', burnin' through
Is this sent from Heaven, Hell
Or a potion of the two
All I know is it's torture
I'm your pin doll, you're my voodoo

Wanna kiss your mouth
Wanna kiss your mouth
Oh I've watching how you pout
Wanna taste that mouth

Let me slip away
Let me slip away
Let me slip away, not a word to say
Just let me slip away

Wanna have my wicked way with you

Imelda May,"I knew a feral girl, once upon a time
She grew into a werewolf, that monster was all mine
She was incarcerated, to the inside of my skin
And then I sat and waited, for my nice life to begin

But th-th-there's a wild woman
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free

I tried and tried to tame her, but she fought me tooth and nail
I couldn't even train her, so I held onto her tail
I never should have fed her, didn't know how much she'd grow
I cannot keep her in Kirk
And I think she's gonna blow

Th-th-there's a wild woman
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free

Just a little bit of danger, and I break out in a sweat
I'm trying to contain her, but she's slippin' through the net

Th-th-there's a wild woman
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free
Th-th-there's a wild woman (yeah yeah)
Livin' inside of me
A wicked, wicked wild woman
Dyin' to be free",Wild Woman,2014
Imelda May,"Put it down then I pick it back up
Praying for your name to pop up
Telling me that your still in love
Still in love with me

No matter how hard I hope
No matter how much I want
No matter how bad I'm broke
You still don't

Call, call, call, call me
You've taken all the time you need
If our love, if our love, if our love, means anything
Baby please call, call, call, call me

Can't sleep I'm scared to dream
I'm remembering everything
That you said, that you said to me
When I was yours and you were mine and 
I didn't have to wait all night for you to

Imelda May,"Black tears
One will fall for every good year
Rolling down my face
Inside I'm dying
Outside I'm crying black tears

Your kiss killed me on that night
As your lips, left a bitter taste
And inside I'm dying
Outside I'm crying black tears

How did it all go wrong
We seemed to have it all
But it's broken
And I'm running
And I'm scared
So I pray to God above
It's a sin when we don't love
It's so quiet
Can you hear me
Are you there

Black tears
Please be gone so I can see clear
Keep calm and carry on
But inside I'm dying
Outside I'm crying black tears

How did it all go wrong
We seemed to have it all
But now it's broken
And I'm running
And I'm scared, so scared
So I pray to God above
'Cause it's a sin but we don't love
It's so quiet

Imelda May,"Went for a walk and what did I see
A pair of Louboutins looking back at me
I long to live in luxury
But I got a little baby, got a mouth to feed

Spending money like I have it
A bad habit spending money like I have it
Spending money like I have it
A bad habit spending money like I have it

Postman said hey what do you do?
I'm calling on you every afternoon
I said I got a little mouse, no face no hair

Yeah

My hands gets sweaty my knees go weak
My heart starts thumping-thumping extra beats
I know I'm being petty getting ready to pounce
But nothing beats a fifty-five percent discount

I went to the doctor to find the truth
Am I addicted to spending should I join a group
But doctor said girl to my surmise

Imelda May,"Once upon a time
A Dublin girl ran free
Down the cobblestones
Round pubs and homes
As rich as she could be
Swimming in the Irish Sea
Climbing up Bray Head
Her lips were warmed
With pots of tea
Chips and buttered bread
Fed love from Mam and Da

They raised her up
They made her fly
They gave her roots and wings
As time moves on and years go by
She'll miss those simple things
She's the girl I used to be

The playgrounds all came down
And we mourned our factories
Times were tough, but I had enough
I had my family
Life kicked in with all its might
But my strong heart wouldn't break
I got kicked around and broken down
I took all that I could take

But you raise me up
You made me fly
You gave me roots and wings
As time moves on and years go by
I miss those simple things
And the girl I used to be

Now I'm grown with a child of my own
And I hope to God on high
That these are the days she thinks upon
As the best days of her life

And I'll raise her up
I'll make her fly
I'll give her roots and wings
As time moves on and years go by

Imelda May,"Tried to resist you but I couldn't
Tried not to kiss you, knew I shouldn't
But I was weak for you
You got to me

Thought I was strong, oh how I was wrong
How bad can a good girl be?

Your breath on my neck as you thrilled me
A leg to caress nearly killed me
I was in need of you
You felt my need

Thought I was strong, oh how I was wrong
How bad can a good girl be?

An ancient voice escaped my mouth
And it screamed out a primal pleasure
My spirit soul, my animal
Came together in every measure
Of life, of love
Of flesh, of blood
Of you

May God forgive my indiscretion
But I gotta admit, you're my confession
I wanna peak with you, feel you in me

Imelda May,"I'm a fallen angel, don't wanna be somebody's saint
I've tarnished my halo and my specialty is to take
But I want you to think of me as better than the rest
I've chased away my demons but i'm human at my best

So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall
Off of this pedestal that I hope you've put me on

All that you ever want and I'll be the best of me

If you could just believe in me the way I believe in you
Your world would be just heavenly
With our words, we'd speak the truth
So lie down here beside me and we'll gaze up at the stars
Even they can fall sometimes, but they're perfect as they are

So come adore me, but know I'm gonna fall

I was walking alone
And I was trying to find what I wanted to do with my life
So I know why you need to find a reason inside
For all the arguing and fights

You never want to be living a lie
You don't want to become all the things you despise

You need to believe
And follow your dreams
Follow the path that will lead your heart
Then you can find
The answers inside
They will be told by the voice of your heart

If they don't understand what it means to you
You don?t wanna lose your self-respect
When the shadows are closing in on you
I know that you aren't beaten yet

(Follow the voice, from your heart)
(Follow your dream, from the heart)

You are never alone there's no reason to hide
There are others who see from your eyes
And if you believe, if you stay with your drive
You'll keep your dream alive

REPEAT bridge and chorus



",Voice of the Heart,2008
Imhoof,"There's a song that you can find
In every moment of your life
In every tear you've ever cried
In every painful last goodbye

So when the system breaks you down
Just listen to the sound

[Chorus]
What do I do when it's all been done
When the words have all been sung
And I've given up the best of me
Let the music play

When I'm hanging by a thread
And I've got nothing to give
Let the music play
Let the music play

There's no way to explain
Why life is filled with so much pain
But to the flowers that will grow
In the places it don't rain

So when the storms just beat you down
Well, listen to the sound

[Chorus]

When I'm hanging by a thread
And I've got nothing to give
Let the music play
Let the music play
Let the music play

Horace sings a distant song
Forgotten words that I once sung
Telling me to just keep holding on

I've never been more alone than here
I turn and face my darkest fear
I just got to keep on keeping on

And when it all comes crashing down
Listen to the sound

[Chorus]

When I'm hanging by a thread
And I've got nothing to give
Let the music play
Let the music play

Let the music play
Let the music play",Nightlight to Venus,2005

Algún presente que te agrade Señor,

Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.

Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling ""Yoo hoo""

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, let's go,
Let's look at the show.
We're riding in a wonderland of snow.

Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, it's grand

We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairy land.

We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.

I wish you were here

The weather is fine

And I wish you were here
Missing you is easy
It's all I can do

There's another trail of tears;
They all lead back to me.
So sad, so sad
The things we never had
So sad, so sad, so sad.
So hide your love and guard it well,
Curse that sweet disease.
Protect every fading truth.
Brave hearts may touch their dreams.
I will always be this way.
I cannot deceive.
When I turn to face myself
You're not not here with me.
So sad, so sad

When Forest Projects  used to be Godsville 

Brothers was wilin  others was cool 

Some hit the island  some smoked fools 

Me I chose the life of crime since day one 

13 years old  already trying to cop a gun 

I never understood why my pops would beat me 

No matter what I did, yo he'd still mistreat me 

That's why I never listened to a thing he said 

And I wasn't just mad when I used to wish him dead 

Instead, me and Ma Dukes kept tight 

Promised that one day everything would be alright

Puffing on a bone, breaking car glasses

It was over some broad who liked to auction off the ass

I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see

And told his plans to me, so
 
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Fly like an eagle through the sky
Makin more money than you can and I don't try
I'm on that level
That money makin rebel
Checkin for my pay no way
Can I settle for less than the best
When I make that purchase
And watch my material needs will surface
That's the only way I swang
Watch the way I do my thang
I can do anything
I want to do in my life
You, you know you like the way
I kick my game
I'm not ashamed to do my thing
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want

Watch me do my thing
I like to do my thing
Watch me do my thing
Everybody sing

Lady I'd do almost anything for you
Anything your heart desires
It's easy to fulfill your needs
Because you believe in me
Right now I feel so good inside
Doin' what I want

Tempting from inside

Come hysteric thoughts of pain, slowly I'm consumed
Into emptiness I fall
When my body's cold and dead, will the feeling be the same
Will my kingdom comfort me or reject my languid soul

Stagnant cooling blood
Starts to coagulate
My body weakens and sinks
As my soul discorporates

Resurrected from the souls of the damned, comes the fury of their dismay

Ungodly images unveiled to me, creations from below, my body rots within its grave
My soul now free to roam

I begin to seek what's been taunting me
My lifeless corpse no longer binding me

My incarnate life no more, my existence now deceased, now that I am gone I exist in misery. My unpleasant realization and my suffering begins, salvation never reached
And my kingdom never found.

I don't feel them in my heart

Drown your sorrows in prayer
But your prayers will never change the world
I separate myself
From those who chase the spirit
I can't fall to my knees
And pretend like all the rest
This is a soul that doesn't need saving

Their paradise not mine; an illusion I will not believe
Divine presence of perfection, turns sour in my gaze
Why should I feel compassion for the suffering of your God
For all the pain he allows,I give him what he deserves

In the name of the Father,
In the name of the Son
Where is the Holy Spirit, I feel nothing
As I stare upon the crucifix, I feel nothing for a God I never knew
I refuse to embrace, and live by his word

I take not of his blood

Or his forgiveness
I don't want his kingdom

The seducer of mankind

Our course is our own, I know we're to blame
We're born into shame, to live in despair
A flood of hatred surges inside
Control it, deny it...let it run free

I can't run away...I can't hide from myself
It is what I am...it is what we are
Look around and see...pathetic human beasts
We have written our own ending

How can we live with ourselves
Our jealousy, our tyranny
The lives we make, the lives we take
The fools we serve, the fools we are",Sinful Nature,2002
Immolation,"It feels like we're blind...It feels like we're dead
We'll never find our way...we'll never feel the light of day

Don't try to think...Don't try to live your own life
We have you for keeps...Our ways are sewn deep in your hearts and minds

The colours have faded...everything's black
Darkness around me...Darkness inside me

Your blood line stops here...We are your family now Prepare for the end...a new life awaits us beyond

Like a shadow over mankind
Towering over the light
Love for abuse, can't they see
Humanity struggles to be free

Are you willing to die for us
Are you willing to die with us

Strip us down to nothing and use us as you wish
Like little pawns you move around at your fingertips
We beg to serve and serve you well, you keep us in the dark
Hold us close and suffocate the souls you've led astray

The cycle's complete...the pieces for ruin are in place Our subjects are ready...to seal our date with infamy

Like a shadow over mankind
Towering over the light
Love for abuse, can't they see",Unholy Cult,2002
Immolation,"I am the one, leader of promise
Stalking lost souls
Rabid for the taste of faith

Pull you close to me, I will make you see
Spit my fears into your hearts
Feed your minds with my disease

I'll make them doubt themselves
I'll make you loathe yourself

I am the one...creature of moves
Sending my pack out into the world
Those loyal to me grow like a plague

They'll bow in praise of me, they will be slaves to me
I will bring them to their knees
Devoured soul by soul

I'll make them light for me
I'll make them die for me

You'll feed me your young and I take them with pride
I'll offer you some guilt and a lifetime of lies
Let me tease you with wonders and surround you with me
For I shall be your life, and your life shall be for me

I'm your world, I'm your light, I am all the answers you seek
You'll walk throughout your empty lives, but never challenge me
For I am god, I am every God, I'm whatever you wish of me
I'm the beast you've created, and I'm the beast you'll serve",Wolf Among the Flock,2002
Immolation,"Forward moving, never slowing
A soulless machine that hungers for victory
Tear through the soil, tear through the soul
Power in motion, daunting procession

Swift and cunning
Striking down the opposition
Stand and fight
Resist its might and be erased

Rolling forward, like thunder for glory
Seizing the day, seizing the night
All or nothing, and all it will take
Breathing its chaos over the land

Raining down
A storm of fire, intimidating
Its poison touches all
For generations to come

Cutting the throats and bleeding all hopes
Tireless and savage, preying on fear
Courting death, while trampling life
Exist for the battle, live for the war

And when it’s done
We’ll call it back to march again",Harnessing Ruin [CD-ROM Track],2005
Immolation,"Can you feel it coming?
Can you feel it closing in?
Looming all around us
A horror waiting to begin
Smell it in the air
A sense of havoc growing strong
The tides about to turn
Poised to take us down

And one by one we’ll fall, giants side by side
And one by one we’ll fall, the irony of our end

Rage of silence builds
A calm that’s so deceitful
We’re our own prey
Watching the night fall
We can not stop this
It pulls us under
The tides now turning
Poised to strike us down

And one by one we’ll fall, we’ll slowly disappear
And one by one we’ll fall, our darkest day draws near

We had it in our hands; we thought we had the power
But control was an illusion that finally defied us
Took it all for granted, too little was too late
Finally catching up to us, grandeur has a heavy cost

Burn the world around us, incinerate the skies
Fading into nothing, but what did we expect?
Now the final fury of our final hopes
In awe of what we’ve done, so beautiful to watch",At Mourning's Twilight [DVD],2007

Immortal Technique,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern, was making a million
Being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down, but every year she was sober
Her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He build a reputation 'cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities at other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto breed capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit, up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone till they die
Standing in front of them, starring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him, before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men, up in the cyph'
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offenses
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming shut the fuck up and stop moving around
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he had broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
A broken jaw mumbled for God but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back

Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
Cause he was starring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it
After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when your inflicted
And you'll be one of Gods children and fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever",Dance With the Devil,2001

One Enterprises, comprises the artist and the sound
The pen and paper plays my savior while I'm getting down
Pray for my nieghbors as a favor for holding me down
Slave for my papers as I savor the way that it pounds
It's underground, but the blatent vibrations widely found
Facing the nation complacent radio stations now
Stop hesitaing and contemplating the way we paitient
Start motivating and get them playin the shit we sayin
Ain't no delayin in this war that we gettin slayed in
Cause times a waistin while we stand adjacent to abrasions
They fouls are more than flagrant
And so I see the prisons cages while I pound the pavement
Looking for payment saying fuck enslavement
Usin the tools of old ancients
Announcing my engagment to this music that we making
Ain't no faking on tracks, and we ain't never come wack (never!)

Immortal Technique in the trenches with my nigga Akir
Our family surived the genocides so we can be here
And now we enterprise the aftermath, one in the same
Living the revolution 'till we catch one in the brain
And even then my spirit will return in heavenly form
And wipe the chess board clean, of my enemies pawns
The red don communist threat, burried and gone
So they invented a war, the government can carry on
It makes me wonder if the word of god is lost in the man
This is for the children of Iraq, lost in the sand
This is for the illest emcees that'll never be known
And this is for all the soldiers that'll never come home
I wrote this for Momia, stuck in a beast
For people who, march in the streets, and struggle for peace
For hood niggaz, born rugged, never rocking Versace
Eddie Ramierez's cousin George, and my old friend Sashi
Chris from the block, and all my niggaz stuck in a cell
Paul Wolfowitz, motherfucker I'll see you in hell
My destiny is to show the world, that the music is real
Go back in time and play this shit, for the slaves in the field
And for my children in the future, waiting to breathe
People slowly dying hanging on, waiting to leave
Believe when I'm gone, and this album's on a library shelf
I'll be one with god and one with you and everything else

[Hook]

[Immotal Technique talking]
Yeah..
Revolutionary Volume 2 has been brought to you
By the type of motherfuckers who ain't scared of shit
And if you playing this album, and I'm no longer here
And sometime far away from when I recorded this
Remember that history
Isn't the way the corperate controlled media made it look like
Read between the lines and free your mind
Revolution is the birth of equality
And the anti-thesis to oppression
But this is only built for real motherfuckers
So when I'm gone, don't let nobody I never got along with
Try to make songs kissing my ass, recycling my beats or my vocals
The shit is real over here man
Thank you for listening, and thank you for supporting independent Hip Hop
The heart and soul of our culture
Keeping the truth alive
Goodnight my people.. goodnight..

[Intro: from the film ""Scarface""]


Host: I've heard whispers about the financial support
your government receives from the drug industry.

Guest: Well, the irony of this, of course, is that
this money, which is in the billions, is coming from
your country. You see, you are the major purchaser of
our national product, which is of course cocaine.

Host: On one hand, you're saying the United States
government is spending millions of dollars to
eliminate the flow of drugs onto our streets. At the
same time, we are doing business with the very same
government that is flooding our streets with cocaine.

Guest: Mmm-hmm, si, si. Let me show you a few other
characters that are involved in this tragic comedy.

[Beat starts]

*Two Men Speak in Spanish*

[Immortal Technique - Worker]
I'm on the border of Bolivia, working for pennies
Treated like a slave, the coke fields have to be ready
The spirit of my people is starving, broken and sweaty
Dreaming about revolution (REVOLUTION!) looking at my machete
But the workload is too heavy to rise up in arms
And if I ran away, I know they'd probably murder my moms
So I pray to ""Heso Preisto"" when I go to the mission
Process the cocaine, paced and play my position

[Pumpkinhead - Cocaine Field Boss]
Ok, listen while I'm out there, just give me my product
Before we chop off ya hands for worker's misconduct
I got the power to shoot a copper, and not get charged
And it would be sad to see your family in front of a firing squad
So to feed your kids, I need these bricks
40 tons in total, let me test it, indeed I (*sniff*)
Shit, this is good, pass me a tissue
And don't worry about them, I paid off the officials

[Diabolic - Peruvian Leader]
Yo, it don't come as a challenge, I'm the son of some of the foulest
Elected by my people...the only one on the ballot
Born and bred to consult with feds, I laugh at fate
And assassinate my predecessor to have his place
In a third-world fashion state, lock the nation
With 90% of the wealth in 10% of the population
The Central Intelligence Agency takes weight faithfully
The finest type of China white and cocaine you'll see

[Tonedeff - American Drug Distributor]
Honey I'm home, nevermind why our bank account's suddenly grown
It's funny, we're so out of this debt from this money we owe
Woulda ya...mind if I told you I had two governments overthrown
To keep our son enrolled in a private school, and to keep ya tummy swollen
c'mon, our fuckin' home was built on the foundation of bloody throats
The hungry stolen of they souls, of course this country's runnin' coke
I took a stunted oath to hush the one's who know
But CIA conducts the flow of these young hustlers who lust for dough

[Poison Pen - Drug Dealer]
I don't work in the hood (Hit my connect)
Plus what's really good, they supply for the hood
These dudes fucking crack me up, scrutinize like we inferior
Petrified when we meet in my area (calm down)
My dude's'll shoot until I say so, got the loot? 
Give me the YAY YAY like Ice Cube, so don't play with my llello
We won't stop for you bastards
Must choose (?), chop it and bag it

[Loucipher - Undercover Police Officer]
Taking pictures and tapping phones 
Debating snitches and cracking codes
Past a couple, blast the fo', 
Want any hustler stacking dough with probably crack the blow
And my overtime is where your taxes go
I gain your trust
Get you to hand weight to us because we paid up front
On the low with cameras taping ya
Getting pop away? The prison sentence is going to
Make the officer leave with two ki's out the evidence room

[C-Rayz Walz - Prison Inmate]
Out the evidence room (*Said with Loucipher*)
Went my fame, truck, boat or plane, they watching you
You think you got work? They copping too
We control blocks, they lock countries
Ya own companies, we had nice cars and sneaker money
Now there's players out there, talking 'bout the holding
With bugs in they house like they down South with windows open
Your dough ain't long, you wrong, you take shorts and (?)
Feds will be up in your mouth...like forks and spoons
So enjoy the rush, live plush off Coke bread
Soon you'll be in a cell with me, like Jenny Lopez
In school, I was a bully, now life is fully a joke
I keep a flow on a boat for Peruvian Coke
Players do favors for governers and tax makers
Fat Quakers smoke crack and sex acts with bad mayors
The walls got ears, you big mouths probably scared
Not prepared to do years like Javier

[Immortal Technique Speaking] 
The story just told is an example of the path that
drugs take on their way to every neighborhood, in
every state of this country. It's a lot deeper than
the niggas on your block. So when they point the
finger at you, brother men, this is what you've got to tell them:

[Wesley Snipes - from ""New Jack City""]
I'm not guilty. YOU'RE the one that's guilty. The
lawmakers, the politicians, the Columbian drug lords,
all you who lobby against making drugs legal. Just
like you did with alcohol during the prohibition.
You're the one who's guilty. I mean, c'mon, let's kick
the ballistics here: Ain't no Uzi's made in Harlem.
Not one of us in here owns a poppy field. This thing
is bigger than (Immortal Technique). This is big
business. This is the American way.",Peruvian Cocaine,2003

",Revolutionary (Intro),2003
Immortal Technique,"Yeah... It's that real this time around
Immortal Technique... Revolutionary Vol. 2
It's on now mother fucker
Lock and load!

This is the point of no return I could never go back
Life without parole up state shackled and trapped
Living in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack
But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped
I've gone too far, there ain't no coming back for me
Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-be
Just like the Spanish exterminating Tynos
Raping the black and Indian women, creating Latinos
Mother fuckers made me out of self righteous hatred
And you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix
A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow
Lethal injection strapped down ready to go
Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace
Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets
Nat Turner with the sickle pitch fork and ma chatte
The end of the world, mother fucker you not ready
This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it
Malcolm little running up before Elijah Muhammad
The commedent killed the dinosaurs, changing the earth
They love to criticize they always say I change for the worse
Like prescription pills when you miss using them nigga
The temple of nights when they took Jerusalem nigga
And figured out what was buried under Solomon's temple
Al Aksa the name is no coincidental
I know too much to government is trying to murder me
No coming back like cutting your writs open vertically
How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country
Genetic engineered sickness spread amongst me
My people are so hungry that they attack without reason
Like a fuckin' dog ripping off the hand that feeds him
Immortal Technique is treason to the patriot act
So come and get me mother fucker cause I'm not coming back

This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before
'Cause the place I'm from doesn't exist anymore

This is the point of no return nigga you better believe this
Mary Magdalen giving birth to the children of Jesus
The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic
Human beings killing monkeys to conquer the planet
The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia
Machine gunnin' your body with depleted uranium
This is the age of micro chips and titanium
The dark side of the moon and contact with aliens
I started out like Australians, criminal minded
Broke into hell, tore it down, and built and city behind it
South Paul, murderous, methodology nigga
Remember that I'm just a man don't follow me nigga
'Cause once you past the point you can never go home
You've got to face the possibility of dying alone
So tell me mother fucker, how could you die for the throne?
When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own
It rains acid, one day the earth will cry from a stone
And you'll be lookin' at the world livin' inside of a dome
Comperized humanity living inside of a clone
This is the place where the unknown is living and real
Worm went to planet X and the seventh seal
Universal truth is not measure in mass appeal
This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky
Cause almost everything that I was always ever told was a lie

This is the point from which I could never return
And if I back down now then forever I burn
This is the point from which I could never retreat
'Cause If I turn back now there can never be peace
This is the point from which I will die and succeed
Living the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed
From now on it can never be the same as before

Third world mother fuckers!

I'm from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth
Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed
From where police brutality's not half as nice
And makes the hood in America look like paradise

Compared to the AIDS-infested Caribbean slum
African streets where the passport's an a American gun
From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet
And spend the next 25 years tryin' to deny it

I'm from where they cut your hands off if you make a fist
And niggas throw 'coca cause the job market doesn't exist
Except slave labor modern day company store
And peace keeper's don't ever, ever come here no more

From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam
Kill us children born deformed eight months before they born
I'm from where they lost the true meaning of the Qur'an
'Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam

And niggas know that, but throw that poppy seed anyway
'Cause that food dropped parachute does not come everyday
I'm from where people pray to the gods of their conquerors and practically
Every presidential a money launderer

From where the only place democracy is acceptable
Is if America candidate is electable
And they might even have a black president, but he's useless
'Cause he does not control the economy stupid!

Lock and load your gun, where I'm from, the Third World son
Been to many places but I'm Third world-born
Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from: the Third World son
You polluted everything, and now the Third World's gone
The waters poisoned where I'm from son
Seven hundred children die by the end 'this song
Revolution will come, where I'm from: the Third World son
Constant occupation, leaves the Third World torn

I'm from where the catholic churches are some racist shit
They helped Europe and America rape this bitch
They pray to white Spaniard Jesus, who's face is this
But never talk about the black Pope Gelasius

I'm from where Soviet weapons still decide elections
Military is like the Mafia, you pay for protection
Catamite, sex tours, is what the country sells
And rich white businessmen make the best clientèle

I'm from where they too pussy to come film Survivor
And they murder Coca-Cola union organizers
I'm from where the justice system esta podrido
Fuck government niggas, politic over perico

(Spanish)

Cause Rico laws don't apply to the CIA
And mother fuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day
I'm from where they overthrow democratic leaders
Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers

From where blacks, indigenous peoples and Asians, were once
Slaves of the Caucasians and it's amazing how they trained them
To be racist against themselves in a place they were raised in
And you kept us caged in

Destroyed our culture and said that you civilized us
Raped our woman and when we were born you despised us
Gentrified us, agent provocateur divide us
And crucified every revolutionary messiah

So I'm a start a global riot
That not even your fake
Anti-communist dictators can keep quiet
Fuck your charity medicine, try to murder me
The immunizations you gave us were full of mercury

So now I see the Third World like the rap game soldier
Nationalize the industry and take it over!

Cuz the death of my (? )is a good constitution

Biohazard labs instead of storerooms
What's next motherfucker projects as dorm rooms
You ain't fooling nobody in this community dude

The Savior is a metaphor for how we set it off

I didn't write this to talk shit, I say it because
Some of y'all forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution, music and artisans
But the movement was still fucked up like Parkinson's
'Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people out of the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
W.E.B. Du Bois verses Marcus Garvey
And we ended up selling out to everybody
The Dutch soldiers and the John Gotti's
Bankers ? modern day gangsters, a mobile army
They want to move us all out the NYC

I'll leave niggaz traumatized like they momma died
And they was responsible for the driveby homicide

Immortal Technique,"[Repeated in background]
(Open your eyes before you die)

We're here because of you
We're here because you were there
We've arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation
To seek the fulfillment of a promise of America
We were promised a better life in our home countries, 
where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently
Instead the quality remained almost the same 
and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury

Some corporations are more efficient than government, 
but their motivation is not the health or the well being of the people, 
it's only about profit, everything else, their image, 
their human resources, their public relations, 
only exist to protect the reality behind it
Once upon a time, we were told that nationalization would prevent growth 
by limiting competition, 
that our countries were nothing without the companies 
that invested in us and so they privatized everything, 
everything in our country was owned by people 
that had no connection to our culture, 
by those who never had our interests at heart, 
they didn't care about our survival or well being, 
they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land, 
by exploiting our people, our industry and our resources
They took everything we built and made it theirs, 
first by creating racism to justify slavery, 
building the capital for capitalism 
and then when they gave us what they call liberty, 
everything we had was still owned by them, 
our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy 
and that we would have freedom, 
but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom
The freedom to take all the wealth generated 
by our work and our land 
and give us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table
Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God

(Open your eyes before you die)
And while some used missionaries and donations to off set this abuse, 
other countries and companies were blatent with their crimes, 
using war, disease and sanctions that killed millions, 
they supported corrupt governments 
that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people, 
because their loyalty was to those who enable them, 
enstored them and kept them in power, 
they became the bastard children of American industry, 
kleptocracy, government's of thievery, 
they protected the corporations 
and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits
The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars 
to fund civil wars, right wing death squads, 
execute political dissidents, sympathetic clergy 
and even overthrow democratically elected governments 
and so the age of revolution began again, 
they painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the market
But the free market has never been free, 
because the market does not regulate itself, 
it is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image, 
destroy the image and the enemy will die
Such is the same in the rap industry, 
but the major label super powers treat the underground like the 3rd world, 
when they need new assets, 
new honest to prostitute a side and put on a shelf to use their songs
When they needed new concepts, music and publishing to steal from the producers, 
they came to the underground, to the 3rd world, they took our culture, 
our property and our industry and our resources, 
even using our own people to help them exploit us
But behind the mask of efficiency, 
they claimed that we need to succeed, 
they're no better than us, they're economic advertising was always a lie, 
a few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth, 
almost as if it was designed for failure
Opportunity comes at the price of soul and the music, 
so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture, 
glittering rented jewelery, the cars, the IMF loans, 
the seeds with suicide genes, 20 year contracts and oil bloody money
Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters, 
they'll stop at nothing to get what they want, 
they paint the 3rd world, underground, as savage and backward, 
but the super powers are no less corrupt, 
they've just learned to disguise it better, 
cause they fix elections too, they embessle tax money, 
they go to war for resources, they fund terrorism for their own benefit, 
and when there's enough at stake, 
history's taught us that they'll even assassinate their own president.

While BET gets screwed by Viacom
The new revolutionary is shyaman
It's not brush fire rap, it's five alarm
Motivational music after I am gone
My inner visions, mysticism call me Mr. Wisdom
They wanna turn the globe into a prison
And being sick is better than being dead
'Cause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds
Cloned chickens walking around without heads
The food is contaminated, the water got lead in it
Population control, make the babies sick
All these 5G chips, are you for 86?
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And we are on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime

[Chorus]

Alhamdulillah's a spiritual calling
My alternate and we are still mourning
It's not a documentary about global warming
This is lunar explosions of global warning
So when the moon leaves you can't tell night from morning
Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans
It's not your average rap recording
this is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons
While the American dream remains dead and dormant
My stimuli's supplied by my endorphins
The mind's eye greater than pi and broadband
I break on through to the other side without doormen
It's not The Doors, man
I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins
With more keys to open more doors than four foremen
To executive's rooms where they walking on all fours man
Canines standing upright amongst you
Hated by swine, spreading the H1N1 flu
On some rabies shit, are you for 86?
Population control, make the babies sick
This is a war against consciousness
Controlling your soul, sort of a psychological dictatorship
And I am on the front lines
Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime

Imogen Heap,"This is an obsession, 
A kind of aggression with himself 
It's the way he'll always be
He loves to rebel 
To go against his ten commandments
For him, that's just being free

And he always will, 
Get his thrills, 
The only way he knows how
Well it might make you frown
But he just loves, 
Being that dove, 
Roaming where he cares to go
To a state of mind 
Which no one knows 

[Chorus]
Over there stands my angry angel 
And he's shaking his head, 
In disgrace with me
Over there stands my angry angel
And he's frowning like hell, 
But I'm not feeling guilty 

Over and over again, 
More and more for the pain
To release himself, from this shell
Time after time, you may glare at
Him for the way he looks like something 
Drawn up from hell 

But that's just his cover
From what is under it
All his imagination, 
His passion for a creation 
Which he has discovered, 
Uncovered a world, 
Of amazing sensations
His own little nation

Always tense and filled with rage
Above the concrete fields below

Traded in my lino for a pad and a biro
Used to stand in line just so as I could sign my giro
But now my ends meet in the best way that I know
(Hat, snare, kick) and the beats that go boom
See the music I consume to escape the doom and gloom
All the beats and melodies keep realities at bay
But what happens when the records done and starts to fade away""

Alone within myself again
I try to veil away my pain
The dirty grey surrounding me 'round
And now I hear no sound

As i wonder how i keep from going under
I got trouble on my mind like my name is chuck d
And like Marvin Gaye it makes me wanna holler
When the music hits me I feel no pain
That's why i gotta put you on again and again
I take the needle off the technics and put it in my vein
All my troubles get crushed as the rush hits my brain
And away goes trouble down the drain""

Are just some of the things I like
So the more that I see of them in my day
The better I sleep at night

Mum, dad, Giles, (Lizzie) and Juliet (Uncle James)
Are just some of the people that I love
So the more of all them I can get in my day
The better I'll sleep at night

I can moonwalk, build castles, play ping pong, talk to animals,
Hold my breath for a really long time, and tell the future
Are just six of the things I can do
And the more I can fit of these things in my day
The better I sleep at night
Ahh, the better I sleep at night

Composer or maybe an astronaut
This is what I'm gonna be when I grow up
I know 'cause I sing out all through the day
I fly through space by night
The teasing, the fighting, the hospitals
I don't wanna go anymore
I put a brave face on, battle through the day
But I might cry myself to sleep (Sleep)

Pinch, pinch, punch, punch
Dancing 'round the car park after lunch
Copy cats, gold stars, cola cubes for good marks
Shy type, show off
Your mom's got her masters, so what?
Swap stickers, best friends, knight rider
Whatcha tell the time again
Popular, blonde hair, all the pretty girls sit over there
Sister's in school, he's cool, our brother knows karate

What do I do to make you hate me so much?
Is it the clothes I wear? (The way I speak?)
Wonder bra thrown 'round the German classroom
Me wouldn't understand
I'll never live it down
Hiding in the bushes
Or tip-toeing down the corridor
Stop it, you'll make me laugh
(Why would I ever need to know this?)
And somehow I'll get through
I never want this to end
This night, this music, with you in my arms
Switch in to the real world
No idea what I'm doing
But here it goes (there she goes)

I've found the place, feels like home
But I caught you kissing her
So suddenly I'm on my own
There's just not enough hours in the day
Things are going great, I can't complain
When I stumble to bed, I sleep like a baby
Finding my feet
Make love, make money, make a difference
Finding my feet
Connect (connect)
Finding my feet
Make money, make a difference
How d'you do that again?
Connect (Connect together)

I find myself gazing out of the window for no reason
When did I stop eating bread, and cheese? I love cheese
I want to have children,
But I don't want to have children, you know?
Something nibbling, a feeling I can't quite explain (A question)
Online, offline, like I'm not really here (A choir)
Awake or sleeping, somehow can't tell the difference (A question)
Bright light outside, dark deep down within

It's a cover up, it was a cover up operation all along
Honing in, I'm honing in on the heart of it all
Toughen up, I've got to toughen up

What's at the heart of it all?

I watch you come and go
I know you can hear my voice
Don't walk away
Come daydream with me
In closed loops and future-proof cardboard to caviar
Let's show them how good we are
If you look after me, I'll look after you

Seeking privacy for their forbidden
I am their defenseless host
Through my open wounds they let themselves in
Sheltered (sheltered), they mock me (they mock me)

If you stand up for me, I'll stand up for you

I'm weather-beaten in a losing battle punctured by nature, becoming organic
The air in here ages me, ungracefully!

Oh, my crumbling heart!
If you'll be good to me,
I'll be good to you

Oh, safe in the ache of soul-decay!
'Cause I will remember you
Will you (Remember me?)

Bespoke to broken, this interwoven tapestry of tragedy,
Crooked frames and cracked glazing
Slithers of wistful window gazes glint in borrowed light

Where doorways with no door stage a ballet of leaves,
Who pirouette in the footsteps of once glorious days

By peeling paint, I'm a sunken ceiling,
I'm cracking up, and can seem threatening

I'm falling apart

I'm scary at night
Take dark, forbidden
Keep out, keep out!
No, no, no go forth

A has-been, a once was, the leftovers, an eyesore, bleeding, oxidising,
A few remaining, unloved, emotionally damaged, a waste of space,
A nuisance, I haven't had time to become, unwanted!

You won't live through the night

My eyes are blind, I won't survive

Years ago my life was torment
In the shadows I wait for my moment
To take your life, to make you pay
Under the cold moon you lay

I care not for the emptiness inside
For in the end of this night
It will be gone, I will be whole
Your blood to mend my broken soul

As day turned to night,
I saw the end approaching
No hope for us, but yet our faith stays strong
No blade to take my life, no pain to make me suffer
This was the end and yet our faith stays strong

I won't live through the night.

I won't live through another night!",Shadowsouls,2004

Märk hur vår skugga, märk Movitz mon frère

Hur guld och purpur I skoveln, den där
Byts till grus och klutar
Vinkar Charon från sin brusande älv
Och tre gånger sen dödgrävaren själv
Mer do din druva ej kryster
Därföre, Movitz, kom hjälp mig och välv
Gravsten (gravvård) över vår syster
Lillklockan klämtar till storklockans dön
Lövad står kantorn I porten
Och vid de skrålande gossarnas bön
Helgar denna orten
Vägen upp till templets griftprydda stad
Trampas mellan rosors gulnade blad
Multnade plankor och bårar
Till dess den långa och svartklädda rad
Djupt sig bugar med tårar
Så gick till vila från slagsmål och bal
Grälmakar Lövberg din maka
Där, ditåt gräset långhalsig och smal
Hon än glor tillbaka
Hon från Dantobommen skildes idag
Och med henne alla lustiga lag
Vem skall nu flaskan befalla
Torstig var hon och uttorstig är jag
Vi är torstiga alla

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Days when the rains came ?
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and a-sliding
All along the waterfall
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown!
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium
With you, my brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Laying in the green grass
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee dah dee
Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la
Dee dah la dee dah la dee dah la

In Control,"You're yet another kid who started goin to these shows 
Thought you'd remain but what did you know? 
You bought the records and bought the image 
But you didn't even last for a couple of years 
Thought you'd stay true but you were never right 
What the fuck were you thinking saying you'd be committed for life 
Had a grasp on everything? 
Well guess what you were never important to the fuckin scene 
That's right!..Yeah, we're talking about you 

And it hurts so bad 'cause you know its true 
Waved your flag like you knew what it meant 
But you couldn't stick it ou and there you went 
But I guess its good there are people like you 
Who think how you think and do what you do 
Yesterday you were here and now you're gone 
You were just another head for me to stage dive on 
People like you will never learn 
You're always destined to crash and burn",Crash and Burn,2000
In Control,"I can't believe the things that we say 
I can't believe the things we fucking do 
Cause when it comes to matters of the heart 
No one should decide but you 
But still the laws are imposed on me 
As American becomes more hard to face 
Reached out for some compassion 
But couldn't find a trace 
History of hate that never ends 
This ignorance that we can't escape 
Threatened by what you don't understand 
Erase your bigotry, and start today 
I'll take your life before you take my rights 
True convictions stand the test of time 
When it comes to matters of the heart 
I bow for no one",Matters of the Heart,2001
In Control,"Through the years I've come to realize 
that there's always going to be someone better, 
quicker, fitter, smarter, stronger than me 
but when I look in the mirror at least 
I can accept the person I see 
I'm not afraid to be me 
And even if I'm all alone 
and everyone turns their back and walks away 
I don't know if I'd feel any different than I do today 
but I get by",Not Afraid,2001
In Control,"Go ahead with your tough guy moves 
Because your immaturity is all you've proved 
Your hard style of dancing don't mean shit to me 
'cause a fake little kid is all I see 
You're a fucking joke 
In two years where will you be? 
Sit back and let the bandwagon decide 
This is your reality check 
Step back take a look in the mirror 
Wake up from your tough guy fantasy 
This isn't the first time we've had to say: 
""Give me some fucking reality""",Wake Up,2001
In Control,"Open your ears and listen to me 
As I talk about an idealistic hardcore scene 
No one has beef and nobody fights 
Inside everyone's a brother for the rest of the night 
A band who feels just like us on stage 
Sharing the same frustration and rage 
And in the pit kids fuck shit up 

But everyone's smiling there's no need to be tough 
Cause tonight everyone here is a brother 
We may not be the same but we respect one another 
Inside the doors everyone feels alive 
There are fingers in the air and mad stage dives 
There's a huge pile on for every song 

And everyone comes up front to sing along 
There's no such thing as a rock star anymore 
'cause this shit isn't glam rock its fuckin' hardcore 
You can escape your worries and be with your bros 
And we all share a feeling that no one else knows",It Can Happen,2001
In Control,"When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree,
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be.

And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me,
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.
Let it be, let it be,
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.",Let It Be,2001
In Control,"Been on this earth for a long time now and most would say we've evolved 
But as technology advances the old problems haven't been solved 
Some how we think we remain morally right but nothing is that pure 
Mankind's eyesight is too one tracked and our downfall is coming for sure 

But the thing that makes me lose respect in all of humanity 
Is the fact that we never learn from out own history 
How much longer can the earth sustain itself at this rate 
10 billion people in 2 thousand 10, am I the only one who sees our fate 
I don't think there is a chance in hell that people will try to turn this around 
If they do it will be too little too late while the walls are already crumbling down 

You see the problem lies within ourselves 
We don't give a fuck about anyone else 
Brought up selfish human beings 
Stricken by our own disease 

We don't see the way that others see 
We're not compassionate to what others choose to believe 
Threatened by everyone else who's a little bit different than ourselves 
This ""live for today"" ethic has fucked things up 

Its self centered, I've had enough 
Definitely the most selfish way to live 
'cause you take take take and never give 
But we will never change",Too Little Too Late,2001

Der auf dem Wasser so mÃ¼de lag
Die Luft erbrach sich fast vor Fruchtbarkeit
Und unsereins der hat schon lang nicht mehr
Sich in ein Weiberfell hineingewÃ¼hlt
Sie sang ihr schÃ¶nstes Lied so schwarz wie Teer
Bis die Nacht herunterfiel
Da lag sie da ohne ihr Kleid

Ich hieb Drei Zweige ab vom Strauch
Und legte sie dann auf ihren Bauch
Sie war so jung und alt genug
Und auch der Nabel war versteckt vom Haar
Und tief darunter lag der Muschelmund
Egal was ihr so von mir denkt
Sie hat mir nicht nur eine Nacht geschenkt
Leider schnell wie Schnee der zerrinnt

Zuletzt hat mich das Luder doch genarrt
Ohne ihre Mund, das Gras war hart

Mit einer Mondfrau paart vielleicht
Wird dann mein Herz die Schmerzen los
Und singt der Liebe bald ein neues Lied
Wie ein Netz die Muscheln aus der Tiefe zicht

Mit meinesgleichen

Nach Sternen greifend
Missachtend deren Glanz

Mein rasend Herz zur Faust geballt
Wird euch den Raubzug befehlen
Die klare Stimme zum Himmel schallt
Dem Schicksal das Glück zu stehlen

Ein altes Weib mir Lichter zeigt
Die ich schon immer haben wollt'
Beim Sturm des weißen Gipfels
Hab ich mein Kindsein gezeugt

Auf Knien den Wind ich anbete
Dass der Zauber nie verweht
Wenn betäubt daneben trete
Die Visionen in Erfullung gehen

In Extremo,"Es war einmal ein König an Land und Dingen reich
Der saß auf seinem Throne finster und bleich
Was er sinnt ist Schrecken, was er blickt ist Wut
Was er spricht ist Geißel, was er schreibt ist Blut

Einst zog zu diesem Schlosse ein edles Sängerpaar
Einer hat schwarze Locken, der andre ist grau von Haar
Der Graue sprach zum Jungen: ""Sei bereit mein Sohn,
Spiel die besten Lieder, stimm an den vollsten Ton!""

:Es regnet, es regnet Blut
Es regnet den Spielmannsfluch:

Es spielen die beiden Sänger I'm hohen Säulensaal
Auf dem Throne sitzt das Königspaar
Der König so prächtig wie blutiger Nordenschein
Die Königin so süß wie der Sonnenschein

Sie singen von Lenz, Liebe, Heiligkeit
Sie zerfloss in Wehmut, Lust war auch dabei
Ihr habt mein Volk geblendet, verlangt ihr nun mein Weib?
Der König schreit wütend, er bebt am ganzen Leib

Es regnet, es regnet Blut
Es regnet den Spielmannsfluch

Des Königs Schwert blitzend des Jünglings Brust durchdringt
Statt der goldnen Lieder nun ein Blutstrahl springt
Der Jüngling hat verröchelt in seines Meisters Arm
Dann schreit der Alte schaurig, der Marmorsaal zerspringt

do verfluchter Mörder, do Fluch des Spielmann Tun
Umsonst sei all dein Ringen, mit Blut befleckt dein Tun
Des Königs Namen meldet kein Lied, kein Heldenbuch
Versunken und vergessen - das ist des Spielmanns Fluch

Es regnet, es regnet Blut
Es regnet den Spielmannsfluch

With full speed at the next reef

Borrow your freedom from god
To make the short reprieve
Free of your doubts

Throws over board the pains of life

When reality caves in

Don't tell me,
Tell my ghost,
Cause I blame him
For all I don't want to know

I found secrets about life untold

Life's wrapped in a riddle,
Easier said than done,
Hate to play the victim,
Rather run and hide.



I found secrets about life untold,
Let them take me far away

Call back in place,
It easier to cope behind the curtain,
Wipe the worries away
No thought about consequence

Let them take me far away",Alias,2008

These walls drain my thoughts
Rooms with no sun,
I cant find my way out

It used to be my home
These days,far from my comfort zone
The life I live without control
Fear is taking hold

I should cross the line
Confront lives too blind

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how
To break the cycle that I'm in
And discover the living

I don't recognize my soul
Condemned to live in this black hole
Deep within time,
They crave warning signs

Hear a distant cry
Would you tell me how

Pharmaceutic evil.
Broken vows, bitten by a cottonmouth.

A helpless victim of the viper in back
How could this happen to you?
A choking body quickly turning so blue
Your life is under attack

In Hearts Wake ,"Open up your eyes because it's a long way down.
Wake up and turn this hatred around.
Racial insanity, trafficking of slaves.
These crimes you will take to your graves.
Your souls are like one another;
Your veins are similar in colour.
This land wasn't yours to keep,
So listen now and hear me speak:

The stars look down and witness.
Erase the spreading sickness.

You can't see it with your eyes because they are rolling back.
You're about to have a heart attack.
Human depravity, suffering and torture.
Co-existence maimed at the slaughter.
Your souls are like one another;
Your veins are similar in colour.
This land wasn't yours to keep.
Wake up fools from your ignorant sleep.

Erase the spreading sickness.
You're so far gone that you can't see
Your place in hell is guaranteed.

Separation now leaves you to sink and slowly drown.
Unmarked graves for those who have disgraced our name.
Devastate? Eradicate? The human race is the same in every way.

I stand tall, feet firmly planted on the solid ground.
Separation now leaves you to sink and slowly drown.

Separation will never advance us.
Discriminate, you will never rebuild trust.
We're born the same over time. Your open mind changed.
We're all brothers, so you need to look upon others in the same light.
Just 'cause you're white doesn't mean you can excuse this ignorant fight.
And the same if you're black no racist attack is justified.
Supremacy, just a lie.

Does it matter about the colour of skin?
Stop wasting your time.You're fighting a fight that you won't win.
Diminish this ignorance and get a grip. Settle in.
You're controlled by the hype, abusive and threatening
Towards another brother that wants to be here and fit in.
Grown up around mixed-race kids, we see no difference,
So why discriminate him? Hatred based on appearance.
You need to erase this spreading sickness.

Twilight keeps me here suspended, frozen still as time intended.
The path that binds must be, what is defining me.
So sing me back to sleep, wrap me in your memory.

I can't stop hearing these voices (these voices in my head).
They try to keep me wide awake and I just want to give in .
I can't stop hearing these voices (they never end).
When will they let me fall asleep?
Wake up.

The night is clever, capable of deceiving weather.
Nothing always has a meaning, if everything is always breathing.
The body is my temple, a golden fragile vessel.
So sing me back to sleep, wrap me in your memory.
The floor boards speak, the curtains start to breathe.
Stuck in a lucid dream, wake from this treachery.

I can't stop hearing these voices (these voices in my head).
They try to keep me wide awake and I just want to give in.

I don't know if I am alive in this horror.
I watch the chaos unfold in the eye of the storm.
I swim with snakes and I spiral through form.
In the end of the living, in the home of the dead, 
There is a world where the brave only dare to tread.
Thrown into cold the fear sets, the sun burns black.
Terror begins, there's no turning back.
Can you feel it seizing your spine?
Can you see it slowly turning you blind?
When will you seek and see the marvels around you?
Don't let yourself be the one in the way.
Realise that you're alive.
Surrender.
I watch the chaos unfold in the eye of the storm.
I swim with snakes and I spiral through form.
In the end of the living, in the home of the dead, 
There is a world where the brave only dare to tread.
This nightmare continues chasing your breath.
There's warfare within you embracing your death.
Can you feel it seizing your spine?
Can you see it slowly turning you blind?
Turning you blind.
I emerge attempting to define the indefinable.
Attempting to describe the indescribable.
Through hurricanes, only one thing remains I can hear singing on the air tonight.

In the Woods...,"If the earth was a willow
And you were one too
- would earth be weeping
So gentle and true?
If I was the garden
Whereas you could grow
-would you hand me your brAnches
And grant me your love?
In between the lines of your story-flowing through
The pages of a book so well prepared the
Words leave more than ashes from your pencil
When it speaks of tiny stories that happened
Through these years
I swear that your present reality-disillusioned
Obscurity? -will gently wipe away the tears
Of wasted seeds
How Can we go through this
- with wounded wing before we learned how to fly
How can I control desires
- when desires burns on a chilly autumn Night?
I will try and make you imagine;
The aura where they stand
Is filled with little secrets
- as written in the sand
Naked as a child at birth
A question in disguise
An oasis in a lonely desert
Where lonely unknown lands lie
From here and into infinity
- humble and timeless
Philosophy-you gently wept away the tears
Of wasted seeds
All the days that have left me
And the species I have seen
Ahead days will follow
- it was only a dream
Though my garden is growing
Under skies out of blue,
And it changes Each season
Both in colours and in truth
You should know that a willow
- a weeping bed's pillow-
Until all days are through
The rain that fall on your branches,
Just yearning for a source to feed it's primal need
Can make your beauty blossom from within
With flowers blowing in the wind-and in seasons to follow...

In the Woods...,"[Roger Waters, 1968]

Far, far, far away - way
People heard him say - say
I will find a way - way
There will come a day - day
Something will be done.

Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race
And at Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time - time
Time to be - be - be aware

Carter's father saw it there
And knew the Rhull revealed to him
The living soul Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye - eye
Something in the sky - sky
Waiting there for me

The outter lock rolled early back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in flowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

Oh - oh - did you ever know - know
No no never ever will they
I'll say!

Summoning his cosmic power
And then glowing from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed

Take me, pull me all around
Break me, I'm yours

In This Moment,"I've been driving through these nights
This road reminding me of all I am
As time drags on, these windows fade
Reality starts slipping from my mind
All I know is this all fades, the second that I'm by your side
Can this be real, can this be fate

Just say you'll be there for me
Please say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be my side
When the storm subsides

All these years beneath the skin
Everything inside me turning to the shame
I was lost, but now I can see
This fate is turning deep inside of me
All I know is this all fades, the second that I'm by your side
Can this be real, can this be fate

Just say that you'll be with me
Please say that you'll be there
Just say that you'll be my side
When the storm subsides

In my name shall they cast out demons
They shall speak in new tongues
They shall take up serpents
And if they drink any deadly poison
It shall in no wise hurt them
They shall lay hands on the sick
And they shall recover

And only handled
If the Holy Ghost
Of the Holy Spirit

No, you don't fool me
This hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows

In Tua Nua,"If you understand me now, well, here's a promise 
From every single piece of my body 
That though I've fallen at every corner 
I'll ask not for shelter or for charity 
For what you needed, I could not give you 
For all the love and money in this world 

All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would feel this way 
All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would see the day 

Just like my father I still love him 
But it's not easy, no not never 
Still it goes on, these roots run deep 
Beneath the lies that we speak 
Thick as thieves, us laughing up our sleeves 
Until we learn to steal from each other 

All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would feel this way 
All I wanted was to believe in somebody 
Never thought I would see the day 

Come on down, come on down into my kitchen 
I've got some stories, I've got some stories to tell

From every single piece of my body 
That though I've fallen at every corner 
I'll ask not for shelter or for charity

Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité
In letzter Stunde hängt deine Seele
Wie eine Spinne fest I'm Netz,
Nur I'm Mythos wird man zur Heldin,
Unvergeßlich bist do noch jetzt,
Aufstieg und Fall, Triumph und Verleumdung,
Rettung hat ohne Abgrund kein Sinn,
Blutiger Abstieg vom Thron zum Schafott,
Dein Spiel ist aus, Marie, Marie, Marie,
Marie, Marie, Marie,
Oh Marie Antoinette,
Marie, Marie, Marie,
Oh Marie Antoinette.

Ina Deter,"Jeden Tag Fleurop von mir,
Jeder Traum ein Film mit dir,
Jedes Telefon ist Zwang,
Jeder Brief liebt seitenlang.
Jeder Blick berührt die haut,
Jeden Kuß nur mit Sekt getraut,
Jedes Wort hält mich I'm Arm,
Jede Nacht trägt deinen Charme.
Mit Leidenschaft
Und alles geben,
Mit Leidenschaft
Will ich's erleben,
Mit Leidenschaft
An jedem Tag,
Krieg ich zurück
Was ich wag.
Jede Fahrt zu die ein Rausch,
Jede Million für dich I'm Tausch,
Jedes Warten endet nie,
Jedes mal krieg ich weiche Knie.
Jeden Tag Fleurop von mir,
Jeder Traum ein Film mit dir,

Ina Deter,"Augen, ist es wahr, so ein Blau
Tagträume, in die ich schau'
Liebe pur, die überfällt
Friedvoller Rausch, der lange hält
Alles Vertrauen bringst do mir
Ruhender Pol, explosiv in dir
Heilloses Sehnen nach Freiheit
Wahrer Mut, zur richtigen Zeit
Mit dir, kann mir
Mit dir kann mir alles passiern
Denn ich liebe es
Mich zu verliern
Jeder Faser, euphorisch erregt
Wildwarmer Sturm, der sich nie legt
Exzessiv, wie beim ersten Mal
Wir brauchen uns, perfekte Wahl
Letzte Ausfahrt auf Erden
Will ich verschlungen werden
Blind von deiner mystischen Kraft
Laß mich nicht in Frieden
Mit dir, kann mir
Mit dir kann mir alles passiern
Denn ich liebe es
Mich zu verliern

Wenn er sich aufführt wie der gibt’s mit den Frauen nur Theater.

Sie lautet wie jedes mal

Ja ich will
Dass du aufhörst damit
Mach mir bitte wenn es geht keinen Antrag mehr
Kein Fleurop-Kram mit keinem Liebeslied
Und keinem Teddybär
Ja ich will
Dass du aufhörst damit
Mach mir bitte wenn es geht keinen Antrag mehr
Kein Männerchor vor keiner Penthouse-Suite
In keinem Blumenmeer
Ja ich will

Vor allen Dingen bitte nicht mehr im Fernsehen für mich singen
Keine Tränen mehr bei Kai Pflaume
Das vermiest mir echt die Laune
Beim HSV nie mehr wirst du meine Frau
Und ""I Love Ina"" mit 'nem Herzrand auf der Stadion-LED-Wand
Kein Tisch beim Franzosen
Kein Kuss-Mund aus Rosen
Im Garten vor meiner Tür

Wenn ein Flugzeug mal wieder meinen Namen
In den Hamburger Himmel schreibt
Dann ist mir das so peinlich und denkst wahrscheinlich
Ich wär' soweit
Ja ich will

Mach mir bitte wenn es geht keinen Antrag mehr

Kurze Hosen aus Leder
Die Stiefel voll Dreck
Auge grün und blau
Wegen Klamottenklau

Hinterm Schützenhaus
Heimlich getroffen um Pläne zu schmieden
Jungs geküsst und geraucht
Froren uns den Arsch ab und träumten vom Süden

Unsere Sansibar
Das war Edeka
Und die Bushaltestelle
Das Tor zur Welt
Zu den Nachbarn gehen
Um mal Fern zu sehen
Großes Kino ganz ohne Geld

Ina Müller,"Ganz egal, wo wir uns trafen
Ob in Zügen oder Bars
Es war der letzte sichere Hafen
Hier bleiben wir, das wars
Wir malten Horizonte
In blauen, rauen Mengen
Um später doch vom Himmel
Die Geigen wieder abzuhängen

Bei jeder Liebe die wir machten, fielen wir wieder pubertär
Aus allen Wolken, weil wir dachten, dass es die letzte Liebe wär
Ein weiteres ""Für immer"" ins Leben eingeritzt
Wir hatten ja keinen Schimmer, dass nichts bleibt, wie es ist
Nichts bleibt, wie es ist

Bei jeder Liebe, die wir machten
Nahmen wir irgendetwas mit
Den wilden Kuss und wie wir lachten
Und diesen Spruch und unseren Hit
Ein Duft, der uns gleich anmacht
Egal, wer ihn grad trägt
Dieser Moment in einer Mondnacht
Der immer noch erregt

Und jede Liebe, die uns kränkte
Hat uns doch irgendwie stark gemacht
Weil sie uns größere Flügel schenkte
Für die nächste große Schlacht

Und die Letzte wird die Schönste

Doch das ist, so wie ich mich kenne
Noch zwei, drei Männer hin

Soft as stars in April skies are,
Tell me some day you'll fulfill
Their promise of a thrill.

Star eyes,
Flashing eyes in which my hopes rise,
Let me show you where my heart lies.
Let me prove that it adores
That loveliness of yours.

All my life I've felt
Content to stargaze at the skies.
Now I only want to to melt
The stardust in your eyes.

When if ever, will my lips know
If it's me for whom those eyes glow?
Makes no diff'rence where you are,
Your eyes still hold my wishing star,
Oh, star eyes, how lovely you are.",Star Eyes,2001

She tried to juke me in a figure-fo' leg lock (oh)
She said she like the way I stick and make the bed rock
or how I lick and leave her twisted like a dreadlock, and it's
on
So stop the sweating like a wristband
And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
Cause I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We putting holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggas with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yapping is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside
I'm a dentist making women open they mouth wide
You be in jail still running it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth right, but who
cares?

Coming to Shady Park is like a peep show
It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missing more than Shaq when shooting free throws
They packing and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stopping cars like a roadblock
They moving weight like Atlanta was moving boat rock
And catching ums like seeun Muslims eating pork chops, never happen
And meanwhile I been thinking man
Niggas been slanging tapes like they slanging 'caine
Cause in the hood its getting ugly like orangutan
So if you trying to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we trying to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yelling our fucking pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggas you think they dyked out, so
don't play

Hey, what can I say?  We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit

You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Ain't nothing nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like, 
hold up, god damn, I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is ticking me off like fifty metronome
I'm taking all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!

You better tell your bitch to follow you to safety

I've got the blues so bad
I can hardly catch my breath
The harder it rains
The worse it gets
This is the time
I'd love to be holding you tight
But I guess I'll just go crazy tonight",It's Raining,2011

Et que quelqu'un vous tende la main
Que votre chemin évite les bombes
Qu'il mène vers de calmes jardins
Tout le bonheur du monde

Puisque l'avenir vous appartient
Puisqu'on n'contrôle pas votre destin
Que votre envol est pour demain
Comme tout c'qu'on a à vous offrir
Ne saurait toujours vous suffire
Dans cette liberté à venir
Puisqu'on ne sera pas toujours là

Tant de rêves à vivre jusqu'au bout
Sûrement plein de joie au rendez-vous
Libres de faire vos propres choix
De choisir quelle sera votre voie
Et où celle-ci vous emmènera
J'espère juste que vous prendrez le temps
De profiter de chaque instant

On fait d'notre mieux, seulement parfois
J'ose espérer que c'la suffira
Pas à sauver votre insouciance
Mais à apaiser notre conscience
Aurais-je le droit de vous faire confiance?

Inaya Day,"She wears a long fur coat of mink
Even in the summer time
Everybody knows from the coy little wink
The girl's got a lot on her mind
She's got
Big thoughts
Big dreams
And a big brown Mercedes sedan
What I think this girl
She really wants is to be in love with a man

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much

She saw him standing in the section marked
""If you have to ask you can't afford it"" lingerie
She threw him bread
And said make me scream
In the dark what could he say
Boys with small talk and small minds
Really don't impress me in bed
She said I need a man's man baby
Diamonds and furs
Love would only conquer my head

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much

They made haste in the brown sedan
They drove to 55 Secret Street
They made love and by the seventh wave
She knew she had a problem
She thought real love is real scary
Money only pays the rent
Love is forever that's all your life
Love is heaven sent
It's glamorous

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much

She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
She don't need a man's touch
She wants to lead the Glamorous Life
Without love it ain't much, it ain't much",Glamorous Life [Mike Cruz Dub],

There's a party goin' on in my hotel room
And you're invited, all you got to do is show up x2

(Verse 1)
Now we done left the venue 'coz the show was done
Before we hit the hotel, make a quick run
To get the Martel to add to the fun, meet me at suite room 151
BYOB, we about to kick it off
Remember that party last year in the loft?
This'll be better 'coz we bigger now
Got mo' figures now, fit in mo' niggas now
I got about 30 of the finest
Ready to get flirty and down right do-dirty
We got twister the dots mean a lot
When you flip the dial end up with a face in your twot
Stop yappin' at the DJ, that ain't right
'Coz tonight this here DJ, he gon' save my life... (woah, woah)

[Chorus:]
(Verse 2)
Now the people are comin', and the party is jumpin'...
... and T is on the beat box
And after this song he'll rock the locks
Hotel security ain't troublin' us none
They partyin' with us, no badge and no gun
Grown folks in the livin' room showin' out
And they ain't leavin' till we kick 'em all out
Strip poker, truth or dare
I swear it's about to get sticky up in here
Back back and forth and forth
From New York to L.A and back to New York
Of course while I'm in town it's gotta be nice
On the North-East corner they're flippin' the dice
Now the bubbly's poppin' all over the suite
Swig on this and kick up your feet
Ain't no party like an MC Lyte party 'coz an MC Lyte party don't stop, pops
And this here's better than when the ball drops

[Chorus:]
(Verse 3)
Now here's the E-low, Jackie and Mark
Done hit the back room to jump start the sparks
It's gettin' all hot, now they pumpin' Beenie Man
Scream for the cream, but holler when you see me man
You know like I know, the party don't end till I say when
Now the grub is runnin' out better get it while you can
Pick is gettin' low better find you a man
Slow jam hit and you sittin' all alone
Ain't nobody gonna take you're borin' ass home
It wouldn't be fair for me to not tell you
I'm the hostess of the year, keep it in the clear
Yo, the party's over here, nope, the party's right here
Be careful not to wear and tear the derrier
Now ain't that supmthin', humpin' and a bumpin'
My motto is never let 'em see you comin'

That's why it only goes down once a year...

I know you wanna change me
I know you'd like to make me beg you please
Criticize and break me
Make me walk around on hands and knees
Try to comprehend me
We can still be friends see
I thought a lot about it
I have to move on outta here

I wanna be free, free completely
Living all by myself

I wanna be good, bad, happy, sad
Living all by myself

Know I don't wanna hate you
And I don't wanna cry myself to sleep
Or get a nervous breakdown
I thank you for my lose of self esteem
So try to understand me
I need to live my life free
Cried enough about it
I have to move on outta here

I wanna be free, free completely
Living all by myself

I wanna be good, bad, happy, sad
Living all by myself

Just Wanna be mine, mine only child
Living all by myself

I Wanna be easy, easy come and go
Living all by myself

I wanna be free, free completely
Living all by myself

I wanna be good, bad, happy, sad
Living all by myself

Just Wanna be mine, mine only child
Living all by myself

I Wanna be easy, easy come and go
Living all by myself

I wanna be free, free completely
Living all by myself
By myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
Just by myself
A little while like an only child by myself
Just free to be me completely by myself

Feel my heartbeat and for real friend of mine

A dream or reality enemies at my door
Eyes, I realize it's fantasize I must be high
So let me live before I die

To survive your life is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step by step and be versatile

Love peace and cash that's what it's all about

Inca Son,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence

""Fools"" said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you

To a word

All that we shared
Our inner treasures
Are used against each other as we fall

We could have known
That the road would end this way

What makes us give
Our hearts so freely
Only to find that we're strangers after all

Our difference will surely change in time

Something I read and manifested that's getting you down

Don't you dare come to bed with that ambiguous look in your eye

Say what you will
Say what you mean
You could never offend
Your dirty words come out clean

Tomorrow, what price will I pay?
Could I make it all up to you by serving coffee for two in bed?
Would you then gimme the time of day?

I need a map of your head
Translated into English
So I can learn not to make you frown
You'd feel better if you'd vent
