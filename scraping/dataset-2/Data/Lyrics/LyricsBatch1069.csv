Syd Lawrence,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,2003
Syd Lawrence,"When I hear that Serenade in blue
I'm somewhere in another world, alone with you
Sharing all the joys we used to know
Many moons ago

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade in Blue,2003
Syd Lawrence,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,2003
Syd Lawrence,"Pardon me boy, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?
Track twenty nine, boy you can gimme a shine
I can afford to board a Chattanooga Choo Choo
I've got my fare and just a trifle to spare
 
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer
Than to have your ham 'n' eggs in Carolina
 
When you hear the whistle blowin' eight to the bar
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far
Shovel all the coal in, gotta keep it rollin'
Woo, woo, Chattanooga, there you are
 
There's gonna be a certain party at the station
Satin and lace, I used to call funny face
She's gonna cry until I tell her that I'll never roam",Chattanooga Choo Choo,2004

Syd Lawrence,"Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

Syd Lawrence,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2004

Syd Straw,"People of earth sometimes you really get me down
People of earth, sometimes it's just astonishing
People of earth, sometimes you really get me down

Hey you at the bar, what you pay good money for?
Hey you at the bar, what do you even come here for?
You’ll never know what kind of a show you missed

Hey you in the blue van, why did you steal my parking place?
I know that you saw me waiting for it patiently
Now what did you do? Don’t forget the gold hand rule

Please don’t put me down
Please don’t put me down
Does it make you feel big to belittle me?
Please don’t put me down

Don’t kill me for my sneakers, find some shoes of your own
And don’t abuse our teachers
'cause we can learn this on our own, and people yer know
We’ve really got a lot to learn

Attention all shoppers, big, big savings today,
For our shoppers, if you’ve got the money to pay
Big savings in isle 6 today

People of earth, greed, greed, greed
People of earth, need, need, need
It’s not in my nature to sit
And watch you bleed, bleed, bleed

Please don’t put me down
Please don’t let me down
Be the first one on your clock to keep on walking top to top
Please don’t let me down

And what about the oceans? I’m afraid to eat the fish
I bet their scared to live there, look it’s glowing in my dish
What did the aquatic world ever do, to deserve all of this?

When will we ever learn that oil and water don’t mix
When I picture the world, I picture one better than this
Why do we keep fighting, baby?
Together we could live in bliss

People of earth, I really love you
And never would I put myself above you
People of earth, people of earth, people of earth
People of earth, people of earth, I really love you
I am one of you

",People of Earth,1996
Sydewynder,"So what I really ask is just a little room to breathe and she says no 
All I really ask for is a little bit of stop and she's all ""go"" 
So wherever I am going I just want you to know I'll be right here 
So wherever's water's muddy just know that it runs clear 

Sometimes going up with you 
Sometimes growing up with you 
Brings me down 

I can see the girl but I know she can't see very far 
All we are trapped in is a big wide open road with no car 
We're stalled out on the highway of broken hearts and dry tears 
I can't bring you close across the gap of all these years 

Sometimes going up with you 
Sometimes growing up with you 
Brings me down 

I ain't never been the way I feel the way you 
Bring me down 
I ain't never gone the way you ask me to you

I know you like the party, but the party never stops
well I know you
I know you
I know you

I know you want to be here so you just let go
and no one?s ever gonna tell you no
but I want to, cause I know you I know you

get your party on
get your party on

This is my last advice leave with me cause you could die tonight

the drugs you used as a place to hide, it?s really bad if you don?t get this right
(I got this, I got this, I got this I don?t need you)

You got kicked out of your mothers house
You stole money from her purse she finally found you out
You should be ashamed, (don't sit there judging me)
what a waste (you'd be the same if you could see, so lets have another drink)

And we'll party on, party on
get your party on
get your party on

February is still as scary, the month your father died
a little girl in a shrieking world, looking for her place
to run and hide

Well I know you like the party, but the party never stops
I know you like the party, but the party never stops
well I know you
I know you
I know you

But you party on, party on
get your party on
get your party on
give it one last time cause this is all you?ve got!

Sydney Chaplin,"I met a girl a wonderful girl
Who's really got a lot to recommend her for a girl
Fabulous creature without any doubt
Hey what am I getting so excited about
She's just a girl an everyday girl
And yet I guess she's really rather special for a girl
For once you've seen her the others are not
Hey what am I getting so excited about
But so what what has she got others have not
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those
But when she looks up at me what do I see
The most enchanting face my pulse begins to race
Hey I met a girl a marvelous girl
She rarer than uranium and fairer than a pearl
Found me a treasure and I want to shout
Hey what am I getting so excited about
But so what what has she got others have not
Two eyes two lips a nose all girls have some of those
But when she looks up at me what do I see

Long before I met you
I was sure I'd find you someday, somehow

Appear at a party at her mother's saloon; she invites nick and he accepts.

Nick:
I want to be seen, be seen with you,
With you on my arm,
To wear you like a charm,
Your glitter decorating my arm.
Now, natch'rally such proximity
Gives rumors a rise,
We'll let them analyze
What our amalgamation implies.
Oh yes,
The gossips will press,
So willing to stress
The seamy side--
Know what?
So what!

Fanny is on a tour with Ziegfeld's latest show.
They have dinner at a private dining room.
Fanny is annoyed that Nick hasn't been in
Touch for ten months. Nick orders, mainly
In French, which Fanny doesn't understand.
Fanny is uneasy that Nick might make
Advances in such an intimate room.
[Nick:]
You are woman, I am man,
You are smaller, so I can be taller than,
You are softer to the touch,

You are someone I've admired,
Still, our friendship
Leaves something to be desired.
Does it take more explanation than this?
You are woman, I am man--

Isn't this the height of nonchalance,
Furnishing a bed in restaurants?
Well, a bit of dinner never hurt,
But guess who is gonna be dessert?
Do good girls do just what mama says,
When mama's not around?
It's a feeling,
Oy vey, what a feeling.
[Nick:]
A bit of pate?
[Fanny:]
I drink it all day.
Should I do the things he'll tell me to?
In this pickle what would Nellie do?
In my soul I feel an inner lack,
Just suppose he wants his dinner back?
[Both:]
Does it take more explanation than this?
[Fanny:]
Just some dried-out toast in a sliver,
On the top a little chopped liver.
How many girls become a sinner
While waiting for a roast beef dinner?
Though most girls slip in ordinary ways
I got style--I do it bordelaise.
Well, at least he thinks I'm special
--He ordered a la carte.
It's a feeling I like feeling very . . .
I feel the feeling down to my toes.
Now I feel that there's a fire here,
Try that once a little higher, dear,
What a beast to ruin such a pearl,
Would a convent take a Jewish girl?

Does it take more explanation than this?

If I stop him now,
Can he sue me?

Hey, Mama, is it true what the say, that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, they talk all around town say that 
Papa had three outside children and another wife 
And that ain't right.
Heard them talkin' about Papa doing some storefront preachin'
Talkin' about saving your souls and all the time weak, dealin' in death
And stealin' in the name of the Lord
Mama just hung her head and said,
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Papa was a rollin' stone.
Wherever he laid his head was his home.
And when he died, all he left us was alone.""
 
Hey, Mama, I heard Papa call himself a jack of all trades.
Tell me, is that what sent Papa to an early grave?
Folks say Papa would beg; borrow or steal to pay his bills.
Hey, Mama, folks say Papa was never much on thinkin';
Spend most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'!
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth.

Sydney Davis,"Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart

Baby, baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
This time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(think it over) after I've been good to you ?
(think it over) after I've been sweet to you ?

Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over

I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
But this time before you leave my arms

Sydney Devine,"As I was slowly passing 
An orphan's home one day, 
I stopped for just a little while 
To watch the children play. 
Alone a boy was standing 
And when I asked him why, 
He turned with eyes that could not see 
And he began to cry. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child. 

No mummy's arms to hold me 
Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die. 
I'll walk the streets of heaven 
Where all blinds can see. 

And just like for the other kids 
It will be a home for me. 

I'm nobody's child, 
I'm nobody's child. 
Just like the flowers 
I'm growing wild. 
I got no mummy's kisses 
I got no daddy's smile. 
Nobody wants me, 
I'm nobody's child.",Nobody's Child,1995
Sydney Devine,"Way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie
We laid rubber on the Georgie asphalt
We got a little crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a Friday night

Talking 'bout cars and dreaming 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute
Yeah way down yonder on the Chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But I learned how to swim and I learned how I was
A lot about livin' and a little 'bout love

I was willing but she wasn't ready
So a settled for a burger and a grape sno-cone
Dropped her off early but I didn't go home

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?

And candle lights on little corner tables

Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations

The women folk would hide, they'd hide.
When liberty valance walked around
The men would step aside
Cause the point of a gun was the only law
That liberty understood.
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good.

From out of the east a stranger came,
A law book in his hand, a man.
The kind of a man the west would need
To tame a troubled land;
Cause the point of a gun was the only law
That liberty understood.
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good.
When it came to shootin' straight and fast,
He was mighty good.

Many a man would face his gun
And many a man would fall,
The man who shot liberty valance,
He shot liberty valance,
He was the bravest of them all.

The love of a girl can make a man
Stay on when he should go, stay on.
Just tryin' to build a peaceful live
Where love is free to grow;
But the point of a fun was the only law
That liberty understood.
When the final showdown came at last
A law book was no good.

Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd
Return that fateful night, that night.
When nothing she said could keep her man
From going out to fight.
From the moment a girl gets to be full grown
The very first thing she learns
When two men go out to face each other,
Only one returns.

Everyone heard two shots ring out,
One shot made liberty fall
The man who shot liberty valance,
He shot liberty valance,
He was the bravest of them all.

Not the top, not the bottom, but the middle
And I still remember where I cracked my head
In the vacant lot, there's a row of tiny houses there now 
And we used to light fires in the gutters
And I could cool my head on the concrete steps
But the girl down the street hit my sister on the head
With a stick and we hid behind my father
As he knocked on the parents' door
To tell the them what she did
But the parents were drunk so they really didn't give a shit

And the girl down the street said a dog couldn't bark
'Cause a man with an axe cut its voicebox out
But my older sister told me that it prob'ly wasn't true
And I believe what she said 'cause she took me by the hand
One time when a coupla men drove down the hill in a white van
Said there was a phone box filled with money 'round the corner
And I woulda gone along but she took me by the hand
To the house in the middle of the hill
In the middle of the hill, in the middle of the hill

And my mother knew the words to a lot of different songs
And we'd always sing the harmonies, yeah we'd sing along
She had cold, cold hands when the fever hit
And then the noises that the trains made sounded like people in my head
And the stories that the ceiling told 
Through the pictures and the grains in the pine-wood boards
And let me stay outside 'til the sky went red
And I could cool my head on the concrete steps
And you could never really see the top from the bottom
But I don't pay enough attention to the good things when I got 'em

We'd ride side by side in the morning on our bicycles
Never even spoken or faced each other
But on the last hill we'd race each other

When we reached the racks we'd each go our own way
I wasn't in his classes, I didn't know his name
When we finally got to speak he just stared at his feet
And mumbled a sentence that ended with 'James'

When the kids called him weird he didn't try to deny it
Every lunchtime he'd spend walking by himself
Round the boundary of the grounds til he heard the bell

Well one day I found him, joined him on his walk
We were silent for a while until we started to talk
I told him my family were fighting in court
He said his step-dad and him always fought

We talked about music, he was into punk
Told me all the bands that I liked were junk
I said I'd never heard the songs the sex pistols sang
I laughed back at him and then the bell rang

The corridors were crowded as we came out of the rooms
Three guys I knew pushed him into the cement
Threw away his bag and said he had no friends

He yelled that he did and he looked around
Tried getting up but they pushed him on down
That's when he saw me, called out my name
And I turned my back, and just walked away

Sygnature,"When I met you
Did I sweat you?
Didn't I let you
Do it all cause you ball
At the hot spot
Cover drop top
With some ice in your watch
It's so phat you forgot

But as soon as I turned my back on you
Another guy got with it
The day that I gave my heart to you
I thought that you was with it
What kind of fool am I?
What kind of love is this?
How long did you think you could play me?

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me
Don't come running back on your hands and knees
If that's the way you like it baby do your thing
Don't really matter cause two can play that game

I was at a party
Sippin don p
In Armani
When somebody bumped into me
Then our eyes met
And her eyes said
I could have her if I wanted that I'd only have to ask

She asked me if I had a girl
And it really didn't matter
She must not be that good to you
When I could treat you better
I don't know what to do
She wants to leave the crowd
Then she whispers to me,""Let's make-out.""

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me
Don't come running back on your hands and knees
If that's the way you like it baby do your thing
Don't really matter cause two can play that game

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me
Don't come running back on your hands and knees
If that's the way you like it baby do your thing
Don't really matter cause two can play that game

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me
Don't come running back on your hands and knees
If that's the way you like it baby do your thing
Don't really matter cause two can play that game

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me
Don't come running back on your hands and knees
If that's the way you like it baby do your thing
Don't really matter cause two can play that game

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me
Don't come running back on your hands and knees
If that's the way you like it baby do your thing
Don't really matter cause two can play that game

If that's the way you want it that's cool with me

Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs (""Where K and them niggas at man?"")

Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

We gotta go  (gotta go, gotta go)
We gotta go (yeah baby) (it's check it out time)
We gotta go (let's go nigga, gotta go)
We gotta go (Y'all know what time it is!) (Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man)
We gotta go (call that valet motherfucker, tell him to get a nigga shoe)
We gotta go ('cause we out this, motherfucker)

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
'Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
'Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

We gotta go (ayo man Pac ay)
We gotta go (where the where the fuck is Daz at man?)
We gotta go (This nigga locked up or somethin'?)
We gotta go (The only one not to leave) (yo man)
We gotta go (it's check out time it's time to get out this mother)
We gotta go (You seem them bitches?)
We gotta go (We out man, fuck that shit)
We gotta go (Yo Rece!)
We gotta go (Yo nigga, whassup, whassup?)

Hey I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behaviour is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, 'cause I'm livin' Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go
We gotta go (Ay, it's check out time)
We gotta go (Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin')

Syko,"Hay veces que ser yo no lo es todo
Cuando tienes tanto y sientes no tener nada
Caminas por la vida solo
Yo callo pero aveces es así que me siento
Aprendes a aceptar que las cosas mas grandes se acaban solo con un momento
Aprendes a vivir en un mundo de traición
De fuego y mas caras con valor
Te acostumbras a llevarlo a todos los extremos
Somos de la calle y así es que todo lo hacemos

No se mide mal ni bien
Ni se valoran cosas que convienen
Todo va tan rápido, hasta que llego a casa y te miro a los ojos
Te abrazo y todo se detiene
Y me arrepiente de haber hecho tanto
De por tanto tiempo de haber caminado ciego
Y haber perdido el sentimiento en miedo

Kendo me dijo que me metiera a la cabina y me concentre
Que la música es eterna y por eso estoy aqui diciendo esto,
Para el día en que yo falte lo guardes para siempre

El orfanato!
Ángeles Y demonios

Me siento y saco números un octavo en dos mil quinientos
entre mes y cocina se van doscientos
veintidós paquetes de cuarenta y dos y viran tres mil novecientos
en semana y media, el negocio es super lento

Recupero, los veinticinco de la pieza voy y los entrego
y de ganancia quedan uno, dos, seis, cero
se tiraron y al que se llevaron fue a mi socio
cojo mas fianza en verdad que no es negocio

Mi nombre suena
y los problemas van en cadena
el case no es mio pero pronto mi sello se estrena
el dinero fue mi eclipse en luna llena
y el doctor le diagnostica, cáncer a mi nena

Bueno
Syko me estoy volviendo loco

Que paso escucho tu voz como ajora

Yo he guerreado tres veces por el case y con necesidad

Pero yo cabrón. No tuve el ticket ni pa' navidad

Donde vea al flaco papi se la voy a dejar pegar
y que se muera!

Kendo dale cuerda antes de meterle al flaco
Hay que darle al del B M el es la mano derecha

Naa, el bobolon no es ni la izquierda
Y después que le demos Syko arranca mierda

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

Me dijo no andes solo no te envuelvas no te dejes
tu naciste pa' eso saca pecho no te quejes
no sueltes la pistola que es tu única garantía
de que mañana te alumbre la luz del día

Piensa en la familia, en la renta, la comida
la nena esta enferma ya tu mai murió de SIDA
contéstame cabrón vas a dejar que el destino por ti decida?
o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Donde te parquiaste?

Afuera del case frente a casa de Nindativa
a hablar de una vía pero ya no se si sirva

Olvídate de eso, hablemos sin dar lata

Pues vamos a movernos que detrás del cemento oyen las ratas

Somos dos dentro del carro los cristales no pueden bajarse
si nos ven entrando juntos el chisme va a regarse
no puedo tirar de afuera hay que entrar y asegurarse
la cuarenta tiene problemas con el peine y va a trancarse

Tas loco tienes que matarme
yo si que voy a bajarme
yo he guerreado por este caserío y no voy a dejarme
el kisko es mio, las reglas van a cambiar,
si ganamos si le metemos, si perdemos hay que mudarse

Me baje yo creo que me vieron
un par corrieron
Kendo lo tengo de frente, me dieron

Hirieron a Syko le enganche el clip de veinte a la nueve
el que mata es en este caserío hoy es el día que lo pruebe

Entre detonaciones y sirenas
la voz de mi nena
dice papi es mejor que te quedes
no salgas me duele
lo que mi nena no sabe es que su papi se debe
a una guerra de calle, un bato se muere
que el dinero nunca se regala y del cielo no llueve
que por ver crecer al primer cabrón ya le di nueve

te falle mi amor quizás nuestros sueños se troyaron
pero a este otro hijo de puta le di los once que quedaron
los guardias llegaron, me rodearon, dispararon
trate de ganarles pero como quiera me cazaron
te escribo desde la cárcel por si no te contaron
o por si lamentablemente fallecí y me enterraron

Anoche me visito un ángel pregunto que precio tiene
no poder ser feliz y no ver crecer a tus nenes
dijo que el diablo encuentras a vivir detrás del reca
recuerda que la loca fue quien se llevo a tu vieja

Deja atrás to, recoja busca rumbo tienes tiempo
no confíes ni en ti mismo no hay amigo en el infierno
Sentí una paz inmensa cuando aquel ángel me hablaba
De repente otros en la puerta tocaban

o vas a cojer la ley en tu mano y buscar la salida?

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo

Ángeles y demonios oo
hablándome a mi y no oo
No quise escuchar

El día en que mi barrio conozca y reconozca
que sangre llama mas sangre
nunca vamos a terminar con las drogas
si no que ella va a terminar con todos nosotros
que los asesinatos suben cada día mas
y que somos todos y cada uno de nosotros
los responsables de que nuestras comunidades sigan en porvenir
progreso pueblo, Puerto Rico tu puedes

si no empezamos por nosotros

Los asesinos liricales con los instintos
De rebeldía mas notables hacia la sociedad
Su mundo de organización con ambiciosos fines de lucro
Que se dedican a enriquecerse de la sección por la música
Que sufren todos nuestros pacientes
A diario somos las victimas de su paso por

Que no hace falta nadie si estas en el orfanato

Pa la matemática en la industria una era histórica
Soy la que Nostradamus llamo una fuga combica
Que llevaría este genero a esa era galáctica
Soy el único real en una atmósfera de hipócrita
Que gozan del dolor y aquellos viven de la critica
Un montón de desperdicio solido que hacen música
Que no tienen cojone mucho menos ética

La calle me alumbra como los ojos de un búho a un intruso
Que gritan dentro de la jungla se entienden que silban
Un idioma en interrogantes verdad que den un paso en falso
Pa obligarte a regresar al mismo sitio de donde de llegaste
Paciente mental en sobre medicación sin supervision a visto
A redactar la calle a perfección si me notas telcos son la
Pelcos que el doctor receto y si el ritmo estoy rompiendo
Es por que soy mejor que todos

De impulsiva y una escritura alusiva que me ayuda a demostrar
Que me encuentro en otro nivel puede a ver parecido pero como

Waitin' for the train
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down
Just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna 
And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time 
I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
 
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, 
When he sang the blues
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
 
From Kentucky coal mines
To the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, Lord
Through everything I done
Bobby baby kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord
I let him slip away
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find it
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows
For one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all that Bobby left me

Sylabil Spill,"Wir hatten so große Träume, aber alle sind geplatzt
Früher waren wir Freunde, aber heute ist es nur noch Hass
Ist schon krass, was der Teufel mit einem macht
Er betäubt dich und hat tausend Tricks, es wird deutlich in der Nacht
Du willst immer mehr, gehst kaputt, immer mehr
Immer mehr, immer mehr, amina
Du wirst taub und blind, lebst für den Augenblick
Jeden Tag Achterbahn, immer Staub am Sniffen
Du wirst zum Zombie, Spitzname Staubsauger
Bis zum Tag, wo dir einer sagt man kann's auch rauchen
Auf einmal ist der Stein am brenn'
Auf einmal tuste kein' mehr kenn', bleibst kleben Spiderman
Auf einmal dreht sich deine Welt nur noch um eins
„Wie komm' ich an den nächsten Stein hin?“
Rhythm of the night, immer high (immer!)
Und nicht mehr frei, wie damals in der Kinderzeit
Viel Trauer, viel Krise, viel Minus, viel Miese
Als du und der Teufel dieses miese Spiel spielten
War eins von Anfang an klar (ah!)
Es endet fatal

Leben und irgendwann dann sterben
Bis dahin: Was hast du vor, was willst du werden?
Sterben musst du sowieso

Leben und irgendwann dann sterben
Bis dahin: Was hast du vor, was willst du werden?
Sterben musst du sowieso
Aber warum übertreibst du so? Jeden Tag nur weiß und so

Du hockst nur da und bist ganz allein
Kreidebleich, kalter Schweiß bedeckt deine Haut die ständige Schreierei
Helfen dir auch nicht, du kommst nicht raus
Was du brauchst ist der weiße Staub, der dich innerlich auffrisst
Sabber fließt durch deinen Mund, du kommst dir wie 'n Krüppel vor
Liegst da mit Schüttelfrost, der Entzug ist der Grund
Dir fällt das Atmen schwer, du sagst, du siehst Dämonen
Läufst oben ohne und siehst außer Panik gar nichts mehr
Warum du hier bist liegt an deiner Gier
Noch 'ne Line hier, noch 'ne Line hier
Statt dicke Möbel hast du nur noch ein Bett
Nur noch einen Stuhl, Tisch und der Rest ist weg
Statt Parties gibt's Gruppentherapie

I'm living proof that man can change
I knew what I wanted
I knew how to get it

It didn't make it happy so I started again
What I wanted to be was a family man 
But nature had some alternative plans
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold 
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told

I want to know yeah
I want to know

But every now and then 
Often at night 
A particular feeling would surface in spite 
Of what I told myself and tried to deny
I kept on asking the question: why?

A total metamorphosis

Cause my behaviour was getting strange
People on the street caught my eye
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy

The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge
Was in retreat and I was on the verge
Of falling in love or having fun
Time was running out
Something had to be done

I want to know
I want to know yeah
Tell me what's the reason

Dancing with others
Out on the floor

Music and smoke
What did it mean?
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I had what I wanted

Madly in love
Nothing else mattered
This was enough
Questions were answered 
Which used to perplex 
In particular those about the big s.e.x.

I want to know yeah
Tell me what's the reason

Dreaming is easy
Life is tough
I got the picture
The most important thing 

Is not to end up bitter 
Cause when you start to feel 
Increasingly forlorner 
Woomph! love comes 
Right around the corner

It may not last 
But here am I
Once a caterpillar
Now a butterfly
It can seem strange
But when you reminisce
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

Filled with fears. 
She lacked love in herself which brought many many tears.

And let it control you
Hungry for the piece of the pie you think someone owes you
But you don't try to survive past what you think you know

(but they don't earn it)
But you're not gonna get from me

Gotta go for what you know (what you know)
What you get ain't all what you see.

Relationships are up to you to manifest destiny
You fuss and fight all the time, seems like you can't agree
No compromise, everyone thinks they're so damn wise
But I know one thing's for certain
What you do brings everything, while what you say don't mean a damn thing
What you say don't mean a damn thing, oh, oh.

Is that you baby
Someone to fulfill my needs
And be all about me
But knows when to let me breathe
Because I gotta do my thing
Is that you baby

See for me it's been quite some time
Since I had someone to call mine
And some could say that I'm a little picky
But I was that way 'cause I had to be
'Cause some men don't really understand me
And I can't tolerate no drama king
I'm just looking for someone who can be
Down for me when I need him to be

[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

I'm not lookin' for no drama
I'm not lookin' for no complicated situations
I'm just lookin' for a man who's got good conversation
And when it comes to love
He never shows hesitation

Let myself overlook it

It's ok 'cause I know your heart,
Friends they think I'm a fool, for staying so true to you, but it's ok because 
I'll play that part

Even though you never say you love me,
I know you're always thinking of me,
And people try to hate on you, 'cause they don't see you like I do, (no they don't)
And ain't no matter what they say,you notice me everyday
And knowing that you care for me the way you give yourself so willingly

And I know there will there be times
To take time out and cater to my needs
But really that's cool 'cause I'm not alone
I'm with you even when you're gone

Really you're so special to me
Nothing is better than to be
The part of my love that is so sweet
So you don't have to say a word

But the game is over baby, no more you need to fantasize
'Cause I'm not letting go so come and put your lips on mine

Syleena Johnson,"[Verse#1:] One day I was feelin' low down
 (Was havin') Bad thoughts like I won't be around
 (Was thinkin') Maybe I should get out of this game
 (I thought that) Nobody wanted to hear me sing
 (I thought that) Nobody even knew my name
 (I thought that) Maybe 'cause it was I didn't lose weight
 (I thought that) I had failed and I felt so ashamed
 (And not just) At my music, but at everything
 (But then my) Momma said ""don't you dare think that way""
 (And my) Sisters told me not to lose my faith
 (They told me) ""Get on your knees and let GOD lead the way""
 (And then I) Closed my eyes and I heard a voice say
[Chorus ](2 Times):It told me ""Stand up""
 If you want to be seen, 
 It told me ""Reach out""
 So you can catch your dreams,
 It told me ""Cry out""
 If you want to be heard
 It told me ""Be strong""
 And take heed to my word""
[Verse#2:] So from now on when I hear that voice say
 (Stand up) I'm on my feet, and I'm showin' my face
 (Because I) Won't go quietly into the night
 (I will be) Strong and faithful, oh I will survive
 (I will be) Honest to me, I will try even when I cry
 (I will be) Humble, but fearless knowing the LORD by my side
 (I won't take) Life for granted, I'll live everyday like my last
 (I will make) Lemonade even when lemons is all I have
 (I will pay) All my dues and tithes in Sundays
 (I won't break) When haters test me, focused I will stay
 (And when I) Cannot hide from those low down days
 (I will just) Close my eyes and hear that voice say

Uhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is
Yah mean? We untouchable baby

[Chorus]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

We built this Double are thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggaz round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!

Thorough type niggaz that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out

Come on fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9

Double are and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
What! We untouchable, alright?
Yea, WHAT!

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, YEAH! Be strong..

All the niggaz with the weed spots
And all my niggaz on them cell blocks
We goin' are-you-double-F are-why-D-E

You can't fuck with my army
My niggaz is untouchable, eatin' niggaz like Lunchable
.45 be crushin' you when the bullets be touchin' you
Paul bearers'll carry you

To the cemetery where your momma goin' bury you
Black suit be fittin' you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees

Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggaz who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable

[Chorus]

Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane

Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine

Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise

But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas

I'm untouchable, nigga

Hang the Double are chain from the side of the car

Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?

Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on

That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
to stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

Uhh, uhh, uhh, come on!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines

I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms

Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh

I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X what up?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable

Woo, ah

Listen, how do I live without you
When every day that I open my eyes
And turn to my side gotta smile deep inside
'Cause the one who was there was you

And how do I focus at work
Every time my cell phone rings
Or a pager beeps, I'm so nervous so anxious
But hoping the caller is you

And how am I supposed to get sleep
When every night that I lay down my head in my bed
You ain't there with your arms wrapped around me
Holding me all night through

And how could this be fair
When I gave you all of my love
All my time every dime after spending still
You could walk out the door to explore

Another relationship
Is that what this is about
Another relationship
That you would leave your own house
For another relationship

Was that the straw that broke the camels back
Another relationship, another relationship
Baby, tell me what's up with that

What does she have on me
What does she do that is so damn good
That would make you give up all the love
All the trust and the stuff that you built with me

Does she know my name
Did you ever tell her that she was taking
And breaking the bond that we strengthened
Through blood sweat and tears over the years
Boy you don't hear me

And has she met your son
Or maybe your mother and father
Your sister, 2 brothers and all of your cousins
Your uncle who loves me and still call me

And how could this be
Tell me what's better than storming the weather
And staying together with the one you love
And have a history

Another relationship
How could you go to her Is that what this is about
Another relationship
How could you leave your own house

Was that the straw that broke the camels back

(I thought we were so happy, baby)
How could you leave so easily
Is she worth all that baby, oh

Oh, how could you baby
Another relationship
Sacrifice our happy life
For Another relationship

And this wasn't what you promised me
Another relationship, another relationship
You said you would love me
Love me, love me, love me forever baby

So how come I wasn't good enough, oh

I know all relationships get tough, oh

For another relationship
How could you do this to me

Oh, why, why, why did you leave

So, so, so, so easily

Oh, yeah

It's funny how
Every time we talk
You're the boss
Not this time
Made up mind, love is lost
Draw the line, saw it coming
From a mile away
Bet you wish
You could just go change the day
You're the one to blame for all the childish games
Time I face the truth
You ain't tryna change
And I can't stay here (No more, no more)
Another minute, hour, second
Staring in your face

[Chorus]
Is there an apartment for rent
Is time that I leave and pack all my ish
Does someone need a roommate
Comes a time when a woman has lost all faith
Is there an apartment for rent
Fed up female, no dog, no kids
Does someone need a roommate
Leave your number and a message
Cause I need it right away

You bring out my violent streak
I don' thrown it all you
But the kitchen sink
And I trust just as far as I can see
It's killing me to be up in your presence
So I look up to heaven, pray to God
Asking Him to give me strength
To stand up to this man
That's abusing me
Mentally it's too much
That I'm finding, all the lying
But I ain't gon' run behind him (Ain't goin' run behind him)
That I ain't my life
Cause I can walk away

[Chorus]

I ain't no money
But palimony pays
18% for the trouble that you made
You made your own bed hard now lie
You keep the crib
Cause I'm moving out today
Cause I'm moving out today

(Ladies let me hear you say)

[Chorus]

Oh, Yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause I'm out Mr. Landlord
I dun lost, I dun lost all faith
Is there an vacancy for me
Fed up now, just can't take no more from you, no
I'm know all I'm all I can do
Boy, I'm through, so fed with you
Take your keys, I'm out the door
You ain't gotta worry bout me no more

Verse 1:
What makes you think that I'm gonna wait forever
When we both know that your never gonna leave her
What makes you think that I don't wanna man
I could call my own
What makes you think that I don't want a family
What makes you think that I wanna be unhappy
Boy, I can't do this, it ain't right
I don't think that you should call me anymore

I can't sleep at night
I toss and turn 
My mind is bursting
My conscious burns
I can't stop thinking about this love
And if the shoe was on the other foot

Chorus:
(Leave me alone), if your not gonna be here for me
(Leave me alone), if your not gonna do shyt for me
If you got a girl at home and she's pregnant
Wondering when your comin home
(Leave me alone), don't wanna know you got problems in your marriage
(Leave me alone), if you think I'm gonna help carry your baggage
(Leave me alone), cause I don't wanna share your love
Baby, I can bad on my own

(Listen)
Verse 2:
What makes you think that you could get away with murder
What makes it so easy for you to hurt her
What makes you think that I don't know that you can the same thing to me
I know you think I'll do anything for ya
Cause I been so greedy and selfish just like you
But now I'm finished, it ain't right
Even though it felt so right, it's still so wrong, oh

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Mon-day, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday
If Sunday's only the day we spent a week
What's the purpose of us
It just ain't worth it to me

Syleena Johnson,"Met him on a Sunday
Oh, it was first day of the rest of my life, oh
(Haven't been the same, since you called my name, everything has changed)
Made me bloom just like a flower
Since the first time we took a shower
Made love for hours (oh)
And I could feel the power of your love
Girl, I'll be true to thee
As long as your lovin' me, givin' you the best of me
Lovin' you is my destiny
I always put you first

(Never walk away) Cause you give me more than anything 
And in my heart 
You'll always have a place

Cause I am your woman

More than anything
More than a diamond ring with a stone in pink 
You're been more to me lately
You mean more than those things
More than the air I breathe (more) 
More than the food I eat (more)
More than the shoes on my feet (more)
Oh, you are more than to me

The moment that I saw you 
Knew I was crazy for you 
The look in your eyes
(Said those things, many things to me)
Girl, join this walk with me
Believe me when I say, 
I'm with you for life,
Right by your side, make you my wife

Girl, I'll be true to thee
As long as your lovin' me, givin' you the best of me

Cause I am your woman (yes you are, yes you are)
I am your woman, boo

[Chorus: x2]

You're my autumn when the seasons change
Falling in love, can't wait to change to rain
Boy, you're like the sun rays
Shining down on a special day
Like sand to a beach
The sweet to a peach
You make my heart beat
Change me from Miss to Mrs. 
Granted all my wishes, you're more

[Chorus]

More than a friend becomes a lover
Here to the end don't want no other
Through thick and thin
We've got each other
More than anything
I ask for 
Or pray for
You are my joy, oh",More,2005

How can I teach my son to be a leader if I?m always following

Syleena Johnson,"It makes no difference who you are
Or what color you happened to be
As long as you're live and breathing
This is got to be one of journey

Hey, as a young girl I had my heart set on many big dreams
Then I grew up and found the world ain't nothing what it seems
Hey, then the tears came down the face of my reality, yeah
When I realized how mean and rude this world can be

And if I ruled the world
(I would give love to all the woman and children)
I would break free every mind
(And I would supply all the dollars to feed them)

There would be peace and love on Earth
(There'd be no war, peace study no more)
Soldiers be free to make the choice
(To live or die so I'd free them the voice)

All I want is freedom
(From all the stress, the test, the mess, the lies of your enemies)
All I want is freedom
(Freedom to fight for everything that you believe)

Freedom
(Freedom to say what you think, free from the prejudice that changes all)
All I want is freedom
(You have to have it, where would you be without your freedom)

And no matter, if you're from the hood or from the hills of Beverly
Soil of America, from the far place overseas
Black, yellow or white, straight, gay or somewhere in between
We all want a one nation under God that's free

And if I ruled the world
(I would give love to all the woman and children)
I would break free every mind
(And I would supply all the dollars to feed them)

There would be peace and love on Earth
(There'd be no war, peace study no more)
Soldiers be free to make the choice
(To live or die so I'd free them the voice)

All we need our freedom
(From all the stress, the test, the mess, the lies of your enemies)
All we need our freedom
(Freedom to fight for everything that you believe)

All we want Freedom
(Freedom to say what you think, free from the prejudice that changes all)
All I want is freedom
(You have to have it, where would you be without your freedom)

Every man, woman and child deserves the right to be free
One nation under God living just for all

(We want our freedom)
As it makes no difference who you are
(We want our freedom)
Or what color you happened to be

(We want our freedom)
As long as you're live and breathing
(Sing daddy)
This is got to be one of journey

All I want is my freedom
(From all the stress, the test, the mess, the lies of your enemies)
All I want is freedom

Still turned right around and cheated on me
And you let me down
Say goodbye boy I'm about to leave
You let me down for the last time


How many times have you told me you love me
And how many times have you ran out on me
Then said I'm sorry
What kinda woman do you take me for
Do you think I'm crazy
Did you think that I was gonna keep on letting you play me
But oh hell no can't take no more

I wish we cud of been happy

Starin' eye to eye like, who the fuck we screwin'?
Here take these nickel bags and deduct your doin'

Tight, I'm an Aries born in April
That means my attitude is I'm born to hate you
Now let's get it gritty
I'll doggystyle while you watching ""Sex and the City""

I'll bomb yo' committee, if why'all MIDI
I treat your girl like (?) and walk off with the kitty
Kitty, kitty...

Tell me why, when I, saw you the, other day
You spoke to me as if I was your best friend or sum'
But when today I tried to say whassup and you walked on by
You had nothin' to say to me then

Sometimes, I can't even understand why you'd even bother to pass my way, no
'Cause, dealin' with you kinda makes me wonder
Exactly whereeee yeah does my time go (and noooooo, no)
I can't believe the things that you be doin' for me
Knowin in yo' heart you don't really mean to, nooo

When why'all tongue kiss why'all suckin' my wood together
Fallin in love, I won't do it; cause some of these women
Their clothes look sooo good, but they act stupid

Because it's sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy

And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cause now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated

Cause if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around

Cause when I go out baby, I GO OUT with a bang! (bang bang)
Thursday night, 'bout to hang out at the House of Blues
Fresh attire, new shoes, plus a new, hairdo, Whoo!
I'm mesmerized by the music that they bump in the club
I see my homegirl man (whas' happening, whas' up?)
Lookin like he need some love
And everytime I see him, he been givin me the eye
Cause he my type and I'm his type and plus we love to ride
Imagine that, off we left
Hot sweat hot sex it ain't like we just met (ahh, yeah, yeah)
Why she trust me?  Since his girl went on a little trip
I made his sweat drip, he made me strip
It ain't my fault he in a fucked up relationship
That just go to show, you never know who you dealing with
Love over friendship, that's why I live my life trustless, yeah

Hmm, I spent the night at the homie's house, shit
Slept in his living room, on his couch
Nigga high'n a motherfucker burnt out (shit)
Before you know it, god damn, the homie chirped out (damn!)
And he ain't said shit, he just dip in his Seville as he peel
Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?
Now baby got a gown on, getting her clown on
As she slid downstairs, now she taking me down home
Cheating in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
Am I wrong?  Shit, on and on and on and on
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you
His baby momma in my face, she shaking poo-poo, what would you do?
Trust is a motherfucking loco, shit
And so is temptation, and I don't know what I'ma do
Come on through (come on through) so I can cum on you (cum on you)

Every breath down the back of my neck
Senses can be fooled so easily
But this runs deeper
This is in my bones

I could have sworn you lay in the ground
In my sight
Yet so far out of reach

Take this misery
Drown it with my memories
So they can never be found

To where the waves break

And take a life",The River,2012
Sylosis,"Biding time
For what as felt like centuries
Dead ends in front of me
The sting of reality strikes down

And still you keep it in

The weakness you hide
Consumes your life
Carry the weight down to your grave
And wait for death's hand

Paralysed and waiting endlessly
Is it something I will never find
A thirst never to be satisfied

I watched you take the strain

The weakness you hide
Consumes your life
Like a search that never ends
Your existence is unexplained

It ignites the flame inside
What makes you feel alive again
Is to understand what it means to die

Is it something I will never find
A thirst never to be satisfied

Winds arch over me
And waves crash down to drown everything

Is it something I will never find
A thirst never to be satisfied

It ignites the flame inside
What makes you feel alive again
Is it to understand what it means to die",What Dwells Within,2012

Une autre fois revoir le jour
Mais cette fois
Naître de ses propres amours

Couper tous les cordons d'avant
Pour simplement

S'il est possible de renaître
Je recollerai tous les éclats perdus
Des anciennes fenêtres
Et je ne vivrai plus
Que pour devenir mon propre veuf
Pour enfin tout recommencer
Avec le corps et le cœur neufs
Sans avenir, mais sans passé
 
Venir au monde
Ouvrir les yeux, tendre les bras
Que chaque fois
Soit la première tant qu'il faudra
Se mettre au monde
A chaque jour, à chaque instant

Sylvain Lelièvre,"Autrefois Yahvé vint prendre thé
Chez son vieux pote Abraham
Il lui dit «Mon vieux, t’as l’air de douter
Je dois éprouver ton âme
Si tu crois en moi, si j’ai ton soutien
En un mot si t’as la foi
Ton petit vaurien de fils qui fout rien
Tu l’immoleras pour moi»

REFRAIN 	
Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça 

 
Faut dire qu’Abraham approchait alors
Plus ou moins cent quarante ans 
Qu’il fût quelque peu fêlé sur les bords
C’est bien possible et pourtant
Il partit dès l’aube du lendemain
Emmenant son fils avec lui
Et sans dire un mot il prit le chemin
Dont Yahvé l’avait instruit

Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça 

Pourquoi tant de bois?» demande Isaac
(Tel était le nom du fils)
Son père lui répond sans le moindre trac
«On va faire un sacrifice»
«Épatant! dit l’autre, mais où est l’agneau?
«Sans mouton, pas de méchoui»
Mais soudain le vieux brandit son couteau
Soudain le fils a compris

Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça 

On connaît la suite: l’Ange est arrivé
Stoppant le bras du prophète
Faut croire que la chose amusa Yahvé
Puisqu’un jour il l’a refaite
Des siècles plus tard, sous un autre nom
Il envoie son propre fils
Crever sur la croix, mais pas d’ange, non
Pour le soustraire au supplice

Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça
Toi t’aurais jamais fait ça, papa
Non t’aurais jamais, jamais fait ça, papa!

Et les jours où personne ne daignait trépasser
Seul entre ses cercueils et son vieux gramophone
Il prenait des chorus avec Tommy Dorsey

Et s'il faut que la mort soit votre gagne-pain
Tout plutôt que l'armée, vive les pompes funèbres
C'est moins dur que docteur et plus sûr qu'assassin

Donc il était croque-mort et battait la mesure
Tout en déboutonnant trois ou quatre bémols
Sa fiancée cachée, son unique aventure
C'était son instrument parfumé de formol

Chagrin pour escroquer les veuves tout en pleurs
Distrait pour encaisser les chèques d'assurance
Artiste pour monter les Cadillac en fleurs

On trouva son trombone serré contre son corps

Of a friend, of a friend, of a friend, of a friend

Sylvan Richardson,"Big nothing. 
He stood in the road outside of town 
With a broken clockwork toy in his hand. 
A graveyard for childish dreams in his palm 
A broken lifeline. 
Big nothing. 
The mechanical amusement sputtered to life in his fist. 
As he clenched, it whirred and died again. 
It was a cowboy who drew his gun, 
But the pistol was welded to the holster 
By age and careless children, 
So it struggled and strained 
And it unwound its own spring. 
Big nothing. 
He didn't need tattoos to show where he'd been 
And who he'd loved. 
It was the same thing that men had cried for; 
That women had dyed their hair for. 
The cellophane illusion of a starry sky 
Stretched over an open sore. 
Big nothing. 
He thought about his lost daughter 
The way her eyes would alight at the greedy circus barker's blackmail song 
How he wanted to smash her skull in when she parroted back, 
'Tell mommy; tell poppy; you need this little dolly.' 
Big nothing. 
Big nothing. 
The smoky voice of the petaled girl woke him long enough. 
There was too much light in the room, so he unscrewed the bulb. 
She took him to bed like an adopted dog. 
Big nothing. 
She lit sickly incense, as he tried to tell himself 
The resemblance were pure and coincidental. 
He unleashed his grip on the toy and all it meant to him, 
And it wound down forever. 
Big nothing. 
He woke up in a sweat, the next day. 
With her smile still painted on his mouth 
He walked out of a town called Big Nothing.

You showered me with love 
No taking, only giving 

Take me back to something 
That I lost somehow, somewhere along the way 
Take me back to something 
That I need somehow, to brighten up my day 

Little angel, young at heart 
Full of passion, full of life

When the twilight fades
When the moon hits my eyes

Will you still care
Will you still need me tomorrow
Will you be there
Will you still love me tomorrow

Will you still need me tomorrow

When darkness decides
My virtue falls in you

Have you changed your mind?
Have you seen the future?
Was it hard to find?
Will you keep on dancing
On the edge of life?
Do you ever wonder how you will survive?

I guess I still don't know
Can I make it on my own?
I guess I got to go but can I make it on my own?
I guess it's time to let my feelings show
I guess I still don't knowâ?¦
But can I make it on my own?

When the night is over
And the races run
I'll find the answers
How to come undone
Will you keep on dancing
On the edge of life?
Do you ever wonder how you will survive?

You cried the whole night through
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Go on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river............over you

Now conversation seems to get in the way
Our love wins to share, is growing colder
It seems too little from the everyday

Maybe we can find a love together
And maybe we can find in somebody new
Who knows what the future hold before us?
I really rather I get old with you

Where do we go from here?

Now that becomes so wrong, baby

Rappin Queen's my claim to fame
Gonna tell you a story you didn't know
Get ready get set, cause here I go
I knew the land, of Rappersville
Castle on a mount called Sugar Hill
Like Diana Ross said loud and clear:
""This is my house, I live here!""
We have a King, I must confess 
We share everything cause we love the best
We have money and friends of every kind
Friends are his, money's mine
My every wish, is his command
Furs everyday at the wave of my hand
I consider myself a fortunate lady
Sporting my Rolls, and grey Mercedes
Ahhhh, ha ha ha!

Ohh yes it's good to be the Queen, ohh la la
Gee but it's good to be the Queen
(Sing it girls, what it is, is what is is, sing it girls, sing it girls, well)
You can be sure about one thing, ohh la la
Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui it's good to be the Queen

The Queen of Sugar Hill, ah
We partied all day in the castle all night
All the VIP's of the world was in sight
Drinks were free so was the fun
There was more than enough for everyone
So Sammy and Frankie, mingle in the crowd
Heard Stevie and Michael, singin' out loud
They were hippin' and hoppin' all over the place
Bangin' the boogie right in my face
I got on the mic and I started to rap
Feet start slappin', hands began to clap
They were cuttin up records, faster and faster
But no one did it like our Grandmaster
The fun I had, I could not measure
This rappin', is a sho nuff treasure
The people all stood and began to scream
As somebody yelled, ""Long live the Queen""

[Chorus]
It's good to be the Queen!
Badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbat
Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

It started back, in seventy-nine
My whole darn future, was on the line
I created, a brand, new sensation
Through my mind and the whole darn nation
With the Big Bank Hank, the Wonder Mike
And this kid called Master G (that's me)
Well would you believe their Rapper's Delight
Went down in history, hahaha!

I'll never forget, the King of Kings
Break it on down

How do you call your lover boy
Come here, lover boy
And if he doesn't answer
Oh lover boy
And if he still doesn't answer

Sylvia,"Sittin' in a restaurant she walked by
I seem to recall that certain look in your eye
I said ""who's that?"" You said with a smile
""Oh it's nobody, oh nobody""

Maybe that explains the last two week
You called me up, dead on your feet
Working late again, I ask who with
You said ""nobody, oh nobody.""

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever?
(Clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better

Late last night we went for a drive
You were miles away I asked ""who's on your mind?""
You said, ""Nobody, nobody. Why do you ask?""
Oh, her again I could have told you that.

We came back home got ready for bed
I said to myself I've got one shot left
Your still mine and I won't stand in line
Behind nobody, nobody!

Well your nobody called today
She hung up when I asked her name
Well I wonder does she think she's being clever?
(Clever)
You say nobody's after you
The fact is what you say is true
But I can love you like nobody can, even better.

Sylvia,"Flew in this morning on the 8-0-5
Had a couple of hours to spare.
I wanted to see the hometown again
It'd been years since I was there.
A taxi took me by the old grade school
But on the playground there was no sound
Windows boarded up, a rusty sign laying on the ground.

[Chorus]
They say you can't go back
Anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing,
You can't change the changes going on (going on)
They say you can't go back anymore than you can stop the door from closing.
Once you're gone, you can't go back home

Drove in front of the movie house where I spent my Saturdays
Quarter got ya in back then, costed three and a half today.
And he stopped by Shipleys bakery,
But Mr. Shipley had passed away.
I got back in the cab, I saw that everything had changed.

[Chorus]

Taxi pulled up in front of your house,
I started to get out,
Then I, I saw a little boy open the door
I quickly turned around.
I told the driver, guess there's no one home,
I think he understood, you've got a plane to catch he said, the drive will do you good.

They say you can't go back anymore than you can stop the wind from blowing,
You can't change the changes going on, going on,
They say you can't go back anymore than you can stop the door from closing,
Once you're gone, you can't go back home
Once you're gone, you can't go back home

Sylvia,"Love
Love is strange
Lot of people
Take it for a game
Once you get it
You never want to quit, no no
After you've had it
You're in an awful fix

Don't understand, no no
They think loving
Is money in the hand
Your sweet loving
Is better than a kiss

I'm Sylvia, that's the name
Rappin Queen's my claim to fame
Gonna tell you a story you didn't know
Get ready get set, cause here I go
I knew the land, of Rappersville
Castle on a mount called Sugar Hill
Like Diana Ross said loud and clear:
""This is my house, I live here!""
We have a King, I must confess 
We share everything cause we love the best
We have money and friends of every kind
Friends are his, money's mine
My every wish, is his command
Furs everyday at the wave of my hand
I consider myself a fortunate lady
Sporting my Rolls, and grey Mercedes
Ahhhh, ha ha ha!

Ohh yes it's good to be the Queen, ohh la la
Gee but it's good to be the Queen
(Sing it girls, what it is, is what is is, sing it girls, sing it girls, well)
You can be sure about one thing, ohh la la
Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui it's good to be the Queen

The Queen of Sugar Hill, ah
We partied all day in the castle all night
All the VIP's of the world was in sight
Drinks were free so was the fun
There was more than enough for everyone
So Sammy and Frankie, mingle in the crowd
Heard Stevie and Michael, singin' out loud
They were hippin' and hoppin' all over the place
Bangin' the boogie right in my face
I got on the mic and I started to rap
Feet start slappin', hands began to clap
They were cuttin up records, faster and faster
But no one did it like our Grandmaster
The fun I had, I could not measure
This rappin', is a sho nuff treasure
The people all stood and began to scream
As somebody yelled, ""Long live the Queen""

[Chorus]
It's good to be the Queen!
Badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbatu badi mbat
Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

It started back, in seventy-nine
My whole darn future, was on the line
I created, a brand, new sensation
Through my mind and the whole darn nation
With the Big Bank Hank, the Wonder Mike
And this kid called Master G (that's me)
Well would you believe their Rapper's Delight
Went down in history, hahaha!

[Chorus]
I'll never forget, the King of Kings
Break it on down

I go in early, come home late
Trying to get over you
But I keep thinking more of you

My friends say that I'll forget
[Incomprehensible] that’s a losing bet
If I could just turn love to hate
Maybe then I could escape

Anytime, anyplace
In someone else's eyes I still see your face
Anyplace, anytime
Anywhere I am you're on my mind

You'll always be a memory
That time can never re-arrange
Anytime, anytime, anyplace

It's just another TV dinner alone
With thoughts of you inside my head
I fall into my lonely bed

Then I turn the radio on
Ah but every DJ plays our song
And I'll just lie there restlessly
Wishing you were next to me

Anytime, anyplace
In someone else's eyes I still see your face
Anyplace, anytime
Anywhere I am you're on my mind

I'm living proof that man can change
I knew what I wanted
I knew how to get it

It didn't make it happy so I started again

But nature had some alternative plans
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold

Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh why can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?

There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
High above the chimney tops,
That's where you'll find me.

Sylvia McNair,"Old black magic has me in its spell
Old black magic that you weave so well 
Those icy fingers up and down my spine
The same old witch craft when your eyes meet mine
Same old tingle that I feel inside

Down and down I go
Round and round I go

I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you're the lover I have waiting for

And every time your lips meet mine

Sylvia McNair,"At words poetic, I'm so pathetic
That I always have found it best,
Instead of getting 'em off my chest,
To let 'em rest unexpressed.
I hate parading my serenading
As I'll probably miss a bar,
But if this ditty is not so pretty,
At least it'll tell you how great you are.

You're the top! You're the Colosseum,
You're the top! You're the Louvre Museum,
You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss,
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeart sonnet,

And I can feel after every line
A thrill divine down my spine.

You're the purple light of a summer night in Spain,
You're the National Gall'ry, You're Garbo's sal'ry,
You're cellophane.
You're sublime, You're a turkey dinner.
You're the time of the Derby winner.
I'm a toy balloon that is fated soon to pop.

You're the top!

You're the top! You're a Ritz hot toddy.
You're the top! You're a Brewster body.
You're the boats that glide on the sleepy Zuider Zee,
You're a Nathan Panning, You're Bishop Manning,
You're broccoli.
You're a prize, You're a night at Coney,
You're the eyes of Irene Bordoni,

But if, Baby, I'm the bottom,
You're the top.

You're the top! You're an Arrow collar.
You're the top! You're a Coolidge dollar.
You're the nimble tread of the feet of Fred Astaire,
You're an O'Neill drama, You're Whistler's mama,
You're Camembert.
You're a rose, You're Inferno's Dante,
You're the nost of the great Durante.
I'm just in the way, as the French would say
""De trop,""

You're the top.

You're the top! You're a Waldorf salad.
You're the top! You're a Berlin ballad.
You're a baby grand of a lady and a gent.
You're an old dutch master, You're Mrs. Aster,
You're Pepsodent.
You're romance, You're the steppes of Russia,
You're the pants on a Roxy usher.

You're Ovaltine.

You're the top! You're the Tower of Babel.
You're the top! You're the Whitney Stable.
By the River Rhine, You're a sturdy stein of beer,

You're stratosphere.
You're my thoist, You're a Drumstick Lipstick,

Rappin Queen's my claim to fame
Gonna tell you a story you didn't know
Get ready get set, cause here I go
I knew the land, of Rappersville
Castle on a mount called Sugar Hill
Like Diana Ross said loud and clear:
""This is my house, I live here!""
We have a King, I must confess 
We share everything cause we love the best
We have money and friends of every kind
Friends are his, money's mine
My every wish, is his command
Furs everyday at the wave of my hand
I consider myself a fortunate lady
Sporting my Rolls, and grey Mercedes
Ahhhh, ha ha ha!

Ohh yes it's good to be the Queen, ohh la la
Gee but it's good to be the Queen
(Sing it girls, what it is, is what is is, sing it girls, sing it girls, well)
You can be sure about one thing, ohh la la
Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui, oh yes! Ma oui it's good to be the Queen

The Queen of Sugar Hill, ah
We partied all day in the castle all night
All the VIP's of the world was in sight
Drinks were free so was the fun
There was more than enough for everyone
So Sammy and Frankie, mingle in the crowd
Heard Stevie and Michael, singin' out loud
They were hippin' and hoppin' all over the place
Bangin' the boogie right in my face
I got on the mic and I started to rap
Feet start slappin', hands began to clap
They were cuttin up records, faster and faster
But no one did it like our Grandmaster
The fun I had, I could not measure
This rappin', is a sho nuff treasure
The people all stood and began to scream
As somebody yelled, ""Long live the Queen""

It's good to be the Queen!

Badi mbatu BADI MBATU badi mbatu badi mbatu

It started back, in seventy-nine
My whole darn future, was on the line
I created, a brand, new sensation
Through my mind and the whole darn nation
With the Big Bank Hank, the Wonder Mike
And this kid called Master G (that's me)
Well would you believe their Rapper's Delight
Went down in history, hahaha!

I'll never forget, the King of Kings
Break it on down

A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.

Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

Floating on the silence that surrounds us

And a window looking on the mountains and the sea, how lovely

Until the final flicker of life's ember

A bitter tragic joke, have found with you, 
The meaning of existence, oh my love",Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars,2004

I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented, like a nightingale without a song to sing
O why should I have spring fever, when it isn't even spring
I keep I were someone else, walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard from a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning daydreams, spinning spinning daydreams
I'm as giggy as a baby on a swing
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud, or a robin on the wing

It might as well be spring.

Your love has come and gone.
You can't stop the changing season that's tearing my heart away,
Cause I remember when time was only sand, we were running forward, now were walking the streets of yesterday.

It's okay to let it go, it's alright to let it show.
Maybe were all healing, kneeling, to an alter of hope,
When our hands are touching, clutching to that open door,
If we could touch the sun, with love to lead us on,
Would that be enough for you to see we belong.

Leaning to the wind, go where no one else has been,
I will hold the silence till it sleeps in the palm of my hand.
I know you realize all that's burned your eyes was nothing more than(____) and (____) playing with your head

On est silence on est chanson 
Heureux ou malheureux  
Entre blessure et désespoir 
On se rassure on veut y croire 
C'est une chambre où l'on se plait  
Mais c'est décembre au mois de mai 
Heureux ou malheureux  
Mais c'est toujours ce même coeur qui bat 
Comment peut-il mourir autant de fois 
Je ne sais pas 
À chaque fois pourtant j'y crois  
Et tu t'en vas et tu reviens 
C'est coeur lilas c'est coeur chagrin 
Nous deux c'est quoi c'est tout c'est rien 
Il me faudra vivre demain 
Avec toi ou sans toi   
Car c'est toujours ce même coeur qui bat 
Comment peut-il mourir autant de fois 
Je ne sais pas  
À chaque fois pourtant j'y crois  
Oui c'est toujours ce même coeur qui bat 
Comment peut-il renaître à chaque fois 
Je ne sais pas 
Depuis toujours pourtant j'y crois 
Depuis toujours pourtant j'y crois",Ce Même Coeur Qui Bat,1990
Sylvie Bernard,"Ici, depuis Les parfums des cafés l'après-midi 
La pluie, la nuit 
Et dans le port les sirènes qui crient 
Tous les météores 
La brise du nord 
Cassent toute ma vie 
Lorsque tu pars encore  
Fuir, fuir 
Le tourbillon secret de l'avenir 
Lire, lire 
Sur ton visage, les mots pour m'étourdir 
Tous les calembours 
Les rires aux détours 
Rédéchirent ma voix 
Quand je parle d'amour  
Et les oiseaux tournent dans le vent 
Et le soleil brûle le quai pourtant  
Ici, depuis 
La fûmée bleue des cargos alourdis 
Furie de bruit 
Pour t'oublier un million d'alibis 
Tous les grains de sable 
Les jardins, les rades 
Les jours irremplaçables 
Donnent à mon coeur un air irréparable 
Depuis",Depuis,1990
Sylvie Lewis,"She was the color of TV
Her mouth curled under like a metal snake
Although Holy Wood was sad
They'd remember this as Valentines day
Flies are waiting

In the shadow of the valley of death
In the shadow of the valley of death
They slit our wrists and send us to heaven
The first flower after the flood

I saw that pregnant girl today
She didn't know that it was dead inside
Even though it was alive
Some of us are really born to die
Flies are waiting

In the shadow of the valley of death
In the shadow of the valley of death
They slit our wrists and send us to heaven
The first flower after the flood

In the shadow of the valley of death
In the shadow of the valley of death
In the shadow of the valley of death

Sylvie Vartan,"I didn't think it could happen again
I'm just too old and set in my ways
I was convinced I would always be lonely
All of the rest of my days
Maybe I give up on romance
In my longing to give up the pain
I just didn't believe I would ever love again

I was like one who had shut myself in
Closed the windows, locked all the doors
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart
Yet knowing there had to be more
Though it sounds like a great contradiction
It's the easiest thing to explain
You see, I was afraid I might never love again

What does it take for a blind man to see
That there's more there than just meets the eye
What are the ways that the magic comes in
That can turn a song into a sigh
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming
Or maybe I'm going insane
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again

Here I am standing beside you
Oh life's such a wonderful game

Look at me now, I'm falling in love

It's this and so much more that makes me love you

Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on
Then a man of low degree stood by her side

Malgré qu'il ai bien des défauts
C'est lui que j'ai dans la peau

Tel qu'il est, il me plait

Et je l'aime
C'est un vrai gringalet
Aussi laid qu'un basset
Mais je l'aime

Pour tenir le coup il se dose
De quintonine à tous les r'pas

Of things that can't be mine

In her lonely bed
Staring at the ceiling
Wishing she was somewhere else instead

Waiting for a call

Wishing she had never left at all

Smiled like Mona Lisa

Of the flower-power

Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying

Maybe the stars will align in the night...
