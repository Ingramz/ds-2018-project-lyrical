Rusted Root,"Blind before my head turned to the ones I love,
Blind, to the ones I love,
I will lift my head up to the ones I love,
We'll shine with the ones we love,
This blind disease has hurt so many times before

This blind disease has hurt so many times
Her reach for her, Her reach for her,
She long for my prayer.

My better love shown in the raging kind,
She long for my prayer, She long for my baby, 
I got love for her, she's my raging sign, 
This blind disease has hurt so many times before
I'll take my step, Back into me,
My better love shown, In faith I do believe.

Choked up my pawn, Move along my queen,
She love my prayer, Safety of my king. This blind 
Disease has hurt, so many times before, 
This blind disease has hurt, so many 
Times before I got to my highest point

Lovers and friends, My hurt is gone, Been hoping to find my way,
Hands of light will come, To uncrystalize our fear,

Cause in faith I do believe

I lock myself in shelter in the bush thick and thorned,
In the bush thick and thorned,
With the infinite being my god,
Walking with the great and vast with no limits in my head,
No limits in my head, as I circle the human,
Skull birds, in existing lapse of time,
I am pushing the morning forward the choice is yours and mine

As we all go now, we go

Walking with my arms,
At my past, I'll walk until I follow, only you, only you,
I'll wake up and I'll dream of my past I'll wake up
and I'll sit down here with you, only you 
As I circle the human, skull birds,
In existing lapse of time,
I am pushing the morning forward the choice is yours and mine,

Well I'll fly down, pick myself 
With eagle eye, and my love will surely be,
My love will surely be",Infinite Space,1996
Rusted Root,"Well through the window she comes,
And through the window she comes,
She got a little rope tied, tied to her leg, 
Where it leads to I don't know,
But you can hand your babies up to the higher ground.

I'll run my hands through to you",River in a Cage,1996

Open wide to my grave
Spread these wings open wide
Open wide shed these braves

We only know our love is for you

Rusted Root,"It's in this hour, it's in my blood, I'm awake in you
And all these witnesses they stare me in the face
This time I won't wait too long to turn away
Fleeing from my head till the dawn, the dawn

'Cause when all I feel has been taken from my mouth
This 'no time' is real until I've compared it to myself
And still I couldn't be further

It's in your faces, familiar and true
It's what brings me here in front of you
I'm coming on like a dove stitching love
Through this crude amplification I call your bluff

And all these Gods, they wait for us now
In no time we see, no reason for my doubt
And still I couldn't be further

I've been away from, I've been away from you
I've been away from you, I've been away from you
I've been away from, I've been away from you
I've been away from you, I've been away from you

Rusted Root,"Here we stand again
In the year 1999
But you're so far
But yet so close

And in the ancestral rays of the sun
We're passing time in the video store
Remembering all the things
That we were

But I've been pushed back
To the cradle
Though I believe I'm bigger now
Although I'm lonely as a flower

In the alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun

Alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

And I swung the door wide open
Yes I've done my deeds adorned
When I crashed into your building

And I hope you don't cry to long
Huddled in debris land
But tomorrow's perfect
Tomorrow's Tuesday

In the alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weepin'
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

Alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weepin'
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

But darlin' don't you weep
Silver and gold
Aren't we lonely as a flower
Climbing above these walls

Aren't we lonely as a flower
Climbing above the walls
Well let's forget these stupid buildings
Come on my lover take the fall

In the alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day

Alabaster lazy sun
Never long time for the weeping
Alabaster lazy sun
In my day
In my day

Leaving us naked and so alive

Could kill you dead like a 44
I say who, who, who's it gonna be
When you're dead on the floor

Oh tell me where, where
Is the way to the door

Could kill you dead to get along

Roll, roll, my lady love
She don't want my love to go astray
Well I say who, who, who's it gonna be
When you have games to play

I'm gettin' tired of this crazy bone
It's like suckin' blood from a stone
Well tell me where, where
Is the taste I used to know

The poundin' in my head alone
Could kill you dead to get along
The poundin' in my head alone
Could kill you dead to get along, to get along

I hope a day never goes by
Without lookin' into those eyes
You're my love, my prayer

The poundin' in my head alone
Could kill you dead like a 44
I say who, who, who's it gonna be
When you're dead on the floor

Somewhere along these power lines

Stand up, state your name, like water into wine

To buy some clothes like I used to wear before
Curly haired sally says, ""She likes me a little better this way""

And everything I wish for I know I could
Only if everything I could I didn't wish for
It's a good day in the U.S.A., stripped down to your uncle long Johns
But no thanks, I'm good here in my magenta radio
Here in my magenta radio

Can I say something just a little more
I bet you, we could talk into the morning honey
I bet you we never see the morning
Without a hornet buzzing around our door

'Cause every time I look in your mirror, I see smoke from your gun
We both got itchy triggers and we wear them for fun
And we got two stories to tell and one of them must be wrong
But no thanks, I'm good here in my magenta radio

Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try
Hold me my lady, 'cause we all love even when we try

And we don't know our name, when we try
But we don't know our name

I see us kissing the earth, lovers of our way to be
Trying on shoes that don't really fit our feet
All in a dream we got burnt, all in a dream we got hurt
But we try and we try and we try and we

A glass of wine in her hand

To meet her connection

I went down 
To the Chelsea drug store
To get your prescription filled
I was standing in line 
With Mr. Jimmy
And man 
Did he look pretty ill
We decided 
That we would have a soda
My favorite flavor vanilla cream
And I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
And he said one word to me 
And that was dead

You can't always get 
What you want
You can't always get

No you can't always get

But if you try sometimes
Well you might find

To the demonstration
To get my fair share of abuse

Our frustration
And if we don't we?re gonna blow

On the world tonight with our blue diamonds that were once our fears pressing down on the town

Cause I found you now and forever I won't waste this breath Let time be by our side It's now and never I won't waste this breath

It?s older than anger, it?s infant and primal
It?s bubbly and grotesque
It?s in between what I know

And so I ask

Why should I cry
Why cry

You're the one, the one
I always wanted to be now
And ever since the break of dawn

you've been next to me
And my mood
You're greedier than sex

To where the woman lies
And she is dreaming of another

Was really bored

Drifting upon these same waves

A Saturday I'd not forget.

Took a human life to pay the debt.

I heard a scream, I turned, surprised
Felt the smoking pistol in my grip.

While the band played vulgar symphonettes

Used to trap OG with the E, on the Greyhound bus one pair of jeans

Pop a bottle, might toast somethin'

Hit the chest (?)
Mac attack on that ho shit, might walk around, get your throat split

Fuck around, hocas-pocus
You in focus, I'm a locust, see them big pictures and stay focused
Your ho luck atrocious, my bitches look ferocious
Breakin' shit psychosis, you niggas talkin' about practice
Roll around with that acid, if you don't know start askin'

Rusty & Doug,"Well, at birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me

The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

My Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
Even got a lady mink, a muskrat's cousin
Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em into money

Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my pop I've gotta go again
Well, Papa said, ""Son we've got lines to run
We'll come back again but first there's work to be done""

Time will wound all heels, and it ain't pretty

Rusty Kershaw,"Well, at birth mom and papa called their little boy Ned
Raised him on the banks of a river bed
On a houseboat tied to a big tall tree
A home for my papa and my mama and me

The clock strikes three and papa jumps to his feet
Already mama's cooking papa something to eat
At half past, papa he's ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He's gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

My Muskrat hides hanging by the dozens
Even got a lady mink, a muskrat's cousin
Got 'em out drying in the hot, hot sun
Tomorrow papa's gonna turn 'em into money

Well, they call mama Rita and my daddy Jack
Little baby brother on the floor that's Mack
Bren and Lin are the family twins
And big brother Ed's on the bayou fishing

On the river floats papa's great big boat
And that's how my papa goes into town
Takes him every bit of a night and a day
To even reach a place where the people stay

And I can hardly wait until tomorrow comes around
That's the day my papa takes his furs to town
Papa promised me that I could go
He'd even let me see a cowboy show

I saw the cowboys and Indians for the first time then
I told my pop I've gotta go again
Well, Papa said, ""Son we've got lines to run
We'll come back again but first there's work to be done""

He's got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana Rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He's setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man
Gotta make a living, he's a Louisiana man

Lately the news is weighing me down
I get confused, what's life all about?
I'm ready for some answers now

What if I keep my eyes on You
Could I sail across the ocean blue?
And Your sun will guide me through
If I go, this I know, I'm headed home

Once upon a time when I was so young
Looking back at all the things that I've done
I wonder if You were around

?Cause my family prays with all their hearts
That I could change
And I'm ready to start thinking it over

What if I keep my eyes on You
Could I sail across the ocean blue?
And Your sun will guide me through
If I go, this I know, I'm headed home

And wouldn't it be nice if we could live twice
And watch the sunset just one more time
Wouldn't it be nice if we could live twice
And watch the sunset just one more time

If I keep my eyes on You
Could I sail across the ocean blue?
And Your sun will guide me through?
If I go, this I know, I'm headed home

If I should die before I wake
I pray, Thee Lord, my soul to take

Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
And even sometimes he would go away, too

Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely,"" and ever since that day

I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

And lost boys like me are free

Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand

Holding the light 
Of my love. 
The heavens opened and closed, 
As well I might have supposed, 
And I am left in disabandon, 
So far removed from all that I had planned on. 

My days have grown so lonely, 
For I have lost my one and only; 
My pride has been humbled, 
But I am his, body and soul. 

I was a mere sensation, 
My house of cards had no foundation, 
Although it has tumbled, 
I still am his, body and soul. 

What lies before me? 
The future is stormy, 
A winter that's gray and old; 
Unless there's magic 
The end will be tragic, 
And echo the tale that's been told so often. 

My life revolves about him, 
What earthly good am I without him? 
My castles have crumbled, 
But I am his, body and soul.

Ruth Etting,"All too soon
We had to part
The moment you had touched my heart
And with you went my dream

All too soon
All too sweet
Was our affair
And you put all the sweetness there

What a shame that it's gone
All too soon
I knew the strange delights
That only you in love could bring

And as I reached the heights
The bottom fell from everything
You should know as well as I
Our love deserves another try

For we whispered goodbye

There's a somebody I'm longing to see

Of the Rose of Tacloban

Necessary to survive
And money makes it easy

Or what lies beyond tomorrow

The love and women
On a magazine page
Elegant woman
Like a paper parade

I don't go out dancing
I just stay at home
Cutting out their faces
And replacing them with my own

And replacing them with me own

Ruthie Ann Miles,"For seven years I've been in here
Seven years down in the hole, they said
""Your watch, your glasses, and your wedding ring
You won't need them anymore""

I felt abandoned--I felt cast aside
So where is God who never sleeps?
I heard a voice say, ""Why do you cry?""
Then I found my inner peace

Ninoy, you were my first love
But you said I was too tall
The heart gets stronger and grows colder
For the Rose of Tacloban

I begged to God, could he forgive me now
And take back all those things I said?
This moment was a gift from above
Maybe it's some kind of test

Take good care of him
Santo NiÃ±o, Santo NiÃ±o

Ninoy, remember a long time ago
You used to walk me to my home?
Who set you free? Who built this hospital?
You think I hate you, but you're wrong

For seven years I wore this crucifix
A necklace that watched over me
Face to face with mortality
I let go of all my fears

Now my husband he might hate you
But you know I saved your life
Ninoy, don't be a hero
I beg you, don't get on that flight

Until he hears an old train, rolling down the line
Then he hurries straight home, home to pack
And if he didn't go
Well I believe he'd blow his stack

That he wouldn't settle down, if he could

There's something over the hill that draws him in

(G) I'll sing you a true song of (D) Billy the (G) Kid
I'll (D) sing the record of (G) deeds that he did
Way out in New Mexico a long time (D) ago
When a (G) man's only friend was his (D) own forty- (G) four

Now when Billy the Kid was a very young lad
In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man

Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Before this young manhood reached its sad end
He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty one men

It was on one black night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty one men that I've put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two""

Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
A big moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City's best friend
The poor outlaw's life have reached its sad end

The one we all called Kurt

I know there's some mistake
How forgetful I'm becoming
Now you fixed your business straight

I remember you in Hemlock Road
In nineteen fifty-six
You're a faggy little leather boy
With a smaller piece of stick

You're a lashing, smashing hunk of man
Your sweat shines sweet and strong
Your organs working perfectly
But there's a part that's not screwed on

Weren't you at the Coke convention
Back on nineteen sixty-five
You're the misbred, gray executive
I've seen heavily advertised

You're the great, gray man whose daughter licks
Policemen's buttons clean
You're the man who squats behind the man
Who works the soft machine

Come now, gentleman
Your love is all I crave
You'll still be in the circus when I'm laughing
Laughing in my grave

When the old men do the fighting
And the young men all look on
And the young girls eat their mothers meat
From tubes of plasticon

Be wary of these my gentle friends
Of all the skins you breed
They have a tasty habit
They eat the hands that bleed

So remember who you say you are
And keep your noses clean
Boys will be boys and play with toys
So be strong with your beast

Oh Rosie dear, don'tcha think it's queer
So stop me if you please

",Better Things to Think About,1980
Ry Cooder,"This here was our situation 
We was just young wild wood boys 
New as the birth of the nation 
The kind that the Army employs 
High riding Rebs from Missouri 
Fought for the gray and Quantril
Caught up by the battle and the fury 
Back when just living was hell 

After the battle was over 
And after the Union had won 
It was quitting that made us the loser 
So we kept doing just what we'd done 
Riding as comrades together 
We looted the trains and the banks 
Removing that carpetbag money 
And sticking it hard to the Yanks 

Death always follows behind you 
When you ride down that old outlaw trail 
Someday a bullet will find you 
Or you'll rot like a corpse in some jail 
Turning your back to the danger 
Is a wager no man can afford 
'Cause gold turns a friend to a stranger 
Like old Judas turned on our Lord 

Men are revered and remembered 
While they lay in that coffin and rot 
Some live in the legends of history 
Most are forever forgot 
The victory it goes to the strongest 
And only the strong will survive 
Survival is living the longest 
But nobody gets out alive 

The questions don't never get answered 
And the rights, they're remembered all wrong 
The facts, they can get plenty confusing 
So someday if you happen to be singing this song 
Remember it's just for the record 
You can't change the handwork of fate 
And tell 'em I lived for the moment 
And I died when I tried to go straight",Wildwood Boys,1980

Ry Cooder,"(Bob Dylan)

It's been raining in my mouth all day
Dripping down to my clothes
My patience it is wearing thin
Got a fire inside my nose
Searching for the truth the way God designed it
The truth is I might drown before I find it

Well, I need a woman
Yes, I do
Need a woman
Yes, I do
Someone who can see me as I am
Give the kind of love that don't have to be condemned

And I want you to be that woman
Every night
Be that woman
Treat me right

I've had my eyes on you, baby
For about five long years
You probably don't know me at all
But I've seen your laughter and I've seen your tears
Now you don't frighten me
I ain't no defendant
And you look like it wouldn't hurt you none
To have a man of understanding

Well, I need a woman
Oh, don't I
Need a woman
Bring it home safe at last

I've seen you standing on the corner
Seen you sitting down in the park
Been watching you in the sunshine
Walking with you in the dark

And I want you to be that woman
Treat me right
Be that woman
Every night

Well, if you believe in something long enough
You just naturally come to think it's true
There ain't no wall you can't crossover
Ain't no fire you can't walk through
Well, believing is all right
Just don't let the wrong people know what it's all about
They might put the evil eye on you
Use their hidden powers to try to turn you out

Well, I need a woman
Just to be my queen
Need a woman
Black, white, yellow, brown, blue or green

Riding out with me at midnight
Like two Spanish desperadoes
Gazing down upon the futile world
In her Cadillac Eldorado
We will penetrate the storm
In search of truth that has not been tested
But she better bring along her checkbook
Just in case we get arrested

And I want you to be that woman

Ry Cooder,"Brand new day, brave new man
It's a miracle what love can do
All the joys romance can bring
Come smiling down on a heart that's true
When love is real, you can't turn it around
It's like a river running down to the sea
This old world turns around for lovers like you
It's not The Way Love Turned Out For Me.
 
People in love build a house they can share
Takes a long time to get it just right
But a fire can start in the kitchen somewhere
And burn that little house down overnight
That flame burning bright in your heart
I believed that you turned it on just for me
Another man held that fire 
Burned our house to the ground
That's The Way Love Turned Out For Me.
 
People turn out for the big show
Pretty flowers turn out in the spring
And the light turns out in the kitchen
When somebody pulls on the string
But there's no light burning in my kitchen
And no doors open up with my key
And I ain't got no one to turn to

Lonesome outerspace invader blasting through the night
Tuning in the soul music on the satellite
All that low-down funky rhythm makes him jump and shout
Just got to find that ghetto planet that everyone's talkin' about

Tuning in the local scene on the radio
The D.J. on the radar screen is telling him where to go
The funky fever's getting louder, sounds just like a soul encounter
Cruisin' for some bar-be-que right up Central Avenue
And he's got a little dance he wants to do

He pulls up to a big night club in his UFO
Gets right in with all the folks out on the big dance floor
It really stops the action, everybody's mystified
To see that little step he's got as he goes glidin' by

Now, he ain't doin' the Gigolo 'cause he ain't got no hips
Looks like the Funky Chicken man, 'cept he ain't got no hips
Those shiny metal threads he's wearin' really got some class
I'd say he was doin' the Bomp, but I can't seem to find his ass

Now, everybody fall in love
He's reet, he's neat, he can't be beat
You shake your shimmy like I shake mine
He's hand held and he's jet propelled
Shake it up from sun to sun
He's fast and loose, he's full of juice
Shake it like an atomic bomb
He's got the goose so what's the use
That UFO has landed in the ghetto

When the night falls, it falls on me

And the whores that now work where we first met
I want to hold you so bad that it hurts
And it only gets worse when the sun sets

'Cause when the night falls, it falls on me
And when the day breaks, I'm in pieces
When the night falls, it falls on me
And I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely

And then I see you and call out your name
But down the street you keep walking away
And when I reach you
A stranger looks over her shoulder then it starts all over

Now the moon is a thin silver line
Disappearing behind a skyscraper
And I climb my stairs to my dark hotel room
Through the litter of Sunday newspapers

Try to get up, could not get out the door
And there's a big ole snake

How different the ladies of long ago to the modern women that we all know
If you observe you are bound to see that sex has changed entirely
A long ago their one ambition in life, was to be a mother and a wife
Now they go out imitating the males by smoking cigarettes and drinking cocktails

Girls used to like to be school teachers, gradually becoming stenographers
We next hear of them as lecturers, authors and engineers
There is no limit to their ambition, they've even gone in for aviation
And if you men don't assert control your women will rule the world

Play a bridge!

Now they say anything that your man can do, they also can achieve too
And they've openly boasted to do their part in the literature and art
We will next hear of them as candidates for the president of these United States
And if you men don't assert control your women will rule the world

Now you hear on the radio and TV of a great national calamity
Story of tragic proportion coming from the White House in Washington
The facts in the case are clearly stated the president is being cruely dominated
By a international conspiracy that threatens world peace and security

When you reach the broken promised land 
And every dream slips through your hands

Let me tell you how it was with me
Old Satan had me bound in chains 
And I had no liberty
One day my heart got troubled 
All about my dwelling place
I heard the Lord when He spoke to me 
And he told me to leave that place
So I moved, I moved

I'm ready to tell you my secret now
I see dead people, but they don't know that they're dead
And sometimes, when it get real cold, that means they're mad

[Shoestring - singing]
Can't go to sleep I hear a beat, it sounded just like feet
Jump off my seat, see they hit my window, cause I gots the beat
I've seen a shadow pulling cattle from an early battle
I've seen this snake up in my shoe and all I heard was rattle (rattle sound)

Picked up the phone and it exploded like a fucking bomb
I'm seeing shadows biting me like they was Jeffrey Dahm
So many clicks, so many crews trying to blow my fuse
So many shadows in my yard that I feel abused (gong sound)

I'm hearing voices in my head and I can see a tread
I'm seeing scores, a pitbull and he's smelling dead
Slipped on my slippers, the ones with the chromed zippers
Knocked out a shadow in my room, all these Jack the Rippers

I fight with tigers, the shadows say they're Michael Myers
Just like Jack Nickleson played ""The Wolf"" I hear my neighbors driers
All this pain in my brain makes me go insane
I'm hearing chains and tracks and running trains (train running, gong sound)

A lot of these soldiers in my kitchen with their bloody blades
No hands, no knives, just bodies and their hand grenades
I started ducking, them soldiers started busting at me
Flashbacks when I was two father hollered at me

Hearing whistles the click from pistols got me live annoyed
Past beef won't let me rest, I live like Sleepy Froyd
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow (echos, gong sound)

[Bootleg - talking]
We're all walking in the valley of the shadow of death
So concentrate on your family, friends and loved ones
Because you never know when there's a shadow

[Chorus: Kalonda, Ryan]
Shadow, every time I turn around there's a shadooooow
Though I walk through the valley of a shadooooow (gong sound)
Life's too short to take for granted fearing shadooooow
I can't take this pain I'm feeling from these

[Bootleg]
Woke up, hopped out the bed this morning, felt somebody watching
Opened my door no one was there I swear I hear'em knocking
Cocking my pistol cause I'm paranoid and in a zone
Somebody said whip me, but I know I'm home alone (gong sound)

Jumped in the shower, trying to wash away this eary feeling
Walked out my bathroom seeing shadows dancing on the ceiling
Put on my clothes and smoked a cigarette and brushed my grill
My pitbull Puppy barking at so what I know ain't real (dogs barking)

Turned on my T.V. watching CNN, I heard a boom (explosion)
Two shadows having sex, I hear'em fucking in my room
Exit my residence the only face's a gust of wind (wind whistling)
Too hard for wind, a shadow's what it must have been

Ain't no such things as ghosts, I'm tripping dawg and I know it
Walked towards my car, the horn went off, a shadow had to blow it (car honks)
I need a drink to think and sort out all these weird events
I killed a man, my life's been haunted ever since

I can't believe the shit I'm seeing turning up my bottle
I keep my eyes and I'll rip you, I swear I'm being followed
Can't goto sleep at night unless I take a sleeping pill
Reflections in the mirror fucking with my head for real (gong sound)

I never thought that there was nothing wrong with how I think
Until my momma told me: 'Leg, go see a shrink!
All these songs in my head and can't nobody tattle
Last night I killed two more, here comes another shadow

[Chorus]

[Bootleg - talking]
I thank God every morning when I wake up
'Cause you never know when you're gonna walk out your front door
And get murdered in your driveway
So I'll be telling you this: Keep your mind on your family, friends, and foes

'Cause most niggas is hoes (gong sound)
And they shoot you cause you bawling more than they is
So stay out them whole in the Warclubs
Nigga show love to your family and friends
And get your ass, fuck'em

Can you take away the pain of hurtful deeds

Hair all a mess and a dress all disheveled

Your cats on the sill and my head to your breast
Feeding your rhythms divine

Tasted the salt through your skin,

I had a firecracker waiting to blow
Breakin' like a rocket who was makin' its way
To the cities of Mexico
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A
I had a tar-hut on the corner of 10th
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold
But I've been broken up and busted up since

And love don't play any games with me, anymore
Like she did before
The world won't wait, so I better shake
That thing right out there through the door

Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good
Still amazed I didn't lose it on the roof of the place

Every day the children they were singing their tunes
Out on the streets and you could hear from inside
Used to take the subway up to Houston and 3rd
I would wait for you and I'd try to hide

In a church on the Upper West Side

And swim in the sea without clothes
With rain falling fast on the sea

Nothing much to speak of
But a rough diamond

Through love's fields, so blindly

But, tonight you're sleeping alone without him
Tonight you're sleeping alone without him
And everything went up in smoke
Like wildflowers
Wildflowers, dear

Shuffles through the parade
Of a sleepless circus promenade
Hold on, dear

Poor girl, no Ma
Sister steals her a coat
For the windless breezes
Sleep now and Jesus will come, dear

Nothing moves or even smiles,

I guess I want a little too much

I lose my breath when she comes my way
But I don't even know her number
Even know her name

For every day of sun, I get a month of rain
For every day of sun, I get a month of rain
Oh, I see your face
Oh, I lost my place

I remember seeing you the other day
But I don't remember saying goodbye
All's I know is the sky went clear
And, babe, I think I wanted to die

And it never lasts

And watch the world go by
Am I'm missing a page

But it's written in a language that was meant to fuck you up
And I can never get close enough

But I lie down on her pillow
And you feel like you was going away
Going away when you got no place to go
But back in her arms lying on her pillow
Curled up with a book down on Cherry Lane

Like Christmas on a river

The kind that someone writes but never sends

I know someday it's gonna end
And when you get old
I bet you miss your friends

As angry as a breeze
Tugging hard upon the sails
I been moving through these streets forever
From Baltimore to Amsterdam
These things inside me they repeat like broken records
Spinning pretty somethings behind my eyes
And when I canÂ´t look at you
I can paint you picture perfectly in my mind
And when I get old
IÂ´m gonna miss you all the time

That wind up in the trees
Scattering bluebirds all over the place
Shuffling children in the piles of leaves 
I wish I was the wind that touched your face

How do you keep love alive?

What, what are the words

""We need to talk,"" or
""I'm confused, maybe later you can come over""
