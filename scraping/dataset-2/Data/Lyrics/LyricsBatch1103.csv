The Chemical Brothers,"As I walked along
The supposed golden path
I was confronted
By mysterious spectre
He pointed to the graveyard
Over on yonder hill
I paused in cosmic reflection
Confused on wondering
Of how I came to die

Hm!
I was confused
Coz if I was dead
How and why did I die
And I composed myself
And decided I should face it

Then I stood paralized
On the supposed golden path
And I was confronted
By powerful demon force
And there was the devil
And we spoke his words
Flowed like glowing lava from the mouth of a volcano
And I said:
Help me, Lord!
I found myself in some kinda hell
But I did not believe in heaven and hell
World in opposites kind of reality

But I gained control of myself
And decided to press on

As I walked along
The supposed golden path
I was trembling with fear
All the lions and the wizards yet to come
I seen in the distance
Silver mountains rising high in the clouds
And a voice from above did whisper
Some shining answer from the moon

Please forgive me
I never meant to hurt you",The Golden Path (Ewan's Rave Hell Dub),2003
The Chemical Brothers,"here we go
Don't rely on this, to get you high
Don't rely on us, to get you high

Wait, hold up, electrify, death defy, elect the high, Connect the sky
To the sensei, blade keeps spinning
All around the world, but the world keeps sp-sining
I've been in crazy situations
Since I've learned the art of watching paitence
Big shout to the hip-hop nation, just dance with elation, yeah

Don't rely on this, to get you high
Don't rely on us, to get you high

Yo, put the needle on the record, here we go again
It's the brank new funk for real
Mass appeal, it's everlasting, asking you forcasting direction
Insurrection is served on a 12 inch platter
Mostly incorrect data, over matter
Is a mind that you'll find, this desire, is international, Rational
Back in the day we listened to rap, Bill gats in the backpack
Yo, try many styles for the 3-1,instead of writing a rhyme i would rather be one
two yo can watch what you do and live in the now, but believe there's only a few
Sometimes you've got to get inside to get it high

In fresh water and part of their life in salt water
Wow, very interesting
They change round a couple of days after spawning then we die

They looked around and stood like I was on crack
I heard somebody say out loud
""What the fuck is that?
This nigga's dancing like a fish, while he's doing the snap""

But the more I kept doing it, the more they were feeling it
And then I heard some bitches say, ""Yo, that nigga's killing it""

On September twelfth right here
In front of the Waverly
But unfortunately I lost his address
He was last seen with his friend, a drummer
He resembles George Harrison of The Beatles
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back
I love him but it embarrasses me
To walk down the street with him
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere
And he wears his white crash helmet
He has golden chains on his leather jacket
And on the back are written the names
""Mary"" and ""Mom"" and ""Hell's Angels""

I'm in the park with my girlfriend and please
Tell him Angela and I don't want the two dollars back just him",Frank Mills,1988

Come on ev'rybody, I say now  let's play a game.
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name.
The first letter of the name,
I treat it like it wasn't there,
But a ""B"" or an ""F""  or an ""M"" will appear;
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.
 
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold, 
Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold, 
Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!
 
But if the first two letters are ever the same,
Crop them both, then say the name.
Like Bob, Bob, drop the ""B's"", Bo-ob.
Or Fred, Fred, drop the ""F's"", Fo-red, 
Or Mary, Mary, drop the ""M's"", Mo-ary.
That's the only rule that is contrary.
 
And then I say ""Bo"" add a ""B"" then I say the name.
Then ""Bo-na-na fanna"" and ""fo""
And then I say the name again with an """"f"" very plain,
Then  ""fee fi"" and a ""mo""
And then I say the name again with an ""M"" this time.
And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme.

You know tomorrow is their future

They all gather 'round me, huh

I was happy as a lark
But now I go for walks
To the movies, maybe to the park
I have a seat on the same old bench
To watch the children play, huh
You know tomorrow is their future
But for me just another day
They all gather 'round me, huh
They seem to know my name
We laugh, tell a few jokes
But it still doesn't ease my pain

I keep sayin' she'll be back
But today again I've lied

Oh, I hear her voice as the cold winds blow
In the sweet music on my radio

The Chieftains,"Where Lagan streams sing lullabies
There blows a lily fair.
The twilight gleam is in her eye,
The night is on her hair.
And like a lovesick lenashee
She hath my heart in thrall.
No life have I, no liberty,
For love is Lord of all.

And often when the beetles horn
Has lulled the eve to sleep,
I'll steal into her sheiling lorn
And through the doorway creep.
There on the cricket's singing stone,
She makes the bogwood fire
And sings in sweet and undertone,
The song of hearts desire.",My Lagan Love,1988
The Chieftains,"On Raglan Road on an Autumn Day,
I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare
That I may one day rue.

I saw the danger, yet I walked
Along the enchanted way
And I said let grief be a falling leaf
At the dawning of the day.

On Grafton Street in November,
We tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine where can be seen
The worst of passions pledged.

The Queen of Hearts still baking tarts
And I not making hay,
Well I loved too much; by such and such
Is happiness thrown away.

I gave her the gifts of the mind.
I gave her the secret sign
That's known to all the artists who have
Known true Gods of Sound and Time.

With word and tint I did not stint.
I gave her reams of poems to say
With her own dark hair and her own name there
Like the clouds over fields of May.

On a quiet street where old ghosts meet,
I see her walking now away from me,
So hurriedly. My reason must allow,
For I have wooed, not as I should

A creature made of clay.
When the angel woos the clay, he'll lose
His wings at the dawn of the day.",Raglan Road,1988

The Chieftains,"In Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July,
From a boreen green came a sweet colleen
And she smiled as she passed me by.
She looked so sweet from her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair.
Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there.

From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and
From Galway to Dublin Town,
No maid I've seen like the brown colleen
That I met in the County Down.

As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head,
And I looked with a feelin' rare,
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by,
""Whose the maid with the nut brown hair""?
He smiled at me and he says, say's he,
""That's the gem of Ireland's crown.
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,
She's the star of the County Down"".

[Chorus]

At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes,
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked
Right for a smile from my nut brown rose.
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke
Till my plough turns rust colored brown.
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside
Sits the star of the County Down.

The Chieftains,"I knew of two sisters whose name it was Christmas,
And one was named Dawn of course, the other one was named Eve.
I wonder if they grew up hating the season,
The good will that lasts til the Feast of St. Stephen

For that is the time to eat, drink, and be merry,
Til the beer is all spilled and the whiskey has flowed.
And the whole family tree you neglected to bury,
Are feeding their faces until they explode.

There'll be laughter and tears over Tia Marias,
Mixed up with that drink made from girders.
Cause it's all we've got left as they draw their last breath,
Ah, it's nice for the kids, as you finally get rid of them,
In the St Stephen's Day Murders.

Uncle is garglin' a heart-breaking air,
While the babe in his arms pulls out all that remains of his hair.
And we're not drunk enough yet to dare criticize,
The great big kipper tie he's about to baptize.

With his gin-flavored whiskers and kisses of sherry,
His best Chrimbo shirt slung out over the shop.
While the lights from the Christmas tree blow up the telly,
His face closes in like an old cold pork chop.

And the carcass of the beast left over from the feast,
May still be found haunting the kitchen.
And there's life in it yet, we may live to regret,
When the ones that we poisoned stop twitchin'.

Not one on board was free
We were all confined to our bunks
With no one to pity me

No fond mother dear, our father kind
To comfort my head went to sore
This made me think more on the girl I left
On Paddy's Green Shamrock Shore

Well, we safely reached the other side
In fifteen and twenty days
We were taken as passengers by a man
And he led us in six different ways

To leave their own country, it would grieve their heart sore

Gone are the winders of baskets and creels
And away o'er the ocean, go journeyman cowboys
And fiddlers who play out the old mountain reels

And most of her tradesmen did work for good pay
Ah, but since our manufacturers have crossed the Atlantic
Well, it's now that I must follow onto Amerikay

And now to conclude and to finish my ditty
If e'er a friendless Irishman should happen my way

Right proudly high in Dublin town
Hung they out a flag of war

While Brittania's huns with their long range guns
Sailed in through the foggy dew

Rang mournfully and clear

Springing of the year
While the world did gaze with deep amaze
At those fearless men but few
Who bore the fight that freedom's light
Might shine through the foggy dew
And back through the glen
I rode again
And my heart with grief was sore
For I parted then with valiant men

And there my love, he sits him down.
He takes a strange girl on his knee

And kissed me darlin' mother, drank a pint of beer,
Me tears and grief to smother, off to reap the corn,

Leave where I was born, I cut a stoat black thorn to banish ghosts and goblins,
In a pair of brand new of brogues, I rattled over the bogs, frightened all the dogs,
On the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,

And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!
In Dublin next arrived, and thought it such a pity to be so soon deprived,
A view of that fair city, then I took a stroll,

All amongst the quality, me bundle it was stole,
In that neat locality, something crossed me mind, when I looked behind,
No bundle I could find, upon me stick a wobblin. Enquiring after the rogue,
Said me Connaught brogue, was not much in vogue,

On the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!
The boys of Liverpool, when we safely landed, called meself a fool,

I could no longer stand it, me blood began to boil,
Me temper I was losing, for old Erin's isle,
They began abusing, horah say I, me Shelelagh I let fly,
Some Galway boys were by, they saw I was a hobblin',

With a loud hurray, they joined in the afray,
We quickly cleared the way,
For the rocky road to Dublin, 1,2,3,4,5
Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road,
And all the way to Dublin, whacks fer al de da!",The Rocky Road to Dublin,1995
The Chieftains,"Oh the sisters of mercy
They are not departed or gone 
They were waiting for me 
When I thought that I just can't go on 

And they brought me their comfort 
And later they brought me this song 
Oh I hope you run into them
You who've been traveling so long. 

Yes, you who must leave everything 
That you cannot control 
It begins with your family
But soon it comes around to your soul 

Well I've been where you're hanging
I think I can see how you're pinned 
When you're not feeling holy
Your loneliness says that you've sinned. 

Well they lay down beside me
I made my confession to them 
They touched both my eyes 
And I touched the dew on their hem 

If your life is a leaf 
That the seasons tear off and condemn 
They will bind you with love 
That is graceful and green as a stem. 

When I left they were sleeping
I hope you run into them soon
Don't turn on the lights
You can read their address by the moon 

And you won't make me jealous
If I hear that they sweetened your night
We weren't lovers like that 
And besides it would still be all right 

We weren't lovers like that 
And besides it would still be all right",Sisters of Mercy,1995

The Chieftains,"Ten years ago on a cold dark night 
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall light 
Just a few at the scene, and they all did agree 
That the man who ran looked a lot like me 

The judge said ""Son, what's your alibi? 
If you were somewheres else, then you won't have to die"" 
But I spoke not a word, tho' it meant my life 
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife 

Chorus: 
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
Visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows, but me 

The scaffold is high, eternity near 
She stands in the crowd, she sheds not a tear 
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan 
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones

The Chieftains,"I wished I had you in Carrickfergus,
Only for nights in Ballygrand,
I would swim over the deepest ocean,
The deepest ocean to be by your side.

But the sea is wide and I can't swim over
And neither have I wings to fly.
I wish I could find me a handy boatman
To ferry me over to my love and die.

My childhood days bring back sad reflections
Of happy days so long ago.
My boyhood friends and my own relations.
Have all passed on like the melting snow.

So I'll spend my days in endless roving,
Soft is the grass and my bed is free.
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus,
On the long road down to the salty sea.

And in Kilkenny it is reported
On marble stone there as black as ink,
With gold and silver I did support her
But I'll sing no more now till I get a drink.

I'm drunk today and I'm rarely sober,
A handsome rover from town to town.
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered
Come all ye young men and lay me down.",Carrickfergus (Air),1996

The Chieftains,"As I went out walking one fine summer morning
The birds in the bushes did whistle and sing
The lads and the lasses in couples were courtin'
Going back to the factory their work to begin

He spied one among them, she was fairer then many
Her cheeks like the red rose that blooms in the spring
Her hair like the lily that grows in Yon' valley
She was only a hard-working factory girl

He sat soft beside her, more closely to view her
She says, ""My young man, don't stare me so
I gold in my pocket and silver as well
No more will I answer that factory call""

The Chieftains,"On the night that I was married
And upon my marriage bed
There all came a bold sea captain
And he stood at my bed-head

Sayin', ?Arise, arise, young wedded man
And come along with me
To the lowlands of Holland
To fight the enemy?

Now then Holland is a lovely land
And upon it grows fine grain
Sure it is a place of residence
For a soldier to remain

Where the sugarcane is plentiful
And the tea grows on each tree
Well, I never had but the one sweetheart
And now he's gone far away from me

I will wear no stays around my waist
Nor combs all in my hair
I will wear no scarf around my neck
For to save my beauty there

And never will I marry
Not until the day I die
Since these four winds and these stormy seas
Came between my love and I

The Chieftains,"I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a Jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene laundries

Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly by her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
In the streaming stains

And temptresses like me

Sentenced into dreamless drudgery

Oh charity!

If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene laundries

She was a cheeky girl
A flirt

A literal translation by j. mark sugars 1997

Once I was a gentle maiden,
But now I am a spent, worn-out widow,
My consort strongly plowing the waves
Over the hills and far away.

He is my hero, my gallant darling,
He is my caesar, a gallant darling;
I've found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away.

Every day I am constantly enduring grief,
Weeping nitterly and shedding tears,
Because my lively lad has left me
And no news is told of him - alas!

The cuckoo does not sing cheerfully at noon
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nut-tree woods
Nor summer morning in misty glen
Since my lively boy went away from me.

Noble, proud young horseman,
Youth without gloom, of pleasant countenance,
A swift-moving fist, nimble in a fight,
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong.

Let a strain be played on musical harps,
And let many quarts be filled on the table,
With high spirit, without fault, without gloom,
That my lion may receive long life and health.

Gallant darling for a while under sorrow,
And ireland completely under black cloacks,
I have found neither rest nor fortune
Since my gallant darling went far away

But the want of money sure leaves me behind

And still she cried, ""I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me what will I do""

I know my love is an arrant rover
I know he'll wander the wild world over
In dear old Ireland he'll no longer tarry
An American girl he's sure to marry

And still she cried, ""I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest""
And still she cried, ""Bonny boys are few
And if my love leaves me what will I do""

And still she cried, ""I love him the best
And a troubled mind sure can know no rest""

And if my love leaves me what will I do""

Hurry home to me

When shadows fall I sit alone
And as my eyes get misty
I still recall how much I love
The way you used to kiss me
Though you're away
I love still
I always will

Oh, sailor boy

To those last days
When we were still together
And once again
I hear you say
That you'll be mine forever
I hope and pray
Those words were true
I wish I knew

Don't know why I do

Don't know why I love you, don't know why I care
I just want your love to share

I wonder why, I love you like I do
Is it because I think you love me too
I wonder why, I love you like I do, like I do

I told my friends that we would never part
They often said that you would break my heart
I wonder why they think that we will part, we will part

When I'm away, I wonder what you do

The mists enfold us gently smelling
Breeze in our ears softly telling
Of the days of light and laughter long ago
They trace us, taste us, touch our hair
Show us a castle and show us to their lair - to their lair
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry
We've got feverish sweat and aching bones
But please oh God, don't take us home.
It's pretty cool but we can't rest
The purple sun sets in the west
We prance on gold - red summer lawns
Dragons-blood evening, the buzz of swarms
Of lawnmowers mowing summer lawns away, far away,
I realise we really are quite far away, far away,
Far away, far away
And the rolling moon rocks on by
We dance until we start to cry

But please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home
Please oh God, don't take us home.

She was just my little satin doll
I met her down by the blossom tree
She has beauty like the moon far beyond my words
Like a sunset flock of firebirds, oh
Satin doll, satin doll, satin doll, satin doll
I can't take her no more
I can't take her no more
I can't take her no more
I can't take her no more
Satin doll, satin doll, satin doll, satin doll
Her voice disappeared over the hills
Over mountains made of blue crystal
She was just my little satin doll -
I met her down by the blossom tree
(Where is she?) In a rain forest. Satin doll
(Where is she?) In a sunny field. Satin doll
(Where is she?) Oriental garden. Satin doll
(Where is she?) In a paper temple. Satin doll
She was just my little satin doll -
I met her down by the blossom tree.

The Chills,"You don't need to repeat it, repeat it
I hared it the first time time time

Well, you won't stop by
And tell me what the trouble is
I couldn't care less, ha ha, but my double does
And he told me we're both superseded
So why not drop by, burst my bubble for me

So simple to be cynical
Respond to things with ease
Once an attitudes selected
Then behavior is a breeze

They think they've got it covered
But they've got it all wrong
Hard people make hard times far worse
Not the reverse

It's the contemporary trap

They want to tell you where it's at
When the past is thought irrelevant
Our destiny's black

For they've limited themselves
To an urbanite perspective
And the build-up, rear-down
Press-gang acid attack

Familiarity breeds contempt
And suppresses attempts

Familiarity breeds contempt

Sour seeds grown into stifling creepers
Bitterness feeds on a drive alive
And now my heart bleeds
Familiarity breeds contempt
And a row of resentments

Familiarity breeds contempt
And I'm not exempt",Familiarity Breeds Contempt,1990
The Chills,"Dawn draws near, 
Time flies quitely,
Soft warm felt close by,
I lie here quite still,
It's a thrill.

She,
Who sleeps alongside,
A stranger last week,
Is part of my life,
I look at her with just one single sheaf of colour,
Sunlight playes above her,
Will she stay and share some double summer?
Live never tires of great surprises,
Love may have touched us here,
And summers in the air,
Everywhere.

She,
Seems very like me,
The longer we spoke
The more I could see,
If we were to join our forces
And combine resources,
We could share the summer,
And enjoy its deeper secrets,
Life never tires of great suprises,
Love may have touched us here, 
With something we can share

And some sometimes I hear distant thunder,
Troubles bubbling under,
And I start to wonder,
Maybe she will crack my concerns till they scatter like dust?
Not a thing in this world would be stronger than us.
If she said that she'd stay,
I forever would treasure her trust,
For that's enough.

But maybe these are flights of fancy,
When she wakes she'll leave me, 
But then I see her watching -
And she's smiling,
Life has the strangest way of saying:
Love will occur here now.

Here goes, double summer, 
Sharing with one another.
Here goes, double summer, 
Sharing with one another.

Here goes,
Here goes.",Double Summer,1992
The Chills,"Halo, can you here me?
Halo, fading in silence

I know you hear me
I know you're there being quiet
Someday your song I'll sing for you that finally says
Goodbye
Right now the words don't come tome
I'm torn apart trying

Love grows, but not when you're absent
What they can do to trust, look what it's done for us
How could it change from what it was so quickly to what
It is now?
After that mad year dreading this, the fear of finding
Out

Far beyond reach
Far beyond hope
Where even dreams feature a sad lonely show

Halo (halo)
Halo (halo)
Halo

I can still touch you in my mind
I know precisely what you're like
Follow your footsteps through the sand
Understand?

Last time we kissed
That night was a mess
Didn't it rain or was it you?

These days I'm watching replays
Triggered in my mind's eye, no matter how I try
I see our love in many lands, especially memories of
Our
But Paris, Athens and Amsterdam, and ever London now is

Far beyond reach
Far beyond hope
Where even dreams feature a sad lonely show

Still, when I find I'm in your town
And I would love to come around
It's only sixteen minutes there, on a bike
But I get feelings, can't shake them off
Sometimes it seems I've been robbed

The Chills,"Eyes, I've opened mine
I've seen they signs
We live in times designed to test, select the best
And train the rest to serve and blindly follow

Rise giants, can't have you sleeping so long
Start stretching, we need your strength to move on
Stand tall in defense of your land
Reach out lend us a hand

For it seems all cultures dream
They have a giant who is sleeping
Or a king who will return in times of need
To fight for setting his people free

They teach the kids which fads to follow
So they're unaware tomorrow
When another crippled culture
Dies in the shadow 'neath the corporate vulture

Rise giants, how have you slept for so long?
Start stretching, we need your strength to move on
Stand tall in defense of your land
Rise up to fight the force that draws us backwards
 
Back along the track we just came down
Everyday losing ground
For so few dare to move forward
Or even look all around

When people before could take it no more
They'd create a big friend like Gigantor
By getting in touch with force and much more powerful
Stuff stored deep within us

For it seem all cultures dream
They have a giant who is sleeping
Or a king who will return in times of need
To fight for setting his people free

Free, if anyone asked me
I'd take the chance and shake the Red King
To see, if we are in his dream
The time's right, we should wake all our giants

We should summon them now to rise upon our enemies, and
Like dominoes they will fall over
For I believer our destiny is lying in the eyes of our
Giants",Sleeping Giants,1992
The Chills,"How many years now of anticipating
I can't help hating the waiting and waiting
Believing that time will alleviate all I'll
Or in the long run create some asylum

I've heard all the brilliant advise
I learned that everything comes in a price and that the
Truth is harder
I was wrong
We're going to lose each other for so long

A sad waste, that bittersweet aftertaste
I don't want to face up the facts
I know the truth is harder, that right or wrong
We're going to lose each other for so long

Cause at the moment I'm boarding my plane
I don't know when I'll see you again
And our feelings may just fade away
I've been avoiding those questions, questions

There'll be a calmer time when everything's organized
Everything's simplified
No one persuading me to seek some prize that isn't
Found anywhere
Just karmic injustice here but who do you sue?

We're going to lose each other
We're going to lose each other
We're going to lose each other, so long

I hope we can handle the yearning and learning
Cause we can't keep these wheels from tuning

It felt right that tender respite
Before the warm interlude drifted from sight
And now we lose each other, now we lose each other
We're going to lose each other for so long
So long

Cause at the moment I'm boarding my plane
I don't know when I'll see you again

The Chills,"Cancer signs on are all wrong
Can't seem to form a firm felling at all
Chilled to the bone alone in jeopardy
Floating on tones and sound I seize, here in the water

For the deep black sea, it longs for me
It thinks that's where I belong

Ready or not, they're here
Treading the water
Dreadful and dark things drew nearer (nearer)

Circling round they're so close I shudder
Fins fan my face with delicate spray
Swelling and swaying
Scared all the small fish away

For the deep black sea
She years for me
She says with her I will stay

I'd consider swimming for shore
Arms are swollen and sore
Watching the awesome glide
Hear their unholy howl, as Water Wolves prow

I will think of something for sure
Dada da da da da, dada da da da da
Dada da da da da, dada da da da da
Dreading the water, pray they go away

Where are my wolves?
No sound
Then wind ships around and ripples are crowned
Crescent and wake appear
Overcome fear, overcome fear

We slowly spiral down

The Chinkees,"We heard a loud sound from the ground
Making top news in town
Got scared, ran away
Got to live another day

Story read, someone dead
Any help to find a clue?
Did you see or hear anything different out there?

No one gives a call
Even though it was a busy street
People all around with survival as their own case

Fighting for your own self
And more shared togetherness
Two kids are lying dead with a bullet in their head

Now is the time we make some noise
Get our freedom back
Hold together, share together, backs together all the time
One more death is one too many

Our kids should be alive and running
Visions gone, feeling strong, no more gangs are out there gunning
Is this just a dream or am I in a fairytale?
I want to believe

See someone shoot a man
Don't want to be involved?
Why don't you watch and leave

Saw the cold wind breathing through my sight
I thought about my dad tonight
And asked God, ""Is he gonna be alright?""

And my mind thinks I can't give enough
And I can't pour enough
And my love is not enough in this big world

Sat and talked to dad today
He told me stories leaving for the states
No time to share my father's time
Just learning who this man is I call dad

And I can't pour enough
And my love is not enough in this big world

But you really should stop talking
About the problems of a racist country
Called the United States of America

For the last few years and I've felt no hate
No hate for my differences
How about it?

So angry, angry I sat down
And wrote this song to tell you how I feel
My brothers shot for all of us
More grave than butchered cattle lining up

How brave to live with blinders on
You're living in a drunken college fairyland

",Japanese Exchange Student,1999
The Chinkees,"Wake up, eyes wide
This is the day that I've been looking for
I try to wake up mom and dad
So I can open up my presents, yeah, yeah

Pictures, music
Something get you kind of started
You think about the homeless man
Is he getting fed today?

I can't wait, let's be quick
I want to see what presents I got
I've been good this year
I've been good this year

Family, singing
Lots of smiles show on my face
Homeless, hungry
Still I complain about the things I don't have

Justice, feelings
We really need to come together
Fight for our minds
To be clear enough to see the problems

I can't wait, let's be quick
I want to see what presents I got
I've been good this year

With gifts and things all the kiddies will remember

Hang up your stockin', hang up your stockin'
Hang up your stockin' on Christmas Eve
'Cause Santa's on his way

So boys and girls here's something to remember
Listen to me through the year
If you're not good and if you're not tender
Santa's sure to hear

Get ready for bed, he'll be coming soon

And just before you settle down
You better be sure that you

Running here and there, all around the square
Sayin', ""Catch me if you can!""

Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard him holler, ""Stop!""

The Chipmunks,"Hey, Dave, 'twas the night before Christmas we'll go!
Hi, boys, here I go!

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
One, two, three, four, no, Dave, don't we wanna hear some more!

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
And mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,
Had settled our heads for a long winter's nap,
When out on the lawn there a rose such a clatter,
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon outside was shining on the snow
When the look will right on the ground below,
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More faster than eagles the reindeer came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;

""Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!
On, Comet! On Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.

His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His cute little mouth was just like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;

He had a broad face and a little round belly,
That shook, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,
And laying his finger aside of his nose,
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
""Merry Christmas to all, and good-night.""",The Night Before Christmas,1962

The Chipmunks,"Alright boys, so far so good
Now, what did Dr Doolittle wanna do with the animals
More than anything else, Alvin?
He wanted to learn to talk to them
And who promised to teach him how to talk to the animals, Simon?
Polynesia the parrot

Okay now, Theodore
Do you think you remember the song the doctor sang?
Ah, sure I can, if you help me
Okay Theodore, I'll start it out for you

If I could talk to the animals, just imagine it
Chatting with the chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger, chatting with a cheetah
What a neat achievement it would be

If we could talk to the animals, learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephants and eagle, buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea

I would converse in polar bear and python
I could converse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me, ""Can you speak rhinoceros?""
I'd say, ""Of courserous, can't you?""

If I conferred with our furry friends, man to animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak, and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me

If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we’d have asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions, walruses and sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be

If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on earth can plainly see
Discussing eastern art and dramas with intellectual llamas
That’s a big step forward you’ll agree

I’d learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekinese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I’d say “Whynotamous?” and would

If I could parlay with pachyderms
It’s a fairy tale worthy of Hans Anderson or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals, talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks, and squawks with the animals
And they could talk to him

I’d study every living creature’s language
So you could speak to all of them on site
If friends said, “Can he talk in crab or pelican?”
Then I'd say, “Well, I can” and I’d be right

And if you just stop and think a bit
There's no doubt of it we would win a place in history
If I could walk with the animals, talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak, and squawk with the animals
And they could squeak and squawk, and speak and talk to me

Alright fellas, I understand that's enough

Viens d'abord sur notre maison

The Chipmunks,"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen,
Comet and Cupid and Donder and Blitzen,
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names;
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say:
""Rudolph, with your nose so bright,
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him,
As they shouted out with glee,
""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,
You'll go down in history!""",Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,1995

And the only friend to guide you is an Evening Star,
The roughest, toughest man by far
Is Ragtime Cowboy Joe.

Every night they say he sings the herd to sleep
In a basso rich and deep,
Crooning soft and low

How he sings raggy music to his cattle
As he swings back and forward in his saddle
On his horse (a pretty good horse)
Who is syncopated gaited
And with such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater

How they run when they hear the feller's gun
Because the western folks all know:
He's a hifalootin' scootin', shootin'
Son-of-a-gun from Arizona

He beats it for the village where he always goes,
And ev'ry girl in town is Joe's

Is the wish of Barney and Ben

Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again

And the thing that will make them ring
Is the carol that you sing

The Chocolate Dandies,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1991

The Choir,"When I met him on a sidewalk
He was preaching to a mailbox
Down on 16th Avenue
And he told me he was Jesus
Sent from Jupiter to free us
With a bottle of tequila and one shoe

He raged about repentance
He finished every sentence
With a promise that the end was close at hand
I didn't even try to understand

He left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what he had to say
Then casually dismissed him as a fraud
I forgot he was created in the image of my God

When I met her in a bookstore
She was browsing on the first floor
Through a yoga magazine
And she told me in her past life
She was some plantation slave's wife
She had to figure out what that might mean

She believes the healing powers of her crystals
Can bring balance and new purpose to her life
Sounds nice

She left me wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
I was tongue tied, drawn by my conclusions
So I turned and walked away
And laughed at what she had to say
Then casually dismissed her as a fraud
I forgot she was created in the image of my God

Not so long ago, a man from Galilee
Fed thousands with His bread and His theology
And the truth He spoke, quickly became the joke of educated
Self-inflated Pharisees like me

And they were wide eyed in disbelief and disillusion
They were tongue tied, drawn by their conclusions
Would I have turned and walked away
And laughed at what He had to say
And casually dismissed Him as a fraud
Unaware that I was staring at the image of my God

Comes from inside my soul
[Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty]

I don't need you to 
Believe in me to let me know I'm worth believing in
I don't need you to
Hold me up, I know I can stand tall
I can stand tall
I can stand my own ground
I can stand tall upon my own two feet
Don't need to be part of somebody else to be complete
What I really need comes from deep inside of me

[Chorus]


Don't need to come to you for confirmation
Because I've finally come to this revelation
What I really need
I'm gonna find inside of me
Not in somebody else
Respect comes when you respect yourself 

[Chorus]

Don't need you to tell me I'm pretty 
To know I'm beautiful

English Version:

    1 Have mercy upon me, O God, after thy great goodness : according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences. 

    2 Wash me throughly from my wickedness : and cleanse me from my sin. 

    3 For I acknowledge my faults : and my sin is ever before me. 

    4 Against thee only have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight : that thou mightest be justified in thy saying, and clear when thou art judged. 

    5 Behold, I was shapen in wickedness : and in sin hath my mother conceived me. 

    6 But lo, thou requirest truth in the inward parts: and shalt make me to understand wisdom secretly. 

    7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean : thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 

    8 Thou shalt make me hear of joy and gladness : that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 

    9 Turn thy face from my sins : and put out all my misdeeds. 

    10 Make me a clean heart, O God : and renew a right spirit within me. 

    11 Cast me not away from thy presence : and take not thy holy Spirit from me. 

    12 O give me the comfort of thy help again : and stablish me with thy free Spirit. 

    13 Then shall I teach thy ways unto the wicked : and sinners shall be converted unto thee. 

    14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou that art the God of my health : and my tongue shall sing of thy righteousness. 

    15 Thou shalt open my lips, O Lord : and my mouth shall shew thy praise. 

    16 For thou desirest no sacrifice, else would I give it thee : but thou delightest not in burnt-offerings. 

    17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit : a broken and contrite heart, O God, shalt thou not despise. 

    18 O be favourable and gracious unto Sion : build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 

    19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations : then shall they offer young bullocks upon thine altar. ","Miserere mei Deus (Psalm 51), motet for chorus",2005

With Sade, and Janet, in a menage-a-trois

Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema

And laid low one wet september
It was then he wrote
The curse of her pearls
For which he is now remembered

By early next december
When fine sir john with all reason gone faded into his winter

And the wind did howl, and the trees did bow
The wolves all cried on the day he died

I survived their sugar cures and I dined with snow eating sinners
So much weather has come & gone as the swine roll in the embers
Give my regards to the captain of the guards who has lost his saber
While in the back room the boys have it large
While his mistress she sets the table

And the wine will spill and the moon will shine
The dream is gone and it's about time

Has it always been this way
So much sorrow so much pain
From this day nothing will be the same

Walk your plank and sink away, away

Hidden charms and gaze in wonder
Let the music play
Let the people parade in many colors

Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
But your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
And your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee 'fore I go

The Christians,"Oh the boy had a dream,
He once had a mind of his own,
So they took it away,
And quickly the damage is done.
Yes the heart disappears,
And gives way to despair,
They've got schemes and ideas,
But no loving and care.
And it needs that much more, needs it much more.

Well so much for your schemes,
So much for the things that you say,
While you're out chasing votes,
He's out chasing dragons all day.
So another child dies,
One more baby in black,
and the mother she cries,
As she's starting to crack,
And she can't take much more, no she can't take much more.

How many more times, must they shatter our trust,
Do we sit in silence,or stand up and scream in disgust.

I still have a dream, 
I still have a mind of my own,
They won't take it away,
Because I see the damages they've done.
I see one more boy dies,
One more baby in black,
hear a mother who cries,
But that don't bring him back.

How many times must we stand for their lies,
As the crocodile tears fill their eyes,
The suffering and hardship is not going to fall,
Try to call them again,
Because I can't take much more,
It's worth fighting for,
And we need love much more...",One More Baby in Black,1990
The Christians,"There ought to be a way,
For us to learn to live as one,
But the vicious games you play,
Well, they're not my idea of fun.
A dozen times you lied,
A dozen times I took you back,
Always hoping that you'd change,
But I must face the facts,
Because there you go again.

I am as trusting as a child,
A helpless fool at your command,
You can be so savage and so wild,
Or maybe more like underhand.
When the beast is gone,
The gentle soul inside you stirs,
But I know it won't be long,
Before the beast returns.

And there you go again, 
But I'm out of my mind,
You hurt me so again,
And now you're out of my mind,
And there you go again, a real fairweather friend.

So,I'm leaving you today,
A sadder but a wiser man,
It don't matter what you say,
I've taken all I can.

And there you go again, 
But I've made up my mind,
You won't hurt me so again,
Because you're out of my mind,
And there you go again,
But I've made up my mind.
And so the story ends,and now you're out of my mind.
There you go again, this broken heart will mend,
There you go again,
Farewell fairweather friend,
Goodbye.",There You Go Again,1990

Now I'm all alone, my life's in disarray
But try as I might, I can't live without you
So I cling to the hope of a brighter day

Oh, I know, we've been through this all before
How can I prove my love for you is real?
No, I can't do anymore, if I could only find words

And still I must learn to cope

I still have hope

I would let it be and leave all well alone

Feeling sure it's myself who's the foolish one

And I have heard that the die is cast
I know the word can be liberation
For a people free at last, free at last

Why can't we give peace a chance

The Christmas All Stars,"It was December 24 on hollis after the dark
My man santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
So Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Now all mase know
When it's eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
'Cause I know
When there's a Christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down

Now to me, pd I had a lot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who ain't caught me shaking the box
'Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock

Cookies and milk
Satin and silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat red suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
But here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality

Santa baby, are you really real?
Chris kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On Christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(You better praise him)

Santa baby
Just slip a benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight

It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin' this

It's the Grinch who stole Christmas
Climbin' down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasn't a boy I wouldn't have had nuthin to play wit!

On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
When I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the Cadillac and asked him ""yo what's up with that? ""
He said ""There ain't no Christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with god's angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That santa claus is a black man

And I don't know why
No I don't know why

Now that it's all over
Now there's just some coldness in my way
It's in my way
You took the clubs and the spades

You took the clubs and the spades
And I don't know why
No I don't know why
It's a shame it's not a game 

We're playing in it's just the blurred crusade

The Church,"A palm tree nodded at me last night
Said hey you look so pale
I don't know if it was the air or the breeze in my hair
I had a feeling I had failed
So down to the beach just out of reach
The moon was being trailed
A girl and a sailor and a hot dog trailer
That's their holy grail
The sand whispered heat and burned the feet
Of gulls landing on the shore
In the motel pool the waitress cools
She doesn't ask for more
She makes a wish she takes a risk
She opens up her door

Through human eyes she's a dolphin in disguise
It's the last night of the war
Somewhere far away there's another day
And someone's getting out of bed
She put on her face in the morning space
She doesn't know she's dead
Her ruby lips can't excite me anymore
And pain sprawls on the chair, it's always there
And he descends the stairs, he doesn't see
The sunburned landlord glares, for all the people
He can never be",Bel-Air,1982
The Church,"Don't open the door to strangers
Don't let them in, to your heart
They only want to take you far from me
Don't open the door tonight

Don't trust the man in the windows
Don't let him buy all your dreams
He only wants to make them all his own
Don't open the door tonight

See the angry sea, it's a sign for me
There's another shore, what we waiting for
Feel the wind is sad, all the things I had
Blown away and falling around me

Don't leave your thoughts unguarded
Don't let them float where they will
They never tell me what I want to know
Don't open the door tonight",Don't Open the Door to Strangers,1982
The Church,"In the empty place the soul stripped bare
Of skins and heart and I come apart
In your icy hands
I forget my role, as I stare into your soul

In the empty place you change your mind
You change your clothes you change your pose
For a perfect fit
I forget the cast, as I stare into your past

For a moment we're strangers
For a minute you look away
For a second or always
For an instant another day

Such strange things you say
In the empty place we dress our wounds
Collect our coats, a window gloats
Above a street

I prepare my case, as I stare into your face
Just one me one you
The world contains a few
Is it true, is it truly new

Are we through the stolen door once more",For a Moment We're Strangers,1982
The Church,"Oceanic lights are cleverly dim
Blueish features in the lower reaches
We raise our traffic flares to him
Fishnet, girlish, the red ones spark

Holy arcs tracked in the dark
The more I see, the less I look
Here's another name I took
Listen! In the early morning air

The remnants of their eveningwear
Branching off, the road winds east
Deluxe locations just near completion
Come dine with wine and oyster feast

The pearls are real, have one for free
They're washed up by the foam waved sea
The more I look the less I smile
Never mind let's stay awhile

The fans blow secrets on the night
Out of mind but not out of sight
Is this where you live
Broken voices the nylon choir

Nothing left to stoke that fire
All they own is on their tongues
They never see or wonder if
Is this where you live

Thin dogs don't vie for bones
Why desert just to be alone
All they own is on their backs
They can't believe it's you I'm with

Is this where you live
Don't blush as I brush your touch
No need for any speed or rush
All you own is on the floor

I'm buying all you're gonna give
Is this where you live
Coffee stories, the lying truth
Electric lights don't help my youth

All I owned is on my face
Urbane mirror anger myth
Is this where you live",Is This Where You Live,1982
The Church,"Last year today seemed a long way away
And ahead of me
A new face and street, people who meet you
Instead of me
They bring you, they take you
They own you, they make you

Last year today you turn and you say
Here's a dream for me
You close your eyes, the moon starts to rise
And you scream for me
I calm you, I'm with you
What did they ever give you

Memories in future tense
Memories don't make much sense

Last year today a radio plays
Such a simple song
The music surreal and you almost could feel
That there's nothing wrong
They bought you, they sold you
And all the things they told you",Memories in Future Tense,1982
The Church,"Anna sits beside her research
Silence in the dappled moonlight
Sleeping cat and dying fire
Embers of the past conspire

All her books are closed and scattered 
And she feels that nothing matters to her
Outside this dream her sister frequents
Like a cobweb catching fragments

She approaches like a vision
She says ""Anna, do you hear me?
But the picture's always shuttered
All the distant thoughts that flutter to her

I can see them all, I can hear them call
And as she falls I lean to say goodbye
Breathing all the wasted hours
Talking to the dying flowers

Dwarfed by spires and tangled towers
We don't ask the reason why
Anna comes and goes in shadows
Paintings of the open windows

Her photograph is always faded
Her sister's eyes are blank and shaded
Don't you understand her science
Merging in a strange alliance to her

We're together in the future
You and I and her together
All our fated are intermingled
We are plural, we are single

We are leaving for a meeting
And last seen the weather sleeting for her",Sisters,1982
The Church,"People say to see is to believe
Then they just believe in that they can perceive
What they see is not the total view
Filtered between the me and you
Ah, but I'm trying so hard
Just to tell you I care
And I've wanted so long, to tear this all away
Tear it all away

People say well you just had to be there
And all the time you know they've never been there
And it makes me sad to sit and think
Of all those empty souls nearly at the brink
Ah, but I'm trying so hard
Just to keep to myself
The things that I hope will tear it all away
Tear it all away

People grow up and learn to drive some car
But I did that and it doesn't get you far
The things you want are never to be found
And in the end it's all some running round
Ah, but I'm trying so hard
Just to open my eyes
To seeing some things that tear it all away
Tear it all away

I thought you would know
I thought you would know
People say they think that they are sure
But they turn away and don't go back no more
What they saw was not a perfect sight
Just their own face reflected in the night

Just to tell you it's now
And I'm gonna keep on trying

The Church,"Come down, another day
Morning streaked on a perspex screen
The screaming beaked blackbirds peck
The wrecked eyes of last week's lies

The sandman gets shallow sleep
He tries to weep for the grown-up things
One last peep for policemen
A'resting in the woodland side so steep

Oh and I hope I'm not going too fast for you
And don't believe it when they say it's over
It's not over

There's an ice age due on Wednesday
Overcast sky, blocks of fortune
The bridges sigh, the sweethearts are blank
They never thank, no, they never even try

Winking paperboy
Paperwork, overloaded portrait
Let it jerk you back to yesterday
That's where the curtains start to fray

Too fast for you
Too fast for you",Too Fast for You,1982
The Church,"So hard finding inspiration
I knew you'd find me crying
Tell those girls with rifles for minds
That their jokes don't make me laugh
They only make me feel like dying
In an unguarded moment

So long, long between mirages
I knew you'd find me drinking
Tell those men with horses for hearts
That their jibes don't make me bleed
They only make me feel like shrinking
In an unguarded moment

So deep, deep without a meaning
I knew you'd find me leaving
Tell those friends with cameras for eyes
That their hands don't make me hang
They only make me feel like breathing
In an unguarded moment",The Unguarded Moment,1982
The Church,"Like a womb, night was all around
Someone, somewhere must have talked some sense
I could feel it moving underground
So many things I still don't understand
The dream I was having took on an ugly face
I don't know if I was walking through heaven
It could have been any place
Skipping 'cross the water, wading through the sand
Awake to find you gone, emptiness is where you lay
I just had to smile for all the things you'll never hear me say
Oh, I know, I could never get that near
What do you expect me to do, disappear?
You and me, we're as free as we can be
Can't you see, like the trees so obviously...
The message disturbs me so I throw it to the wind
And after all the hellos goodbyes etc etc
We can't start this thing again
It's like the fog you walk towards, but never seem to reach
Every morning now I hear that same old song
And though the singer is long dead, his voice goes on and on
Ugliness you have to learn, but beauty you can't teach
Awake to find you gone, a note pinned to my sleeve
It wasn't just the things you took
It was the things you had to leave
Now it seems you were never here
What do you expect me to do, disappear",Disappear,1983
The Church,"I want to break to be beautiful
Seven long nights to think
A handful of words, a sleeveful of birds
Casually left on the sink

Crimson beads, cut out your needs
Leave you feeling more in the pink
Seven long nights at a pre-announced site
A head on my shoulders and I feel all right

Alter the courses, stand near my flames
Questionable sources, only dropping names
Dropping names
I taught her how to be hard or soft

She never really needed to learn
A trip into town, defenses are down
I never ever need to return
She holds me by the stars, says look at these scars

Feel my longing burn
Seven long days but I can't change my ways
Look over my shoulder and I say hey hey",Dropping Names,1983
The Church,"Alone, at the end of the day
As I stand before the relics
Of what used to be you and me
You turn with the tears in your eyes
Not understanding that you are free
Free of me
Like songs, our warmth fades away
Turns into coldness
Like the words that we say, today
And as the city glows, electric people nobody knows
Electric dreams, nobody knows
When you touch my skin, the feeling is electric
I hoped that our destiny sloped
Ever upwards, now it curves away
And falls, like rain
And the windows of children
I see the future, just sliding away, and false",Electric,1983
The Church,"The electric lash of trees in the studio
Fills my head with light
Only the voice of the girl on the radio
Falling from a height
I turn to leave as if in a cameo
It doesn't feel quite right
Only one thing you ever really know
If it's day or night

Our eyes meet and I love her
I suspect she already knows
How those eyes see me so very very clearly
Even when they're closed

The electric lash of trees in the studio
A bite then a caress
Only the voice of the girl on the radio
Drifting from the west
I turn to leave as if in a cameo
A moon, a knot, a guess
Only one thing you ever really know
You might curse before you bless",Electric Lash,1983
The Church,"Sinking silk, and burning gold
Touch you as the air is turning cold
Another place I look for you
The heights above an almost perfect view

Seeing things just rest a while
As the tide sweeps out another mile
Inside the man, the pleasure dome
This is the world that I once called home

Strangers in their naked skin
Waiting for their sweet oblivion
Close to you, hear all you say
Even though you're continents away

The perfumed air, the taste of fear
Shrug your shoulders and they disappear
Take this gift and let it grow
Let it be all the hope you know
It doesn't change",It Doesn't Change,1983
The Church,"Crocodile skin water, city shadows wait
Put your head into your hands, the ending is so great
Take a ride to sundown, buy a ticket home
Take all the things I've bought you, leave all the rest alone
Marble skins turn human, people fade to gray
Put your head into my hands we'll make them go away
As you're crying softly, you won't ever be disturbed
Red on pink, the sun will sink, have you even heard?
And the colors take me down
It's no reason to be sad
And you leave without a sound
It's no reason to be glad
Salty tears are wasted, children lie awake
Put your head into my hands, don't let your spirit break
Black smoke from the chimneys, white smoke from the hills
Everything is moving, but we're standing still
Celebrations fading, boats upon the waves
Put your head into my hands, trying to be brave
The carnival has packed up, the storm has left us peace
Poppies sleep undamaged, we drive into the east",It's No Reason,1983
The Church,"In a moment of triumph, I find defeat uncontrolled
In the second of honor, a despair sharp and old
She gives me a taste, please show me some etiquette
I wasn't looking for you and I don't want to find you yet

At an uncurtained window, in a street full of rooms
Watching the gardens, and pursuing the blooms
This world is so white, they never see me anymore
But I trusted you then, and I'm trusting you still

It's just that I'm not quite sure
Now I wonder why, I thought I could ever lose
But the gain is hardly what I'd choose
Now I wonder why

It was somebody, a woman, it was a delicate crime
And I've been waiting for ages, yes I've been here all the time
There was this greed in my blood, she let me take the easy way
She helps me hide the vagabond, that was myself yesterday

And after the acting, I found that I couldn't sleep
And during my drifting, I found that I was too deep
By the virtue of faith
I knew that I could be lost

Beyond this dark place
Unprepared to pay the cost",Now I Wonder Why,1983
The Church,"Tell me, is everything unplanned?
It's all so unexpected that I just can't understand
We run so hard and always end up in the same place
""Glad that went so smoothly"" well that never is the case
One day the darkest cloud is bright
Who will shake away the shadows of eternal night
It's just the storm before the calm
Like the life held in your palm - it's clay, one day
And you stand there, with ashes blowing past
Dipping into gilt-edged love that will be made at last
And the gold you spend and the hastening end
That you throw into the sea
Coming back a hundredfold, there's no guarantee
We'll walk and be like giants, we'll all be honest men
I go back to my blindness so that I may see again
A woman standing on a hill is gazing out to sea
Dreaming of a new age waiting there for me
I call her from a distance and she smiles into the sun
And men and gods begin their dance, for their time has begun
And holy wars extended and battlefields of pain
Washed away, forgotten in the perfect rain
Princes, kings and humble things are well-worn and content
Messengers come everywhere, envoys have been sent
""Na na na na, na na na na na

She lived in the future, she lived in the past
She gave it all to me, she gave it all to me
Don't think I've forgotten the thoughts of your room
It told unlikely tales, an age of beauty
Some nights I walk through the heat to your street
I lose my bearings, but I can see clearly
Travel by thought

The Church,"Me and the puzzled travelers
We searched the ground for wealth
And scoured the dreaming valleys
On days where shadows melt
Digging for the blue and the green
Constant in opal or ultramarine
But you could only find yourself that way

And dust was my companion
And thirst caked all our words
Unearthing nearly nothing
We swarmed like carrion birds
Some for fortune, some for greed
Some for want, some for need
But you could only find yourself that way

Transform effortlessly

Or as bad as I feared

Some seek sleek and slithering charms
Out of reach their grasping arms

We haven't reached the borders yet
Then into town he rides in grim

Ripped and raw, lays his glove on the door
Walks in and tells the man on the floor
Maybe these boys want to do some talking
Your room's a mess, it's ugliness
But I go on living in it till you say yes
The curtains are new, but the windows are old
All the stories passing through already been told
We live in a style where trust is a drag
To hold up your end means the middle will sag
Some blackhearted actors interfered in your scene

Something inside you is never the same
Something outside you is always to blame

They have some good things to add to the blend
The games expanded, invaded the place
You're the only one who's forgotten his face
You're saying no no no I must be on my way
But it really has been a pleasant night
And you go so slow hope they'll ask you to stay
But indifference gives you a fright
Walking outside you come to a door
You go inside and you wonder what for
At least it's good to be out of the wind
You turn around and the clocks all begin
Just like the winter your memory thaws
Just like the ocean your memory pours
So many pieces to match or to find
So many doubts to have in one mind
It's hard to see how the tables have turned
It's hard to see how the people have learned
It's hard to watch the past drizzling past
It's hard to watch them picking the cast
And it stacks up badly that it never makes sense
You sense that sensation is who's paying the rent
And she beckons to you with her fingers and lies
She says: can't you slice the price of your paradise",Month of Sundays,1984

Look at the things she allows
Junction fever must have closed down the rail

Queuing in the ruins in the wake of the gale it's
Harmony I say

Hear the difference between close and near
The way oaths and oafs interfere
Bliss comes first as a jangling flood
Pillow from the old country arrives with a thud
That night she drinks ceremony and mud it's
Happening I say

Must be thirsty, drink, drink, sink, forget
Must be empty inside the shadow cabinet

She offered her chaos to me
Proffered herself languidly
The eldritch bitch must have muddled her spells
Tinges of Persia, I hope that it sells
Chemical nuptials and ringing the bells
It's heavenly I say
Then one winter morning you walk through the trees
But they cut them all down for the factories
Made this pretty cabinet and gave you the keys

The empty streets of violet town
Gardenerless the houses stand
And eyes in windows, strange

And I tell you sometimes when we're old
Of the useless boy and his dream",Violet Town,1984
The Church,"One night I saw all this
The ship that drifted in
And from that afternoon you changed
Some fallen leaves were in the drive
A stranger's voice above the wind
The difference was the color of Lorraine
She said that mourning almost tasted blue
Oh Fraulein, that was you
Your phone would ring and ring and ring
The shadows on the beat
The car abandoned long before, when I was free
A message crumpled said something
Yet the language was unknown
Are old mistakes forgotten just like me
She said she's leaving with the crowds
She wants to throw this all away
She said I'm thinking this out loud
That's what I thought you'd say
One night I saw all this
The man who paid the bill
A glance along the noise
Hey baby that's our song
The seagulls all flew away
And when I turned to ask you where
And when I turned to ask you why
You've gone",Fraulein,1988
The Church,"Your room is damp, your love's turning cold
Where is the meaning I thought we could hold
I can't believe what's happened to you
I stand back and watch, there's nothing I can do
Poetry, a delicious joke
All your flame going up in smoke
Just once more, just once again
If I ever get caught here, you'll know who to blame
In a heartbeat and a heartbeat's all that it takes
In a heartbeat see your heartbreak
I play some records but the words are too strange
I call you sometimes but your number's been changed
I will remember every smile and tear
But when I listen to you I don't want to hear
",In a Heartbeat,1988
The Church,"The clouds in the sky are all rushing by
A stare's just a backwards glance
The years and the days are all melting away
Yet you still won't take a chance
But life speeds up, don't you know, don't you know
The push and the throb, the threat of the mob
The crack's not a secret this time
The mouths and the doors, now I can't shut anymore
Keep running, you're falling behind
The world spins alone, the weight of it groans
I get dizzy just turning the page
The air holds us down and we're stuck on the ground
Trying to slip off our age
Come to the window come to the door
Given under my hand given under the law
I gave you everything you still want more
They gave you some mad forgotten war
Now it's time to slow things down
Because I told you life speeds up
Tell me how it happened did it hurt did you cry
Did you ever feel yourself falling out of the sky
Did you ever lie awake and wonder why
Did you ever fall asleep and dream that you died

Sat next to nothing and she looked right through me, and on
Inside the car sat a sulky blond
And on her lap the road went on and on
As she dresses I look to the ground
Perhaps I know where the place can be found, and on
Outside, the night is very soft, but where does it end
We'd pile into the Buick, but you've got to have money for that

She said I've had the same about you
They come to me sometimes when I'm sleeping
I said that's a way for me too
Now it's been a long time and I don't have the mind
To justify what we've been through
Logic is fine and science can be kind
But it can't define me and you
Yet I thought I had something special to say
But this nightmarish world
Makes you throw your thoughts away
As though I was someone special today
We say why are the innocent bleeding
Is there not a thing we can do
They say please swallow this trust we are feeding
And don't worry, it's bad for you
Now it's been a long show and I thought you should know
It's time for us to play our hand
But words are much too slow they lost meaning years ago
Isn't that how this began
Some say now! The truth is before us
Others say oh no this is not real
Some say be cruel then they'll adore you
Others say you can't touch till you feel
Now its been trip and its only the tip
Of the iceberg I'm trying to melt

And when you broke they scrambled for a piece

And you turn around and you call me a liar.

Quick calculation, there's not nearly enough.
Because we're lost, because we're lost.
Cold desert stars, feel them sparkle and frost,
They are so lost.

Follow her down to worship some god.
Who never speaks to me, I wonder if that's odd.
Then he says you're never listening.
The pursuit of adulation is your butter and your bread.

It's an exquisite corpse and its lips are red
And its teeth are glistening.
But you are lost, but you are lost.
Now hang up 'cause the lines are all crossed,
You are so lost.

If you're alone and you're feeling blue,
Everyone in Persia probably feels like that too.
I just hope they don't believe like you do.

Gray stands the tower in the distance.
Days pass like warm sun on the face.

 I wish somebody would tell me the score
 We raked old Poseidon over the coals
 Shook his shells, shaked his shoals
 Where can a soldier fix himself a drink
 Forget the noise, forget the stink
 And the opium is running pretty low
 'Cause when the pain comes back, I don't want to know
 Across yonder ocean the natives are fierce
 Their ears are filled their teeth are pierced
 But it's not their spears that spill your breath
 They kill their enemies by loving them to death
 We were on some battlefield
 I felt something soft go through my shield
 I felt something warm enter my guts
 I was bleeding bad but there were no cuts
 They captured three of us, took us back to their village
 After a long long time I could decipher their language
 They worshiped Baal, they worshiped the sun
 They worshiped the son of the evil one
 They were more than voracious, they sucked our ambition
 They let me go on one condition
 That was when I came back to my native shore
 I tell you they don't want to play with us anymore
 But a part of me will never be free
 And the part that's free will never be me
 But a thing of love and beauty is in my head
 A message from my enemies, and here's what they said
 They said that love = hate
 And death = fate
 An enemy always = an adorer
 But priest = aura
 And life = time
 And time = space
 And space = sublime
 And human = race
 Oh and woman = man

When the peoples guard is down
On a day like today
Overcast and gray
Bells were all ringing
The birds stopped their singing

Screaming to be free
He alights from the platform
In his usual uniform
His skin looks like he slept in it
Or had something rotten kept in it
And snakes stir in the thistles
Back of cats neck bristles
Round vicious lips the fur is stained
The disillusionist is back again
They say that he's famous from the waist down
But the top half of his body is a corpse
His gold won't buy him sleep
His poverty runs so deep
In winter he cracks, in summer he warps

Hang around the backstage door
But he knows what you're waiting for
You rub yourself against his fame
Already ready to bear the blame
He asks you ""Did you like my show?""
As if he really wants to know
Then doesn't wait for your reply
He just pulls you back inside
You've started feeling dizzy
It isn't you or is he

Undress you incidentally
Down the swaying corridor
People you feel sorry for
But when he puts the gaze on you
You're amazed at what you'll let him do

He can turn wine into water
Mother against daughter
Juggles busy deadlines
Gets himself off headlines
Surrounded by his minions
Who never have opinions
Performing little tricks for you
Puts it in a fix for you
Smashes your watch with a hammer
Caresses you with camera
And says the magic words
That nobody's ever heard
Now the slur is fading
Reality all-pervading
It only makes you want him more
It only makes you fawn him more

And he does the Indian rope trick
The one that makes you seasick
And he keeps on filling up your cup
But you keep on filling up

And some of it's done with scissors
And some of it's done with cables
And his hands under the table
It doesn't matter you want to believe
It doesn't matter if you have to leave
You won't escape his orbit
And the things that you must forfeit
And the audience seems familiar
Some of them in particular
Bet you they are his plants
When he plays the game of chance
He reads the minds of jilted girls

 But barbarians came and set fire to their home
 Exposed the dome dwellers to the outside
 They must have known it was the end
 All of their wealth couldn't save them
 All died inside the flames
 Destined to make that same old mistake
 God that's such a shame

Of the man who had no face? (Sure I have)
His wife suspected something
That's why she brought me in
We arranged to meet one night
At a bar called Aphrodite's (On Second Street)
When I looked into her eyes
I quickly realised (Danger)
The price was right, the deal was struck
I don't think that she gave it a thought
 It was clear to see that the lady was love blind
 It was clear to see, it was clear that she was love blind
Out into the foggy night
Into the city's blurry light (I drove alone)
I wondered then what kind of place
Would make a man lose face
I pieced together clue by clue
Just what a faceless man would do (It wasn't hard)
Who would he love, where would he go?
Places faceless men would know (On Second Street)
I was close, I was near
But that woman just wouldn't hear
 It was clear to see that the lady was love blind
 It was clear to see, it was clear that she was love blind
 Love blind...
Next morning came, as mornings do
I had a shave that was close, too (A close shave)
In the mirror, in my space
There was a man without a face
I rang my client and I banged on her door
I told her it was me that we was lookin' for

Am I the only one to succumb to their rule
Well, I know the form that it's taking
It's not making sense anymore

The way your clinging is slinging me under
The strength I need already denied me

Is crumbled in their life's dusty caress

They were so blind
Hiding in a hotel room
Somewhere in the west
I heard they brought a priest in to sanctify the place
But it remained unblessed
Things move around
My guitar sometimes plays itself
They say it's static electricity but
Yesterday it took twenty dollars off the shelf

Irrigated deserts, built giant golden thrones
Built palaces in India and a dome on the moon
Illustrated ceilings, praised God with strange choirs
Fed the five thousand, built cities of spires
Felt the pull of science unravel in their minds
Charted celestial bodies and were punished for their finds
Conquered snow-peaked mountains, drove jungles to retreat
Were drowned in vicious rapids and were heralded for their feats

Fantasized in Babylon, built a home in space
Scaled the walls of China against all human odds
Won battles without hope and saw men turned into gods


Still they hide their faces well unbetrayed by Heaven or Hell
Only traces to be found although their history resounds
Disconnected they displayed all the discoveries they made
And now they wander round the earth beyond the realms of death or birth
If you look you'll see them there like clouds hanging in the air
And they said the earth was flat, sailed off the world into a vat
Turned the planets into toys then played marbles like small boys

It's impossible, yes I know
It's too tempting too, I admit
It's unforgivable, but I have nothing to lose
Then when the feast was over
The guests withdrew to the fire
Talking proud, laughing out loud

The cats fell down drunk in the chair
They reverted again to women and men

The Church,"Sometimes I wonder how I got mixed up with you
You just cannot comprehend the things that I do
The truth is so fragile, the ties are so true
Lying in the nettles where the blossoms once grew
So now you're asking what is this mystery
And all these questions, ancient history
Sometimes I wonder what is left to be said
If I'm consumed and fading will the children be fed?
The roof is always creaking, the stone has been bled
You say I'm just existing and you leave me for dead
Sometimes I can see your love is a sled
Sliding down the slopes that will lead to your bed
Some of us are white, some of us are red
Some have got these visions going 'round in our heads
As you go just blow a kiss to me
And as it falls, ancient history

Overhearing conversation, the grinding of the steel
Scenes fly past the curtains that the darkness paints uncertain
And memories are meaningless, her motives are concealed

Running through the reasons in the corners of his mind
Sifting tiny diamonds on his shaky mental islands
Where he often claims asylum from the structures left behind

They keep paralyzing me
Try a little light on me
Everything's so bright
How come I see your lights in me
Winding your way through this room full of flesh
Science, sexuality, the heat of your breath
Each bead of sweat, the message is sent
And army of hips, and trenches to defend
You can call your name/court a young maid again and again
Wear out your welcome, and escape on a train
Slither on up to a shining star
Concern yourself with the weird and bizarre
Disappear like smoke in a cold night sky
With a warm soft throb and a flash of light
How come I see your lights
They keep paralyzing me
Hey, try a little light on me
Everything's so bright
How come you see your lights in me

You
You wake up late
Yet you're asleep
Inside a dream
Then
You feel something
Superimposed
Upon your thoughts
They say that in the future every man and woman will be a star
And everybody's shining and it's blinding and they don't see too far
You can't spend the whole song in space
Next
You move outside
You feel grey rain
Upon your skin
In
The muted hush
The raindrops crash
The seconds roar
They say we're all assembled from the tiny pieces of the red shift
The elevator's later but it's swifter to just wait for a lift
You can't spend the whole song in space
(Yeah!)
Life
The new frontier
An interlude
Eternity
You
You drink some wine
You had a smoke
You got to smile
They say that at the speed of light the particles all get quite excited
But out here in this universe it's bursting and we're all so delighted

I want you heart and soul
A critique of pure reason
Won't give me what you sow

Some day I think that nothing outside matters
Some day you blink, you miss a thousand years
Some day I pray, falling dumbly to my bed
Some day you stay 'til the audience appears

And we measured the time that elapsed
And we stumbled around like madmen unbound
And I said, ""Look out boys, these are traps""

And I was just a stranger then
Yes, I was just a stranger then
And I was just a stranger then

And we followed a path till we slipped up and laughed
And I lived half a life in that state
And we got our release in everything but peace
And peace of a record second rate

And I was just a stranger then
And I was just a stranger then
Yes, I was just a stranger then
Like a stranger, always strangest at home

Well, I like what you do
But you will never break through
You can try if you want
But you'll fail

The Church,"Across the wet November night
The church is bright with candlelight
And waiting evensong
And waiting evensong

A single bell with plaintive strokes
Pleads louder than the stirring oaks
The leafless lanes along
The leafless lanes along

It calls the choirboys from their tea
And villagers, the two or three
Damp down the kitchen fire
Damp down the kitchen fire

Let out the cat, and up the lane
Go paddling through the gentle rain
Of misty Oxfordshire
Of misty Oxfordshire

On country morning sharp and clear
The penitent in faith draw near
And kneeling here below
And kneeling here below

Partake the heavenly banquet spread
Of sacramental wine and bread
And Jesus presence know
And Jesus presence know

And must that plaintive bell in vain
Plead loud along the dripping lane?
And must the building fall?
And must the building fall?

Not while we love the church and live
And of our charity will give
Our much, our more, our all
Our much, our more, our all

And the fear it brings
That new doors can open up
And be a savior to me

And I feel like I'm growing old much too soon,
My love for you, I just couldn't convey,
And the keys to my happiness, I let slip away.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Instead of striving to reach my goals and my aims
I got distracted with meaningless games,
For just an illusion, I traded love that was real,
Now my eyes cannot see and my heart cannot feel.
Now I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream.
Sometimes I think I'm a prisoner of fate,
Doomed to find out things a little too late,
And so I must play this broken man's role,
Unless you come home, girl, and bring back my soul.
'Cause I'm a man without a dream,
I've got a heart that has no hope,
All my senses are numb,
Losing you, I've become,
A man (I'm just a man) without a dream,
Without a dream,
Without a dream.

Who think youth can be found in a fountain

But she'll never dance with them.
And in smoke filled rooms of electric sound
A legend is built around the snow queen
You may believe you're a winner
But with her you will soon bite the dust 
And discover you're just a beginner
You may not think you're a loser, but in midair
You'll be hung while you trip on your tongue
And it'll only amuse her
In the morning haze you are frozen there
Caught in the icy stare of the snow queen
No my friend, she doesn't want what you're selling

And into the night you'll fade, knowing

Flow into one another

At the mist that they created
And lose myself within it

As I stand in that cathedral
I will want to dive

And she may argue with her logic

There Ireland's lines of marching men, in squadron passed me by
No pipes did hum or no battle drum did sound its dread tattoo
But, the Angelus bell o'er the Liffey swell, rang out in the Foggy Dew

Right proudly high over Dublin town, they hung out the flag of war
For, 'twas better to die 'neath an Irish sky than at Suvla or Sud El Bar
And from the plains of Royal Meath, strong men came hurrying through
While Brittania's sons with their long range guns, sailed in by the Foggy Dew

'Twas England bade our wild geese go that small nations might be free
But, their lonely graves are by Suvla's waves on the fringe of the grey North Sea
Oh, had they died by Pearse's side, or fought with Valera true
Their graves we'd keep where the Fenians sleep, 'neath the hills of the Foggy Dew

The bravest fell and the sullen bell rang mournfully and clear
For those who died that Easter tide in the springing of the year
And the world did gaze in deep amaze at those fearless men and true
Who bore the fight that freedom's light might shine through the Foggy Dew",The Foggy Dew,

The Clancy Brothers,"There was Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me
And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled

While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley 

'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us
But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us
And so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early
And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the barley"" 

While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging
The foeman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing
A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early
And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley 

But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow

""Surrender now Jack Duggan for you see we're three to one
Surrender in the Queen's high name for you're a plundering son""
Jack pulled two pistols from his belt and he proudly waved them high
""I'll fight, but not surrender,"" said the wild colonial boy

He fired a shot at Kelly, which brought him to the ground
And turning 'round to Davis, he received a fatal wound
A bullet pierced his proud young heart from the pistol of Fitzroy
And that was how they captured him, the wild colonial boy",Wild Colonial Boy,1988
The Clancy Brothers,"They're moving father's grave to build a sewer
They're moving it regardless of expense.
They're moving his remains to lay down nine-inch
drains
To irrigate some rich bloke's residence.
Now what's the use of having a religion?
If when you're dead you cannot get some peace
'Cause some society chap wants a pipeline to his
tank
And moves you from your place of rest and peace...

Now father in his life was not a quitter
And I'm sure that he'll not be a quitter now.
And in his winding sheet, he will haunt that privy
seat
And only let them go when he'll allow.
Now won't there be some bleedin' consternation,
And won't those city toffs begin to rave!
But it's no more than they deserve, 'cause they had
the bleedin' nerve
To muck about a British workman's grave.

When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

And the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking

Oh, the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they'll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean

A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it's for real
The hour when the ship comes in

Then they'll raise their hands

And like Goliath, they'll be conquered",When the Ship Comes In,1993

By the campfire at night where the wild Dingos call
But there's nothin' so lonesome, so dull or so drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Now the Publican's anxious for the quota to come
There's a faraway look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
What a terrible place is a pub with no beer

The stock man rides up with his dry, dusty throat
He breasts up till the bar, pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
When the barman says suddenly, ""The pub's got no beer""

There's a dog on the verandah, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer

Old Billy, the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen, she says, ""You're early, me dear""
Then he breaks down and he tells her that the pub's got no beer

It's lonesome away from your kindered and all

Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

Mush-a ring dumb-a do dumb-a da
Wack fall the daddy-o, wack fall the daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

[Chorus]

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
But Jenny blew me charges and she filled them up with water
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

And 't was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell

Far away
Trying to figure it out

In the unknown zone

Watch the starlight
Shooting for the sky
Reaching out to catch
A piece of Paradise
Is it true
Or just imaginations
Visions twist around my mind
And brings me shelter from the night

Where do we go
Where do we go from here
When do we finally disappear

There's nothing left to save
They blew it all away

Tonight we're riding on
The final escape

Is it heaven
Is it hell
Is it the afterworld
Or just something else
Are we prisoners in Nowhereland
Where darkness is your only friend
Kept inside this wall of sleep
Have we fallen into a deep freeze

Left the wastelands
Broke the lines
Crossed the border to another time
Being drawn by the fates
Who run our destinies
Stranded in a state of life
Where dreams become reality

In troubled times
We saw the writing on the wall
We heard the fools
Who brought the human race to fall
We'll build another generation
And not destroy the God creation

Open up the doors
To another history

No demands
Here's the future

We were sailing away with a cargo of bricks

She had twenty-three masts and she stood several blasts
And they called her the Irish Rover

There was Hogan from County Tyrone
There was Johnny McGurk who was scared stiff of work
And a chap from Westmeath named Malone
There was Slugger O'Toole who was drunk as a rule
And fighting Bill Tracy from Dover
And your man Mick McCann, from the banks of the Bann
Was the skipper on the Irish Rover

We had one million bags of the best Sligo rags
We had two million barrells of bone
We had three million bales of old nanny goats' tails
We had four million barrells of stone
We had five million hogs and six million dogs
And seven million barrells of porter
We had eight million sides of old blind horses' hides
In the hold of the Irish Rover

We had sailed seven years when the measles broke out
And our ship lost her way in a fog
And the whole of the crew was reduced down to two
'Twas myself and the captain's old dog
Then the ship struck a rock, oh, Lord what a shock
And nearly tumbled over
Turned nine times around then the poor old dog was drowned

For three score or more in this little isle of green
I'm known from the Liffey down to Segue
And I'm known by the name of old Johnny Dhu
Of all the trade's that's going, sure begging is the best
For when a man is tired, he can sit down and rest
He can beg for his dinner, he has nothing else to do
Only cut around the corner with his old rig-a-doo

I slept in the barn, down at Caurabawn
A wet night came on and I slept 'till the dawn
With holes in the roof and the rain coming through
And the rats and the cats, they were playing peek-a-boo
When who did I waken but the woman of the house
With her white spotty apron and her calico blouse
She began to frighten and I said ""boo
Aarah, don't be afraid mam it's only Johnny Dhu""

I met a little flaxy-haired girl one day
""Good morning little flaxy-haired girl"" I did say
""Good morning little beggarman, a how do you do
With your rags and you tags and you old rig-a-doo""
I'll buy a pair of leggings, a collar and a tie
And a nice young lady I'll fetch by and by
I'll buy a pair of goggles and I'll colour them blue
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too

Over the road with my pack on my back
Over the fields with my great heavy sack
With holes in my shoes and my toes peeping through
Singing skinny-me-rink a doodle o and old Johnny Dhu

Saying, Arise arise you new married man and come along with me,
To the lowlands of Holland to face your (fight the) enemy.
But Holland is a cold place, a place where grows no green
But Holland is a cold place for my love to wander in *
Though money had been so plentiful as leaves grow on the tree
Yet before I'd time to turn myself my love was stolen from me
Be still, be still, my daughter what makes you to lament
Is there ne'er a lad in our town can give your heart content?
There's lads enough in our town but ne'er a one for me
For I never had but one true love and he was pressed from me
*or (It's a wild inhabitation for my true love to be in)

No firelight nor candlelight shall ease my heart's despair
And I will never married be until the day I die

As over hills and valleys, my true love he did go
It was there he spied a pretty fair maid, with a salt tear in her eye
She had a baby in her arms, and bitter she did cry

""Oh, cruel was my father to bar the door on me
And cruel was my mother, this dreadful crime to see
Cruel was my own true love to change his mind for gold
Cruel was that winter's night that pierced my heart with cold""

And the fairer that a young man speaks, the falser is his heart
He will kiss you and embrace you, 'till he thinks he has you won

So come all you pretty fair maids, a warning take by me

(P.J.McCall)
At Boulavogue, as the sun was setting
O'er bright May meadows of Shelmalier,
A rebel hand set the heather blazing
And brought the neighbors from far and near.
Then Father Murphy, from old Kilcormack,
Spurred up the rocks with a warning cry;
""Arm! Arm!"" he cried, ""for I've come to lead you,
For Ireland's freedom we fight or die.""
He led us on 'gainst the coming soldiers,
The cowardly Yeomen we put to flight;
'Twas at the Harrow the boys of Wexford
Showed Bookey's regiment how men could fight.
Look out for hirelings, King George of England,
Search every kingdom where breathes a slave,
For Father Murphy of the County Wexford
Sweeps o'er the land like a mighty wave.
We took Camolin and Enniscorthy,
And Wexford storming drove out our foes;
'Twas at Slieve Coillte our pikes were reeking
With the crimson stream of the beaten yeos.
At Tubberneering and Ballyellis
Full many a Hessian lay in his gore;
Ah, Father Murphy, had aid come over,
The green flag floated from shore to shore!
At Vinegar Hill, o'er the pleasant Slaney,
Our heroes vainly stood back to back,
And the Yeos at Tullow took Father Murphy
And burned his body upon the rack.
God grant you glory, brave Father Murphy,
And open Heaven to all your men;
The cause that called you may call tomorrow
In another fight for the green again.

The Clancy Brothers,"There was Johnny McEldoo and McGee and me
And a couple of two or three went on the spree one day
We had a bob or two, which we knew how to blew
And the beer and whiskey flew and we all felt gay
We visited McCann's, Maclaman's, Humpty Dan's
We then went into Swan's, our stomachs for to pack
We ordered out a feed, which indeed, we did need
And we finished it with speed, but we still felt slack

Johnny McEldoo turned red, white and blue
As a plate of Irish stew he soon put out of sight
He shouted out ""Encore!"" with a roar for some more
That he'd never felt before such a keen appetite
We ordered eggs and ham, bread and jam, what a cram
But him, we couldn't ram, though we tried our level best
For everything we brought, cold or hot, mattered not
It went down him like a shot and he still stood the test

He swallowed tripe and lard by the yard, we got scarred
We thought it would go hard when the waiter brought the bill
We told him to give o'er, but he swore he could lower
Twice as much again and more before he had his fill
He nearly supped a trough full of broth says McGragh
""He'll devour the tablecloth if you don't hold him in""
When the waiter brought the charge, McEldoo felt so large
He began to shout and barge and his blood went on fire

He began to curse and swear, tear his hair in despair
To finish the affair, called the shop man a liar
The shop man, he through out and no doubt, he did clout
McEldoo he kicked about like an old football
Tattered all his clothes, broke his nose, I suppose
He would have killed him with a few blows in no time at all
Mceldoo began to howl and to growl, by my soul
Through an empty bowl at the shop keepers head
It struck poor Mickey Flynn, took the skin from his chin
An erection did begin and we all fought and bled
The peelers did arrive, man alive, four or five
At us they made a dive for us all to march away
We paid for all the mate that we ate, stood a trait
And went home to ruminate on the spree that day",Johnny McEldoo,1994
