Jerry Douglas,"And when I die and when I'm dead, dead and gone
There'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on

I'm not scared of dying and I don't really care
If it's peace you find in dying, well, then let the time be near
If it's peace you find in dying, when dying time is here
Just bundle up my coffin 'cause it's cold way down there
I hear that's it's cold way down there, yeah, crazy cold way down there

And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on

My troubles are many, they're as deep as a well
I can swear there ain't no heaven but I pray there ain't no hell
Swear there ain't no heaven and pray there ain't no hell
But I'll never know by living, only my dying will tell
Only my dying will tell, yeah, only my dying will tell

And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born and a world to carry on, to carry on

Give me my freedom for as long as I be
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me
All I ask of living is to have no chains on me
And all I ask of dying is to go naturally, only want to go naturally
Don't want to go by the devil, don't want to go by the demon
Don't want to go by Satan, don't want to die uneasy
Just let me go naturally

And when I die and when I'm gone
There'll be one child born, there'll be one child born

When I die
There'll be one child born
When I die
There'll be one child born
When I die
There'll be one child born
When I die
There'll be one child born
When I die
There'll be one child born",And When I Die,2014
Jerry Douglas,"Made up my mind to go
Some place so far away, I headed west
Without a sad goodbye
No hugs or tears that way, it's probably for the best
Sent cards along the way
Said I was looking for a brand new life
I never settled down
My wanderlust would always cut the ties like a knife
Sometimes the lonesome wind
Calls out just like it knows me
And on a night like this
When I don't know where to go, he shows me the way

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

I always looked ahead
I was so afraid that I'd be caught behind
Followed a crooked stream
To places I'd never seen and one more highway sign
Just like some other guys
I count the hours 'til the day will end
But it's not so I can rest
For me it's the time that's best for talking to my friend

Cause he knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away

Now half my life is gone
The only home I have is open road
My skin is cracked and brown
A mirror to the dessert ground and the dusty wind that blows
I never made a mark
Just scattered footsteps on the shifting sand
Whatever pushes me
It's something only he can understand

He knows me, my brother wind
He's lonely too and he takes me away",Brother Wind,2014
Jerry Douglas,"Sit down on the corner just a little crime 
When I make my money got to get my dime 
Sit down with her baby wind is full of trash 
She bold as the street light dark and sweet as hash 
Way down in the hollow leavin' so soon 
Oh St. Teresa higher than the moon 
Reach down for the sweet stuff when she looks at me 
I know any man sees you like I see 
Follow down the side street movin' single file 
She say

That's where I'll hold you, sleeping like a child 
Way down in the hollow, leavin' so soon 
Oh, St. Teresa, higher than the moon 
Just what I've been needin', feel it rise in me 
She say

Every stone a story, like a rosary 
Corner St. Teresa, just a little crime 
When I make my money, got to get my dime 
Way down in the hollow, leavin' so soon 
Oh, St. Teresa, higher than the moon 
You called up in the sky 
You called up in the clouds 
Is there something you forgot to tell me
 
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me 
Show me my Teresa, feel it rise in me 
Every stone a story, like a rosary",Saint Teresa,2014
Jerry Douglas,"Well you and I were meant to be 
And in the end I know you'll see 
That we can never be just friends 
Our only love will never end Delilah 

Just think about the way we were 
A perfect set of his n' hers 
Why does a man have to resist 
A never ending happiness Delilah 

I got myself out of the way 
My debt to you is never paid 
I was a fool to let you go 
I'm sorry and I love you so Delilah 

I think about you every day 
And I'm sorry for the things I said 
My perfect love my closest friend 
Oh Delilah 

Well you and I were meant to be 
And in the end I know you'll see 
That we can walk around like friends 
But soon this day will have to end Delilah",Delilah,2014
Jerry Douglas,"From twenty thousand feet
I saw the lights below me
Twinkling just like christmas
We descended slowly

And the curve of the world passed
With all of that flying
Above the mighty ocean
And now we all are arriving

Grab the carry on baggage
Join the herd for the mad run
Take a place in the long line
Where does every one come from?

As we shuffle on forward
As we wait for inspection
Don't be holding that line up
At the end lies redemption
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah

Now I'm stamped and I'm waved through
I take up my position
At the mouth of the cannon
Saying prayers of contrition

Please deliver my suitcase
From all mischief and peril
Now the sight of it circling
Is a hymn to the faithful

Forgive me for my staring, for my unconcealed envy
In the hall of arrivals where the great river empties
It's hand carts and porters
All the people it carries
To be greeted with flowers
Grandfathers and babies
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah

There is no one to meet me
Yet I'm all but surrounded
By the tears and embracing
By the joy unbounded

The friends and relations
Leaping over hemispheres
Transcendental reunion
All borders vanish here

We are travelers traveling
We are gypsies together
We're philosophers gathering
We are business or pleasure

We are going or coming
We're just finding our way
To the next destination
And from night into day
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah,
Oh oh, hey hey, ah ah

In a giant bird's belly
I flew over the ocean
From twenty thousand feet high
How those lights were glowing",Transcendental Reunion,2014
Jerry Douglas,"Last night I dreamed my head was in fever
Last night I dreamed it never was so far
To reach the shore of safety and redemption
And a gaze upon the bright morning star

I dreamed I was by friends all put abandoned
I dreamed I was alone but for my scars
And blinded by the tears that fell like water
No more to see the bright morning star

The streets of dreams never looked this lonely
The streets of dreams never felt this hard
And I heard my voice barely of a whisper
As the clouds denied the bright morning star

Sometimes this life is no more than a moment
And sometimes this light is lost unto the dark
But courage hears the sound of dawn approaching
And each our own, bright morning star

I woke to find every window open
I woke to find the heavy door jar
And I walked outside and stood upon the hilltop
And gazed one small bright morning star

I walked outside and every bird was singing
As I found again my bright morning star
",Bright Morning Star,2014
Jerry Douglas,"Well I know it ain't been roses lately, baby, it's just been thorns
And no matter what we do, nothing seems to change
Love has always been my shelter, for you it's been a storm
But for a while I thought we'd almost beat the rain

Now there's a hole here in my pocket where all my dreams have gone
Fallen out like so many nickels and dimes
And last of all you, you'd always been my good luck charm
I should've known that luck's a waste of time

'Cause it don't bring you love if you don't love
And it don't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it don't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it don't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

Now there's a whole lot of life to be unsure of
But there's one thing I can safely say I know
That of all the things that finally desert us
Pride is always the last thing to go

But it won't bring you love if you don't love
And it won't bring you time if you ain't got time
And it won't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And it won't bring you kindness if you ain't kind

And now I wish you only roses, baby, without the thorns
And I hope your dreams are always within reach
And I wish you shelter, baby, from all your storms
They scared you, but they never seemed to teach

That I can't bring you love if you don't love
And I can't bring you time if you ain't got time
And I can't bring you strength, baby, if you ain't strong
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind
And I can't bring you kindness if you ain't kind
",It Don't Bring You,2014
Jerry Douglas,"I can tell by the way you're walking
You don't want company 
I'll let you alone and I'll let you walk on 
And in your own good time you'll be 

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree 
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go 
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own

And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back and all that you'll see 
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

And I can tell by the way you're listening
That you're still expecting to hear 
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears

They can't add up to to much without you
And so if it were up to me, I'd take hold of your hand 
Saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name  
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came

When you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea 
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee 

And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears 
That it's habit alone that keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here

Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree 
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee 

Because to people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be 
When we look back and say those were halcyon days 
We're talking about jubilee",Jubilee,2014
Jerry Douglas,"There was a time when we?d be the last to leave 
Watching the sun come up while everyone fell asleep 
The music was always loud and I?d smoke and drink too much 
Until I?d fall in your arms and into your lovin? touch 
Now as the years roll by, time has reeled me in 
I?ve slowed down a notch or two from the way things were then 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

Remember the days when we?d pack our bags and run 
Chasing a crazy dream into the morning sun 
Now as the twilight falls, I find I?m satisfied 
Watching the fire glow as long as you?re by my side 
Here in my heart it seems, time has passed me by 
I love you as much today as the very first time 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 

I still want you the way I wanted you then 
If I could do it all over, I?d do it all over again 

Those old ways of mine, I?ve left them behind 
Those crazy days are through 
The only thing I still do like I used to do 
Is carry this torch for you 
",Like I Used to Do,2014
Jerry Douglas,"I am a man of constant sorrow, 
I've seen trouble all my day. 
I bid farewell to old Kentucky, 
The place where I was born and raised. 
(The place where he was born and raised )

For six long years I've been in trouble, 
No pleasures here on earth I found. 
For in this world I'm bound to ramble, 
I have no friends to help me now. 
(He has no friends to help him now.)

It's fare thee well my old lover. 
I never expect to see you again. 
For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad, 
Perhaps I'll die upon this train.
(Perhaps he'll die upon this train.)

You can bury me in some deep valley, 
For many years where I may lay. 
Then you may learn to love another, 
While I am sleeping in my grave.
(While he is sleeping in his grave.)

Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger 
My face, you'll never see no more. 
But there is one promise that is given 
I'll meet you on God's golden shore. 
(He'll meet you on God's golden shore.)",Man of Constant Sorrow,2015
Jerry Douglas,"I am just a poor boy, 
Though my story's seldom told, 
I have squandered my resistance 
For a pocketful of mumbles, 
Such are promises 
All lies and jest 
Still, a man hears what he wants to hear 
And disregards the rest. 
 
When I left my home 
And my family, 
I was no more than a boy 
in the company of strangers 
in the quiet of a railway station, 
Running scared. 
Laying low, 
Seeking out the poorer quarters 
Where the ragged people go, 
Looking for the places 
Only they would know. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Asking only workman's wages 
I come looking for a job, 
But I get no offers. 
Just a come-on from the whores 
On Seventh Avenue 
I do declare, 
There were times when I was so lonesome 
I took some comfort there. 
Lie-la-lie 
 
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes 
And wishing I was gone, 
Going home 
Where the New York City winters 
Aren't bleeding me, 
Leading me, 
Going home. 
 
In the clearing stands a boxer, 
And a fighter by his trade 
And he carries the remainders 
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down 
And cut him till he cried out 
In his anger and his shame, 
""I am leaving, I am leaving"" 
But the fighter still remains

Of former deeds of daring

Out on an ocean all boundless we ride,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Tossed on the waves of a rough, restless tide,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Far from the safe quiet harbor we've rode,
Seeking our Father's celestial abode,
Promise of which on us each he bestowed;
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.

Wildly, the storm sweeps us on as it roars,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Look, yonder lie the bright heavenly shores,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Steady, O pilot, stand firm at the wheel;
Steady, we soon shall outweather the gale;
Oh how we fly 'neath the loud creaking sail:
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.

We'll tell the world as we journey along,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Try to persuade them to enter our throng,
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.
Come trembling sinner, forlorn and opprest,
Join in our number, Oh come and be blest;
Journey with us to the mansions of rest:
We're homeward bound, homeward bound.

Into the harbor of heaven we glide,
We're home at last; home at last!
Softly we drift on its bright silver tide,

We stand secure on the glorified shore:
""Glory to God"" we will shout evermore;
We're home at last; home at last.

Though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble,
There's no place like home.
A charm from the skies
Seems to hallow us there,
Which seek thro' the world,
Is ne'er met with elsewhere.
Home, home, sweet sweet home,
There's no place like home,
There's no place like home.

As I tread the drear wild,
And feel that my mother
Now thinks of her child;
As she looks on that moon
From our own cottage door,
Thro' the woodbine whose fragrance
Shall cheer me no more.
Home, home, sweet sweet home,
There's no place like home,
There's no place like home.

An exile from home,
Splendor dazzles in vain,
Oh, give me my lowly
Thatched cottage again;

That came at my call:
Give me them and that
Peace of mind, dearer than all.

There's no place like home,
There's no place like home.

Jerry Ernst,"I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, 
Borne, like a vapor, on the summer air; 
I see her tripping where the bright streams play,
Happy as the daisies that dance on her way. 
Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour,
Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er: 
Oh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, 
Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

I long for Jeanie with the daydawn smile, 
Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile; 
I hear her melodies, like joys gone by, 
Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die:
Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,
Wailing for the lost one that comes not again: 
Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low, 
Never more to find her where the bright waters flow. 

I sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayed 
Far from the fond hearts round her native glade; 
Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown, 
Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone. 
Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore 
While her gentle fingers will cull them no more: 
Oh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair, 
Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

Bethel I'll raise
So by my woes to be,
Nearer, my God, to thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to thee.

Or if on joyful wing,
Cleaving the sky
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
Upward I fly
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to thee!

You better beware, that dream you dreamed
In time it could demand
The very ground on which I stand

Maybe you think that I am just a stranger
Or maybe recall I knew your name
You wrote it on the wall
In letters black and tall

Way down, way down in midnight town
Way down
Way down, way down in midnight town
Way down

When midnight dawns
Upon each painted martyr in the circus
Maybe you'll recall we met before
So please don't you accuse me
Of dealing with you loosely

Jerry Garcia,"Mama said, ""Don't go near that river,
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John.""
Come in the morning I'd always be there,
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

Take me back to another morning, to a time so long ago,
When the sweet magnolia blossomed, cotton fields as white as snow.

Catfish John was a river hobo who lived and died by the river's bed,
Looking back I still remember I was proud to be his friend.

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river,
Don't be hanging around old Catfish John.""
Come in the morning I'd always be there,
Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg, traded for a chestnut mare,
Lord her never spoke in anger though his load was hard to bear.

Walking in his footsteps in the sweet Delta dawn.

You get so far away from how it feels inside.
You can't let go cause you're afraid to fall,
But the day may come when you can't feel at all.

The words come out like an angry stream.
You hear yourself say things you could never mean.
When you cool down you find your mind.

Slipping out of the bed
You thought that I was fast asleep

Heard your slippers in the midnight hallway
And I heard you rustling around
Trying not to make a sound

Heard the tap of your high heels
And the click of the lock on the door
Baby, I hope you know what you're doing

Heard you walking down the stairs
And I counted them one by one
One for each year that flew by

Heard you stop and turn back once
Then I thought that I heard you sigh
Or maybe it was the breeze

Heard the jingle of your keys
Then you stumbled and cursed the cat
That was sleeping on the stairs under the stars

Heard you open the car door softly
You must have been there half an hour
Turning it all round in your head

Were you sitting there waiting
For me to come down and call your name?
I wonder, were you waiting for me
Waiting for me, waiting for me, waiting for me

Then I heard the motor turn over
And I heard you driving away
Way before the break of day

I'm troubled, I'm troubled
I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me
Lord I'll live a long time

Courting is pleasure
And parting is grief
But a false hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

For a thief will just rob you
And take what you crave
But a false hearted lover
Will lead you to the grave

(Chorus)

And the grave will decay you
And turn you to dust
Not one girl in a hundred
That a poor boy can trust

They'll hug and kiss you
And tell you more lies
Than the cross ties on a railroad
Or the stars in the sky

(Chorus)

I'm going to Georgia
I'm going to Rome
I'm going to Georgia
Gonna make it my home

I'm gonna build me a cabin
On the mountain so high
So the world bird and the turtle dove
Will hear my sad cry

Va nuestra canción como un saludo
Para los que defienden su derecho
A libertad y usan la razón como su escudo

No hay bala que mate a la verdad
Cuando la defiende la razón
Reunámonos todos para acabar con la maldad
Muévete y pon todo el corazón

Casi todos buscamos siempre la comodidad
Esto ha sido así toda la vida
El que va adelante casi nunca
Mira atrás para ayudar al que lo pida

Pero hay día llegó la necesidad
De seguir un rumbo diferente
En darnos la mano para cambiar la realidad
Depende el futuro de la gente
Allá y aquí, aquí y allá

Si no hacemos algo el mundo, se va a acabar
Muévete mi gente, mueve Panamá
Muévete Puerto Rico, con seguridad
No hay bala que pueda matar la verdad

Para acabar el racismo en Sur África
Lo cantan los niños, y mamá y papá
Para salvar el mundo de tanta maldad
Lo pide la gente en todas las esquinas

Muévete Colombia, Méjico, Argentina
Cuba, Guatemala, oye Costa Rica, Perú y Nicaragua
Que hoy te necesita, Brasil y Bolivia, Chile y Paraguay

¡Ay! Canta Venezuela, canta el Uruguay, Jamaica
Trinidad, Guadalupe, vamos Salvador, ven Martinique
República Dominicana, avanza Ecuador

Jerry Garcia,"Cherise was brushing her long hair gently down
It was the afternoon of carnival as she brushes it gently down
Rubin was strumming his painted mandolin
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade played in the carnival parade

Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight Cherise beware tonight
Rubin, Rubin tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do, Is there another girl for you?

If you could see my heart you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, say I fall down cold

When Rubin played on his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in before going on its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke to the painted mandolin

Looking out to the crowd who is standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Rubin stared, at Rubin stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down

The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Rubin's song took on a different tone and he played it just for her
The song he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate it cut through like a blade

Rubin was playing his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone for the strings played all alone
The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Rubin, Rubin tell me true for I have no one but you

If you could see my heart you would know it true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, say I fall down cold

The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind without a look behind

There was a wealthy merchant,
In London he did dwell
He had a lovely daughter,
The truth to you I'll tell
Oh the truth to you I'll tell

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor,
Her true love e'er could be
Oh her true love e'er could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind.

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, to convey herself away.

""Before you step on board, sir,
Your name I'd like to know""
She smiled all in her countenance,
""They call me Jackaroe""
Oh, they call me Jackaroe.

""Your waist is light and slender,
Your fingers are neat and small
Your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball""
Oh, to face the cannon-ball.

""I know my waist is slender,
My fingers neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall""
Oh, to see ten thousand fall.

The war soon being over,
They hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found.

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds.

This couple they got married
And well they did agree
This couple they got married,
So why not you and me
Oh, so why not you and me.

who stands on the back of a whale howling out in the middle of the ocean.
Waves of dog emotion.
Howl on 'til you find your sailor.
Howl on 'til he carries you home.

Racecar driver crazy fool, he don't worry 'bout nothin' cept crashin' o-o-o-ohh.
Crashing o-o-o-ohh. Crashing o-o-o-ohh like waves.
Way out where the water is blue there's no land to be seen.
The sky and the ocean fuse together like events inside a dream.
When the sun sinks in the water
stars look down and blink at the sailors standing on deck
who smoke cigarettes and think.
And sometimes when the waves are mellow,
all crashed out you can hear that lonely dog howling out.
Howl out for you master.
Howl all night long.
And maybe he'll hear you and carry you home.",Zillionaire,1994

With her black leather and gold spike suspenders

Of the infamous Catherine the Great
And we know how you love the ovation
And the scene that it seems to create.

Jerry Garcia,"Ain't it just like the night to play tricks
When you're tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doin' our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain
Tempting you to defy it

Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off

Just Louise and her lover
So entwined
And these visions of Johanna
That conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the keychain
And the all night girls they whisper of
Escapades out on the ""D"" train

We can hear the night watchman
Click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them
It's insane

Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here

The ghost of electricity
Howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna
Have now taken my place

Now, little boy lost
He takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery
He likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me

He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall
While I'm in the hall

Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna
They kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, 'This is what
Salvation must be like after a while'
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles

See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say
""Jeeze, I can't find my knees""

Oh, jewels and binoculars
Hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna
They make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks to the countess
Who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""

But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him

And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road

He writes every thing's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes

The harmonicas play
The skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna
Are now all that remain

As the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate.

I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.

Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.

As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""

And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.

And glowed like burnin' coal

Like it was written in my soul from me to you,

In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.

And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,

Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,

I got to get to her somehow.

Jerry Garcia,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens

And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', ""Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain""

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin

""Would you please not stare at me like that,"" he said
It's just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide

Well, Judas, he just winked and said
""All right, I'll leave you here
But you'd better hurry up and choose
Which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear""

I'm gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you'll be
Judas pointed down the road
And said, ""Eternity""

""Eternity,"" said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
""That's right,"" said Judas Priest, ""Eternity
Though you might call it Paradise""

""I don't call it anything""
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
""All right,"" said Judas Priest
I'll see you after a while

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feelin' low and mean
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene

Saying, ""Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are
There's a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest""

""Oh, yes, he is my friend""
Said Frankie Lee in fright
I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight

""Yes, that's the one,"" said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
Well, my message is, he's down the road
Stranded in a house

Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand

""What kind of house is this,"" he said
Where I have come to roam?
""It's not a house,"" said Judas Priest
It's not a house, it's a home

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over everything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll

He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman's face in every one

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep

For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst

No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest,
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest

And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
Nothing is revealed

Well, the moral of the story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong

So when you see your neighbor carryin' somethin'
Help him with his load
And don't go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

Tough Mama, can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty, Won't you move it on over and make some room?
It's my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom.
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise,
You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.
Dark Beauty With that long night's journey in your eyes.

Sweet Goddess, born of a blinding light and a changing wind,
Now, don't be modest, you know who you are and where you've been.
Jack the Cowboy went up north He's buried in your past.
The Lone Wolf went out drinking That was over pretty fast.
Sweet Goddess Your perfect stranger's comin' in at last.

Silver Angel, with the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve,
I'd be grateful if this golden ring you would receive. Today on the
Countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge
And all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another
Notch.

I'm crestfallen, the world of illusion is at my door,
I ain't haulin' any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore.
The prison walls are crumblin', there is no end in sight,
I've gained some recognition but I lost my appetite.

She's nobody's child, the law can't touch her at all.
She wears an Egyptian ring, that sparkles before she speaks.

And sing me a song of my own,

And the stars start to splatter in the sky,
When the moon hits the southwest horizon,

And listen to the ripples as they moan,
I will walk alone by the black muddy river,
And sing me a song of my own.

Black muddy river, roll on forever,
I don't care how deep or wide, if you've got another side,
Roll muddy river, roll muddy river, black muddy river, roll.

When it seems like the night will last forever,
And there's nothing left to do but count the years,
When the strings of my heart begin to sever,
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears,
I will walk alone, by the black muddy river,
And dream me a dream of my own,

Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Take me back to another morning
To a time so long ago
When the sweet Magnolia blossomed
Cotton fields as white as snow

Catfish John was a river hobo
Who lived and died by the river's bed
Looking back, I still remember
I was proud to be his friend

Mama said, ""Don't go near that river
Don't be hanging around Old Catfish John
Come in the morning, I'd always be there
Walking in his footsteps in the Sweet Delta Dawn""

Born a slave in the town of Vicksburg
Traded for a chestnut mare
Lord, her never spoke in anger
Though his load was hard to bear

She had sweethearts a-plenty
And men of high degree
There was none but Jack the sailor
Her true love e're would be
Oh, her true love e're could be

Now Jackie's gone a-sailing
With trouble on his mind
To leave his native country
And his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind

She went into a tailor shop
And dressed in men's array
And stepped on board a vessel
To convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

Well before you step on board, sir
Your name I'd like to know
She smiled all in her countenance
They call me Jackaroe
Oh, they call me Jackaroe

Your waist is light and slender
Your fingers are neat and small
And your cheeks too red and rosy
To face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannon-ball

Well, I know my waist is slender
My fingers are neat and small
But it would not make me tremble
To see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

The war soon being over
She hunted all around
And among the dead and dying
Her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found

She picked him up all in her arms
And carried him to the town
And sent for a physician who
Quickly healed his wounds
Oh, who quickly healed his wounds

So well did they agree
This couple they got married
So why not you and me?
Oh, so why not you and me?

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?

String barbed wire at your feet, that will not let you pass.

Wrap you in your sweet perfume and squeeze you 'til you die.

Just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace, is the human face
But afraid, we may lay our home to waste

There's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around

Ashes to ashes all fall down

And again the hunt begins and again the blood wind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise

It strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me, you and me

Rat cat alley roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones

Selling guns instead of food today

Singing ""black goes south and white comes north""
And the whole world full of petty wars
Singing ""I got mine and you got yours""
And the current fashions set the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
And the radical he rant and rage
Singing ""someone got to turn the page""
And the rich man in his summer home,
Singing ""Just leave well enough alone""
But his pants are down, his cover's blown

Will hear my sad cry

Outside the window an organ grinder's tune

Come back for more of that love in the afternoon

It was the afternoon of carnival as she brushes it gently down
Rubin was strumming his painted mandolin
It was inlaid with a pretty face in jade played in the carnival parade

Cherise was dressing as Pirouette in white
When a fatal vision gripped her tight Cherise beware tonight
Rubin, Rubin tell me truly true
I feel afraid and I don't know why I do, Is there another girl for you?

If you could see my heart you would know it's true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, say I fall down cold

When Rubin played on his painted mandolin
The breeze would pause to listen in before going on its way again
Masquerade began when nightfall finally woke
Like waves against the bandstand, dancers broke to the painted mandolin

Looking out to the crowd who is standing there
Sweet Ruby Claire at Rubin stared, at Rubin stared
She was dressed as Pirouette in red
And her hair hung gently down

The crowd pressed round, Ruby stood as though alone
Rubin's song took on a different tone and he played it just for her
The song he played was the carnival parade
Each note cut a thread of Cherise's fate it cut through like a blade

Rubin was playing his painted mandolin
When Ruby froze and turned to stone for the strings played all alone
The voice of Cherise from the face of the mandolin
Singing Rubin, Rubin tell me true for I have no one but you

If you could see my heart you would know it true
There's none Cherise, except for you, except for you
I'd swear to it on my very soul, If I lie, say I fall down cold

The truth of love an unsung song must tell
The course of love must follow blind without a look behind

Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?

Seems like I been down this way before

Is there any truth in that, senor?


Senor, senor, do you know where she is hiding?

How long are we gonna be riding?

How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?

Will there be any comfort there, senor?


There's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck

There's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck

There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot

Where she held me in her arms one time and said, ""Forget me not""


Senor, senor, I can see that painted wagon,

I can smell the tail of the dragon

Can't stand the suspense anymore

Can you tell me who to contact here, senor?


Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled

Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field

A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring

Said, ""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing""


Senor, senor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather

Well, give me a minute, let me get it together

I just gotta pick myself up off the floor

I'm ready when you are, senor

Overturn these tables

This place don't make sense to me no more

Can you tell me what we're waiting for, senor?

As the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate.

They walked along by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin' bright.
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate.

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walkin' by the arcade.
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin' up,
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate.

He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere.
He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window open wide,
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate.

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks,
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in.
Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
Once more for a simple twist of fate.

Which goes from bad to worse?

And scratched your name in sand
Though you thought it was nothing more
Than a place for you to stand

You discovered that no one would be true
That I myself was among the ones who thought
It was just a childish thing to do

You came through it all the way, flyin' through the skies.

Countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch, I stood alone upon the ridge
And all I did was watch. Sweet Goddess It must be time to carve another

Jerry Garcia Band,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.

She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.

She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.

So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,

Windows shaking at my cabin door

I'm troubled in mind
If trouble don't kill me

And parting is grief
But a false hearted lover
Is worse than a thief

For a thief will just rob you
And take what you crave
But a false hearted lover
Will lead you to the grave

And the grave will decay you
And turn you to dust
Not one girl in a hundred
That a poor boy can trust

They'll hug and kiss you
And tell you more lies
Than the cross ties on a railroad
Or the stars in the sky

I'm going to Georgia
I'm going to Rome
I'm going to Georgia
Gonna make it my home

I'm gonna build me a cabin
On the mountain so high
So the world bird and the turtle dove
Will hear my sad cry

They laugh at her connections

Get your heels in tow

Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

There's the day breaking
Windows shaking at my cabin door
Love me like you did last night
Just one time more

I know it don't make sense
But then it don't intend
You keep coming by
We'll make it up again

Get up, Johnny, sing along
Get along now, get along
I could be right, I could be wrong
Pretty soon be long gone

Lay me down in worried sleep
Listen while the river weep
Thought I heard it sing a song
Delta Queen done come and gone

Tiger tea, tiger gee, you my Tiger Rose
Gently roll me, honey, while I sing your song
On the bank where children play 'ring a levio'
Come on and show me somethin' I don't know

Come on, big eyed handsome moll
And be my party doll
We'll live in jive o county
'Neath the waterfall

Just tell 'em, ""Anything""
Cut glass spur or a silver chime
Can make 'em ring

I just love you so
Maybe that's the reason
That you don't say no

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody

Once again your face comes back to me
Just like the theme of some forgotten melody
In the album of my memory
Serenade in blue

It seems like only yesterday
The small cafe, a crowded floor
And as we danced the night away
I hear you say forever more
And then the song became a sigh
Forever more became goodbye
Cause you remained in my heart, but

Tell me darling in there still a spark?
Or only lonely ashes of the flame we knew
Should I go on whistling in the dark,
Serenade in blue",Serenade In Blue,
Jerry Gray Orchestra,"Skylark, have you anything to say to me, 
Won't you tell me where my love can be? 
Is there a meadow in the mist 
Where someone's waiting to be kissed? 

Skylark, have you seen a valley green with spring 
Where my heart can go a-journeying 
Over the shadows and the rain to a blossom-covered lane? 

And in your lonely flight haven't you heard the music of the night? 
Wonderful music, faint as a will-'o-the-wisp, crazy as a loon, 
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh

Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things, 
But my heart is riding on your wings 
So if you see them anywhere 
Won't you lead me there",Skylark,
Jerry Gray Orchestra,"Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you",Guilty,1998
Jerry Gray Orchestra,"I have but one heart, this heart I bring you
I have but one heart to share with you
I have but one dream that I can cling to
You are the one dream I pray comes true

And nobody else before you, ever has heard me say
You are my one love, my life I live for you
I have but one heart to give to you

You'd be so nice, you'd be paradise
To come home to and love

I called you here today for a bit of bad news
I won't be able to see you any more
Because of my obligations
And the ties that you have
We've been meeting here every day
And since this is our last date together
I want to hold you just one more time

Don't look back I want to remember you just like this

A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?

Jerry Grillo,"Where do you start? How do you separate the present from the past?
How do you deal with all the thing you thought would last? That didn't last
With bits of memories scattered here and there
I look around and don't know where to start

Which books are yours?
Which tapes and dreams belong to you and which are mine?
Our lives are tangled like the branches of a vine that intertwine
So many habits that we'll have to break
And yesterday's we'll have to take apart

One day there'll be a song or something in the air again
To catch me by surprise and you'll be there again
A moment in what might have been

Where do you start? Do you allow yourself a little time to cry?
Or do you close your eyes and kiss it all goodbye? I guess you try
And though I don't know where and don't know when
I'll find myself in love again
I promise there will always be a little place no one will see
A tiny part within my heart, that stays in love with you

A man is born but he's no good no-how

(Chorus x 2) 

Who am I? Scar mother fucking face 

Who am I? A to the mother fucking K 

Who am I? Belo mother fucking Zero 

Who am I? Niggas Ain't Ready to Die 

(Scarface) 

Who the fuck am I? 

A born killer with no conscience 

Leaving niggas with holes in their heads unconscience 

No second chances 

'cause in this game no one advances 

You made your move and fucked up now the devil dances 

No scrilla for this just murderers with blocks 

To run up on their dick and hit em and get em hot 

With a 357 slug pointed at your nose 

Left a bloody mess and a note stuck between your toes 

You fuck with me nigga you're fucking with the warrior 

Anybody destroying you're packing the sig sauer 

Putting niggas off in body bags 'cause in this game you take no prisoners 

Leave it in blood Hare Krishna 

Nobody's breathing niggas stuck on getting even 

You die this evening insanity gon be my reason 

I trail niggas fill niggas and kill niggas 

I introduce the ways that are wicked to real niggas 

(Chorus x 2) 

(AK) 

Who ever epitomise 

And idolise my murderous skills 

With this vivid imagination and slugs that kill 

Off in the zone unorthodox with the world on blocks 

It's unexplainable how I got these bitch niggas locked 

Keep my eyes on my safe and keep this murderous flavour 

Since I picked up a strap I've had this murderous behaviour 

Spread the whole clip around and get the fuck outta Dodge 

I got a ride full of straps in my homies backyard 

It's too cold to proceed without a block to start 

Watch a gat blows him apart as the bullets depart 

Now who the fuck am I? Is the question you ask 

Can't be touched or fucked with is all you need to know 

It's 1998 plus you bitches got to go 

And y'all cain't fuck with me and tell em why 

My adrenaline rush on jump 

Plus you got my arm beneath grabbing with the double barrel pump 

(Chorus x 2) 

(Belo) 

I hear some niggas talking loud like we been stealing this shit 

Just say you hate me cock the bullshit don't you grip on my dick 

It's Belo Zero mother fuckers same sick ass nut 

Drink a brew and smoke some weed and blow your bitch ass up 

I put in work so recognise I carry my shit on my chest 

More respect and I neglect to come up back with the vest 

I never seen a thousand soldiers hit the dirt on your roll 

Fuck your chief and all the soldiers I'm a king on my own 

I'm coming with force down with Big Chief nigga Rapalot style 

Grip sixteens and triple beams will leave that ass on the pile 

Walk on down and see the light 'cause I'm not faking the shit 

I told you once that I'm a soldier I'm just taking your shit 

Now who am I a born killer nigga fuck what you heard 

I'm too delirious and serious I ain't like a nerd 

Fuck around and call the coroner dig your whole ass up 

Separate your head from the spam and leave your bitch ass stuck 

Nigga... 

(Chorus x 2) 

(N.A.R.D) 

Retaliation is a must 

I see niggas from behind so I bust 

My Desert Eagles gon to catch you when they duck 

Now what the purpose when they still gon get struck 

And leave they brains fucked up 

I don't know why they put they eyes on me 

'cause I'm a black material killer trying to keep it low key 

Now what it was they probably didn't know it was me 

But that goes to show em that fancy bitches focus just be 

They want to look up on my Rolex while I spot on my heat 

They see my Lexus car shining when I been on the streets 

With no ticket on it but still they try to find out what's in it 

It's a black nigga with a black chrome on the seat 

In the dark zone it's on 

And hell yeah I used to push packs 

Taking niggas straps and pimping bitches in 'lacs 

Matter of fact this shit I rap about I did before 

See it ain't no studio mother fucker just stepping through these doors 

(Chorus x 2) 

We can't be fucked with we can't be touched

Jerry Harris,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen
And all its sad good-byes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool

Shoulda known better than to cheat a friend
And waste this chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I am wishing that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say

We could have been so good together
We could have danced this dance forever
But no one's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're, know you're not a fool

You hold me tight
And love's got me high
Please tell me yes
And don't say no, honey
Not tonight
I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave 'till I see the
Morning sun creep through your window pane
Cause love won't let me wait (not one more minute, baby)
The time is right
Turned down the lights
And take my hand
We will take a flight
And spend the night
In a wonderland
Now move a little closer to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait 
 (No , listen girl)
I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We will explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame

Jerry Harris,"Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love

If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I 
And our ribbon in the sky

Jerry Harrison,"I'm watching TV a Saturday night 
What do I see 
But a middleweight boxing fight 
A right spar here, a left hook there 
Two in one combination 
A standard fare 
One fighter he tries the Ali shuffle 
Guess I'll change the channel 
'Cause it's just another scuffle 

It reminds me of me and you 
It reminds me of what we used to do 

TV rerun watching James Dean 
Red jacket on, he looks like Martin Sheen 
I keep on thinking 'bout Natalie Wood 
She sure was looking awfully good 
That rebel may have looked so cool 
Heart's aflutter, but don't be fooled 
'Cause in the end he still lost his fight 
Tough luck, sonny, life's not nice 

It reminds me of me and you 
It reminds me of what we used to do 
It reminds me of high school 
Reminds me of five years of doing nothing 
Reminds me of five years without loving 
Yeah 

I didn't blame anyone 
For what happened to me 
Full responsibility, you see 
If I came up, I went down 
I was fooled and I fooled around 

You are the one that I'm after 
And you are the one, no disaster 
And you are the one I desire 
And you are the one that I require 
Tonight, oh Honey, tonight 
That's right, Honey, tonight 

No more reruns 
Just a static on my channel 
Test pattern light 
Lights my room like a candle 
A time between the days 
Slips in like a vandal 
If I blink or tire 
I'll miss life's gamble 

That's the time that I remember you 
And that's the time that I think of you 
And that's the time 
I remember what we used to do 
And that's the time I think of you 

But tonight you are the one I'm after 
You are the one, no more disasters 
You are the one I desire 
And you are the one I require

Jerry Harrison,"Got the heat turned on and the windows down
She's hell on wheels, telling everyone how good it feels

She wants to roam the road just to get down on the floor
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up little boy and ride
She said let's ride, rev it up, rev it up, little boy, and ride

If I lose your love, I'd die somehow
You broke the news to me today
But I need one thing before I go away

Well, you know I'm gonna love you, baby, once before I die
You know I've got to love you, baby, and I ain't gonna cry

There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran, looked a lot like me

The judge said son, what is your alibi
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spoke not a word, thou it meant my life
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

But late at night, when the north wind blows
In a long black veil, she cries ov're my bones

",My Girl Josephine,1988
Jerry Jeff Walker,"There's not much to say for what was mine today
But when tomorrow comes, I'll make my way
Had planned to build a dream or two today
But everything I tried turned out mistakes
Won't stay down long, tomorrow is my day

Casting nets catch dreams; try for what seems to be
Bend that willow round and shape things as I see
Finding that some cards are drifting in the sea
And no matter how I play them, they'll trick me
That was his day, tomorrow I'll be free

Today played unfair; left me hung up, nowhere
And though it tries to break me I don't care
Tried to bring my ship in tow to land somewhere
Today is just another chance that's left me there
Broken toys today, tomorrow's my repair

There's not much to say for what was mine today
Won't stay down long, tomorrow is my day

Heading down an open road
To New Orleans, maybe Mexico

The whole world topsy turvy, you feel like you're upside down
Everyday it's a push and a shove, ah, people trying to get around
Working hard, breaking even's good, to live you know you need to pay
Yea, I'm half way gone, I feel I got to stay
But I don't like living trapped this way
Get away, get away yea

Ah to be up and leaving this town, heading down an open road
With all that you own kinda thrown on the back seat
Thinking 'bout where you're going, to New Orleans, maybe Mexico

If only you could pack up everything you love
And everyone who'd even been your friend
Keeping close to you the things that make you strong
And carry them with you around the bend

The fear to move and meet the new can keep you in line
To go you know that something stays behind
Separate the good and bad, 'cause you know the kind
The world is passing you by, but right down the line, down the line

He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick

They travelled about

His dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

They said I dance now at every chance and honky tonks
For drinks and tips

Cause I drinks a bit

A love for others shouldn't lack in courage
Or shadows thicked in anger hold you down
Your love is always traveling there beside you
With the strength to turn this world around
In your mind you're free and love can blossom
In solitude you cultivate its range
You have in sight a life all men have dreamed of
You seek to make it happen in your days
On the street you meet with strung emotions
You've more respect for him than he himself
Your open gift of love for him's confusing
But love transcends while hatred fools itself
The way you live each thought is how you're moving
The direction of your dreams is where you go
The courage of your love to have importance
Is all you really need or have to show

Go ahead and live your life and love it every day

How it slowly slips away

All your dreams committed suicide and there you go
You got a dead man on your hands

Now everyone has other lives in mind
Once they've taken care of needs
But won't it blow their minds
How quickly time flies
And that's all to life that there's goin' to be

So be careful what you pretend to be
Choose it well what you think you're goin' to be

One who dares to speak his mind
A friend who disagrees without apologies
But I've heard that leads to jail sometimes

A simple road without a bend
As you walk that line, I think you'll find friend
There's changes down the road you didn't figure in

",Dead Men Got No Dreams,1969
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Jerry Jeff Walker

If there's anything in this world you want
Better go for yourself
Learn to pick it up with your own two hands
Don't count on somebody else

If there's a dream that you are working on
Don't be surprised
If any old thing that you're counting on
Just suddenly dies
Got to plan in advance what you know you'll need
And carry it up on your back
Got to keep the things you need really close at hand
And tote them in your bag

When you're alone be ready for rain to fall
On a sunny day
If ends just meet be ready to go outside
And break a leg
You may as well get it straight before you start
You've got a general plan
To walk a road here to there but be prepared
To dig it where you land

If lady luck supposed to come across
She won't come through
If there'e the slightest doubt things could go wrong
It's bound to fall on you
Oh I know it's nice to think that things work out
And we'll all make our goal
But I think a man is wise to only count upon
What his own two hands can hold

If by some chance your world should turn on you
Come a tumblin down
You'll be at the place that I was at
When I wrote this song

'Cause I'm trying to tell you why I know
It's time for me to go

Be free, be kind, be strong
I sang at walls and you came down to hold my head
When the concrete beat me down
And we rested high in a nest in the wall
Forgetting it all
So help me now, I do believe I am sinkin' down
Yes, I'm back on the ground and I've found
I'm bound to travel on
You've only asked me to let you know whenever I had to go
I'm trying to let you know I'll soon be gone

So you'll know you're not to blame

How they string me along

Holdin' you back from the places that you usually hide
Are you all alone? Or more than anything before?

Janet says she loves you, is there something troublin' you?
It's not that easy to say, for I feel at times such a presence
In the room of friends I knew especially on these rainy days
But go on try to stay

Fly, fly, fly, we're flyin' away
We hold on to memories of everyone
Like existing clouds - a shadow dance before the sun
And down with the rain
I can see the separations come

There is less light and the night is longer now
The air is full of something strange
No more at ease the geese fly stronger now
Because they know the seasons change

The gentle dove knows love is over now
Wanderlust sets him aflame
My heart must start to play the rover now
Because I know the seasons change

Summer's here and then it's gone
Spots are changing on the fawn
Spring and summer held my heart
But I can feel the winter breaking all of that apart
Through autumn leaves I see your face right now
Your dress is wet with the summer rain
And though we loved I must erase you now
Because I know the seasons change

You must understand
Everything throughout the land will be another color soon

Our love is short, it cannot stay
It came by night, it's gone by day

How many sets has it been

That it happens more often than not

That I'm not with tonight
Wherever they are

Well, I rolled into town last night, I'm tired
And would you believe I would like to cry now
I saw my lady laying there with a man
Not another one, oh no
And would you believe
That it happens more often than not
And here's to all the ladies
That I'm not with tonight

How many times do you got to try

That it happens more often than not
But here's to all the ladies
That fell for me tonight

So pass that bottle, now give it here
There's so many reasons to drink it dry
Numb my pain maybe even kill me

And broken every one of the ties that bind me
And I have danced me around, all those sad ol', sad ol' situations
And I've taken my share of those sweet invitations

And the snakes are sleeping where the weeds are thick.

[Chorus]

I think I feel an angry oven heat, 
The southern sun just blazes in the sky. 
And in the dusty weeds, an old fat grasshopper jumps. 
I wanna make it to that creek before I fry.

[Chorus: x 2]",Mississippi You're on My Mind,1975
Jerry Jeff Walker,"One night while I was out a ridin' 
The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn 
The moon was bright as a readin' light 
For a letter from an old friend back home 

And he asked me 
Why do you ride for your money 
Tell me why do you rope for short pay 
You ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And you're losin' your share 
Boy, you must have gone crazy out there 

He said last night I ran on to Jenny 
She's married and has a good life 
And boy you sure missed the track 
When you never come back 
She's the perfect professional's wife 

And she asked me 
Why does he ride for his money 
And tell me why does he rope for short pay 
He ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And he's losin' his share 
Boy he must've gone crazy out there 

Ah but they've never seen the Northern Lights 
They've never seen a hawk on the wing 
They've never spent spring on the Great Divide 
And they've never heard ole' camp cookie sing 

Well I read up the last of my letter 
And I tore off the stamp for black Jim 
And when Billy rode up to relieve me 
He just looked at my letter and grinned 

He said now 
Why do they ride for their money 
Tell me why do they ride for short pay 
They ain't a'gettin' nowhere 
And they're losin' their share 
Boy, they must've gone crazy out there 
Son, they all must be crazy out there

Pissin' in the wind, bettin' on a losing friend
Makin' the same mistakes, we swore we'd never make again
And we're pissin' in the wind, but it's blowing on all our friends
We're gonna sit and grin and tell our grandchildren

About the time I called this Guy it was four in the morning
Teach me the words to the song I was humming

He just laughed and he said that the ole grey cat is sneakin' down the hall
But all he wants to know is who in the hell is paying for the call

[Chorus]

Now this Nunn called me up, it was eight in the morning
Wanted to know how in the world am I doin'
He just laughed and he said get together boy, and fall on by the house
Some Gonzo buddies would like to play anything your's picking now

[Chorus]

Now we worked and we suffered and struggled
Makin' our record till we got it right
Now we're waiting on the check to come sneaking down the hall
Like that old time feeling
That we never should have ever put the record out at all

Lace your shoes with country blues
Ramble down that dusty ole road

Take your money down in the town
Gonna get rich in the game
Come on home drunk at day break
You got no room to complain

Chorus:
Cause the pot can't call the kettle black
Cause the train's all runnin' on the same ole track
Can't feel nothing but your life flyin' by
You got trouble on your hands, trouble on your mind

Grandpa had him a wanderin' eye
He must a passed it on down to me
None of the girls are pretty as Suzanne
But I like some that I see

Chorus:
Cause the pot can't call the kettle black
Cause the train's all runnin' on the same ole track
Can't feel nothing but your life flyin' by
You got trouble on your hands, trouble on your mind

Bottom of the bottle sure makes you feel good
I'd like you better that way
So clap your hands and make up a song
I hear every word that you say

Chorus:
Cause the pot can't call the kettle black
Cause the train's all runnin' on the same ole track
Can't feel nothing but your life flyin' by

But let his ole ramblin' roll




",Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black,1975
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Butch Hancock

Well, I was standin' at a big hotel, just wishin' everybody well
If anybody paid me any mind, it was hard to tell
Then a big cop on his beat, took out his pistol and pointed at me
Lookin' down the barrel, I swore I saw the gates of hell
Standing at the big hotel

Well, I walked on down the avenue,
Just lookin' for someone that I looked like you
I couldn't see a face that seemed to ring a bell
And then I stopped beside the five and dime
Just window shoppin' and wastin' time
Along came a gal, she sold me all she had to sell
She left me standin' at the big hotel

Chorus:
And then I lost my mind, in the wilds of Hollywood
Then I spent some time in the shadows where I stood
And I let those cards fall just where they fell
And then I found myself, standin' at the big hotel

Lord, Lord, what's the matter with me
I pay so much for the song I sing
And all I'm doin' is singin' em to myself
It's like standin' in a stagnant stream
With no water in the world left to drink
I was down at the bottom of a dried up wishin' well
Just standin' at a big hotel

Chorus




",Standin' at the Big Hotel,1976
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Don't you think I know
You don't want me anymore
How you've turned off to me
Like the closing of the door
When I search your eyes
For a sign that you care
All I see is goodbye
And you wish that I weren't here

[Chorus]
Won't you give me one more chance
To make it with you
Forget about the bad we had
Don't believe we're through
Come and lie with me
Like the way you used to do
Cause you're the only thing
I've got to hold on to

Thought I knew all the ways
Love can go blind
Like the winter deep and cold
In the heat of summertime
And though I feel a part of you
Is somehow out of tune
It's something I can't see
Like the dark side of the moon

Drifting and dreaming
Yeah, that must be my fate
Always grinning down the devil's throat
Blazing with aces and eights

Just have my friends throw a great big party
Toss my ashes out across the waves

Oh my dearest darling - you're on my mind tonight
Now that spring is coming I see the leaves are bright
But when I read your letters I remember those lines
Oh no, deeper than love

Oh that mountain music, it makes me think of you
When I hear that mountain music I want you to hear it, too
But when I read your letters I remember those lines
Oh no, it's deeper than love

It's a simple beat of a heart, like a glove on the hand of time
Been so long we've been apart - when I remember your life,
I remember mine

Oh my dearest darling, I'm no one's sweetheart now
I thought love was behind me but it's always you somehow
And when I read your letters I remember those lines
Oh no, it's deeper than love

Well somewhere the sun today's soakin' up a cornfield dry
But it's shining a love song on some snowy clouds
And I know my fingerprints will be brushed away
By the hard plate every day of the century

But the other night when you cried and you woke me up
Just to tell me of your bad dream
I held you close to be of some avail
Tryin' to hold the wind up with a sail

We turned again and stood upon that gentle land
It's a vulnerable drum of old moss and sand
We could rise up another hot naked wall if we stand tall
We can face it again, it's the same old wind

But last night when you cried and woke me up
Just to tell me it's all a bad dream
I tried to hold you to be of some avail
Like tryin' to hold the wind up with a sail

Whenever you cry and wake me up and tell me you know
That it's all a bad dream
I want to be there to hold you to be of some avail
Tryin' to hold the wond up with a sail

While this old world wears its heart like a big bulls eye

Climb to the treetops, little child, if you're able

Fold your fingertips, girl, and find where I can't hold you
Let the sun ray fall and let the dewey ground unfold you
I know someday you'll sing to me the words I've just told you
If all the things you feel ain't what they seem to be 
Don't you mind me girl, 'cause I ain't really nothin' but a dream

I hold some grapes up to the sun
Flavor breaks and bursts and rolls upon my tongue
Eager tongues, we'll always taste our strife
Fill up our lungs with seeds of life
You come and taste and smell the waters of our times

Close your lips, child, so softly I might kiss you
Let your flower perfume out and let the winds come and caress you
As I walk this garden I am hoping I don't miss you
The things you taste and smell ain't what they seem
Don't you mind me girl, I guess I'm nothin' but a walking dream

The sun and moon both are right
We'll see them soon through all our days and night
But the colors I see in your eyes are fiery bright
I swear they blind the heavens with all their light
Come and see what your eyes cannot see

Close your eyes, child and look while I show you
Let your mind go reeling out and let the breezes just blow you
Someday we'll meet again and suddenly I'll know you
All the things that you see ain't what they seem to be
Now don't mind me I ain't nothin' but a dream

A mockingbird sings each different song
Each song has wings and won't stay long
Those who hear him think he's doing wrong
While the church bell and school bell toll their one note song
Come hear where your ears cannot hear

Close your ears child and listen while I tell you
Follow the darkest night, the sounds they may impel you
Even the song I'm singing may disturb or serve to quell you
All the sounds you hear aren't what they seem to be

He left me hanging against a cold steel rack

While I sing to you about a minstrel band
Of children in their witches hats, 
Painting pictures with the pipes of pan

How a young boy and his sister played some tunes 
Upon a whistle made of tin
And led me through the flower gardens, 
Laughing at the postman's stubby chin

And in my dizzy stupor, 
I was trying to forfeit all I'd known
And listen to that music that could swirl me in a magic all it's own

But somewhere in the distance, 
You and I, we fought our monsters to a draw
It was in those days of books and wine, 
With Ferlin Getty grasping for a straw

And out along the highways, 
We journeyed far to find that mystic smile
Chasing down identities, 
My God we must have run a million miles

So we can teach the children, 
Nothing, nothing but survival in the desert bare
They can teach us how to laugh, 
How to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair

So sing for us you children, 
Tinkle bells and rhyme the purple, greens and blues
Think of us as fighting fools, 
Who wintered through our seasons loving you

Desperados waitin' for a train

Soon as I could walke'd take me with him

He's got brown tobacco stains all down his chin

For your birthday, I thought that I'd give you
A little something from me
A gift you would treasure, something you'd always keep
At first I thought maybe some jewelry
With lots of diamonds or gold
But any man with deep pockets can go and buy one of those

Chorus:
No, I wanted something, something that money can't buy
A gift I could give you, and it would last for all time
So I wrote you this love song, one I hoped that you'd like
And I've wrapped it in a promise, to love you all of my life

These days it's so easy to buy things, no effort needed at all
Anything you desire, all you do is make a call
But I wonder how often it's happened, once you've brought it home
That shiny new trinket now leaves you cold and alone

Chorus:
So I wanted something, something your money can't buy
A gift I could give you that would last for all time
So I wrote you this love song, one I hoped that you like

Jerry Jeff Walker,"My old man had a rounder soul 
He'd hear an ol' freight train and he'd have to go
Said he'd been blessed with a gypsy bone
And that's the reason I guess that he'd been cursed to roam
Came to town back before the war
Didn't even know what it was he was lookin' for
He carried a tattered bag for his violin
Full of lots of songs of the places he had been
He talked real easy and he smiled and waved
He could pass along to you when his fiddle played
Makin' people drop their cares and woes
And hum out loud the tunes that his fiddle bowed
Til the people there began to join that sound
And ev'ryone in town was laughin,' singin,' dancin' 'round
Like the Fiddler's tunes we all there heard that night
Like some dream that says all the world is right
Instrumental Break
The Fiddler's eye caught a beauty there
She had that rollin' flowin' golden kind of hair
He played for her as if she danced alone
He played his favorite songs, the ones he called his own
She alone was dancin' in the room
The only thing left movin' to that Fiddler's tune
Instrumental break
He played until she was the last to go
The he stopped and packed his case, said he'd take her home
In all the nights that passed a child was born
In all the years that passed, love would keep them warm
And all their lives they'd share that dream come true
And all because she danced so well his fiddler tune
Instrumental break
The train next mornin' blew a lonesome sound
As if she sang the blues of what she took from town
And all that I recall that was said when I was young
There's no one else could really sing those songs he sung",My Old Man,1987

Skinny young kid who sits in the back of the class
Nobody knows his name, nobody cares to ask
They just sit up front and tell him he won't go far
Not knowing one day he'll grow up to be a movie star

Chorus:
Got to hold your head up high if you're gonna see at all
Got to put your foot above the rest if you're gonna rise at all
Got to spread your wings and fly if you don't want to fall
'Cause it's the road that you choose that'll take you through it all

Now that kid has grown up to be that movie star
Seemed like yesterday people told him he couldn't go far
Tonight's his big premiere; he's got tons of fans
Next week he's on the late show with David Letterman

He's older now, he's got grey hair and all
He's got two teenage kids, John and Paul
One of them is having the same problems he did too
He just says son hold on here's what you've got to do

Somewhere up in Ohio
Where I guess some rounder came up short
And he had to let her go
Cost me ninety dollars

Cause I never had a better friend
Than that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much

She picked up the name of Angel
In an old New Orleans bar
Where a drunken poet drew one
On the top of that guitar
Old Dave Stovally marked her
Scratched the song right out of his heart
Seems everyone who used her 
Scarred that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much
Just a Roy Smeck Stage Deluxe
But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much


She traveled with me always 
Through the alleys and bars
Songs I sang and friends I knew
Were part of that guitar
At nights it was my pillow 
Sleeping underneath the stars
Day and night I stayed alive
With that old beat up guitar

She didn't look like too much

But a lady has never faired as well
Who'd traveled through so much


Yeah a ramblin man he has his troubles
Hanging on to all that he owns
After many years of travelin'
That guitar fell by the road
Then one night in New Mexico
I stumbled into this bar
Angel laid there smilin'
On that old beat up guitar

Well I took her from the wall
Ran my hands across the scars
Played again the old songs
That were written on that guitar
Friends I've loved and lost
Many nights inside of a bar
Came back so clearly singing with

Who will walk her tonight out in the heather
Who will laugh away the teardrop in her eye
She wants someone to love her forever
But every new love only brings another lie
Empty winds you hear her say, fickle winds they shift away
I don't need him in my life for I can fly

Who will walk her tonight out in the heather
Who will laugh away the teardrop in her eye
Who will smile with him when the photographs are yellow
And share his memories when they're flowers in the snow
Who will know his mind when all the words are hollow
Or help him face the things he never seems to know
It's the road you hear him say, it's the road and it's my way
I don't need her in my life now let me go
Who will smile with him when the photographs are yellow
And share his memories when they're flowers in the snow

Empty winds you hear her say, fickle winds they shift away
And I don't need him in my life for I can fly
Who will walk her tonight out in the heather
Who will laugh away the teardrop in her eye
It's the road you hear him say, it's the road and it's my way
I don't need her in my life now let me go

And share his memories when they're flowers in the snow

Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side
And time washes clean, love wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love for a long, long time

Caught in my fears, blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell over, the girls you never knew

'Cause I've done everything I know try and make you mine
And I think It's gonna hurt me for a long, long time

Wait for the day you go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price, I'd have to pay
Life's full of flaws who knows the cause
Living in the memory of a love that never was

And I've done everything I know try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long, long time
'Cause I've done everything I know try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love for a long, long time

Jerry Jeff Walker,"In a bar in Arizona 
On a sultry summer day
A cowboy came in off the road just to pass the time away
He pulled a stool up to the bar and pushed his hat back on his head
I listened to the stories told, to the words that cowboy said
He said...

""I could tell you stories 'bout the Indians on the plain
Talk about Wells Fargo and the comin' of the trains
Talk of the slaughter of the buffalo that roamed
Sing a song of settlers come out looking for a home.""

[Chorus:]
Now, the man with the big hat is buying
Drink up while the drinking is free
Drink up to the cowboys a-dead or a-dying
Drink to my compadres and me
Drink to my compadres and me

Well, his shirt was brown and faded 
And his hat was wide and black
And the pants that once were blue were grey and had a pocket gone in back
He had a finger missin' from the hand that rolled the smoke
He laughed and talked of cowboy life, but you knew it weren't no joke
He said...

""I seen the day so hot your pony could not stand
And if your water bag was dry, don't count upon the land
And winters... I've seen winters when your boots froze in the snow
And your only thought was leavin', but you had nowhere to go

[Chorus]

Well, he rested easy at the bar, his foot upon the rail
And laughed and talked of times he'd had out living on the trail
The silence was never broken as the words poured from his lips
Quiet as the forty five he carried on his hip, he said...

""I rode the cattle drive from here to San Antone
Ten days in the saddle, you know, and weary to the bone
I rode from here to Wichita without a woman's smile
The camp fire where I cooked my beans was the only light for miles

[Chorus]

Well, he rolled another cigarette as he turned toward the door
I heard his spurs a jingling as his boot heels hit the floor
He loosened up his belt a notch, pulled his hat down on his head
As he turned to say goodbye to me, this is what he said...

""Now, the high-lines chase the highways, and the fences close the range
And to see a working cowboy - that's a sight that's mighty strange.""
But a cowboy's life was lonely, and his lot was not the best
But if it hadn't been for men like me, there wouldn't be no west",Man With the Big Hat,1989

A baby child is born along the highway
A tiny little thing upon the land
An okie with his dreams out on the byway
Lifts the tiny baby in his hand
The woman smiles a little smile of knowing
And whispers something softly in his ear
Perhaps a little prayer to help the growing
Perhaps a word of comfort through the fears.

CHORUS
You trust the moon to move the mighty ocean
You trust the sun to shine upon the land
You take the little that you know
And you do the best you can
You see the rest with the quiet faith of man.

A tractor makes its way along the fence line
And drops the seeds precisely in a row
If the rains are kind and the winds don't take the topsoil
Before too long the crops will start to show.
The farmer sees the fields around him growin'
He whispers something low beneath his breath
Perhaps a little prayer to help the growin'
Perhaps a word of thanks for all the rest.

Repeat chorus

There's a storm tossed ship tonight out on the ocean
There's a soul somewhere adrift out on the blue
There's a dreamer with his eyes upon the heavens
They're all looking for a way to make it through.

Jerry Jeff Walker,"She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,
Spending her days on the train.

She's a semi good-looker, but the fast rails they took 'er,
Now she's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.
South Station in Boston to the freight yards of Austin,
From the Florida sunshine to the New Orleans rain.
Now that the rail packs have taken the best tracks,
She's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.

She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,
Spending her days on the train.

Once a highballin' loner, he thought he could own 'er,
Bought her a fur coat and a big diamond ring.
She hocked them for cold cash, left town on the Wabash,
Never thinkin', never thinkin' of home 'way back then.
But the rails are now rusty, the dining cars dusty,
The gold plated watches have taken their toll.
The railroads are dying, and the lady, she's crying,
On a bus to Kentucky, and home that's her goal.

She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,
Spending her life on the trains.

Once a Pullman car traveler, now the brakeman won't have her,
She's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.
Yeah, on a bus to Kentucky, then home once again.",Railroad Lady,1991
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Travelin' down life's crooked road, 
Lots of things there I never knowed
Because of me not knowin' now I pine, 
Trouble got on my trail
I spent the next five years in jail, 
Should have read that detour sign

[Chorus]
Detour - there's a muddy road ahead
Detour - paid no mind to what is said
Detour - all these bitter things I find
Should have read that detour sign

Well when I got to the place where that sign told me to face
Well I figured all of my worries were behind but the further I go
I find more chug holes there in the road, 
I should have read that detour sign

[Chorus]

Well, I got stuck down in the mud, 
All my hopes fell there with a thud
I felt like my heartstrings were made of twine, 
I had no power to get
From that hole I was in yet, 
Should have read that detour sign",Detour,1991
Jerry Jeff Walker,"There was a time I was feeling so hopeless,
It's a wonder I didn't cave in
Kept throwing love at all the wrong people,
Never to see it again

[Chorus:]
Oh, Lord, won't you look what I've found?
Staring me right in the face
Yeah' I'm through being lonely, I'm through being sad
I'm all through throwing good love after bad

Now I think of all the time I have wasted wearing my heart on my sleeve
Trusting my love to the kindness of strangers, oh, was so naive

[Chorus x 2]",I'm All Through Throwing Good Love After Bad,1991
Jerry Jeff Walker,"I woke up this morning feelin' like a million bucks
Looked over on the pillow, there lay my lady love
And I thought how much we'd grown to love the life we chose to live
Ain't it funny how things fall in line, when you take what life gives

Music people tell me I need to write more sad love songe
But me and lovely Susan get stronger as we roll along
We let the rain roll off our windows, we let lovin' warm our rooms
And after all we've lost and found, I'm more in love with you

And all the songs I hear these days, they've got no give and take
The lovers always make the same mistakes
But love will ask a man to find a way to try and work it out
Love can please you, but if it leaves you
It can turn you inside out

So I guess I'll go on counting all my lucky stars
'Cause all the lucky people are the ones who really know they are
You can't have what you want unless you dare to see things through
And I got what I wanted on the day we said I do

[Repeat First Verse]",Lucky Man,1991
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Well it's two eggs up on whiskey toast 
Home fries on the side, 
You wash her down with the roadhouse coffee 
That burns up your inside, 
It's just a canyon, Colorado diner, 
A waitress I did love, 
We sat in the back 'neath an old stuffed bear, 
A worn out Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

Well, old Jack the boss, he left at six 
It was, 'Katie, bar the door'. 
She'd pull down that Navajo rug 
And we'd spread it across the floor, 
I saw lightning frame the sacred mountains 
The wooing of the turtle doves 
Just Iying next to Katie, 
On that old Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

Well, I saw old Jack about a year ago, 
Said the place burned to the ground, 
All he saved was an old bear tooth 
And Katie she left town, 
Well, Katie, got a souvenir too, 
Jack smiled as he spit out a big old plug, 
Well, you shoulda seen her coming through the smoke 
She was dragging that Navajo rug. 

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue 
Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Whatever became of the Navajo rug and you? 

So every time I cross the sacred mountains 
And lightning jumps above, 
It always takes me back in time 
To my long lost Katie love, 
You know everything keeps on a moving 
Everybody's on the go, 
Hey, you don't find things that last anymore 
Like a hand-woven Navajo.

Aye, aye, aye, Katie, 
Shades of red and blue
Aye, aye, aye, Katie,

Jerry Jeff Walker,"The Dutchman is not the kind of man 
To keep his thumb jammed in a dam that holds his dreams in. 
But that's a secret only Margaret knows. 

When Amsterdam is golden 
In the morning Margaret brings him breakfast. She believes him. 
He thinks the tulips bloom beneath the snow.
He's mad as he can be, but Margaret only sees that sometimes. 
Sometimes she sees her unborn children in his eyes. 

[Chorus:]
Let us go to the banks of the ocean, 
Where the walls rise above the Zuider Zee. 
Long a-go, I used to be a young man. 
Now dear Margaret re-members that for me. 

The Dutchman still wears wooden shoes.
His hat and coat are patched with the love that Margaret sewed him.
Sometimes he thinks he's still in Rotterdam.
He watches tugboats down canals
And calls out to them when he thinks he knows the captain,
'til Margaret comes to take him home again,
Through unforgiving streets that trip him though he holds her arm.
Sometimes he thinks that he's alone and calls her name. 

[Chorus]

The windmills whirl the winter wind.
She winds his muffler tighter. 
They sit in the kitchen.
Some tea with whiskey keeps away the dew.
He sees her for a moment. 
He calls her name out. 
She makes the bed up, humming some old love song.
She learned the tune when it was very new.
He hums a line or two. 
They hum together in the dark.
The Dutchman falls asleep & Margaret blows the candle out.",The Dutchman,1992
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Last night I fell in love again and I didn't think I could
I thought by now I was probably over that for good
With too much on my mind, too many things to do
Then last night I fell in love again with you
I heard love comes in waves, each one stronger that the one before
But I never thought that was true, 'til I took a real good look at you
It wasn't what you were doing, it was the way I looked at you
Then last night I fell in love again with you
He said a foolish man will take love for granted
While a wiser man might try and let her know
For if love's a seed that's planted in the heart and soul
Then you give it some attention, it has a better chance to grow
Talkin' with a friend the other day, he said his love had slowly slipped away
Because he never took the time, to do the little things you need to make love stay
And I thought of me and you and all the things that we'd been through
Since the first night I fell in love with you
So last night I looked at you brand new and I saw all the reasons why I married you
What a lovely woman you turned into and how lucky I am to be in love with you
And I'm taking time to say just how much I do
'Cause last night I fell in love again with you
And tonight I'm gonna do the same thing too",Last Night I Fell in Love Again,1992

So that's where my head was at, in a book and a funky hat
On the road with Kerouac, searching for the truth
Sometimes I'm amazed, looking back at a certain phase
Wet my thumb and I turn the page, oh, what was I trying to prove?

Chorus:
I just shake my head and I laugh, at a faded photograph
Of a total stranger staring back at me
Now there's no man stranger to himself,
Than the man he used to be


There's a closet full of worn out boots, skeletons and three-piece suits
A million hats and attitudes and very few regrets
And here I stand in faded jeans, an old t-shirt that don't say a thing
And who knows what tomorrow brings, it ain't over yet

Chorus

No some folks get me confused, with someone they once knew
I know the guy they're referring to, but he ain't been round for years

Chorus

I can see it in the eyes, it was a whole other life
Now there's no man stranger to himself
No man stranger to himself, than the man he used to be




",The Man He Used to Be,1992
Jerry Jeff Walker,"When the telephone woke me this morning, I'm sorry was the first thing I said
From that point it get's a bit fuzzy, thinking with half a head
Putting the pieces together, it's shocking to flash on the past
'Cause when you are known as a rascal, you can bet you showed off your ass

[Chorus]
I was so bad last night, I'll be good for the rest of my life
Now I'm telling you and this is the truth
I have finally seen the light
From now on I'm going to act right, I was so bad last night

The harder I try to remember, the quicker my brain starts to hurt
It really is funny, unwadding the money, that's been stuffed in my pants and shirt
But tryin' to make sense of phone numbers, scribbled on the backs of old cards
I guess we ought to be thankful, nobody knows who we are

I was so bad last night, I'll be good for the rest of my life
Now I'm telling you and this is the truth
I tore up the bar, lost a pretty nice car
It's a good bet I ticked off my wife

I never intended to do it, I dropped in for a drink or two
But all of the chicks were so foxy, I wanted to marry a few
The place was more crowded than usual, and everyone there was my friend
Franny and Snake and Bunky and Jake, and somehow the night never ends

[Chorus]",So Bad Last Night,1992
Jerry Jeff Walker,"This is a time to be cautious; this is a time to be smart
This is a time to consider the options, be careful with games of the heart
A time for young fellas to carry umbrellas
And considering the climate, you really might find it
The right time to stay at home

The booze gets your liver, but when you consider
The condition of water, a man really ought to
Abstain for the night and just stay home

It's dangerous out on the freeway, its dangerous out in the bars
Everybody's mad at somebody, it?s dangerous to drink and drive cars

Whiskeys?s bad for your liver, but stop and consider
The condition of water, then maybe you ought to
Find a good book and stay home

AIDS is to real to be foolish, it?s changed all the rules we play by
You can't take chances in other peoples' pants it's
Too risky to just casually try

Now I only smile at our social lifestyle
It all leaves me believing I'd find more relief in
Some Earl Klugh and the refuge of home
So now I turn off the porch light, next I'll unplug the phones
I'll get on my robe and my jammies, a nice fire sure warms the bones

I might write a letter, but what I like better
Is taking my guitar down and playing an old song
That makes me feel glad I stayed home",Time to Stay Home,1992
Jerry Jeff Walker,"This song is a letter sung to a special friend of mine
One who stopped his singing somewhere back along the line
I wondered if he'd had enough of the rip-offs and the jive
Or did he sing his song one night and lose the will to write

It never was a business deal, this thing with your guitar
It always seemed more a dance done deep inside your heart
Tonight I wonder if it's true, like we felt it at the start
That an artist truly does it best when he does it from the heart

It seems to be much more than an art when the art you sell is you
Be careful how you play the game or else the game plays you

In the old days we'd stay up nights and laugh until we cried
You said songs don't belong to us we just bring some thoughts to light

The rule of thumb is never give the truth away to rhyme
And a man can't lie when he tries to sing it betrays him every time
We really write to understand more about ourselves
And if we're lucky maybe then we touch someone else

Well, I just got back from Europe friend where they hung on every word
It made me feel a little better about my chosen line of work
They asked me if I knew you wrote a lot these days
I told 'em all I know is that you rarely ever play

We start out singing what we like and just give it all away
And wind up hating what we play and sit begging to be paid
So let me say in closing friend, I want you to know
I understand how hard it was to let your music go

An artist must decide which parts to leave in and take out
And if he no longer plays the game that's what the game's about",To the Artist,1992

As he struggles with an old dream all night long
And when she awakes, she turns to reassure him
She whispers to a shadow and finds him gone

She faintly hears a radio play a sad old cowboy song
She watches as he takes, his old saddle from the wall
A sudden chill runs through her in the cold of the not quite dawn

That blows through his soul, when the summer begins
When the winter snow falls, he'll come back again
But his heart always drifts, on the rodeo wind

Is to try and make him stay
He can't explain he don't even know himself
But the force that drew her to him
Has just gotta break away
And the sound of the road and the rolling wheel 
Is the only thing that helps

But he was a friend of mine

He died on the road, he died on the road
He was just a poor boy, a long way from home
Cause he was a friend of mine

I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
When I think about him, I still can't keep from crying
Cause he was a friend of mine

He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine
He never had no money, nah, he never was satisfied
But he was a friend of mine

He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine
He was just a poor boy, long way from home
But he was a friend of mine

Jerry Jeff Walker,"Last night I was dreaming I laying drowning in a stream
But in the light of day I see it's much more than a dream
Life is like a river that carries you on down
It's time we make like we was making tracks for higher ground

I'm always taking chances and got me by on luck
One a few and lost a few, oh had to suck it up
But I see where it's leading me, I've got to turn around
Today's the day I thought of making tracks for higher ground

For higher ground, (higher ground), higher ground, (higher ground)
You ain't going nowhere when you're always falling down
So get off on a good foot and stop stumbling around
Man I'm off and running making tracks for higher ground

Yeah, I had a friend who said he'd love to drink and run around
Wasn't anyway old mercy'd put that bottle down
Well I just heard the other day they laid him in the ground
One way or the other brother we're bound for higher ground

For higher ground, (higher ground), higher ground, (higher ground)
You ain't going nowhere when you're always falling down
You got to pick your head up, keep your mind and body sound
Man I'm off and running making tracks for higher ground

The moral of my story is the fool he never think
And all around you life says you must change every day
Throw off those old shackles and get up and dance around
Today's the day we're roping, making tracks for higher ground

For higher ground, (higher ground), higher ground, (higher ground)
You ain't going nowhere when you're always falling down
Get off on the good foot and stop stumbling around
Man we're off and running making tracks for higher ground

For higher ground, (higher ground), higher ground, (higher ground)
You ain't going nowhere when you're always falling down
Get up on the good foot and stop stumbling around

Man we're off and running making tracks for higher ground

Up and running babe for higher ground, for higher ground baby
Up and running up for higher ground, don't let me down boys
We're all running up to higher ground",Higher Ground,1996
Jerry Jeff Walker,"Last year we went to London and Paris, Texas
We went on a bus tour, the great Texas honky tonk tour
Here are some snapshots about life on the road.....

Let me tell you 'bout the life I lead
It ain't all it's cracked up to be
Of what you been told, 'bout life on the road
Rolling round in a painted bus, 
Just so y'all can look at us
Life on the road

You pack your clothes and your shaving kit
Some extra socks and those pants that fit
Check 'em for holes, life on the road
Everything you pack is black, washed it all upon your back
For life on the road

Climb on board the bus and grab your bunk
One on the bottom is the one you want
Less rock and roll as you roll down the road
Plug John Wayne in the VCR
Let the driver tell you where you are
Life on the road

You get a bed and a TV set, you get an ashtray for your cigarette
You get HBO, well that's life on the road
Get one down on the bottom floor, 
Hang a do not disturb sign on the door
Life on the road

You get clean sheets and a wake-up call
Don't go up north in the spring and fall
But not when it's cold, that's no life on the road
Coffee black with pie a la mode
That's what you want before the show
Life on the road

Tonight we're playing that high school gym
They're all drunk before I even begin
They're hollering ""Pissin' in the Wind""
Life on the road

The local band opens up for us
Now the PA's got a real big buzz
Life on the road

The good news is I get to sing my songs
The bad news is they all sing along
And they're singing wrong notes
Ahh, life on the road

But if I stop, it won't be long
Before they're singing someone else's song

Sometimes I think about old Saturday's child
And all the happy times, we were running wild
I was searching for the dolphins in the sea
And sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me
And I look back, I will remember all the good times
All the warm days in the sunshine
Just a little bit of rain

Chorus:
I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through' the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Backing off the North East wind
Sailing on summer breeze
And skipping the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talkin' at me
I don't hear a word they're sayin'
Only hear the echoes of my mind
People stop and staring
I don't really see their faces, oh no, only see the shadows in their eyes


CHORUS

Sometimes I think about Saturday's child
And all the happy times, we were running wild

Jerry Jeff Walker,"She is fixed in his mind like the picture
He's kept in his wallet for years
And the image has never been tarnished
By the blood, sweat, and tears
And to him it appears

That the moon is still over her shoulder
And the ribbon is still in her hair
And he can still see her dancing
And music is still in the air

Sometimes he finds it amazing
That all of his children are wed
When their mother is still turning eighteen
And turning his head
She still turns his head

And the moon is still over her shoulder
And the stars are still falling above
And she never gets one minute older
And he is still falling in love",The Moon Is Still over Her Shoulder,1998

Telling me just what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain please tell me now does that seem fair
For her to steal my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away

The only girl I care about has gone away
Looking for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart

Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we knew start to grow

I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again

Jerry Jeff Walker,"We were wild and young and willing to give up anything it took
To get to where we were going, you could read us like a book
Our nights were hot, filled with a lot of lovers and dreams and songs
And mornings mostly found us in places we did not belong

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
We listened to the songs Bob Dylan wrote
We sat there stoned and amazed
We forgot to eat, we forgot to sleep
Searching for the perfect line
So here's to the good old days, baby, one more time

I remember Jimmy saying: if he had two blues and a beer
He might get some sleep tonight, give his head a chance to clear
I reminded him of an old girlfriend singing at a bar called Slim's
And I recall him doing lot's of things that night
But sleeping wasn't one of them

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
We learned all the songs the Beatles sang
We even tried Purple Haze
We forgot to eat, we forgot to sleep
Searching for the perfect rhyme
So here's to the good old days, baby, one more time

We were wild and young and willing; we still are in some ways
Every now and then we still have one of them good old days
And it makes me proud when I think out loud
About lovers and dreams and songs
And how it always kept me going, and the best ones are never gone

But those were the days (those were the days)
Man, those were the days (those were the days)
We learned all the songs by Hank and Lefty
There must have been a thousand ways
We forgot to eat, we forgot to sleep
And all but the very best lines
And even a few of those from time to time

I've been ridin' them dead enders, flat wheelers, kickin' up cinders

Lonesome lines the boulevard
Neon flickers to the rhythm of the night,
But this evenin', sleep is coming hard
Down the concrete hallways in this part of town
You can hear the young hearts drowning in thirst for life
The back streets full of mystery, people 
Frozen in their dreams
Too little mercy, too little love, 
Too much night, it's too much tonight

The eastern avenue runs level with the river
In between lies the freight yard of boxcar blues
Eastern avenue railway, come on, come on and deliver
This load of tears and this pair of walking shoes
Boy's got the eastern avenue river railway blues
Trapped between him and the city,
He packed a bag and took one south bound over the line
Trapped between him and the pity, he suffers for those unfaithful times
Well, eastbound river railway runs swift and hard
He swears tonight he's gonna take that ride
Jerk a cold steel freight train right down the boulevard
He ain't gonna stop 'til all the loneliness collides
'Cause it's too much tonight

She first saw pictures of the river Seine 
From her window late at night, she'd pretend the stars were lights 
Of the cafes in the St. Germain des Pres 

[Chorus 1: ]
And she longed to see the world, and converse with other girls 
As they laughed and talked and walked along the boulevard 
To float to Paris and the lights in a taxi late at night 
Seems like a leap of faith to make from this old farm 
But she made herself a promise that someday she'd celebrate 
Her birthday in the St. Germain des Pres 

After college she got married, she worked in theatre and had some babies
Her life took on directions of its own
She became a working mother, she lived her life for others
For her husband, for the children and her home

Then one day her grown daughter said, she was off to Europe and
Have you ever thought about it Mom?
She said of course I used to honey, a lot when I was your age
But I hadn't thought about it much until right now
She remembered the promise, that someday she's celebrate
Her birthday in the St. Germain des Pres

She sees how quickly life can pass by, how easily a dream dies
You can't just live your life for someone else
So she boards the plane for Paris, she thinks she'll need a new dress
As she keeps that birthday promise to herself

Oh she thought she'd do it sooner, seems so important to her
But life moves on when you're off making plans
But every now and then it happens, a chance appears for you to grab it
That's why this time she just couldn't let it pass
Cause she made herself a promise that someday she'd celebrate
Her birthday in the St. Germain des Pres

And later take a walk beside the Seine",She Made Herself a Promise,2001

And the DJ played ""Imagine"" and everybody cried
I remember a thousand lighters held up in our hands
All we were saying them ""Let's give peace a chance""

Where was I when you stopped loving me?
When did I become history?
There's not many things that escape my memory
Tell me where was I when you stopped loving me?

It felt like our first time at 11:35

When did I become history?
There's not many things that escape my memory

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn,
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon

Our beautiful garden has withered away,
Where you planted roses,the weeds seem to say,
A cottage for sale.

From every single window, I see your face,

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came you saw you conquer'd me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
The smile of Garbo and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The scent of smould'ring leaves, the wail of steamers
Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you",These Foolish Things,2002

Walking my baby back home
We stop for awhile she gives me a smile
Snuggles her head to my chest

She has to borrow my comb
One kiss then I continue again

Jerry Jerome Quintet,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1992

It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap

I want to guard your dreams and visions 
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims 
And strap your hands 'cross my engines 
Together we could break this trap 
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back 
Oh-oh, will you walk with me out on the wire 
'Cause, baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider 
But I gotta know how it feels 
I want to know if love is wild 
Babe, I want to know if love is real 

Oh, can you show me

Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard 
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors 
And the boys try to look so hard 
The amusement park rises bold and stark 
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist 
I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight 
In an everlasting kiss 

One two three four!

The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive 
Everybody's out on the run tonight 
But there's no place left to hide 
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness 
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul 
Oh-oh, someday girl I don't know when 
We're gonna get to that place 
Where we really wanna go 
And we'll walk in the sun

Boy, how they could love!
Swore to be true to each other,
True as the stars above!

Just casually glanced into a window so high,
And who did she see but her lovin' man
Lovin' up old Nellie Bligh!
She caught her man
Doin' her wrong!

Well, she went round the corner to her favourite pawn shop;
This time she didn't go there for fun!
'Cause when she left, underneath her long red kimono,
She was totin' a forty-four gun!
She was gunnin' for her man
Who was doin' her wrong!

Then back Frankie dashed to that hotel,
Started yankin' the bell!
She said, ""Stand back, you madam and floozies,
Or I'll blow each and every one of you straight to hell!
I want my man
Who's done me wrong!"".

Johnnie, in panic, mounted the staircase,
Screamin', ""Oh Frankie, don't shoot!""
Three times she pulled a trigger on a forty-four gun,
The gun went, ""Root-toot-toot!"".
She nailed her man
Who'd done her wrong!

So they put her away in a dungeon,
Way up in a dark dingy cell
In the south east corner of a jail,
Where the wind seemed to blow straight from hell!
For killin' her man
Who done her wrong!

But the day Frankie mounted the scaffold,
She was just as calm as any gal could be!
And raising her eyes to heaven she cried,
""Lord, I'm comin' to thee!
I'm sorry I killed my man
Who done me wrong!"".",Frankie and Johnny,

Looked up at his mama and smilingly said

And took a hammer in his hand
He could drive steel with either hand
He was a darn good steel drivin' man

Now John Henry drove an awful lot of steel
He was the best driver in the land
When he'd start in to drivin' down that steel
The sparks would fly to beat the band

Oh, it's happening,
I know it's happening
All the good is gone

All the good is gone
From the love we shared together
All the tenderness
Has disappeared from your lovin' heart

And now, I'll start lookin'
For another to take your place
And when each time I hold her
And feel her warm embrace

Warm memories of our good times,
When I loved you for so long
I remember, yes I remember
All the good is gone
Yes, I remember, honey I remember

Jerry Lee Lewis,"One by one they're turning out the lights 
I've been feedin' that ol' jukebox just to hold you tight 
I guess its for the best I just put in my last dime 
I heard you whisper ""We'll meet again, another place, another time"" 
Chairs are stacked all over tables its closing time they say 
I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay 
Anywhere would be much better than lonely room of mine 
Through a lonely night a waitin' for 
Another place, Another time 
Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be 
I've been so used to holding you close to me 
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb 
To a lonely room waiting for another place, another time 
Won't that old stairway be hard to climb 
To a lonely room to wait for

I left my gal an' left my home

I went and broke my darling's heart

Locked me to a ball and chain

All alone I bear the shame
I'm a number, not a name
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

All I do is sit an' cry
When that evenin' train goes by
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you

Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.

Out on runway number nine, big seven-o-seven set to go
But I'm stuck here in the grass with a pain that ever grows
Now the liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
Well now there she goes my friend, she's a-rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver wing on high

She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground, as cold and drunk as I can be
