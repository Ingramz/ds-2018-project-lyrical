Al Sack & His Orchestra,"Others find peace of mind in pretending,
Couldn't you?
Couldn't I?
Couldn't we?
Might as well make believe I love you,
For to tell the truth I do",Make Believe,2000
Al Sack & His Orchestra,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2000
Al Sack & His Orchestra,"A rose must remain with the sun and the rain
Or its lovely promise won't come true
To each his own, to each his own
And my own is you

What good is a song if the words just don't belong?
And a dream must be a dream for two
No good alone, to each his own
For me there's you

[Chorus:]
If a flame is to grow there must be a glow
To open each door there's a key
I need you, I know, I can't let you go
Your touch means too much to me

Two lips must insist on two more to be kissed
Or they'll never know what love can do
To each his own, I've found my own
One and only you

[Chorus]",To Each His Own,2000
Al Sack & His Orchestra,"Some say that love is sweet as a rose,
Some say it's honey and the bee,
Well sit right down and let me tell you
What my love is to me.

""Candy""
I call my sugar ""Candy""
Because I'm sweet on ""Candy""
And ""Candy"" is sweet on me

He/She understands me,
My understanding ""Candy""
And ""Candy""'s always handy
When I need sympathy
I wish that there were four of him/her
So I could love much more of him/her

He/She has taken my complete heart,
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart
""Candy""
Its gonna be just dandy
The day I take my ""Candy""
And make him mine all mine
Mine",Candy,2001
Al Sears,"You ain't never been blue; no, no, no, 
You ain't never been blue, 
Till you've had that mood indigo. 
That feelin' goes stealin' down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh, ""Go 'long blues"".

I always get that mood indigo, 
Since my baby said goodbye. 
And in the evenin' when the lights are low, 
I'm so lonely I could cry. 
'Cause there's nobody who cares about me, 
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be. 
When I get that mood indigo, 
I could lay me down and die. 

You ain't never been blue; no, no, no,

I, I, I, I, I, I need you

Your love is, oh, so Heavenly
My darling, can't you see

When you're with me, such warmth
When your lips are touching mine
They're sweeter, much sweeter than wine

Al Sears,"Yesterday you came my way,
And when you smiled at me,
In my heart I felt a thrill you see,
That it was love at sight and
I was right to love you as I do.
Still I never dreamed that you could love me too.

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

You're telling ev'ry one I know
I'm on your mind each place we go
They can't believe that you're in love with me.

I have always placed you far above me.
I just can't imagine that you love me.
And after all is said and done,
To think that I'm the lucky one.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

Skies are gray. I'm blue each day
When you are not around.
Ev'ry thing goes wrong, my dear I've found
But when you're by my side I fill with pride
For I'm so proud of you
It all seems too good to me to all be true

Your eyes of blue, your kisses too,
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.

I hate to see that evening sun go down, 
'Cause my lovin' baby done left this town. 

If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today, 
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway.

She pulls my man around by her apron strings.

That we always hold dear
Good old summertime

With faces brown as berries

Al Simmons,"Tonight I heard the wild goose cry
Wingin' north in the lonely sky
Tried to sleep, but it ain't no use
'Cause I am the brother to the old wild goose

My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

The cabin is warm and the snow is deep
And I've got a woman, she lies asleep
When she wakes at tomorrow's dawn
She'll find, poor critter, that her man is gone

My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

My woman was kind and true to me
Thinks she loves me, the mournful she
She's gotta learn that it ain't no use
To love the brother to the old wild goose

My heart knows what the wild goose knows
And I must go where the wild goose goes
Wild goose, brother goose, which is best
A wanderin' foot or a heart at rest

Spring is comin' and the ice will break
And I can't linger for a woman's sake
She'll see a shadow pass overhead
She'll find a feather beside my bed

And I must go where the wild goose goes

Al Simmons,"Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me, Heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart
And in a world apart
A world where roses bloom

Angels sing from above

Seems to turn into love songs

To wake up all the neighborhood
To bring to every boy and girlie

All day long

up high in banana tree. 
Yellow bird,

Al Stewart,"The subway station's closed again
Sleeps beneath its veil of rain
My footprints' broken trail behind
Steals the nightlights from my mind

The dark deserted streets then clear
Today has lived and died in here
So I leave the chapel gloom 
To find the shelter of my tiny room

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in

The panelled patterns on the door
Chase shivering shadows to the floor
Upon the pillow worn and thin
The memories of hopes begin 
The carpet with its flowers and shredding
Spires a foot before my bed
The crack that won't return again
Advancing through my broken window pane

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright
It's all right till the last winding train fades from sight
Then alone in my room I must stay to lose or win
While these wild bedsitter images come back to hem me in

The friends I've left back home all write
With laughing words that warm my sight
Saying, Tell us, how's the city life
I reply and say just fine 
(Oh, you must be something)
And so you see I can't go back
Until I either win or crack
I'm standing in a one way street
The stage is set
(Oh, now you're set)
The story incomplete

But it's alright while the lights of the city shine so bright

Al Stewart,"I could have gone to Cambridge with Lionel
I think I tried to raise a pound
Just to see the University
And find the scenes she hung around
Is your mind a menagerie
Perhaps, I mean it's hard to say
A pterodactyl built its nest on me
I'm feeling strange but quite OK
On this beleeka doodle day
Archimedes and his orchestra
Loudly disapprove of life
Got mad when I called them unmusical

But I just hang around your city and
I don't have anything to say

I had a week once in Italy
With Mike and Robin and some songs
I had a girl once in Sweden but
I haven't seen her for too long
I drift down to the Cousins and
The usual people were all there
I saw a girl in the soft red light
I smiled but she looked away
On my beleeka doodle day

I wrote a song just before the dawn
And then I lost it now its gone
I spent all day playing Monopoly
It seemed to feel like getting on
Sometimes I wonder how it feels to be
Paul McCartney or the Queen
I wonder how they'd feel if they were me
I think its gonna start to rain
On this beleeka doodle day

Oh Jack the Ripper and Hippocrates
They're out to get me in the end
I think they'll find me by the ruined trees
Without a candle or a friend
Then they'll bring me to the wizard's cave
Softly mould me into clay
And lock me in with no telephone
And laugh and throw the keys away
On my beleeka doodle day

So to Avril and I would like to give
My thanks for lending me your room
I stayed one night, ah but I had to go
I think I'll maybe come back soon
Of all the girls that I have ever known
There wasn't one who didn't play
They came and went just like the newspapers
And left me mere to find my way
Through my beleeka doodle day",Beleeka Doodle Day,1967

Bouncing on the noses of the 
People from the train 
A flock of salty ears

Feet squelched soggy leaves across the grain

Al Stewart,"Prince Louis Battenberg is burning the admiralty lights down low
Silently sifting through papers sealed with a crown
Admiral Lord Fisher is writing to Churchill
Calling for more dreadnoughts
The houses in Hackney they are all falling down

And my grandmother sits on the beach in the days before the war
Young girl writing her diary while time seems to pause
Watching the waves as they come one by one to die on the shore
Kissing the feet of England

Oh, the lights of Saint Petersburg come on as usual
Although the air seems charged with a strangeness of late
Yet there's nothing to touch
And the Tzar in his great Winter Palace has called for the foreign news
An archduke was shot down in Bosnia but nothing much

And my grandmother sits by the mirror in the days before the war
Smiling a secret smile as she goes to the door
And the young man rides off in his carriage, homeward once more
And the sun sets gently on England

Ah the day we decided to drive down to worthing, it rained and rained
Giving us only a minute to stand by the sea
And crunching my way through the shingles
It seemed there was nothing changed
Though the jetty was maybe more scarred that I'd known it to be

Aunt Mandi and I stood and stared at the overcast sky
Where ten years ago, we had stood, my grandfather and I
And the waves still rushed in as they had the year that he died
And it seemed that my lifetime was shrunken and lost in the tide
As it rose and fell on the side of England

Prince Louis Battenberg is burning the admiralty lights

",Denise at 16,1967
Al Stewart,"She's a mollusk, a seamstress, a princess
A priestess, a negress, she knows her position
She's a swallow, a willow, a cello,
A pillow, a bow and also a physician

She takes your eyes and mends your head
She draws the wine and breaks the bread
She has no lies to tell you and no truths to sell you
She's a girl, she's almost a woman

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, biding his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

He's a hawthorn, a raven, a scarecrow, a haven
For moon blessed thought and opinion
He will laugh like the fountains, the bones of the mountains
Lie deep in his forest religion

You will call his name when evening falls
And the ground sets hard and the night wind calls
You will feed him and heed him, at times you will need him
Say, you were almost his woman

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, biding his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

In the shuddering mad, red blood let sunset
A tired man is leaving his cover
And the soft eyes of zero are cut by the sounds
Of the vanishing feet of her lover

And the door slams shut and the air grows tight
And her throat is gripped by the hands of night
And all that is left is the clock on the shelf
As it ticks one day into another

And zero, she sighs as the morning dies
With the broken wings of a seagull
From the mountain he watches her, sensing his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

At the pall of the day, the man of the mountain
Is nearing the end of his travel and the fence is down
On the west land bounds
And a footfall pounds in the gravel

Comes a knock three times and the air grows still
As he steps inside from the sudden chill
And the moment is caught in the net of the night
For the coming of dawn to unravel

And zero she flies as the morning sighs
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he's coming, judging his time
And his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

Ohh, zero she flies as the morning dies
Spreads her wings like a seagull
From her window he watches her, a man in his time
But his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

",Ivich,1967
Al Stewart,"Maid, truly I see now it must be a long way down
And with love's bud shorn
Now must all dalliance hither crumble and wither
Oh strange, methought it strange
Thou couldst deprive me of my crown 
And my freedom that thou cast upon me as 
Litter bears fruit of bitter strain 

And I would go forsooth to the dragon's tooth
If thus a chance were gained
To resurrect that part of your wanton heart
To whose grave my own is chained

And hold, ere thou dost go
Were not thy moments gilded too
And in honesty didst thou not measure for measure
Countenance pleasure
Cold were't thou so cold
This in thy mind be frozen too

And will not Spring be reborn
But might the sun thaw the frost here
That all be not lost herein

And I would rather, zounds
It were hell's own hounds
Whose foul breath upon my face
Did portent my doom, than to bear the gloom
Of a world stripped of thy grace

And so in truth I know
Yes it will be a long way down
And if go thou must, ere we should meet accidental
Prithee be gentle 
And though distant now
Perchance the hand of time may soothe
And though lost at six, if I should live to be seven 
I might forget Stephanie",A Long Way Down from Stephanie,1967
Al Stewart,"Most of the better bred woolen toys have gone to bed
And the teddy bear is a-sleeping in the cupboard
And the wooden soldiers all and the rubber bouncing ball
Are listening to the tales of mother Hubbard

But the fairy lights are dark on the Christmas tree
As restlessly I stand here forgotten and alone
I've been too long on the floor, I can't stay here any more
So Jenny, won't you please take me home?

Oh, the statues that I see are made out of blackest ivory
But I pass them by never guessing of their meaning
And a million voices cry as I walk across the sky
Though it's restless here, why it's only in betweening

For the journey that I'm on is incomplete
So to my feet I must rise now and travel on alone
Ah, but if you've got some time to spend in between now and the end
Oh Jenny, won't you please take me home?

Almost every word that I've said that you have heard
Hides another thought left unspoken
And if I may not reach it through the gutter of my speech
Then it best be left unsaid than lie broken

And if you wish to see, then from time to time look in my eyes
Oh, the gold is not far beneath the stone
If that will not say, it doesn't matter anyway
Jenny, won't you please take me home?

Al Stewart,"On a Christmas cake day one Friday in August
In a bookshop in Charing Cross Road
I first set eyes on a girl and at once I did know
She had eyes like a poet and hair like a rainbow
Reflecting the lights that did glow
And the sadness she kept in her eyes
Struck my senses a blow

And so as by chance at the touch of a glance
We could find ourselves out in the road
With no crush of time to defeat us and no place to go
And I couldn't say how but the coffee bar crowd 
Had appeared through the silence that broke
And she said, Oh my father's a judge in St Albans you know
Oh well, then perhaps I could help you 
You know that St. Albans is miles away
And I've got a room in Swiss Cottage in which you could stay
She laughed, Oh I couldn't do that, for I've got 
To be up in the morning you see
So I rang up to find out the first morning train she could take

And so in the gloom of a candlelit room
With spaghetti, two forks and a plate
She said, Oh I really would like to be free and escape
Oh well if it's like that
You don't have to go back
And you're perfectly welcome to stay
But I've not finished school yet 
She said as she got into bed 

And so as she slept and the pure morning crept 
Through the windows to take her away 
I thought you can't make people be what you want them to be
I could see my self nailed to a dormitory tale 
Of a holiday night's escapade
And just yesterday she had seemed like a woman to me

And so like a child with the sleep in her eyes
Where the sadness of age had once been
She left on the train with a see you again and a smile
And I couldn't say what I had won or I lost
Or even just what I had seen
But when I'm alone I just think of her once in awhile",Swiss Cottage Manoeuvres,1967
Al Stewart,"David Foster lives in Gloucester with his family
Works 'til pay-time, through the day-time, then comes home for tea
Steak and kidney, then with Sydney to his club and feels free
They close the bar, he finds his car and then goes home to sleep
And his wife has been with Rosie, in the parlour where it's cosy
Watching telly, doing dishes, patching pants and making wishes
And he'll say, Bill should have wired
And, Not tonight dear, I'm too tired
And life drifts slowly by in the provinces

Peter Foster goes to Gloucester for his first school day
Bites his teacher, sees a preacher and is taught to pray
Sees some birds and learns some words it's very, very rude to say
Yes, he's rather like his father was in his young day
And his father has discussions, holding forth about the Russians
Will the Red Chinese attack us
Do we need the Yanks to back us
And in bed she feels his shoulder, but he grunts and just turns over
And life drifts slowly by in the provinces

Wedding rings come with strings but love depends on the little things
Oh could that still be really you
Is there anything time can't do

David Foster's been promoted, he's a decent sort
Peter's gone to Dad's old Public School, it's good for sport
They've even got a private parking place down in Huntingdon Court
Maybe soon he'll be a magistrate, the neighbours thought
Yes, and then he'll teach the beatniks
And the hang-around-the-streetnicks
And the good-for-nothing loafers
Who knock girls up on their sofas
And his wife is quite nice, really
Though she seems a little dreamy
Recently

I was born and brought up on the east side of town
And my earliest days they passed quickly
I would play after school with the kids all around
In the sun and the dust of the back streets

Oh, all through my girlhood the war had its day
And my daddy he would always be leaving
So my brother and I we would sit by her side
Telling our tales through the evening

Oh, I grew with the days and the boys came to call
In the back shed I learned about kissing
But I don't think my mother has noticed at all
For we've heard that my daddy is missing

Then my school days they were over and I went off to work
And my mother grew quieter and greyer
So one day I left her and went off to live
With Billy, a saxophone player

In our broken down attic we laughed and made love
And all that we had we were sharing
Oh, we slept through the day and played into the night
God, we did as we pleased without caring

Oh but a year's passed away and he's left me one day
To play in a far away country
And the sun told my eyes, You've got no place to hide
As I waited to be having his baby

Oh I lived in the park and the men passed and stared
Each wondering which one had lost her
And one came to ask could he buy me a meal
And he said he was called David Foster

We were married that month and I swore to myself
Somehow I'd pay back what I owed him
Cooking his supper and cleaning his boots
Yes, and kidding myself I could love him

Oh, but now my baby is grown and he's gone out to school
And he looks very much like his daddy
And David has buried himself in his work
And the time on my hands, it hangs heavy

Oh, the neighbours they smile as we pass in the streets
And they make their remarks on the weather
But the butcher and baker deliver things now
And I've stopped going out altogether

Oh, I live by my mirror and stare in my eyes
Trying to make out who I see there
But I'm looking at a woman that I can't recognize
And I don't think she knows me either

There are lines on her face and her hair is a mess
And the light in her eyes it grows colder
In the morning there's nothing will change, ah but yes
I will be just a little bit older",The Ballad of Mary Foster,1969
Al Stewart,"Oh I come from Pittsburgh to study astrology
She said as she stepped on my instep
I could show you New York with a walk between Fourth Street and Nine
Then out of her coat taking seven harmonicas
She sat down to play on a doorstep
Saying, Come back to my place I will show you the stars and the signs
So I followed her into the black lands
Where the window frames peel and flake
And the old Jewish face behind the lace
Even now trying to get to see what's cooking
Just John the Baptist in the park getting laid thinking there's no-one looking
And its eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn

Her house was a dusty collection of rusty
Confusion with landings and tunnels
And leaning bookcases and spaces and faces and things
Where twenty-five Puerto Ricans, Manhattan Mohicans
And Jewish-Italian Pawnbrokers
Lead their theatrical lives in their rooms in the wings
While outside in the black lands
The violent day runs wild
And the black and white minstrels run through the crazy 
Alleys while the cops go booking
And ruthless toothless agents sneak around and there's no-one looking
And it's eighty degrees and I'm down on my knees in Brooklyn

And oh, I'm back in the city again
You can tell by the smell of the hamburger stand in the rain

She spoke of astrology while muttering apologies
For coffee that tasted of hot dogs
I said, That's OK, mine was cold anyway, and just grand
Then she lay on the bed while the radio fed
Us with records and adverts for cat food
And I looked at her, holding my thoughts in the palm of my hand
And outside in the black lands
The evening came and went
And the bums in the street begging money for one last drink
Are hanging round the liquor stores trying to get a foot in
And the girl from Pittsburgh and I made love on a mattress with the new moon looking
And in the cool evening breeze I was down on my knees in Brooklyn",In Brooklyn,1969
Al Stewart,"Mr. Willoughby, whose only luxury is the sugar in his tea
Teaches history at High Worthington School
His clothing has remained unnoticeably plain
His common room technique suitably restrained, though maybe too cool
Work done in the summery sun, see the cricket ball fly
Intently, like a strange demented bird towards the sun
Considering its flight, he pauses for a while
Ah, but Mr. Willoughby, we've never seen you smile
Tell me how come
Ah well, sometimes it must get lonely
Ah, but it's life and life only

Maurice, said Renee, Why didn't you say that you'd be so late
The supper that I made is ruined again
Is there anything you'd like 
No, nothing, he replied
Standing by the stairs, not looking in her eyes, so stupidly male
All dark and lying in bed, You've been with her again
She blurts out, then turning on her side begins to cry
At first he doesn't stir but then mumbling his words
He reaches for her hand, she shivers, but doesn't take it away
Ah, for sometimes it does get lonely
Ah, but it's life and life only.

Al Stewart,"can remember the first girl that I did love
It was Stephanie
In kindergarten arithmetic classes she used to
Sit next to me
I'd pass her sticky sweets under the table
Where the teacher couldn't see
Although she wouldn't remember me now
Sometimes I wonder where she can be

I can remember the first girl I kissed
It was Christine when I was ten
I'd been told we were moving away
I thought I'd never see her again

Oh don't forget me
I'll be back when they let me
Before you learn how to lie when you're leaving
Love is so much easier then

And at school would you believe three hundred boys
And no girls at all
But you're a fool if you should leave
Just think of the joys of rugby football

And prep in the morning and Brylcreem and acne
And cross-country running to kill evil thoughts
I'm surprised that I survived
I ran ten thousand miles with my back to the wall

I can remember the first girl that I made love to
It was in a park
In the lower pleasure gardens in Bournemouth
In summer just after dark

My mind was reeling: Oh what a feeling.
I missed the bus and walked twelve miles home
And it really didn't seem far

And all through my seventeenth summer
Running together from crowds and ties
Taking our clothes off and feeling each other
With fingers and senses and mouths and eyes

Incurring the glances of old disapproval
From elderly local inhabitant's eyes
Oh time, time we hardly even knew you
You didn't touch us with your lies

In the halcyon days of my late adolescence
My goal seemed clearly in sight
Playing electric guitar with a beat group
We set the ballrooms alight

Camping it up for the dyed blonde receptionists
Who told us we were al-ri-yi-yight
On an ego trip for a teenage superstar
On thirty shillings a nigh-yight

And so it fell that I came up to London
To look for fortune and fame
Starry eyed in my seaside successes
And much too sure of the game

First girl I met thereI thought I'd get there
But the first girl was nearly the last girl
She left my eyes in the drain
She sat on my floor in the dead of the night
Rolling a joint and looking round for a light
Her clothes were so black and her face was so white
How could I know what was right?

And I sat all huddled upon my bed
Watching her in my innocence
And it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence
Oh Artaud's anthology lay spread on the floor

And the thoughts that she gave me,
I'd not met before
And stranded half hypnotised,
I watched her in awe 
Of everything that she stood for

And I wanted more than anything to be like her with every sense
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence
She came over to me and kissed me in play

Taking my hand between her legs as she lay
And she looked in my eyes but I turned them away
Finding no words fit to say

And I hated myself, but could not move
Shattered in my confidence
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence

Now the stare of the lightbulb tore holes in my brain
As she got up in the silence that hung like a stain
And I wanted to speak, or to call out her name
But how could I begin to explain?

And my prosecuting room still holds
A strand of her hair in evidence
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence

Oh I still think about her when the night fills with rain
And speaks in its voices uneasy and vain
And I think were I maybe to find her again
Oh I'd probably see her more plain

And I should have known she was just like me
It was after all only common-sense
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence
But it was no sense at all, but too much sense
That took me to the bridge of impotence

At first I didn't go out much at all
I just stayed at home in my chains
Picking over the threads of my confidence
And searching for the remains

And when I couldn't stand any more of it
Going down to a club
Mixing in with the sounds and the crowds
I let the music cover me up

And only, lonely, the harlequins and painted phonies
Pick their ways, through the haze
Of highs and lows and blues
And all that I could do was to pick my way to you

Though I didn't tell you
You were just a thing to prove
I was hungry when found you, but I'm alright now

They sigh, they lie, the refugees and superheroes
On ice, so nice to see you, what's your name?
And all that I could do was to say the same to you
Take you for the moment, though the moment wasn't true
But I was hungry when I found you and I'm alright now

Though the street lamp cut through the curfew
It shed no light on our mind
It would have been so easy to love you
At any other time

Only, lonely, you came to me the night hung coldly
In your eyes, some other time I might have stayed with you
But all that I could do was to turn around to you
Thanks for what you gave me now it's time to say ""Adieu""
I was hungry when I found you but I'm alright now.

Ba ba ba alright now

And so it came that I stood disillusioned
By everything I'd been told
I just didn't believe love existed
They were all just digging for gold

Widows and bankers and typists and businessmen
Loved each other they said
But all it was though was just a manoeuvre
The quickest way into bed

And so I followed the others' example
And jumped into the melee
In the hunting grounds of Earls Court and Swiss Cottage
I did my best to get laid

Beer cans and parties, deb girls and arties
Bouncing around in the social confusion
Missing and making the grade

The very first time I must confess
I thought you'd be like all of the rest
And we'd be strangers once again
By the time we were dressed

But when you'd smoked your cigarette
And talked of some people that we'd me
I found myself asking was it set,
did you have to go yet

And so you laughed and then kissed me
And stayed for the whole weekend
Although the bed was so narrow
We had to sleep end to end

And so the weeks passed through my brain
In their dadaistic chain
I found myself seeing you again, and again and again
And all you gave you gave it free
Asking for nothing back from me

You gave yourself unselfishly as a part of me
And where I thought that just plucking
The fruits of the bed was enough
It grew to be less like fucking
And more like making love 

Of all the girls I ever knew
some loved and some denied me
And all the words I ever said
have been no use to hide me

And all the songs I ever sung
each one of them untied me
And all the girls I ever loved
have left themselves inside me",Love Chronicles,1969
Al Stewart,"Oh your pictures they don't really do you justice little girl
For you're careful not to let the camera touch your private world
And there's just a hint of sadness in your smile through the dark
As you slip your dress off slowly for the sailor or the clerk
And it could have been so different, and at times you feel bad
For you really did have something that the others never had
And the circle turns and turns and turns so mad, little girl

Ah you must have been just fifteen when you made your mind up first
That you'd make it in the movies and you couldn't lose the thirst
And it took you to the attic where the Agent King holds Court
And his courtesans are fully paid up losers of a sort
He looks at you and tells you that you just might get the part
But you don't get things for nothing and he doesn't want your heart
And the circle turns and turns and turns so mad, little girl

Mmm, you made it to the silver screen and yet you're not a star
And advertising corsets didn't get you too far
But money has its favourites and yours went back to them
So you modelled in a studio in Greek Street for the rent
There you met Antonio, your lover from afar
Who put you on the streets to make the money for his car
And the circle turns and turns and turns so fast, little girl

Ah, your pictures they don't really do you justice any more
For they're crumpled now and faded and were taken long ago
And that faintly coy expression has now left without a trace
Ah there's little of it buried in the ruins of your face
It could have been so different, and at times you feel bad
For you really did have something that the others never had
And the circle turns and turns and turns so mad, little girl

For the circle turns and turns and turns so sad, little girl
Oh the circle turns and turns and it's too bad, little girl",Old Compton Street Blues,1969

A willow,

A pillow, 
A bow 
And also a physician

She takes your eyes 
And mends your head
She draws the wine 
And breaks the bread
She has no lies to tell you 
And no truths to sell you
She's a girl, 
She's almost a woman

A scarecrow, 
A haven

Lie deep in his forest religion

And the ground sets hard and the night wind calls

On the westland bounds 
And a footfall pounds in the gravel

Comes a knock three times

As he steps inside from the sudden chill
And the moment is caught in the net of the night 
For the coming of dawn to unravel

Spreads her wings like a seagull
From the mountain he's coming, 
Judging his time
And his eyes are the eyes of an eagle

Al Stewart,"Oh I just came back from Haarlem
On the very last day of Autumn
Made it through the customs, took the bus into town
The flat looked cold and empty
The chairs unused and dusty
Just a few old letters and papers lying around
The Dutch people were friendly
You know they put me up and they fed me
All along a tour of one night stands

To ease your blues away

Was to find some way to let you know how I felt
You can't say much in an evening
If you know you'll soon be leaving
There's not much time to talk, and it's maybe as well
But I wanted to give you something
Because you knew you really helped me

Bound to lose

""0h I know that you were an outlaw"" she said
""And you robbed both the rich and the poor

And say I can heal all your wounds
In the morning your eyes just look hunted again
You'll be leaving soon""
And the silver, rays of the moon divide
In the slanting mists of the rain
And Maggie is on the prowl again

""So I know that you are an artist"" she said
""And you make your songs out of clay
For you carry the dust on your hands and your face
You never quite brushed it away
And you work with your back to an open door
While the light is beginning to fade
And the windows are liquid the sky is alive
And the night is jade""And the silver rays of the moon divide

Al Stewart,"The morning is humming, it's a quarter past nine
I should be working down in the vines
But I'm lying here with a good friend of mine
Watching the sun in her hair

I pick the grapes from the hills to the sea
The fields of France are a home to me
Ah, but today lying here is a good place to be
I can't go anywhere

But as we slip in and out of embrace
Like some old and familiar place
Reflecting all of my dreams in her face like before
On the last day of June 1934

Just out of Cambridge in a narrow country lane
A bottle-green Bentley in the driving rain 
Slips and skids round a corner, then pulls straight again
Heads up the drive to the door

The lights of the party shine over the fields
Where lovers and dancers watch Catherine wheels 
And argue realities digging their heels
In a world that's finished with war

And a lost wind of summer blows into the streets
Past the tramps in the alleyways, the rich in silk sheets
And Europe lies sleeping,
You feel her heartbeats through the floor
On the last day of June nineteenth

On the night that Ernst Roehm died voices rang out
In the rolling Bavarian hills
And swept through the cities and danced in the gutters
Grown strong like the joining of wills

Oh echoed away like a roar in the distance
In moonlight carved out of steel
Singing ""All the lonely, so long and so long
You don't know how I long, how I long
You can't hold me, I'm strong now I'm strong
Stronger than your law""

I sit here now by the banks of the Rhine
Dipping my feet in the cold stream of time
And I know I'm a dreamer, I know I'm out of line
With the people I see everywhere

The couples pass by me, they're looking so good
Their arms round each other, they head for the woods
They don't care who Ernst Roehm was, no reason they should
Just a shadow that hangs in the air

But I thought I saw him cross over the hill
With a whole ghostly army of men at his heel
And struck in the moment it seemed to be real like before
On the last day of June nineteen thirty four",The Last Day of June 1934,1974
Al Stewart,"I can well recall the first time I ever put to sea
It was on the old 'Calcutta' in 1853
I was just a lad of fourteen years, a midshipman to be
To make my way in sailing ships of the Royal Navy

By the time that I was twenty-one I'd sailed the world around
Weathered storms in the China seas with the hatches battened down
And made my way by starlight off the coast of Newfoundland
And dined on beer and herrings while the waves blew all around

I live in retirement now
And through my window comes the sound of seagulls
And sets my mind remembering
The evening stars like memories sail far beyond the distant trees
Way out across the open seas
I hear them sing

Oh the wooden ships they turned to iron and the iron ships to steel
And shed their sails like autumn leaves with the turning of the wheel
And I was given captain's rank and soon took under me
The proudest ship that ever sailed for queen and country

Ah, the old queen she passed away with the new born century
And I received my calling up to the admiralty
The sands ran through the hourglass each day more rapidly
As we watched the growing of the fleets of high Germany

So at last the Great War blazed
I waited with the passing days
The call to arms that never came
Writing letters

I may be old now in your eyes
But all my years have made me wise
You don't see where the danger lies
Oh call me back, call me back

But the war it ran its course, they could find no use for me
And I live in the country now, grandchildren on my knee
And sometimes think in all this world the saddest thing to be
Old admirals who feel the wind, and never put to sea

Now just like you I've sailed my dreams like ships across the sea
And some of them they've come on rocks, and some faced mutiny
And when they're sunken one by one I'll join that company
Old admirals who feel the wind, and never put to sea",Old Admirals,1974
Al Stewart,"Cut glass porcupine sailing on the Serpentine
Fingers on the skyline pulling down the black blinds
Terminal eyes at the edge of the night
Rivulet of dark wine moving in a straight line
Smudging out the stop signs, running down the life lines

Shadows on the ceiling, coffee cup congealing
Tarot cards revealing, a solitary feeling 
Terminal eyes, but I think it's alright
Silver studded jet plane screaming through the migraine 
Cutting through the cellophane, wrappers of your tired brain
Terminal eyes, put out the light

Only the lonely Arabian skies

Calling you home from your restless disguise
Hands of the windmill moving to a standstill
Rain on the windowsill, ashes on the phone bill

Echoes of the summertime flicker in the street-signs
Terminal eyes at the edge of the night

Al Stewart,"When we came to the station all the trains were rusty
The doors were open and the windows broken in
There was grass in all the cracks and the air hung musty
The travel posters were flapping in the wind
So we moved through the dust and gloom
Playing waiting games in the waiting-room
Lay our sleeping-bags out on the floor
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go

If I followed the coast road, I'd be home by evening
The harbor lights still cut across the bay
From the slot machine arcade the lights go streaming
To the bikes outside the rock 'n' roll cafe
Ah but you know those small town blues
Are really too much to lose
There's nothing really there to go back for
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go

Any railway station would be just fine, fine, fine
To settle down and wash the cobwebs from your head
Oh, if your situation's running dry, dry, dry
Find a waiting-room beneath the stars to make your bed'

Cause you know London can make your brain stall
The streets get cold and empty on a rainy night
So you duck into the subway station, you can hear the trains call
They want to take you to the Earl's Court Road, but it don't seem right
Cause it's na, na, na noowah
On the juke-box, singing in the burger bar
See the people's faces in the passing cars don't want to know
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a place to go

You have the most appealing surface I have seen
Bring it over here, lay it down by me
Don't mean to make you nervous, I just mean
To make you see, this is the place to be

When we came to the station all the trains were rusty
The air was empty and the platforms overgrown
There were old tin cans and cats and the doors were crusted
With mud and leaves and names carved long ago
And the rails go on for ever in a silver trail to the setting sun
You can follow them anywhere you want to go
And on Sunday morning easy rider comes to me with apple cider
Leaves me here without a need to know",Apple Cider Reconstitution,1975
Al Stewart,"Sometimes it seems unimaginable
That you were ever any other way
With your white rose face and your orphan clothes
Embroidered jeans and silver chains
You're a well known face in all the hang-out places
Where the lost souls congregate
You sit all night, but you talk too fast
I don't know what you're trying to say

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha
You've got a one-way ticket for all your yesterdays

I know your daddy said he'd talk to you
But he never really found the time
And your TV mother with her cocktail eyes
Could never really reach your mind
So you fixed your star to a passing dream
And took a cocaine holiday
Now the years flow round you in a muddy stream
And you need another place to stay.

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha
You've got a one-way ticket for all your yesterdays

Reach down, silvery ship from the stars, I know you're there
I know you'll understand me, you can take me anywhere
I know you must be there
Well, sometimes it seems impossible
That the game could get that rough
But the stage is set, the exit's barred
And the make-up won't come off
So you make your bow to the balcony
You light another cigarette
And the lights grow dim as the music starts
And it's easy to forget

Oh Carol, I think it's time for running for cover, a-ha
Believe me, you're everyone's and nobody's lover, a-ha

Al Stewart,"Hello old friend, what a strange coincidence to find you
It's been fifteen years since we last met, but I still recognised you
So call the barman over here, and let us fill our glasses
And drink a toast to olden times where all our memories lie
Where all our memories lie

Do you remember the time we were young?
Lowly, lowly, low
Outside the window the frosty moonlight hung
On the midnight snow

So we pulled our scarves around our faces in the night
Huddled on the doorsteps where the fairylights shone bright
Singing Christmas carols while our breath hung in the light
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday

Do you remember the changes as we grew?
Slowly, slowly, slow
Sneaking in the back way into movies after school
For the evening show

Chasing skinny blue jean girls across the building-site
Checking out the dance floor while the band played ""Hold Me Tight""
See the blonde one over there: I bet she'd be alright
It all comes back like yesterday
It almost seems like yesterday

While I talked he sat and he never made a sound
Staring at the glass beside me
Hey old friend, tell me what's on your mind?
Silence grows on you like ivy
Ivy

Do you remember the church across the sands?
Holy, holy, ho
You stood outside and planned to travel the lands
Where the pilgrims go

So you packed your world up inside a canvas sack
Set off down the highway with your rings and Kerouac
Someone said they saw you in Nepal a long time back
Tell me why you look away
Don't you have a word to say?

He said, ""I don't remember ... I Don't want to remember
In fact I've heard too much already
I don't want to think, just leave me here to drink
Wrapped up in the warmth of New York City

Oh, oh, it seems you just don't know
And you just don't understand me
I've got no use for the tricks of modern times
They tangle all my thoughts like ivy
Ivy""

So I left him, and I went out to the street
Lowly, lowly, low
Where the red light girls were coming after me
Forty dollar show

All across the city's heart the lights were coming on
The hotel lift softly hummed a Cole Porter song
If I went to look for him I knew he would be gone
A picture-card of yesterday

A photograph of yesterdayAnd far off in a deserted part of town
The shadows like a silent army
Flooded out the rooms in pools of blue and brown
And stuck to all the walls like ivy

Al Stewart,"He heard the clatter of her heels in the street
The clock said half-past three
He lay there waiting in the dark to hear
The scraping of the front-door key

He wouldn't say to her
""Don't want to know where you were""
She wouldn't find him there
Next time

She missed the train, she felt the rain upon her face
It seemed to clear her head
She watched him drive into the night
A broken tail-light, a speck of red

She still felt his touch
It didn't seem to mean that much
She wouldn't go back there
Next time

When you were just a kid you loved
To go to movies in the afternoon

Al Stewart,"It's the kind of grey November day that washes away reflections
In the eyes of hotel porters
And the latticed wooden benches by the sea contain no travellers
Or Irish lady authors

And the girl in the raincoat walks the lanes of Brighton
With her collar turned against the wind
And hovers in the doorways of second-hand bookshops
Among the dust and fading print

And you're not the one she's thinking of
And you're not the one she really wants
Just a point along the line she's leaving from

She goes into a cafe, orders tea, looks at the menu
But there's nothing really on it
And the place is as deserted as a plaza in a heat-wave
And the cloth has jam upon it

But the girl in the raincoat doesn't stop to count the tea-leaves
Or turn to see the mists around the sun
For the winter's unfolding around her
And it's time for moving on

And you're not the one she's thinking of
And you're not the one she really wants
Just a station on the line she's leaving from

And so you sit there in the middle of the carpet
With her suitcases around you
And it comes to you she journeyed to the center of your life
But she never really found you

Just another girl in a raincoat
Who shared the passing of the days
And you're glad of the warmth that she gave you
And you hardly need to say

That she's not the one you're thinking of
No she's not the one you really want
Just a point along the line you're leaving from",Not the One,1975
Al Stewart,"I was drawn by the sirens of Titan
Carried along by their call
Seeking for a way to enlighten
Searching for the sense of it all

Like a kiss on the wind I was thrown to the stars
Captured and ordered in the army of Mars
Marching to the sound of the drum in my head
I followed the call

Only to be Malachi Constant
I thought I came to this earth
Living in the heart of the moment
With the riches I gained at my birth

But here in the yellow and blue of my days
I wander the endless Mercurian caves
Watching for the signs the Harmonians make
The words on the walls

I was drawn by the sirens of Titan
And so I came in the end
Under the shadow of Saturn
With statues and birds for my friends

Finding a home at the end of my days
Looking around I've only to say
I was the victim of a series of accidents

And you lay there by the Do Not signs, and shamed them with your spark
Now winter moans in old men's bones as the day falls into dark
So it's goodbye to my lady of the islands

Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through

While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket

Wasting our time
In such a gentle way
We hardly need to say a word, it's just okay

And already the sun has gone, and it's growing dark outside,
I can see your face reflected in the red electric firelight,
And our shadow is an embryo
That slowly comes to life

And as it moves across the wall
It seems to feel the fire of living
Growing stronger as it climbs
To shiver in a blaze

Across the ceiling
And the soundless crash of the sea
Fills the room with the scent of the breeze
And the waves break over

The beach of our bodies
As you reach your fingers out to me

Why don't we take the whole of next week off work,
We're falling

Hangs her clothes up
Hopes tonight the contract won't be broken
Well, they kick you round so much when you're not a star
Make you play all night just for a pittance or a token
But all these imperfections never bothered her at all

There's something that enables her to rise above it all
To shrug it off, just when it seems to go too far

Don't know why",Almost Lucy,1978
Al Stewart,"And in the evening when the day goes down
She leaves the bright house lights
Stands and watches with her coat pulled around
At torches light the western skies

Sometimes she thinks she knows him just too well
Other times not much at all
They live their lives in some familiar spell
And catch each other when they fall

Nothing lasts, well she knows, try to hang on
When it's gone, you'll be burned
Fashions and friends come and go
Everyone travels that road in their turn

She wants to run out where the day meets the night
Far beyond these midwest farms
But she'll be with him till the day she finds
A stranger lying in her arms",End of the Day,1978
Al Stewart,"What if you reached the age of reason
Only to find there was no reprieve
Would you still be a man for all seasons?
Or would you just have to leave
We measure our days out
In steps of uncertainty
Not turning to see how we've come
And peer down the highway
From here to eternity
And reach out for love on the run
While the man for all seasons
Is lost behind the sun

Henry Plantagenet still looks for someone
To bring good news in his hour of doubt
While Thomas More waits in the Tower of London
Watching the sands running out
And measures the hours out
From here to oblivion
In actions that can't be undone
A sailor through the darkness
He scans the meridian
And caught by the first rays of dawn
The man for all seasons
Is lost beneath the storm

And I should know by now
I should know by now
I hear them call it out all around
Oh, they go
There's nothing to believe in
Hear them,
Just daydreams, deceiving
They'll just let you down

What if you reached the age of reason
Only to find there was no reprieve
Would you still be a man for all seasons?
Or would you just disbelieve?

We measure our gains out in luck and coincidence
Lanterns to turn back the night
And put our defeats down to chance or experience
And try once again for the light
Some wait for the waters of fortune to cover them
Some just see the tides of ill chance running over them

Some call on Jehovah
Some cry out to Allah
Some wait for the boats that still row to Valhalla
Well, you should try to accept what the fates are unfolding
While some say they're sure where the blame should be falling
You look round for maybe a chance of forestalling
Bot too soon its over and done
And the man for all seasons
Is lost behind the sun",A Man for All Seasons,1978
Al Stewart,"The wands of smoke are rising
From the walls of the Bastille
And through the streets of Paris
Runs a sense of the unreal

The Kings have all departed
There servants are nowhere
We burned out their mansions
In the name of Robespierre

And still we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

Inside the midnight councils
The lamps are burning low
On you sit and talk all through the night
But there's just no place to go

And Bonaparte is coming
With his army from the south
Marat your days are numbered
And we live hand to mouth

While we wait
To see the day begin
Our time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

The ghost of revolution
Still prowls the Paris streets
Down all the restless centuries
It wonders incomplete

It speaks inside the cheap red wine
Of cafe summer nights
Its red and amber voices
Call the cars at traffic lights

Why do you wait 
To see the day begin
Your time is wasting in the wind
Wondering why
Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles

Wondering why, it echoes 
Through the lonely palace of Versailles",The Palace of Versailles,1978
Al Stewart,"While travelling northwards
On a back country lane
I came on the village
Where first I grew
And stopped to climb up
The hill once again
Looking down from the tracks
To the grey slate roofs

I watched the village moving
As the day went slowly by
In the field we lay here
Lovers' footsteps went by
In the fields we lay here
My very first love and I
Under timeless arcadian skies
Under timeless arcadian skies

The old canal lies
Sleeping under the sky
The barges are gone to a lost decade
On overgrown banks here
Lovers' footsteps went by
Long before ever the roads were made
And in our turn we passed here
And carved our names on trees
As the days washed by like
Waves of an endless sea
Under timeless arcadian skies
Under timeless arcadian skies

Time runs through your fingers
You never hold till its gone
Some fragments just linger with you
Like snow in the spring hanging on

I left the village behind in the night
To fade like a sail in the darkening seas
The shifts and changes in the patterns of life
Will weather it more that the centuries
And in another village in a far off foreign land
The new day breaks out opening up its hand
And the sun has the moon in his eyes
As he wanders the timeless skies",Timeless Skies,1978
Al Stewart,"It was late in December, the sky turned to snow
All round the day was going down slow
Night like a river beginning to flow
I felt the beat of my mind go
Drifting into time passages
Years go falling in the fading light
Time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight
Well I'm not the kind to live in the past
The years run too short and the days too fast
The things you lean on are the things that don't last
Well it's just now and then my line gets cast into these
Time passages
There's something back here that you left behind
Oh time passages
Buy me a ticket on the last train home tonight

Hear the echoes and feel yourself starting to turn
Don't know why you should feel
That there's something to learn
It's just a game that you play

Well the picture is changing
Now you're part of a crowd
They're laughing at something
And the music's loud
A girl comes towards you
You once used to know
You reach out your hand

The fights are going down
The gypsy armies of the evening
Have lit their fires across
The nether side of town
They will not pass this way again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light

I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
The Holy Sister bars her doors against the East
Her house has stood too long divided
The uninvited guests are breaking up the feast
She may not bid them leave again
So here in the night
Leave your home it's time for running
Out of the light

I see the hosts of Mohammed coming
I dreamed I stood like this before
And I'm sure the words that I heard then
Were much the same

Held over by popular acclaim

Down metal snake corridors steely grey

How strange life in dark water can be

Oh mariners spare a thought when you pass
Those who live the submarine life
Far in the deep sonar eyes never sleep
Hiding like a shadow in the night
Jet planes nose through the clouds above me
They look for radar traces of me to see
They'll never know, never no never
How strange life in dark water can be

Wonder what the stars look like
Coming out tonight
Tell my girl she must be strong
She sits and waits all night long
Just looking for a better day
She'll have to find another way to go

No memory, tell me what's wrong with me
Why am I alone here with no rest

Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

In the islands where I grew up

Al Stewart,"They crossed over the border, the hour before dawn
Moving in lines through the day
Most of our planes were destroyed on the ground where they lay
Waiting for orders we held in the wood
Word from the front never came
By evening the sound of the gunfire was miles away
Ah, softly we move through the shadows, slip away through the trees
Crossing their lines in the mists in the fields on our hands and on our knees
And all that I ever
Was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red
Silhouetting the smoke on the breeze

All summer they drove us back through the Ukraine
Smolensk and Viasma soon fell
By autumn we stood with our backs to the town of Orel
Closer and closer to Moscow they come
Riding the wind like a bell
General Guderian stands at the crest of the hill
Winter brought with her the rains, oceans of mud filled the roads
Gluing the tracks of their tanks to the ground while the sky filled with snow
And all that I ever
Was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red
Silhouetting the snow on the breeze

In the footsteps of Napoleon the shadow figures stagger through the winter
Falling back before the gates of Moscow, standing in the wings like an avenger
And far away behind their lines the partisans are stirring in the forest
Coming unexpectedly upon their outposts, growing like a promise
You'll never know, you'll never know which way to turn, which way to look you'll never see us
As we're stealing through the blackness of the night
You'll never know, you'll never hear us
And the evening sings in a voice of amber, the dawn is surely coming
The morning roads lead to Stalingrad, and the sky is softly humming

Two broken Tigers on fire in the night
Flicker their souls to the wind
We wait in the lines for the final approach to begin
It's been almost four years that I've carried a gun
At home it will almost be spring
The flames of the Tigers are lighting the road to Berlin
Ah, quickly we move through the ruins that bow to the ground
The old men and children they send out to face us, they can't slow us down
And all that I ever
Was able to see
The eyes of the city are opening
Now it's the end of the dream

I'm coming home, I'm coming home, now you can taste it in the wind, the war is over
And I listen to the clicking of the train-wheels as we roll across the border
And now they ask me of the time that I was caught behind their lines and taken prisoner
""They only held me for a day, a lucky break,"" I say they turn and listen closer
I'll never know, I'll never know why I was taken from the line and all the others
To board a special train and journey deep into the heart of holy Russia
And it's cold and damp in the transit camp, and the air is still and sullen
And the pale sun of October whispers the snow will soon be coming
And I wonder when I'll be home again and the morning answers ""Never""
And the evening sighs, and the steely Russian skies go on forever",Roads to Moscow,1980

The road into town passes through

Alone in the dark with a drink
With a candle flame burning before you

If it doesn't come naturally, leave it
That's what she said as she turned out the light
And we bent our backs as slaves of the night
She lowered her guard and showed me the scars
She got from trying to fight
Saying oh, you'd better believe it

Well I'm up to my neck in the crumbling wreckage
Of all that I wanted from life
When I looked for respect all I got was neglect
Though I swallowed the line as a sign of the times
But dealing a jack from the back of the pack
They said-You lose again
Oh, I said, who needs it?


Well don't get me wrong now I tried to get on
With the jokers that got in my way
And I put on a smile and I tried all the while to be straight
But they just wanted more all the time and I'm sure
That you know what I mean when I say
That I'm sick of the touch and there's only so much you can take.


Well nothing that's real is ever for free
And you just have to pay for it sometime
She said it before, she said it to me
I suppose she believed there was nothing to see
But the same old four imaginary walls
She built for living inside
I said oh, you just can't mean it


Well there was never a doubt that she had to get out
She was just looking around for a way
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things
That she wanted, but just couldn't say
And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before.


Well nothing that's forced can ever be right
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it
That's what she said as she turned out the light

The veil that covered her eyes

In a kingdom lost in time.

And bent you to their will.

The gold bars and the gun

Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing

And should they come upon your tracks

Al Stewart,"I sat upon the Evening Hill
The shadows set, the night grew still
And as I sat, guitar on knee
A voice of flowers called to me

Sing, sing to me your song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone

I turned with eyes that strained for sight
And there amid the failing light
Dimly saw a figure small
Heard a voice of magic call

Sing, sing to me your song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone

My fumbling fingers found the chords
My trembling lips fought for the words
I stopped to ask the stranger how
He softly said, no questions now

But sing, sing to me your song
Sing, for I belong to the night
In the grey morning light
I'll be gone

Then with the magic of the elves
My fingers danced among themselves
A heart with lightness thus endowed
Formed melodies I know not how

Song, played the whole night long
Thus he danced and clapped through the night
And with grey morning light
He was gone

Now whispering wind plays o'er the hill
And the evening sounds again grow still
A year or more has passed since then

Al Stewart,"I sent my crack divisions through the early morning mist
When they fell on your positions you were powerless to resist
Encircling and probing for the weakness in your lines
By night you were surrounded and your territory mine

I called for your surrender; this you swore you would not do
So I stormed the very fortress that you thought could shelter you
I saw you then upon your knees and turned to give my thanks
To the regiments assembled in their ranks

Where are they now?
Where are they now?

I raised you to your feet and with you hand inside my own
We set off upon a journey, each together each alone
And in the days that followed oh our lives did overlap
I knew the contours of your body like the roads upon a map

I savored every evening, and you sweetened every day

Here, somewhere near

And sent my spies to fathom out the secrets in your head

Ringing through the summer night

In the company of strangers
And your eyes were wild and bright
And though I grew reclusive and my days became withdrawn
I held the banner of our love, now tattered and forlorn

And thought that it would one day fly above us once again
To do this, I had my reasons then
Where are they now?
Where are they now? 

I'm sure, you must be close
Once again, bring the light
Here, very near
Oh you're just out of sight

Perhaps there are some passions that are tempered by the years
You reach accommodation, the intensity recedes
Some of that occurred to me the time I saw you last
Your face familiar in a way, your voice out of the past

Fell away between us in the turning of that page

Al Stewart,"You told the man in the Broadway Hotel
Nothing was stranger than being yourself
And he replied, with a tear in his eye
Love was a rollaway
Just a cajole away
Mist on a summer's day
Nothing was clear
Love was a smile away
Just a defile away
I sought it every way
No one came near.

You asked the man for a room with a view
Nothing was said as he stared at his shoe
Then he replied as he gave you the key
Love was a rollaway
Just an unfold away
That's all there is to say
No one came near.

Alone in your room you hide
As the night rolls by
In the street outside
And you feel over the words he said
Till they turn to rain all around your head

You're seeking a hideaway
Where the light of day
Doesn't touch your face
And a door sign keeps the world away
Behind the shades
Of your silent day.

You made your home in the Broadway Hotel
Room service came at the push of a bell
And the man said as he put down the tray
Love was a stealaway
Just a reveal away
I tried to find a way
Nothing was clear
Then as he turned away
You asked the man to stay
He was there all the day
No-one came near",Broadway Hotel,1992
Al Stewart,"The rain came down like beads 
Bouncing on the noses of the 
People from the train 
A flock of salty ears 
Sparkled in the traffic lights 
Feet squelched soggy leaves across the grain 
I took my love to Clifton in the rain 

And all along the way 
Wanderers in overcoats with 
Collars on parade 
And steaming in the night 
The listeners in the Troubadour 
Guitar player weaves a willow strain 
I took my love to Clifton in the rain

Al Stewart,"With your photographs of Kitty Hawk
And the biplanes on your wall
You were always Amy Johnson
From the time that you were small
No schoolroom kept you grounded
While your thoughts could get away
You were taking off in Tiger Moths
Your wings against the brush-strokes of the day
Are you there
On the tarmac with the winter in your hair
By the empty hangar doors you stop and stare
Leave the oil-drums behind you, they won't care
Oh, are you there

Oh, you wrapped me up in a leather coat
And you took me for a ride
We were drifting with the tail-wind
When the runway came in sight
The clouds came up to gather us
And the cockpit turned to white
When I looked the sky was empty
I suppose you never saw the landing-lights
Are you there
In your jacket with the grease-stain and the tear
Caught up in the slipstream of dare
The compass roads will guide you anywhere
Oh, are you there

The sun comes up on Icarus as the night-birds sail away
And lights the maps and diagrams
That Leonardo makes
You can see Faith, Hope and Charity
As they bank above the fields
You can join the flying circus
You can touch the morning air against your wheels
Are you there
Do you have a thought for me that you can share
Oh I never thought you'd take me unawares
Just call me if you ever need repairs
Oh, are you there",Flying Sorcery,1992
Al Stewart,"In the east the wind is blowing the boats across the sea
And their sails will fill the morning and their cries ring out to me

Oh, I had a dream
It seemed I stood alone
And the veil of all the years
Goes sinking from my eyes like a stone

A king shall fall and put to death by the English parliament shall be
Fire and plague to London come in the year of six and twenties three
An emperor of France shall rise who will be born near Italy

One named Hister shall become a captain of Greater Germanie
No law does this man observe and bloody his rise and fall shall be

Two great men yet brothers not make the north united stand
Its power be seen to grow, and fear possess the eastern lands

Three leagues from the gates of Rome a Pope named Pol is doomed to die
A great wall that divides a city at this time is cast aside

I had no care in the world
Not a cloud disturbed the sky
I was dreaming only of how it might be
Then dark fell into the day
And the wind began to rise
Peter on the White Sea
Green mountains of waves
Blew all around
Peter on the White Sea
The howl of the wind, that lonesome sound
Sailors made their peace then with the Almighty
Still I kept hope in my heart
Through the salt and stormy night
Every hour the wind struck ever harder
We held on tight in the dark
As our bow rose and fell
Till we came with daylight into the harbor
Hard by the monastery walls
To the ringing of a bell
Peter on the White Sea
A day to recall when days are done

Al Stewart,"Born in England's pleasant green
Like a picture postcard scene
To childhood spread with fond maternal care
From the day that he was born
Proud relations came to fawn
And compliment his pretty golden hair

In boyhood sent away
To a boarding school to stay
Its crumbling proud traditions forced to bear
And his friends in this new world
Said he looks more like a girl
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair

Fades secluded youth
Into manhood's search for truth
His mother's eyes now wet had turned to stare
For he said I must be bound
This day for London town
For I believe my fortune's waiting there

So like an eager cutting knife
He plunged in a new life
Oh never known beforehand anywhere
And the thought that he might trip
In his ignorance and slip
Never struck beneath his pretty golden hair

Ah the days soon grew thin
And boredom fast set in
His job was thrown away without a care
For a man who softly said
You'll earn twice as much instead
With those blue eyes and pretty golden hair

Well London town possessed
Of many a tempter's nest
And thus he fell with scarce another care
As so easily he slipped
Into prostitution's grip
Foundationed by his pretty golden hair

Ah but the years quickly flew
And his mind slowly grew
From early freedom into deep despair
As the money ceased to roll
A tired and lonely soul
Poured curses on his pretty golden hair

Ah the years stole their time
Now the living's hard to find
And early friends have vanished in the air
And the gay parties's ease
Changed to public lavatories
Have turned to grey his pretty golden hair

Oh his life was only used
And his body just abused
By those who never think and never care
But though his file said suicide
No, that wasn't why he died
It was murder by his pretty golden hair",Pretty Golden Hair,1993

As I kicked my feet through the snowy world
And in that land there I held the hand of my
Scandinavian girl

We stood as part of a bleak facade
Though the city's heart was still beating
And for a while there I shared a smile with my
Scandinavian girl

And I stood there quite surprised 
To see reflected in her eyes
The very thought I left unsaid
As too unwise

And so we passed through a world of glass
And the moment passed and was lost to time

Tribesmen cheer and gaze wide-eyed
At such celebrity

The Royal smile from magazines
Waving hands from limousines
The crowd holds pictures of the Queen

Concerned with what they mean

In the dark, in the dark
Oh I never saw the danger or the spark
In the dark, in the dark
I was feeling like a stranger
'Cause I never saw the changes in your heart

Those angry words you soon regret
Are gone but not forgotten yet
She may forgive, she won't forget
Each individual scar

You make it up and say no more
And go on living like before
But every wave erodes the shore
And tarnishes the star

You sow each seed of discontent
Wonder where the loving went
Every night that's heaven sent
The dawn can sweep away

And in the background all the time
Like some ironic church bell chime
You watch the Royal couple climb
Towards their destiny

Like a watercolor in the rain
Don't bother asking for explanations
She'll just tell you that she came
In the year of the cat

She doesn't give you time for questions
As she locks up your arm in hers
And you follow 'till your sense of which direction
Completely disappears
By the blue tiled walls near the market stalls
There's a hidden door she leads you to
These days, she says, I feel my life
Just like a river running through
The year of the cat

While she looks at you so cooly
And her eyes shine like the moon in the sea
She comes in incense and patchouli
So you take her, to find what's waiting inside

Well morning comes and you're still with her
And the bus and the tourists are gone
And you've thrown away your choice you've lost your ticket
So you have to stay on

In the rhythm of the new-born day
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
But for now you're going to stay

Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

Moving in lines through the day
Most of our planes were destroyed on the ground where they lay
Waiting for orders we held in the wood - word from the front never came
By evening the sound of the gunfire was miles away
Ah, softly we move through the shadows, slip away through the trees
Crossing their lines in the mists in the fields on our hands and our knees
And all that I ever was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red silhouetting the smoke on the breeze
All summer they drove us back through the Ukraine
Smolyensk and Viyasma soon fell
By autumn we stood with our backs to the town of Orel
Closer and closer to Moscow they come - riding the wind like a bell
General Guderian stands at the crest of the hill
Winter brought with her the rains, oceans of mud filled the roads
Gluing the tracks of their tanks to the ground while the sky filled with snow
And all that I ever was able to see
The fire in the air glowing red silhouetting the snow on the breeze
In the footsteps of Napoleon the shadow figures stagger through the winter
Falling back before the gates of Moscow, 
Standing in the wings like an avenger
And far away behind their lines the partisans are stirring in the forest
Coming unexpectedly upon their outposts, growing like a promise
You'll never know, you'll never know 
Which way to turn, which way to look, you'll never see us
As we're stealing through the blackness of the night 
You'll never know, you'll never hear us
And the evening sings in a voice of amber, the dawn is surely coming
The morning road leads to Stalingrad, and the sky is softly humming
Two broken Tigers on fire in the night flicker their souls to the wind
We wait in the lines for the final approach to begin
It's been almost four years that I've carried a gun
At home it'll almost be spring
The flames of the Tigers are lighting the road to Berlin
Ah, quickly we move through the ruins that bow to the ground
The old men and children they send out to face us, they can't slow us down
And all that I ever was able to see
The eyes of the city are opening now it's the end of the dream
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Now you can taste it in the wind, the war is over
And I listen to the clicking of the train wheels as we roll across the border
And now they ask me of the time 
That I was caught behind their lines and taken prisoner
""They only held me for a day, a lucky break"", I say; 
They turn and listen closer
I'll never know, I'll never know
Why I was taken from the line and all the others
To board a special train and journey deep into the heart of holy Russia
And it's cold and damp in the transit camp, and the air is still and sullen
And the pale sun of October whispers the snow will soon be coming
And I wonder when I'll be home again and the morning answers
""Never""
And the evening sighs and the steely Russian skies go on forever",Roads to Moscow [Live],2003
Al Stewart,"This is the day you disappeared
Your hand was steady and I know that your mind was clear
You left a note up on the shelf
Saying ""I would rather be anyone but myself""

You took a simple ride across the Great Divide
You left the television on in you room
Your friends were sad although they said ""I told you so""
You never really did fit into your skin

The small annoying things you do
All seemed so cute and entertaining when they were new
This kind of honeymoon can't last
I think you knew you wore your welcome out much too fast

I was surprised to see you played the lottery
Your winning ticket you won't need anymore
You were in such a rush you never stopped to check
You jacket pocket on your way out the door

This is your anniversary
I'll light a candle in the window so you might see
This is the day you had to go
Good-bye then, this concludes your portion of the show",Anniversary,2005
Al Stewart,"Nothing that's forced can ever be right 
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it 
That's what she said as she turned out the light 
And we bent our backs as slaves of the night 
Then she lowered her guard and showed me the scars 
She got from trying to fight 
Saying oh, you'd better believe it. 

Well I'm up to my neck in the crumbling wreckage 
Of all that I wanted from life 
When I looked for respect all I got was neglect 
Though I swallowed the lign as a sign of the times 
But dealing a jack from the back of the pack 
They said-""You lose again"" 
Oh, I said, who needs it? 

Well don't get me wrong now I tried to get on 
With the jokers that got in my way 
And I put on a smile and I tried all the while to be straight 
But they just wanted more all the time and I'm sure 
That you know what I mean when I say 
That I'm sick of the touch and there's only so much you can take. 

Well nothing that's real is ever for free 
And you just have to pay for it sometime 
She said it before, she said it to me 
I suppose she believed there was nothing to see 
But the same old four imaginary walls 
She built for living inside 
I said oh, you just can't meana it 

Well there was never a doubt that she had to get out 
she was just looking around for a way 
In the pit of the night there was nowhere to hide any more 
She was out on a limb, she was reaching for things 
That she wanted, but just couldn't say 
And she had to be sure that she wouldn't get caught like before. 

Well nothing that's forced can ever be right 
If it doesn't come naturally, leave it 
That's what she said as she turned out the light 
And she may have been wrong, and she may have been right 
But I woke with the frost, and noticed she'd lost 
The veil that covered her eyes 
I said oh, you can leave it.

Woolen toys have gone to bed
And the teddy bear is a-sleeping in the cupboard
And the wooden soldiers all
And the rubber bouncing ball
Are listening to the tales of mother Hubbard

But the fairy lights are dark
On the Christmas tree as restlessly
I stand here forgotten and alone
I've been too long on the floor,
I can't stay here any more
So Jenny won't you please take me home.

Oh the statues that I see
Are made out of blackest ivory
But I pass them by never guessing of their meaning
And a million voices cry
As I walk across the sky
Though it's restless here, why it's only in-betweening

For the journey that I'm on
Is incomplete so to my feet
I must rise now and travel on alone
Ah, but if you've got some time to spend
In between now and the end
Oh Jenny won't you please take me home.

Now almost every word that I've said that you have heard
Hides another thought left unspoken
And if I may not reach it through the gutter of my speech
Then it best be left unsaid than lie unbroken

You're halfway to the door
The voice said 'get out while you can,
There's just 1O minutes, nothing more'

Time only for the essentials
Better gather them and run
The false name inside the passport,
The gold bars and the gun

And once again they've come out of the past
And though your mind is cool your heart is beating fast
You've been through it all before
Each time you wish a little more that you could ask

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?'

It's a long and twisting journey
From the sweeping northern plains
To the outcrops of the jungle
Bowed beneath the tropic rains

In the customs hall the officer
Takes you to one side
And his eyes reveal no feeling
As you hand over the bribe

And once again you've bought a little time
And once again you're fading out of sight
Still the fox is growing older
As he calls over his shoulder to the night:

""What do you want from me?
What do you need from me?
There's no rest for the running man
Why can't you let him be?""

Here, come over here
Beneath a sympathetic moon
We'll sit and talk over old times without a fear
Another beer, from the cafes of the night

The tumbling rhythms of guitars ring loud and clear
One by one they've nailed the others
But you always got away
What it is that keeps you just that step ahead

No one can say
In one last raid the agents
Of the dawn break down the door
Of a house where you were standing

Maybe just an hour before
And still the thread continues to unwind
You take the hidden roads that only you can find
And should they come upon your tracks

There's just a question hanging back you left behind

What do you need from me?
No rest for the running man

A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love

Speak once again of my love, my own.

It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more !""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! For Heaven's sake!

Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,

It would bore me terrifically,too,

Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998

They cry from fear I'm crying due to my madness/
I'm laughing as I cut up my face with broken glasses/
Surpass bliss with the pain so strange it fascinates/
Go rabid as the savage engage you need to vaccinate/
pack a razor blade in my skin slash it to make you grin/
stuff a slut full of my nut just to break her in/
It pays to sin motherfucker you gotta play to win/
They're hating him Forsaken the worst and I've disgraced my kin/
Fuck it though your face where my fucking knuckles go/
So pucker up this ain't no sucker punch its my fucking show/
I punish foes with blows and flows that eat the soul/

The hatred and racism and placed it across nations/
Embracing the heartbreak as I'm breaking the foundation/
Aroused by bloodshed its he sound and these frowned faces/

I've questioned their every move like they're building around masons/
Now they're about facing I'm never about patience/
They should've been out so now their flesh I'm about tasting/

Keep on, keep on, keep on moving
Banging, swerving lane to lane

[Al-D]
Gripping on grain, while the 15's bang
Know you wonder if it's thunder, where the fuck is the rain
Lane to lane dripping blue, puffing on coo-coo
Candy wetter than do, banging nothing but Screw
Reclined on buck, like I'm stuck in the mud
Ripping my mug cause I'm thug, sipping straight out the jug
Ghetto thoed we ghetto known, wih mo' ice on my heart
Boy got mo' ice, than a W march
Bout to knock my trunk off, with this shit down South
Knocking pictures off your wall, when I pass by your house
Know your spouse is your trojan, if you love her than get her
Cause she stuck on a G, like a god damn sweater
Hotter than a baretta, trying to give it up fast
Left her stupid like cupid, and put a plug in her ass
Swanging glass moving fast, as I dash through your hood
Picking splinters out my palm mayn, gripping on wood

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[K-Rino]
Hear them niggaz bumping, but they can't forget
Swanging down bumping tip, champagne under the tent
Trend setter, red beam for plexing
Crawling, living the life of a Texan
Get down your block three in the morning, waking the hood up
Crawling purple passion, up in my cup
I-10 to 71, mash the gas to Austin
Chrome glossing, big bossing flossing
Block to block spot to spot, no need for tripping
Still collecting my ends, in the 2K dimension
Twist a leaf out the leaf, as I crawl through the street
Waiting on the sunrise, praying a G on deep
It's a Sunday a fun day, and I crawl down Sunnydale
Sparkling sun rays, making the game prevail
Jazzy broads whispering, boppers shaking they tail
You can do what you do, I'm all about my mail

[Hook: Ronnie Spencer - 2x]
[Yungstar]
Lights, camera, action it's on
Bang out my garage, and I'm on 20 inch chrome
Grab my phone, cause I'm calling Al-D
When they see the buttons, don't try to compare me
She gon stare G, so you better get her
I'm coming down, and I'm banging the Hardest Pit of the litter
Down South, keep our name out your mouth
And we'll get it on, and we known to buy a house
And buy the block it don't stop, with shoes and socks
Bet the top drop, and let the bumper unlock
But me I'm rolling foreign, never ever alone
Swanging left and right, with alarm cats knowing
Paints I be pouring, and you know I'm so wet
Getting me a ticket from the laws, you want to bet
They can't stand me, pulling off they say you dripping too much candy
Yes I can't stand it, I'm the drank and drip bandit
You can't handle it, bought the ice that sunk the Titanic
Don't panic, when you see me riding with Janet
On the escapade, riding a Escalade
Break these boys off with techs, my chest plate

Man, King Screw, dedicate this to you my nigga
We love you forever boy (straight up much love)
We ain't goin' never forget you mayn
Never forget the times we had (G love, know I'm saying)

I'll never forget, the times when we balled together
I'll never forget, the love, hugs, smiles and tears
And the strength to help me conquer my fears

[SPM]
I'll never forget, the day we met
I was on Gravestone, trying to find a address
You told me that your wife, had just lost your baby
I never met a man, so hate free
Lately, I've been drunk as fuck
I open up a cold beer, as soon as I wake up
I live in Screwston Texas, that's my home
Banging Screw since 9-2, ask my T. Jones
When Fat Pat died, we was all alone
That boy was the coldest, on the microphone
Screw took it harder, than anyone thought
It's hard to be apart, from someone close to your heart
South Park from the start, all of a sudden
The whole nation, all bout the Screw Shop on Cullen
November 16th, I sat and cried
Cause that was the day, that Houston Texas died

[Verse 2]
I'll never forget true love see, it's gon last forever
Keep my feet on solid ground, so we could ball together
Since a young one never done one, stay true to the heart
You kept my head above water, gave me spark from the start
You put the mic in my hand, plus put your trust in me
Dodging cases being a G, you got me out of the streets
Gave me the capital of Texas, so I could throw away the pyreeces
Put a queen on my shoulder, when nights were cold as misses
Hustling smiles appear the tears, the tears from younger years
Until they find us riders, make sure you standing here
S.U.C. for L-I-F-E, Screw blew one with the streets
Slowed down originator, keeping the trunk on beat
My faith in G-O-D, putting the world up under my feet
Making imitators duketators, bow down and can't compete
From a G to a G, this here's for you to me
Staying down putting it down, screaming Screw for eternity

[Chorus: x2]

[Verse 3]
Whoever knew he would create a new sound, never been heard
Transform a simple name, into a household word
He gained fame but never changed, never switched gears
When you met him it was like, you been knowing him twenty years
Was never fake, blessed to make the rap scene elevate
Genius, watch that boy slow it down and still accelerate
God gave him a gift, and my partna knew how to use it
But the love I got for Screw, ain't got nothing to do with music
Cause when he left, the physical was consumed
But his spirit manifesting, everybody in this room
A real partna forever, I know I can never be him
But if I make him my example, when you see me then you'll see him
S for slowing it down, see cold creating
are stands for realer than real, and never hating
E forever lasting, effect never corrupt
W for the world, cause that's what he screwed up

[Verse 4]
Man I'll never forget, the difference time can make
Man I'll never forget, coming down in the 8
Man I'll never forget, we drunk the pint straight
We been free styling, since them old grey tapes
And then came the day, that we was making them G's
Had them niggas lined up, like we was slanging them ki's
But we ain't slanging D, we just moving C.D.'s
People coming to the shop, way from over the seas
But still we some G's, or should I say that we back
Coming down in a Impala, with the candy wet
Coming down MLK, with the music that bump
We was swinging and banging, steady popping the trunk
Say what's up to that Gator, Mafio and that Pat
I know why y'all looking down from heaven, watching over our back
When they mention Screwed Up Click, they goin' say that we done it
Man them boys done blew up, like the flight 800

I'll never regret, the times we got blowed
On the road doing shows, all across the globe

Legendary status Screw, steady slowing it down
For H-Town for sure, we done lost a soldier
We goin' finish what you live, and I'ma put that on the Clover
It ain't over, pour and sipping the plain soda
Switching lanes over, in my black Range Rover
The Chemist that's right, I done shed some tears
All the car shows we wrecked, and bled for years
You one of my peers, DJ Screw you kept it real
You one of a kind, so you one out a mill
I'ma stay representing, South-side for live

If nobody else, could feel my pain
It was you in my corner, through the heat and the rain
Can't call one time, you didn't make me smile
Took a fall in the Penn, boy you fed my child
Kept my name on fire, like I never left
Kept your eyes on my family, and never slept
Snatched my ass out the streets, and put a mic in my hand
Put my strap on the shelf tray, my fiends for fans
I was hard head misled, seeking for bread
Without the music in my life, I know I would of been dead
But the Lord sent you to me, like a guardian angel
When my feet was caught up in a tangle
So please smile for me, cause Screw you got me throwed in this game
I salute you with my fist, your name was never in vein
See the plack on the wall, all our dreams came true
And I'm still giving thanks to you

Doch sitze erstmal im Transporter Richtung JVA
Komm nicht klar, denn mein letzter Überfall ist mir missglückt
Selbst der Gefängnisdirektor weiß, ich bin zurück
Ich geh gerade, nicht gebückt, scheiß auf die Staatsgewalt
Denn wo ich wohne macht man Bullen auf der Straße kalt
Warte, halt! Das hier ist kein Song für kleine Kinder
Graue Haare von dem Stress und vom Tabak gelbe Finger
Leute werden hier behindert, machen Selbstmord
Weil keiner sieh dran hindert, du lernst dort
Nur abgefuckte Killer, die 'ne Gang form'n kenn'
Und keinen, der dich weiterbringt
Beamte meine Feinde sind, ich bleib der King, die Scheiße stimmt
Weil ich nicht leise bin, komm ich in Einzelhaft
Das Leben hinter Gittern, Bruder, wird dir nicht leicht gemacht
24 Stunden Nacht, hier gibt es kein Sonnenlicht
Freunde sagen, dass sie dich besuchen, doch sie kommen nicht

Hoffnungslos, das ist das Leben hier im Knast
Ich weiß nicht, wie lang ich bleibe, trotzdem bet ich jede Nacht
Denn nur Gott ist groß und vergibt mir meine Sünden
Egal, was ich getan hab, ich hatte meine Gründe
Trockenes Brot ist meine Mahlzeit seit Tag Eins
Sie versuchen mich zu brechen, doch ich werde stark bleiben
Die Cops sind froh, und haben jetzt weniger Arbeit
Viel zu viele Zinker unterwegs, ich trau gar keinem

Al-Gear, Geldgier, sag mir, wer der Staatsfeind ist
Mal einen Strich an die Wand, wenn der Tag anbricht
Die Wahrheit ist: Du bist nicht hart, wenn du im Knast sitzt
Zweimal die Woche duschen gehst, der ganze Tag verkackt ist
Den Fakt ist, dein Leben zieht grad voll an dir vorbei
Doch du checkst es nicht, wieso? Jeder Tag ist für dich gleich
Du vertreibst dir deine Zeit nur mit Karten spielen, weil
Es Spaghetti zu gewinnen gibt oder irgend so ein Scheiß
Nicht mal den Wasserkocher teilst, glaub mir, ich kenne solche Typen
Doch halt es hier nicht länger aus, weil mich die Wände erdrücken
Denn dieser Gangster will flüchten aus einer Welt voller Hass
In meiner Gegend sagen kleine Kinder Geld wäre Macht
Ich häng ständig im Knast und kann die Wände nicht mehr sehen
Bitte Gott, gib mir Kraft, ich will die Wende miterleben
Viele werden psychisch krank und sind morgen nicht mehr da
Andere haben Pech und verlassen den Ort in einem Sarg

Al-Gear,"Wir können uns glücklich schätzen
Dass wir hier in Deutschland leben
Keine echte Armut kennen, Eltern einem alles geben
Denn hab' ich Hunger wird gegessen wie bei Asterix
Doch leider gibt's auch Länder wo es nicht mal warmes Wasser gibt
Nein, wo es anders ist, schwer zu erklären
Kleine Kinder ackern gehen um die Familien zu ernähren
Das sind Infos aus erster Hand, scheiß mal auf die Medien
Heimatland Algerien, verbrachte dort als kleiner Mann die Ferien
Und konnte sehen was es heißt Schwersarbeit zu leisten
Für ne' Hand voll ekligem Reiß, ich kämpf gegen die Zeit
Genau wie Ali ausm' Nachbardorf, dessen Traum es war zu Leben
Allerdings an nem' anderen Ort, 17 Jahre jung
Geprägt von Armut und Qual, keine Airmax an den Füßen
Nur durchlöcherte Sandalen, Bruder, das ist die dritte Welt
Hier führst du kein schönes Leben
Doch der Traum von Ali sollte bald in Erfüllung gehen

Er hatte einen Traum, man konnte es ihm ansehen
Verliere nicht deinen glauben, du musst diesen weg entlang gehen
Im Angesichts des Todes, bist du auf dich alleine gestellt
Das Ziel ist in Sicht, solange du an dein Glauben hältst

Zurück zu Ali und dem Jahr 2010, er war ein richtig guter Junge
Und ging Streit aus dem Weg, besuchte 5 mal am Tag zur rechten
Zeit die Moschee, denn nur Familie und Gebet sind das einzige was zählt
Er machte Tijara am liebsten wäre er Amok gelaufen
Mit Benzin Geld verdienen und an die Marokks verkaufen
Kilometer weit laufen bis hin zur Grenze des Königreichs
Gäbe es einen Fluchtplan, wäre es die Möglichkeit
Doch es könnte tödlich sein, merk dir eins, da hilft dir kein Höflichkeit
Entweder du rennst, oder sie sperren dich ein
Der Traum von Europa, Ali brauchte dafür starkes Glück
Viele Brüder schafften es nicht und kamen in einem Sarg zurück
Der Junge wusste was er brauche war Geld, und so sparte er fleißig
Bis 2011, das ist seine kranke Welt, er will nur der Armut entgehen
Ohne Mama tschüss zu sagen machte er sich auf den Weg

Er hatte einen Traum, man konnte es ihm ansehen
Verliere nicht deinen glauben, du musst diesen weg entlang gehen
Im Angesichts des Todes, bist du auf dich alleine gestellt
Das Ziel ist in Sicht, solange du an dein Glauben hältst

Jetzt stand er da und war ganz auf sich alleine gestellt
Sein Traum wurde wahr, allerdings in einer fremden Welt
Wenig Geld, er kannte keine Spanischen Wörter
Denn die Schulbildung wird in so nem' Staat nicht gefördert
Das war sein erstes Problem als er Europa betrat
Nach der Qual voll in Fahrt, fast über einen Tag
Auf einem Schlepper den man besser auf einem Schrottplatz
Deponiert, nicht als Transportmittel nutzt, für einen blinden Passagier
Doch jetzt war es schon passiert, er hat den ersten Schritt gemacht
Und konnte jetzt nicht mehr zurück, hier begann seine Schlacht
Also rief er einen Freund an, der aus dem selben Dorf war
Dieser lebte jetzt in Deutschland, und flüchtete im Feuer
Er sagte komm nach Düsseldorf, hier Lebt es sich gut
Du kriegst ein Zimmer im Asylheim und musst nichts dafür tun
Er gab ihm die Adresse, Ali schrieb alles auf
Er hatte kaum noch Geld, doch nam diese Risiken in kauf

Er hatte einen Traum, man konnte es ihm ansehen
Verliere nicht deinen glauben, du musst diesen weg entlang gehen
Im Angesichts des Todes, bist du auf dich alleine gestellt
Das Ziel ist in Sicht, solange du an dein Glauben hältst

Angekommen in Düsseldorf, Oberbilk, Endstation
Das Gegenteil von San Tropez, wo die meisten Gangster wohnen
Ali lernte schnell, du musst ein ganz harter Typ sein
Tagsüber mit Drogen dealen, pennen im Asylheim
Er hat angefangen zu trinken und hing nur in Discotheken
Ist vom Glauben abgekommen und hat aufgehört zu beten
Dieses Leben ist nicht immer fair, und manchmal auch nicht einfach
Trotzdem schickte er jeden Monat Geld in die Heimat
Irgendwann hatte Ali schon ne' ganze menge Geld gespart
Und kaufte einen Wagen für seinen Bruder, der älter war
In Algerien saß und keine Zeit zum träumen hatte
Er wollte ihm damit einfach nur ne' Freude machen
Er wurde Stadtgespräch, doch was dann geschah
War nicht abzusehen, denn am diesen Tag
Fuhren seine Eltern mit und zwei seiner Schwestern
Sein Bruder der am Lenkrad saß, starb als letzter",Karma,2014

Wie ich seh' nicht aus wie'n Jochen Schmitz?

Sie fragt, wo mein Mercedes ist, ich sag', dass ich die Umwelt schon'
Sie sagt, ich hab' den besten Flow und dass sie an der Ecke wohnt
Ich fragte, wo, sie sagte: „Da, über dem Wettbüro!“

Meine Taschen voll mit Stoff, denn ich hatte keinen Job
Machte Scheine, doch die Cops waren auf Streife jeden Tag
Auf der Jagd nach Gesocks, so wie ich einer war
Ich war nicht ohne, machte Kohle, doch war leider noch ein Kind

Manchmal kamen sie mich holen, doch sie waren keine Bedrohung
Denn ich bunker' keinen Stoff bei meiner Mama in der Wohnung
Und der Kommissar kommt nicht klar, wirft mich in den Bunker

Nie alleine, denn sie trauen sich nur als Gruppe auf die Straße

And even the palms seem to be swaying

And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

They will cease their fire this silent night in the name of peace and goodwill

I'm going to climb that mountain.

Lay streaming again.

Spend the day bein' lazy.
Just bein' natures friend.

Play somethin with lots of feeling.

The lawman and the cowboys stepped out of the dark
And it was two against the twenty and every bullet found its mark
And so goes the legend that out there in the night
The two still ride together somewhere beyond the borderline.

So they ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins
Heroes never turn or look back
They just ride through the sands of time on the borderline.

They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins
Heroes never turn or look back.

They ride to the desert wind, down a dusty trail, destiny begins
Heroes never turn or look back",The Borderline,1989

there's only one that remains

Searching for some kind of direction, 
Looking for a guiding light

You felt the sadness in me
You took the words that were so cold, 
And added a warm melody

Alabama,"I was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches
Papa used to tease me about it
'Cause deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could

My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hands, see
Education he never had
He did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made

For, life had kick him down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
One day Papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders
And in his tears he said

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Two days later Papa passed away, and
I became a man that day
So I told Mama I was gonna quit school, but
She said that was Daddy's strictest rule

So every mornin' 'fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed

He said, Patches
I'm dependin' on you, son
I tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest

Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of 13 I thought
I was carryin' the weight of the
Whole world on my shoulders
And you know, Mama knew
What I was goin' through, 'cause

Every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
You see, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my Mama pray
Lord, give him the strength to make another day

So years have passed and all the kids are grown
The angels took Mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice kept me through the years

Sing,
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you

Oh, I can still hear Papa's voice sayin'
Patches, I'm dependin' on you, son
I've tried to do my best

They were young and love was new
And every day the feeling grew
Between the two of them
When work grew scarce and times got bad
The hope would chase away the sad
And hope was sometimes all they had
Between the two of them

And the mortgage replaced the rent
They made the most of each day spent
Between the two of them
Their children all turned out just fine
So he retired in '69
And left with oh so little time
Between the two of them
Today I brave the graveyard rain
And placed a rose between their names
Now that's the most that ever came

And the pleasure of just growing up

Alabama,"I was walking home from school on a cold winter day
Took a shortcut through the woods and I lost my way
It was getting late and I was scared and alone
But then a kind old man took my hand and led me home

Mama couldn't see him, oh, but he was standing there
And I knew in my heart, he was the answer to my prayers

Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

When life held troubled times and had me down on my knees
There's always been someone, to come along and comfort me
A kind word from a stranger, to lend a helping hand
A phone call from a friend, just to say I understand

And ain't it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope

Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

They wear so many faces, show up in the strangest places
To grace us with their mercy, in our time of need

Oh, I believe there are angels among us
Sent down to us from somewhere up above
They come to you and me in our darkest hours
To show us how to live, to teach us how to give
To guide us with the light of love

To guide us with the light of love

And in the coral she imagines pearls
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China

take care of her for life and treat her right.

Over hills and meadows we'd stray
Just a boy and his dog, we were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old mill pond
When I would've drowned beyond doubt
But old Shep was right there, to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

As, the years passed and rolled, at last he grew old
And his eyesight was fast growing dim.
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can't do no more for him, Jim?

I went to his side and sat on the ground
And laid his old head on my knee
Well, he was the best friend that I ever had
I cried so I scarcely could see

Old Sheppie he knew, he was going to go
For he reached out and licked at my hand
He looked up at me, just as much as to say
We're parting but you understand

Now old Sheppie is gone where the good doggies go
And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven, there's one thing for sure
Old Shep has a wonderful home",Old Shep,2006

A man and wife had prayed for years for children

Were losing faith and close to giving up

Then a young girl with no way to keep her baby

Laid in their arms a tiny gift of love


It only takes one life to make a miracle

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

One honest prayer coming from the heart


A small coal mining town in West Virginia

Prayed as they kept vigil day and night

Saddened by the twelve who lives were taken

But also thankful one made it out alive


It only takes one life to make a miracle

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

One honest prayer coming from the heart


Two thousand years ago the world lay waiting

For the Savior they were told would come

Then on that winter night there in a manger

God blessed the world with his one and only son


It only takes one life to make a miracle

One tiny ray of hope to light up the dark

It only takes one life to make a miracle

Oh, John Dillon James was my good time country buddy

Well, we hunted, talked and fished his last days away

He was just a hired farm hand, worked old man Walker's land

Retired on his 68th birthday

Yeah, he wore a size sixteen shoe, had skin like alligator

Lord, he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods

Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain

And I recall that song by John Dillon James


One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole

But old Dillon wasn't toting his half pint of tin hide

His roll your own tobacco string was a-hanging from his pocket

His eyes were red as beets, looked like he cried

And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy

But my ten year old mind didn't understand

He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain

And I recall that song by John Dillon James


Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky

I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly

Paid the price down on my knees

A voice from heaven promised me

I got my ticket for the ride in the sky


Well, it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning

I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon, he didn't show

Daddy came down about noon, and said

Son, I've got some news

Lord's rested old Dillon's soul

Yeah, and I walked up to his bedside

Looked down at old big Dillon

Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings

That tables set but I felt good, for at last I understood

That refrain sung by John Dillon James


Well, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky, Lord, y'all

I've been talking to the man, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly)

A voice from heaven promised me

Yeah, I got my ticket for the ride in the sky

I used to play till evening shadows come
And then winding down that old familiar pathway
I heard my mother call at set of sun

""Come home, come home, it's suppertime
The shadow's lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's suppertime
We're going home at last""

Some of the fondest memories of my childhood
Are woven around suppertime
When Mama used to call out from the back steps
To the old home place, ""Come on home, son, it's suppertime""

Oh, how I'd love to hear those words once more
But you know for me, time is woven in the realization of the truth
That's even more thrilling
And that's when the call comes from the portals of glory
To come on home, it's suppertime

""Come home, come home, it's suppertime
The shadow's lengthen fast
Come home, come home, it's suppertime
We're going home at last, we're going home at last""

Change must come thru the barrel of a gun
Not thru talkin' and not through waitin'
And sittin' around just contemplatin' the facts
'Cos we know what they are
So let Mao Tse Tung be your guidin' star
Pick up a gun and learn how to fight
All thru the day and all thru the night
'Til come the day when the last fight's won
I want you to listen, son
'Cos Mao Tse Tung said change must come
Thru the barrel of a gun

Okay. What was the basic premise of Mao? Mao Tse Tung said there's only one way a revolution can come. Do you know, Millie? How did Mao Tse Tung say the only way you can bring a revolution and keep it?

Where you— onliest way I think you can keep it is by being at peace and being honorable.

Oh, shit, I ain't— no— “being at peace”? Mao Tse Tung said that? 

Oh—

No no no no—

Wait a minute— Oh—

—he's the head of China. He's the head of the Revolution of China. 

No, I'm sorry.

He marched 6000 people…on the Long March.

I had my mind on something else. 

Okay then, wha— wha— what'd he say? There only one way you can bring about a revolution for people. 

Only way you can— only way you can bring it on, that by— is by killing. 

Well, what— yes, that's okay, I'm going to let you pass it —but what'd he say? He had a nice little phrase that everybody should know. “Change only comes—”

Oh—

You got it. “Change comes through…”

“—through— by a barrel of gun.”

That's right, senior. And that's good. ‘Cos you by rights would have every reason to forget some things. “Change must come through the barrel of gun,” said Mao Tse Tung. This place would be a paradise tomorrow if every department had a supervisor with a submachine gun. 

Let them hear it in the night! Yes, we'll fight! Let the night roar, because they can hear us, they know we mean it. We'll kill them if they come!

Fooling around with her fears.
In the morning she mourns the decline of her mind
Drowning in a bottle of beer.

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
'This could be heaven or this could be hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, you can find it here

Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the captain,
'Please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling,
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers,
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before

Me acuerdo de los consejos de mis padres que olvide
Su bendición me dejaron que en mi mente guardo yo

Le destrozaron el rostro y lo cubrieron de piedras
Deseaban sus asesinos que no lo reconocieran

Porque le miro en el brazo tatuadas sus iníciales
Por unas deudas de juego, lo mataron sus rivales

El niño se fue del pueblo, la muerte quedo olvidada
Pasaron catorce años, un jinete regresaba
Se le reflejaba el diablo y la muerte en la mirada

Esta va pa toda la raza de santa María del oro
Durango y nos vamos asta torres
Pura raza malandrina mi compa

Se dirigió a la cantina y le dijo al cantinero
Quisiera que me llevaras hasta una mesa de juego
Pero yo quiero jugar con los más ricos del pueblo

A los hermanos Martínez, tahúr es a cual publuado
Les corrieron avisar, que un fuerano había llegado
Dijeron que lo pasaran, que al fin ya estaban jugando

Jugaron toda la noche y ya casi amaneciendo
Les dijo, Voy a cobrarles lo que me salen debiendo
Pensaron que era una broma, pues él estaba perdiendo

Yo fui testigo Señores, de aquella grande jugada
Por no pagarle a mi padre, lo mataron a la mala

Cada vez que veo tu labios me conquistan
Encienden mi motor
Que me has dado solo en sueños tus caricias
Te has vuelto una obsesion

Como demostrarte lo que siento
Si en tu mente no soy ni un recuerdo

why entunar a cada nota
De mi vida why de mi corazon
Why tu aroma se ha enpegnado cada dia
Creando una ilusion

Como demostrate lo que siento
Si en mi mente no soy ni un recuerdo

Mirame amor
Que muero por un beso tuyo
Mirame amor
Que ya no aguanto ni un segundo
Que mi cuerpo no este entre tus brazos
Why un te quiero salga de tus labios
Ven why mirame amor...

Et nous renie
Sourit de nos pauvres naufrages

Écoute mon âme lointaine
Comme il est fragile et précis

Ce chant qui vient des sirènes
Pour qu'elle ait peur, quelle folie !
L'homme ne sera jamais lui-meme
Qu'au bout du cœur de tragédie
Grand Dieu fallait-il que je t'aime
Dans cette vie ?

Désespéré, abasourdi, face à la mer
Devant les portes de la nuit
Mais elle garde ses mystères
Meme en ces soirs d'été
Meme pour ceux qui l'ont chantée

La mer est là qui me murmure
Ces mots d'amour et d'infini
La mer est là qui me rassure
Le miracle n'est pas fini
La mer reflète ton visage
Pour quelle étrange prophétie ?
Retrouverons-nous le rivage
Après la nuit ?

Bien sûr il y eut ces orages
De ses tempetes et de ses cris

Et nous renie
Elle nous gardera ses mystères

Il était déjà tard le vent gris du hasard
Soufflait sur notre automne
Mon amour mon improbable amour

Des espoirs qu'on se donne

Mais toi tu es venue messagère imprévue
De l'amour qui se nomme
Mon amour mon incroyable amour
Toi qui venais la nuit pour faire chanter la vie
Pour faire chanter mes jours mon amour


Mon amour mon improbable amour
Si nous venions tous deux par des chemins frileux
Pavés d'incertitudes
Mon amour mon improbable amour
Il nous reste à bâtir un monde un avenir
Peuplés de certitudes
Mon amour mon improbable amour
Si nous avons joué sur de rugueux claviers
De trop pauvres rengaines
Mon amour mon impensable amour

Et les plus beaux poèmes

Alain Bashung,"Que n'ai-je appris la luge
Que n'ai-je appris à skier
Sans me soucier du déluge
De la texture des glaciers
Que n'ai-je glissé
Que n'ai-je fondu
Sur ton balconnet

Que n'ai-je été torride
Que n'ai-je tombé la veste
Lâché du lest
Pris de l'altitude
Avant de piquer
Déchaîner les esprits
Parmi les êtres et les cèdres
Faire la tournée des grands ducs
La nuit de l’épiphanie
Et puis les autres nuits
Tendre l'arquebuse
Jusqu'à me rompre

Que n'ai-je pris l'Everest
Pour une aspérité
Sommé l'amour et le reste
De s'entrelacer à jamais
Que n'ai-je visé
Que n'ai-je été stupide
Au point de succomber

Des chimères en chair et en os

À bâtons rompus

I would be, caught in the undertow

Comme une star de ciné 
Accoudée au juke-box 
Elle rêvait qu'elle posait 
Juste pour un bout d'essai 
À la Century Fox

Elle semblait bien dans sa peau 
Ses yeux couleur menthe à l'eau 
Cherchaient du regard un spot 
Le dieu projecteur

Et moi je n'en pouvais plus 
Bien sûr elle ne m'a pas vu 
Perdue dans sa mégalo 
Moi j'étais de trop

Elle marchait comme un chat 
Qui méprise sa proie 
Où frôlant le flipper 
La chanson qui couvrait 
Tous les mots qu'elle mimait 
Semblait briser son coeur

Elle en faisait un peu trop 
La fille aux yeux menthe à l'eau 
Hollywood est dans sa tête 
Tout' seule elle répète

Son entrée dans un studio 
Le décor couleur menthe à l'eau 
Perdue dans sa mégalo 
Moi je suis de trop

Mais un type est entré 
Et le charme est tombé 
Arrêtant le flipper 
Ses yeux noirs ont lancé 
De l'agressivité 
Sur le pauvre juke-box

La fille aux yeux menthe à l'eau 
A rangé sa mégalo 
Et s'est soumise aux yeux noirs

Où seuls de vieux, de très vieux singes sont assis
Aux commandes de nos libertés
Aux manettes de nos intégrités

Ça les fait toujours rigoler
Allez, tapons-nous, entre nous

D'une envie de vivre, d'une envie

De parcourir le monde
Cette bonne terre si gironde
Mais non, mais non, voilà qu'on nous gronde!
Cas sans laisser-passer

Faut pas se laisser aller
A rêver d'une autre vie, mon ami,
Non, faut pas rêver
Car pour rêver, faut des «laisser-passer»

Du papier, pour passer sa vie

Des gnous, des girafes, des orangs-outangs
Dans nos réserves sous surveillance

Et qu'on n'aille pas s'égarer
En troupeau ou bien tout seul, isolé
Dans les réserves d'à côté
On est sûr de tomber sur un os

Un ostéopathe de première
Qui vous démembrera, c'est son affaire
De vous faire passer l'envie

un amour qui s'éteint

Alain Debray Y Su Orquesta,"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""
Then we suddenly know what heaven we're in
When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine

When they begin the, begin the, begin the beguine
When they begin the beguine",Begin the Beguine,1975

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

Alain Debray Y Su Orquesta,"And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1975
Alain Debray Y Su Orquesta,"Yo adivino el parpadeo
De las luces que a lo lejos
Van marcando mi retorno

Son las mismas que alumbraron
Con sus palidos reflejos
Hondas horas de dolor

Y aunque no quise el regreso
Siempre se vuelve
Al primer amor

La vieja calle
Donde me cobijo
Tuya es su vida
Tuyo es su querer

Bajo el burlon
Mirar de las estrellas
Que con indiferencia
Hoy me ven volver

Volver
Con la frente marchita
Las nieves del tiempo
Platearon mi sien

Sentir
Que es un soplo la vida
Que veinte anos no es nada
Que febril la mirada
Errante en las sombras
Te busca y te nombra

Vivir
Con el alma aferrada
A un dulce recuerdo
Que lloro otra vez

Tengo miedo del encuentro
Con el pasado que vuelve
A enfrentarse con mi vida

Tengo miedo de las noches
Que pobladas de recuerdos
Encadenen mi sonar

Pero el viajero que huye
Tarde o temprano
Detiene su andar

Y aunque el olvido
Que todo destruye
Haya matado mi vieja ilusion

Guardo escondida
Una esperanza humilde
Que es toda la fortuna
De mi corazon

Extérieur nuit, zoom sur la Jaguar
Comme au cinéma
Mise au point sur moi

On a raconté plein d'histoires
Entre le jeune loup et le guépard
C'était souvent assez banal
Mais ça suffit pour faire du mal
Y'a des gros plans, des images floues
La vérité, c'est juste en dessous
Qu'est-c'qu'on peut dire d'un homme comme moi ?
On dit c'qu'on veut, moi, j'chang'rai pas...

Quelques mots
Qui pourraient changer le scénario
Comme au cinéma
Mise au point sur moi

Plan serré, musique d'ambiance
Quelquefois, on se trompe de séquence
Ni passé simple, ni passé compliqué,
J'conjugue ma vie à l'imparfait

Sous les projecteurs
Manque de chaleur
C'est tant pis pour les acteurs

Mais quand j'suis tout seul devant l'miroir,
Derrière les mots, derrière l'image, y'a plus de star
Et tout c'qui s'passe à l'intérieur
Ça s'appelle aussi la pudeur
Le meilleur rôle d'un homme public
C'est de n'jamais ressembler à ses critiques.
Moi j'suis comme tout l'monde, j'suis pas très sûr
Mais j'ai des rêves pour le futur

Plus de projecteurs
Tout en couleur
Pour faire rêver les menteurs

Plus de projecteurs
Coupez moteurs
C'est trop dangereux pour le coeur

J'voudrais simplement qu'un jour
Tu r'viennes enfin me parler d'amour
Les caméras rest'raient à leur place
Et entre nous, on briserait la glace
Car si je t'aime
Du fond de ma nuit américaine
C'est plus du cinéma
Mise au point sur toi

Alors pour toi, pour moi, on laiss'rait tomber la comédie
Et on s'écrirait un roman pour toute la vie
Allez viens, ferme les yeux
Et sur l'écran de mes paupières closes
Alors certain'ment, toi, tu verras quelque chose

C'est plus du cinéma

Mise au point sur toi",Comme au Cinema,2000

De tu bella Córdoba hasta Madrid
Para demostrar lo que había en ti

Cuando tú llegaste la luz del sol
Con tu valentía se confundió
Y te vi reír loco de emoción

Pero allí nadie pudo ver él
Por qué reías así
Y una voz muy dentro de ti
Te gritó, ""tú puedes vencer""

Entre sol y sombra luchabas tú
Con la claridad de tu juventud
Te sobraba ardor, te sobraba luz

Ni un momento el miedo te dominó
Y la muerte cerca de ti pasó
Porque como tú nadie se acercó

Pero al fin todo el mundo vio
El porqué reías así

Hasta que te llamaron

Tirer sur l'pianiste c'est pas not' boulot
Nous on tire sur le piano

Alain Goraguer et son Orchestre,"Un, deux, trois, quart, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix, onze, douze
Quand t'auras douze belles dans la peau, deux duchesses et dix dactylos
Qu'est ce que t'auras de plus sinon, sinon qu'un peu de plombs?
Un peu de plombs dans l'aile, pas plus dans la cervelle

Quand t'auras claqué ton grisbi
Dans toutes les boîtes à coup de fusil
Tu ne seras jamais qu'un pigeon avec un peu de plombs
Un peu de plomb dans l'aile, pas plus dans la cervelle

Quand dans le feu de la passion, aux échelles des bas nylons
Tu grimperas, tu grimperas après qu'est ce que t'auras?
T'auras du plomb dans l'aile, pas plus dans la cervelle

Quand t'auras aimé à tout vent, et que tes poules n'auront plus de dents
Pour te bouffer l'coeur dans la main, hé ben mon gros malin
T'auras du plomb dans l'aile, pas plus dans la cervelle

Et quand t'auras passé ta vie, derrière les barreaux de ton lit
Tu diras que tu t'en ais payé et oui et puis après?
T'auras du plomb dans l'aile, pas plus dans la cervelle

Mais p't être bien qu'tu ne feras pas de vieux os
Avec tes douze belles dans la peau
Tu tomberas un jour sur un gars, un gars qui t'enverra
Du plomb dans la cervelle et il t'poussera des ailes",Douze Belles Dans la Peau,1958
Alain Goraguer et son Orchestre,"La femme des uns
Sous l'corps des autres
A de soupirs
De volupté
On s'en fout quand
C'est pas la nôtre

Et puis on s'dit tout

Et qu'est-ce qu'on y voit?

Et on commence
À s'inquiéter
On se dit qu'si
C'était la nôtre
Là qui se vautre
On lui f'rait passer
L'goût d'recommencer
Et pour changer d'air
On l'enverrait fair'
Un tour là-haut

Alors on irait
On irait voir

Et quand elle é-

C'est moi, bon alors tais-toi
Y'a du whisky dans la boîte à gants
Et des Américaines, t'as qu'à taper dedans

Écoute, écoute un peu ça poupée
T'entends ? Mon air préféré
Mets-moi la radio un peu plus fort

Et dans ce bouquin y a écrit
Que des gars se la coulent douce à Miami
Pendant ce temps que je fais le zouave
Au fond de la cave
Paraît que y a pas de sot métier
Moi je fais des trous dans des billets

Je fais des trous, des petits trous, encore des petits trous

Je vis au cœur de la planète
J'ai dans la tête
Un carnaval de confettis
J'en amène jusque dans mon lit
Et sous mon ciel de faïence
Je ne vois briller que les correspondances
Parfois je rêve je divague
Je vois des vagues
Et dans la brume au bout du quai
Je vois un bateau qui vient me chercher

Pour me sortir de ce trou où je fais des trous
Des petits trous, des petits trous, toujours des petits trous
Mais le bateau se taille
Et je vois que je déraille
Et je reste dans mon trou à faire des petits trous
Des petits trous, des petits trous, toujours des petits trous

J'en ai marre j'en ai ma claque
De ce cloaque
Je voudrais jouer la fille de l'air
Laisser ma casquette au vestiaire
Un jour viendra j'en suis sûr
Où je pourrais m'évader dans la nature
Je partirai sur la grande route
Et coûte que coûte
Et si pour moi il n'est plus temps
Je partirai les pieds devant

Je fais des trous, des petits trous, encore des petits trous
Des petits trous, des petits trous, toujours des petits trous

Y a de quoi devenir dingue
De quoi prendre un flingue
Se faire un trou, un petit trou, un dernier petit trou
Un petit trou, un petit trou, un dernier petit trou
Et on me mettra dans un grand trou
Où je n'entendrai plus parler de trou plus jamais de trou
De petits trous de petits trous de petits trous",Le Poinçonneur des Lilas,1958
Alain Goraguer et son Orchestre,"Dans un boudoir introduisez un coeur bien tendre
Sur canapé laissez s'asseoir et se détendre
Versez une larme de porto
Et puis mettez-vous au piano
Jouez Chopin
Avec dédain
Égrenez vos accords
Et s'il s'endort
Alors là, jetez-le dehors

Le second soir faites revenir ce coeur bien tendre
Faites mijoter trois bons quarts d'heure à vous attendre
Et s'il n'est pas encore parti
Soyez-en sûr c'est qu'il est cuit
Sans vous trahir
Laissez frémir
Faites attendre encore
Et s'il s'endort
Alors là, jétez-le dehors

Le lendemain il ne tient qu'à vous d'être tendre
Tamisez toutes les lumières et sans attendre
Jouez la farce du grand amour
Dites ""jamais"", dites ""toujours""
Et consommez
Sur canapé
Mais après les transports
Ah! s'il s'endort
Alors là, foutez-le dehors",La Recette de l'Amour Fou,1958
Alain Goraguer et son Orchestre,"Que j'aime voir chère indolente,
De ton corps si beau,
Comme une étoffe vacillante,
Miroiter la peau!

Sur ta chevelure profonde
Aux âcres parfums,
Mer odorante et vagabonde
Aux flots bleus et bruns,

Comme un navire qui s'éveille
Au vent du matin,
Mon âme rêveuse appareille
Pour un ciel lointain

Tes yeux où rien ne se révèle
De doux ni d'amer,
Sont deux bijoux froids où se mêlent
L'or avec le fer

À te voir marcher en cadence
Belle d'abandon
On dirait un serpent qui danse
Au bout d'un bâton

Sous le fardeau de ta paresse
Ta tête d'enfant
Se balance avec la mollesse
D'un jeune éléphant

Et ton corps se penche et s'allonge
Comme un fin vaisseau
Qui roule bord sur bord et plonge
Ces vergues dans l'eau

Comme un flot grossi par la fonte
Des glaciers grondants
Quand l'eau de ta bouche remonte
Au bord de tes dents

Je crois boire un vin de Bohème,
Amer et vainqueur
Un ciel liquide qui parsème
D'étoiles mon cœur!",Baudelaire,1962

De faire le vide autour de moi
J'en apprécie le tabac

Et de courtisanes

Que ce ne sont pas mes beaux yeux

Sans attendre que tout se consume
Elles disparaissent dans la brume
