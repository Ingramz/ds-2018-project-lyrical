Jerry Lee Lewis,"Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like a ball. 
Good Golly Miss Molly, sure like a ball.
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call.

From the early, early morning till the early, early night
You can see Miss Molly rocking at the house of blue lights.
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball.
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call.

Well, now momma, poppa told me: ""Son, you better watch your step.
""If I knew my momma, poppa, have to watch my dad myself.
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball.
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call.

I am going to the corner, gonna buy a diamond ring.
Would you pardon me if it's a nineteen carat golden thing.
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball.
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call.

Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball. 
Good golly, Miss Molly, sure like a ball. 
When you're rocking and a rolling can't hear your momma call",Good Golly Miss Molly,1974
Jerry Lee Lewis,"Hello Josephine.  How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler ""Woo woo woo""

I used to walk you home
I used to hold your hand
You used to use my umbrella ev'ry time it rained
You used to cry so much it was a crying shame


Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo""

You used to live over yonder by the railroad track.
When it rained you couldn't walk I used to tote you on my back
Now you gotta make believe it was a thrill at that.

Hello Josephine. How do you do?
Do you remember me baby like I remember you?
You used to laugh at me and holler 'Woo woo woo""

Jerry Lee Lewis,"Who's the lovin' daddy with the beautiful eyes
What a pair o' lips, I'd like to try 'em for size
I'll just tell him, ""Baby, won't you swing it with me""
Hope he tells me maybe, what a wing it will be
So, I said politely ""Darlin' may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waitin' when I'm in the mood""
First I held him lightly and we started to dance
Then I held him tightly what a dreamy romance
And I said ""Hey, baby, it's a quarter to three
There's a mess of moonlight, won't-cha share it with me""
""Well"" he answered ""Baby, don't-cha know that it's rude
To keep my two lips waitin' when they're in the mood""
In the mood, that's what he told me
In the mood, and when he told me
In the mood, my heart was skippin'
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""
In the mood for all his kissin'
In the mood his crazy lovin'
In the mood what I was missin'
It didn't take me long to say ""I'm in the mood now""

So, I said politely ""Darlin' may I intrude""
He said ""Don't keep me waitin' when I'm in the mood""

Jerry Lee Lewis,"The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The joint was jumpin' and the band began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

[Chorus]
Let's rock, everybody, let's rock
Everybody on the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock

Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang

[Chorus]

Number forty-seven said to number three
""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""

[Chorus]

The sad sack was a sittin' on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weepin' all alone
The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square
If you can't find a partner use a wooden chair""

[Chorus]

Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake
No one's lookin', now's our chance to make a break""
Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix
I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks""

[Chorus]",Jailhouse Rock,1974

Jerry Lee Lewis,"I got a woman,
Mean as she can be
I got a woman,

A black cat up and died of fright
'Cause she crossed his path last night

She kiss so hard, she bruise my lips
Hurts so good, my heart just flips

The strangest gal I ever had
Never happy 'less she's mad

Don't look for the grey in his hair

That just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy
Trying to prove he still can

He's gotta a woman that he's loved for a long long time at home
Ah but the thrill is all gone
When they cut down the lights

They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb
But now the profits are high

But today he's forty years old going on twenty

Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.

All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.

All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.

Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.

She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.

In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.

When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.",Great Speckled Bird,1989

And they always laid the blame on Reuben James

The faded shirt the wrinkled brow the calloused hand upon the plow
I loved you then and I love you now Reuben James
Hey Flora Gray well the gossip of Madison County died with the child
And although your skin was black you were the one who didn't turn your back
On a hungry white child with no name Reuben James
Hey Reuben James with your mind on my soul and Bible in your right hand
You said turn the other cheek there's a better world waitin' for the meek
In my head those words remain from Reuben James

But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go go Johnny go go Johnny be Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
He sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passin' by they would stop and say
Oh my how that little country boy can play
Go go go Johnny go go...

And you will be the leader of a big old band

And the raindrops tumble all around,
Heaven opens a magic lane.
When all the clouds darken up the skyway,
There's a rainbow highway to be found,
Leading from your windowpane.
To a place behind the sun,
Just a step beyond the rain.

Somewhere over the rainbow way up high,
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby,
Somewhere over the rainbow skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me,
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,
Away, above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me.

Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I ?

The great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
The cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
A broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
Lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
Lights that offer other girls for empty arms like mine
They paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
But it's just a mask of loneliness behind those city lights

The world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night
Did the God who put those stars above make those city lights
Did he make a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
Are we just supposed to run and hide behind those city lights
Lights that say forget her love in a different athmosphere
Lights that lure are nothing but a masquarade for tears
They paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
And I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights",City Lights,1994

Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
Ye'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an AvÃ¯ there for me.

And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy [Mono Version],1994

Oh Lord, I want to go home.

Took us all the way to New Orleans

Blowing low
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time
Bobby clapping hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

To the California sun

He was standing right beside me
Through everything I done
Every night he kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas
I let him slip away
Looking for the home I hope he'll find
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding Bobby's body close to mine

Into each life a love is born for one
And one alone dear
The love I chose was surely not for me
For your poison love has stained the life blood
In my heart and soul dear
And I know our love was never meant to be.

But still my heart cries out for you
And you alone my darling
It makes me never ever let you go
But my pleading has all been in vain
For your and you alone dear
And my better judgement tells me to say no.",Poison Love,1995

Can't keep his mind on nothing else

If he put her down

Trying to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort
Sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be

Well, this man loves a woman
I gave you everything I had
Trying to hold on to your precious love

In a building called sheer croppers shack

By a mama who was black

To me she was my mama
Though blood didn't do this

I never had a dad to call my own
But as long lord as I can remember

I'm sure that most folks it looked different
When they saw me upon her old knee
For as I grew up and we traveled around
When they saw black mama and me

To me she's still my mama
I know blood I could never do that
But I had love that was more than sufficient

I received a message of sadness
I ran to her side right away
But before I could speak with her 
Black mama passed away

Today for me neighbors is a sad one
As I stand with my tears running free
Her life here on earth is over

Say I'm easy to come easy to go and easy to love when I stay

This old highway she's hotter than nine kinds of hell
The rides they're as scare as the rain
When you're down to your last shop with nothing to sell
And too far away from the trains
It'd been the good month of Sundays and a guitar to go
Had a tall drink of yesterday's wine
Left the long string of friends some sheets in the wind
And some satisfied women behind
So won't you ride me down easy...

Put a snow on the mountain raised hell on the hill lot horns of the devil himself
Where the rodeo bum a son of a gun and a hobo with stars in his crown
So won't you ride me down easy...

means more than the world to me.

I could wait right here forever if they'd only let me stay
Anywhere would be much better than that old lonely room of mine
And a sleepless night a waitin' for another place, another time

Won't that room of mine be a lonely place to be
After I've been holding you so close to me

When he came walking in
The lies that showed more than his age
He was drunk, worn and thin

He sat down behind the ol' piano
And he ran through a couple of notes
And he said, ""Would somebody buy me a drink, boys
To kinda help me clear my throat?""

And he said, ""What would you give to hear a song?
What prize do memories bring?
It ain't every day you get
To hear living legend sing""

I may forget a line or two
A few words now and then
It takes a drink to make me think
And live it all again

This gray you see don't bother Jerry Lee
And neither do these lines
I may have seen some better days, boys
But God knows, I ain't reached my prime

I've got some scars from a woman's war
And playing those one-night stands
Lord only knows, if I had the time
I'd do it all again

Yes, I could still make 'em dance
Like I did in times that's gone
And I can still make 'em cry
And I can touch 'em with a song

I can still yet turn 'em on

I saw a Cadillac sign
Sayin' ""No Money Down""
So I eased on my brakes
And I pulled in the drive
Gunned my motor twice
Then I walked inside
Dealer came to me
Said ""Trade in you Ford
And I'll put you in a car
That'll eat up the road
Just tell me what you want
And then sign on that line
And I'll have it brought down to you
In a hour's time""

I'm gonna get me a car
And I'll be headed on down the road
Then I won't have to worry
About that broken - down, raggedy Ford

""Well Mister I want a yellow convertible
Four - door de Ville
With a Continental spare
And a wide chrome wheel
I want power steering
And power brakes
I want a powerful motor
With a jet off - take
I want air condition
I want automatic heat
And I want a full Murphy bed
In my back seat
I want short - wave radio
I want TV and a phone
You know I gotta talk to my baby
When I'm ridin' alone""

Yes I'm gonna get that car
And I'm gonna head on down the road
Yeah, then I won't have to worry
About that broken - down, raggedy Ford

""I want four carburetors
And two straight exhausts
I'm burnin' aviation fuel
No matter what the cost
I want railroad air horns
And a military spark
And I want a five - year guarantee
On everything I got
I want ten - dollar deductible
I want twenty dollar notes
I want thirty thousand liability""

and rolled in into Raleigh and all across Carolina

Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill

Rollin' out of Georgia state

We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,
Half way 'cross Alabam
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded
In downtown Birmingham

Right away, I bought me a through train ticket
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans

Just help me get to Houston town

Put luggage in my hands,
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple

I know it was her pink Cadillac

Oozing down the street
Waving to the girls
Feeling out of sight
Spending all my money
On a Saturday night
Honey I just wonder what it feels like in the back
Of your pink Cadillac
Now some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say it's too old
And that it goes too fast
But my love is bigger than a Honda
It's bigger than a Subaru

Where lived a country boy named Johnny be Goode
Who never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like a ringin' a bell
Go go go Johnny go go go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go go Johnny go go Johnny be Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
He sit beneath the tree by the railroad track
The engineer would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passin' by they would stop and say
Oh my how that little country boy can play
Go go go Johnny go go...

And you will be the leader of a big old band

To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights sayin' Johnny be Goode tonight

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream,
Really do come true.

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.

With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast  
Wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled through my closet through  
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
Than I washed my face and combed my hair and 
Stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before  
On cigarettes and songs that I'd been picking
But I lit my first and watched 
A small kid playing with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street  
And caught the Sunday smell of someone frying chicken
And Lord it took me back to something  
That I lost  somehow somewhere along the way

[Chorus]
On the Sunday morning sidewalk 
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
'Cause there's something in a Sunday 
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dieing 
Half as lonesome as the sound
Of the sleeping city sidewalk 
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a Daddy  
With a laughing little girl that he was swinging
And I stopped beside a Sunday school  
And listened to the songs they were singing
Then I headed back for home  
Somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed through the canyons  
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

But he's got the dirtiest job in town

How'd he keep from gettin' the blues

Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.

Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way
He said I like it with a big wide grin
Kept on a poppin' and he said again

Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.

Jerry Lewis,"You can trace the mystery of ancient history 
Through art of artists and their models 
You can comb through the Rome coliseum 
And the rear of your nearest museum 
There's the Mona Lisa, the Tower of Pisa 
A cowhand's daughter out in Texas 
And there's modern art to see 
That makes you wonder 
What the heck is meant to be 
On the streets of Murmark there's a fancy kind of art that is strictly for the 
tourists from the sticks 
And those wise Greenwich guys really open up your eyes painting portraits of 
their pretty little chicks 
So to each creator and imitator who daubs and dabbles with the brushes 
To the guys that draw their bunnies or the Sunday morning funnies 
And brighten up the world today 
And to every girl that poses to every Grandma Moses 
We like to tip the old beret",Artists and Models,1998

Oh baby oh baby obey me 
Facts are facts and I'm mad about your caress 
So relax there's only one word for yes 
My love just lives for you why be lonely 
I want you for my one and only

Jerry McPherson,"Every life, every beating heart
Has a searching soul inside
Ever needing, ever seeking out
The meaning to life

I refuse to believe that we're only here to live and die
In the futile days of a faithless haze
Never asking why, why would I
When I've felt the hand of eternity
It's a legacy I will leave, I want to leave

For the chilrden of the world
Every single little boy and girl
Heaven plants a special seed
And we must have faith for these

I will stand for the truth I've seen
So the truth is seen in me
I will give from the source of love
So all that I believe is handed down
For the road that's yet to be travelled on
By the ones who will carry on, I'll carry on

[Chorus]
For the chilrden of the world
Every single little boy and girl
Heaven plants a special seed
And we must have faith for these

Like the father may we see
That they have a destiny
And give them the light of love to lead

Through the darkness around us now
To a place where hope is found

Jerry McPherson,"Before the threads of time began
Was pre-ordained a mighty plan
That I should walk with Him alone
The cords of trust unbroken


But fate foresaw my wandering eye
That none could yet restrain
To violate the friendship I
Would cause Him so much pain


Chorus:
And everytime I close my eyes
I see the nails, I hear the cries
He did not keep Himself away
He was no stranger to my pain
He walked a mile in my shoes
He walked a mile


Feet so dusty cracked with heat
But carried on by love's heartbeat
A man of sorrows filled with grief
Forgiveness was His anthem


No feeble blow from tongue or pen
Could ever sway my love for Him
Across the echoed hills He trod
And reached into my world.

Jerry McPherson,"So many preachers 
So many churches and denominations 
Got their opinions and their documents

There's a miscommunication

And convolute the story 
But as far as I recall I do believe it all

[Chorus]
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world Rising from the dead 
Doing what He said He would do 
Loving everyone He saw
When it's said and done it all
Comes down to a man dying on a cross 
Saving the world

It isn't a secret  And maybe I'm being simple minded 
But it's about Jesus and a way, a truth, a life 
That can change a heart and a soul forever 
And we need to be reminded

It's the power of the blood 
That brings us to redemption 
We can rise above the fall 
And the reason for it all

Are just reaching 
For the truth that can save a helpless soul 
We wrestle with the mystery in the teaching 
But the news is all good I think that we should

There were questions but my heart knew all the answers

We live in tents and cabins 
In houses just for one 
And we all live together 
On a planet of the sun 

We are all earthlings 
We are all earthlings 
Spinning around together 
On a planet of the sun 

Floating down a river 
Swinging through the trees 
Climbing up a mountain 
Going with the breeze 
All of us can have a happy healthy place to be 
If we can float and swim and climb in earthling harmony 

We are all earthlings 
We are all earthlings 
Spinning around together

Jerry Nelson,"In old Transylvania when I was a lad
Our castle was poor but we never were sad
We learned to be happy
We'd dance round the hall
And learning to count was the key to it all
By counting each count I knew just where to start
And one special step has stayed close to my heart

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
One two three count
Batty batty bat batty bat batty bat batty bat
won't you dance with me doing the batty bat

So now in my own castle I can enjoy
This wonderful dance that I learned as a boy
I see just how wise was my whole family
They taught me to count and so now look at me
I'm counting and dancing and I swear that it's true
If you do the same you will be happy too

One two three, spread out the cape
One two three, twirl round the floor
One two three, left foot you swing
One two three, then start to sing
One two three, loud as you please
One two three, counting with ease
One two three, doing the batty bat

In inches, in miles, in laughter, in strife

How about love? How about love?
How about love? Measure in love

In bridges he burned or the way that she died

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow

I'll be right there, I've got my fair
When I see that rusty haired conductor man
I'll grab him by the collar and I'll holler ""Alabam'! Alabam'!""

That's where you stop your train, that brings me back again 
Down home where I'll remain, where my honey lamb am 
I will be right there with bells, when that old conductor yells
""All aboard! All aboard! All aboard for Alabam!""",There's No Business Like Show Business,1994

Jerry Orbach,"There's something sweet and almost kind
But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined
And now he's dear and so I'm sure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

She glanced this way, I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No, it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be
True, that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Well, who'd have thought?
Well, bless my soul
Well, who'd have known?
Well, who indeed?

And who'd have guessed They'd come together on their own?
It's so peculiar
We'll wait and see

A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before

You know perhaps there is something there that wasn't there before
There may be something there that wasn't there before",Something There [From Beauty and the Beast],1995
Jerry Orbach,"I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
""Good night, sleep well,""
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together",There's a Small Hotel,1999
Jerry Orbach,"Ollie told me I'm a fool. 
So I walked on down the road a mile, 
Went to the house that brings a smile
Sat upon my grandpa's knee 
And what do you think he said to me?

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie showed me the fork in the road
You can take to the left or go straight to the right
Use your days and save your nights,
Be careful where you step, and watch wha-cha eat
Sleep with the light on and you got it beat

When you awake you will remember ev'rything 
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Ollie warned me it's a mean old world
The street don't greet ya, yes, it's true
But what am I supposed to do
Read the writing on the wall
I heard it when I was very small

When you awake you will remember ev'rything
You will be hangin' on a string from your
When you believe 
You will relieve the only soul
That you were born with to grow old and never know

Wash my hand in lye water
I got a date with the captains daughter 
You can go and tell your brother
We sure gonna love one another, oh! 
You may be right and ya might be wrong 
I ain't gonna worry all day long

Snow's gonna come and the frost gonna bite
My old car froze up last night 
Ain't no reason to hang your head 
I could wake up in the mornin' dead
Oh! And if I thought it would do any good
I'd stand on the rock where Moses stood",Lazy Afternoon [From the Golden Apple],2000
Jerry Orbach,"Oh, the shark, babe, has such teeth, dear
And it shows them pearly white
Just a jackknife has old MacHeath, babe
And he keeps it, ah, out of sight
Ya know when that shark bites with his teeth, babe
Scarlet billows start to spread
Fancy gloves, oh, wears old MacHeath, babe
So there’s never, never a trace of red

Now on the sidewalk, huh, huh, whoo sunny morning, un huh
Lies a body just oozin' life, eek
And someone’s sneakin' ‘round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife?

There's a tugboat, huh, huh, down by the river dontcha know
Where a cement bag’s just a'drooppin' on down
Oh, that cement is just, it's there for the weight, dear
Five'll get ya ten old Macky’s back in town
Now d'ja hear ‘bout Louie Miller? He disappeared, babe
After drawin' out all his hard-earned cash
And now MacHeath spends just like a sailor
Could it be our boy's done somethin' rash?

Now Jenny Diver, ho, ho, yeah, Sukey Tawdry
Ooh, Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Oh, the line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky’s back in town

I said Jenny Diver, whoa, Sukey Tawdry
Look out to Miss Lotte Lenya and old Lucy Brown
Yes, that line forms on the right, babe
Now that Macky’s back in town
Look out, old Macky's back!!","Mack the Knife [From ""The Three Penny Opera""]",2000
Jerry Orbach,"Ah human again
Human again
Yes, think of what that means

I'll be cooking again
Be good-looking again
With a mademoiselle on each arm
When I'm human again
Only human again
Poised and polished and gleaming with charm
I'll be courting again
Chic and sporting again

Which should cause severance husbands alarm

I'll hop down off the shelf
And toute suite be myself
I can't wait to be human again

When we're human again
Only human again
When we're knickknacks and what not no more

When we're human again, good and human again
O, cherie, won't it all be top drawer?
I'll wear lipstick and rouge
And I won't be so huge
Why, I'll easily fit through that door
I'll exude savoir faire
I'll wear gowns, I'll have hair
It's my prayer to be human again

When we're human again, only human again
When the world once more starts making sense
I'll unwind, for a change
Really that'd be strange
Can I help it if I'm tense
In a shack by the sea, I'll sit back, sipping tea
Let my early retirement commence
Far from fools made of wax, I'll get down to brass tacks and relax
When I'm human again

So sweep the dust from the floor
Let's let some light in the room
I can feel, I can tell someone might break the spell any day now

Shine up the brass on the door
Alert the dust pail and broom
If it all goes as planned our time may be at hand any day now

Open the shutters and let in some air
Put these here and put those over there
Sweep up the years, the sadness and tears and throw them away

We'll be human again, only human again
When the girl finally sets us all free
Cheeks a-blooming again, we're assuming again
We'll resume our long-lost joie de vivre
We'll be playing again, holidaying again
And we're praying it's ASAP
We will push, we will shove
They will both fall in love
And we'll finally be human again

We'll be dancing again
We'll be twirling again
We'll be whirling around with such ease
When we're human again
Only human again
We'll go waltzing those old one-two-threes
We'll be floating again!
We'll be gliding again!
Stepping, striding as fine as you please
Like a real human does
I'll be all that I was
On that glorious morn
When we're finally reborn
And we're all of us human again",Human Again,2001
