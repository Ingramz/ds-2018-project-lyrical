Manfred Mann,"On our block all of the guys call her flamingo
'Cause her hair glows like the sun
And her eyes can light the skies
When she moves she walks so fine like a flamingo
Crimson dress that clings so tight
She's out of reach and out of sight
When she walks by, she brightens up the neighborhood
Oh, every guy would make her his if he just could
If she just would

Some sweet day, I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

Pretty flamingo
Pretty flamingo
When she walks by she brightens up the neighborhood
Oh, every guy would make her his if he just could, ha
If she just would

Some sweet day, I'll make her mine, pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me
'Cause paradise is where I'll be

Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, pretty flamingo
Some day, I'll make her mine (sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, pretty flamingo)
Yes I will, yes I will, I'll make her mine (sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, pretty flamingo)",Pretty Flamingo,
Manfred Mann,"You went away and left me long time ago
And now you're knockin' on my door
 
I hear you knocking but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I begged you not to go, but you said goodbye
And now you tell me all your lies
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
 
You better get back to your use to be
'Cause your kind of love ain't good for me
 
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been
I told you way back in Fifty Two 
That I would never go with you
I hear you knocking, but you can't come in
I hear you knocking, go back where you've been

The minute that you said good-bye
I thumbed right through my little red book
I wasn't gonna sit and cry
And I went from A to Z
I took out every pretty girl in town
They danced with me
And while I held them
All I did was to talk about you
Hear your name and I'd start to cry
There is just no getting over you
No girl who's in my little red book
Just ever could replace your love
And each girl in my little red book
Knows you're the one I'm thinking of
Won't you please come back to me?
Without your precious love I can't go on
Where can you be?
I need you so much
All I do is to talk about you
Hear your name and I start to cry
There is just no getting over you, no, no, no

Manfred Mann,"The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

C'est une chanson, qui nous ressemble
Toi tu m'aimais et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous deux ensemble

Mais la vie separe ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface sur le sable les pas des amants desunis",Autumn Leaves,1966

Is the night being tight on romance
Ha! Ha! Said the clown, is it bringing you down
That you've lost your chance

Feeling low, gotta go, see a show in town
Hear the jokes, have a smoke, and a laugh at the clown
In a whirl, see a girl with a smile in her eyes
Never thought I'd be brought right down by her lies

In a trance, watch her dance to the beat of the drums
Faster now, sweating brow, I'm all the fingers and thumbs
Wonder why I hit the sky when she blows me a kiss
In a while, run a mile, I'm regretting all this

Ha! Ha! Said the clown, has the king lost his crown
Is the night being tight on romance
Ha! Ha! Said the clown, is it bringing you down
That you've lost your chance

Time to go, close the show, wave the people goodbye
Grab my coat, grab my hat, look that girl in the eye
Where's your home, what's your phone number, stop fooling 'round

Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
And she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe, I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls

She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
And she makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here

When your longtime curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear that

I just can't fit?
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again introduced as friends

Some are building monuments
Others jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair

But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Everybody's gonna jump for joy

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But jumping queues and making haste
Just ain't my cup of meat
Everyone's beneath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
All the pigeons gonna run to him

Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

Let me do what I wanna do, I can't decide 'em all
Just tell me where to put 'em and I'll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everyone's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna wanna doze

Come all without, come all within

And he shook some dust out of his coon skin cap
He said try some of this it'll show you where you're at
Or at least it'll help you to feel it

My head was out the window
Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her, I was too loose to fake
I said I'm hurt she said Honey let's heal it
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band

A song of love is a song of woe, don't ask me how I know
A song of love is a sad song, for I have loved and it's so
I sit at the window and watch the rain, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
Tomorrow I'll probably love again, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo
 
A tear for him, a tear for me, A tear for the love he swore
A tear for him and one for me, and one for under the cedar tree
And one for where ever my love my be, and then I shall weep no more

Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers, clappin' his hands

And her eyes can light the sky

She's out of reach and out of sight
When she walks by she brightens up the neighborhood
Oh every guy would make her his if he just could
If she just would

Some sweet day I'll make her mine pretty flamingo
Then every guy will envy me

Standing hidden in the shadows
He's got a long curved Turkish dagger
With a bejeweled handle

He's tellin' her the world is full of freaks and geeks and simples and he's
Hiding like a leprechaun under stones and in the ripples
In the pool of time she thought she knew it, but someone threw a stone into it
Which breaks up the surface and it's makin' her nervous and it's true
What can she do, yes it's true
What can she do
Martha yes I guess you'll have to wait around, another thousand years

Through his valley
Where the shadows always frightening

To be found inside

To climb to the image of the TV good guy

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps 
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder
Feeling kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing, sneezing and wheezing
The calliope crashed to the ground
The calliope crashed to the ground
 
But she was
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night

Some silicone sister with a manager mister 
Told me I got what it takes
She said ""I'll turn you on, Sonny, to something strong
Play the song with the funky break""
And go-cart Mozart was checking out the weather chart 
To see if it was safe outside
And little early-pearly came by in his Curly-wurly 
And asked me if I needed a ride
Asked me if I needed a ride
 
But she was
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce
Another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night
 
But, mama, that's where the fun is
But, mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eye's of the sun
But, mama, that's where the fun is
 
Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, ""dethrone the Dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone
That's where they expect it least""
And some new-mown chaperone was standing in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messing with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance
The calliope crashed to the ground
 
But she was
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce

And the preacher rides a mount

Manfred Mann's Earth Band,"Crazy Janey and her mission man
Were back in the alley trading hands
Along came Wild Billy with his friend Gee Man
All duded up for Saturday night
Billy slammed on his coaster brakes, said
Anybody wanna go to Greasy Lake
It's a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rosÃ© let's try it
We'll pick up Hazy Davey and Killer Joe and
I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light and they dance like
Spirits in the night, all night
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night, all night
In the night, all night
Stand right up and let them shoot through you

Wild Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coon skin cap
He said try some of this it'll show you where you're at
Or at least it'll help you to feel it
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
My head was out the window
Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her, I was too loose to fake
I said I'm hurt she said Honey let's heal it
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right
Like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice, just as soft as a
Spirit in the night, all night
Janey don't know what she do to you

Stand right up and let her shoot through me

Spirits in the night, all night
Spirits in the night, in the night
Spirits in the night, all night

How the night was bright and the stars threw light
On Billy and Davey dancing in the Moonlight
Down near the water in a stoned mud fight
Killer Joe passed out on the lawn
Hazy Davey got really hurt
He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Davey making love in the dirt
Singing our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go, so we closed our eyes
And said goodbye to gypsy angel row
Felt so right together we moved like

Oh you don't know what they can do to you

Just tell me where to put it

All of my thoughts inside that machine
I've got my youts laptops young
So when they get older, money ah go run
Get your IT skills up, and watch how your bank fills up
You want thousands? Then you get your mills up
This lappy can buy you houses
Me and mine go together like real love
I've been a MacBook pro for a while
And you ain't seen me at a show for a while
But I'm back with a couple of bangers for my culture
Couldn't stop me even if you was a vulture
Right now, I've gotta charge up
When I see eight green dots, then I'm charged up

From Roman disc days to start-up

I do it every day, I've gotta hit the jackpot
I hit the jackpot when they say the track's hot
Had bare records on the wall, it was looking like
A New Era hat shop, no backdrop
Played these meetings like a goalie here
Dem man saved couple shots but they couldn't stop that shot
I've got one main tool: my laptop

Let me tell you how man got here
Started off with the cracked software
All them plugins made man
So much money and it didn't stop there
Went on for years of my life
I was in the kitchen making riddims all night
Sound card, mic and a keyboard
And I wasn't looking for a reward
I was doing it, passion: the leader
Since Street and the fever
Any vision that I had was a real one
I'm a Logic user; a real one
Reach for a draw of the peng and then I build one
Wanted a scene and I built one

Oi, it's my tool, that machine
That MacBook Pro
MacBook Pro forever, trust me

Use that, get back, draw for the Mac
Ayy, yo, record, biggerman
Do the video and the artwork too
Yeah, man, all of that jazz
No, I never backtrack, black jeans, black hat
Mac in my backpack like I'm tryna war with a man
Quad core does more
Stay fit for what, rudeboy on a man
Ready fi get bill up, hard drive fill up
Gotta do works if you wanna be a winner
Anything I gotta do, I'm gonna do it quicker
Only relying on the brudda in the mirror

Years full of tears and regret;
I've been alone broken hearted,
Trying so hard to forget:
 
Girl of my dreams I love you, honest I do,
You are so sweet,
If I could just hold your charms again in my arms,
Then life would be complete;
Since you've been gone dear, life don't seem the same,
Please come back again.
And after all's said and done, there's only one,
Girl of my dreams, it's you.

Sunshine and joy always nigh;
We live and learn for tomorrow,
But sometimes the learning comes high:

Ancora qui fra le mie braccia
Per tutti e due basterebbe tornare fin qui

And a military man
Can't he see we're together
But he doesn't understand

That everybody plays
Striking chords of memory
In so many different ways
Your love burns me like a hellfire....",Hellfire,1991

There's a special star that shines
Every evening in your eyes

Manhattan School of Music Jazz Orchestra,"Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young
Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet  love comes but once, and yet
I'm oh, so glad we met the second time around

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on earth.

Manhead,"Been turned around till I'm upside down
Been all at sea until I've drowned
And I've felt torture, I've felt pain

And I've kissed Margaret Thatcher's shoes
And I been high and I been low
And I don't know where to go

Birth, school, work, death

And heroin was the love you gave
From the cradle to the grave
Boys and girls don't understand
The devil makes work for idle hands

I cut myself but I don't bleed
'Cause I don't get what I need
It doesn't matter what I say
Tomorrow's still another day

Birth, school, work, death
Birth, school, work, death

Yeah, I been high and I been low
And I don't know where to go
I'm living on the never, never, never
This time it's gonna be forever

I'll live and die, don't ask me why
I wanna go to paradise
And I don't need your sympathy
There's nothing in this world for me

filled... with fatal thoughts maybe even murder the same man who told her he would never hurt her here comes

Knows so she may think it doesn't

Force you into sex against your will
So if this has happened to you
You'd better report it because

Have made we can't afford to lose

Mani Hoffman,"VERSE 1

Ya steppin into a danger zone
there’s some things that I’d like to change in your tone.
Shift it down and take out tha bass 
I’ll be damned if ya talkin down in my face
To ya boy it’s about respect 
mouthing off to tha boss ya bound to get checked
Step to my team ya dreams they get wrecked 
when I’m floating my boat all hands is on deck
I ain’t the one settin’ off the clash 
You the one in the front talkin’ all the trash
Should have known that my style is brash
Got your mouth writin’ checks your hands can’t cash
I think it’s time that I take you down 
Got a really big head let it taste the ground
You wanna talk all above the rest ?
Now it’s time to put ya big talk to tha test…

CHORUS

You think that you know- what we’re going through…


Verse 2

It’s going out to the politicians 
the crooked police makin’ broke decisions
They wanna fuck with the way we livin’
To keep us hemmed up in the poor conditions
This ain’t no thing i can tolerate
You wanna spread love the state they spread hate
Floss in your suit ya think  ya so great
Wanna come to the hood at nite I can’t wait
Snortin lines in ya limousine 
Then ya act like ya style of life is so clean
You wanna talk all above the rest ?
Now it’s time to put ya big talk to tha test 
I’m doing this for my party people 
No matter what tha style yo the style iz equal
So shift it down and take out the bass
I’ll be damned if ya talkin down in my face- now !


CHORUS

Mani Hoffman,"Sur une arme les doigts noués
Pour agresser, serrer les poings
Mais nos paumes sont pour aimer
Y'a pas de caresse en fermant les mains

Longues, jointes en une prière
Bien ouvertes pour acclamer
Dans un poing les choses à soustraire
On ne peut rien tendre les doigts pliés

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Mécanique simple et facile
Des veines et dix métacarpiens
Des phalanges aux tendons dociles
Et tu relâches ou bien tu retiens

Et des ongles faits pour griffer
Poussent au bout du mauvais côté
Celui qui menace ou désigne
De l'autre on livre nos vies dans des lignes

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
(Suffit de rien dix fois rien)
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
A peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Un simple geste d'humain
Quand se desserrent ainsi nos poings
Quand s'écartent nos phalanges
Sans méfiance, une arme d'échange
Des champs de bataille en jardin

Le courage du signe indien
Un cadeau d'hier à demain
Rien qu'un instant d'innocence
Un geste de reconnaissance
Quand on ouvre comme un écrin

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Suffit de rien dix fois rien
Suffit d'une ou deux secondes
À peine un geste, un autre monde
Quand on ouvre nos mains

Quand on ouvre nos mains
Quand on ouvre nos mains",Nos mains,2013

Visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see

That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes

I'm gonna lose it anyway
The losing card of some delay
So this is all I have to say
That suicide is painless

It brings on many changes
I can take or leave it if I please
The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins

But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn
That suicide is painless
It brings on many changes

And I can take or leave it if I please

To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be

And I replied oh why ask me

Pity or pain, to show displeasure's shame
Everyone I've loved or hated always seems to leave

Pass each other as if their drugged
Down pale corridors of routine
Where life falls unatoned
The weak kick like straw
Till the world means less and less
Words are never enough
Just cheap tarnished glitter

All your slut heroes offer is a fear of the future,

Smother my life in interest accounts

And consumer self-hate leads to designer bullshit
Hate is art and we steal cars
Decaying flowers in the playground of the rich

It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works it's way on in
The pain grows stronger, watch it burn

To answer questions that are key
Is it to be or not to be
And I replied, ""Oh why ask me?""

Niggas love to hate, hoes jock cause I'm getting rich
Keep my mind on my fetti just to let you know
Strapped with rocks, reds, and camera's in my black fo'fo
On the east-side nigga trying to get me some paper
Lying throwing stone out all over the cater
These hoes be lovin the player, Jason calling me baby
But fuck that, I rather trot these hoes are too damn shady
Look I don't need a bitch, I'm riding down for me
And fuck a gang of niggas, see I'm a soldier G
And ain't another nigga, who got more got game than me
You need to check yo shit, because its lame to me
Since 91 been paying the cost, to be the boss
Got no time to floss, because the game's throwed off

Steady showing niggas how we do it down south
Steady riding shit that ain't even came out
In the club, VIP is where you find me at
Private planes, ice chains, I don't know how to act
Every city, got me something pretty keep em on they back
""If I ain't a hot boy then what do you call that""
If its my shit, off the top you can tell
Cranberry, pineapple, four bottles of bale
Cats that play sports, rap fresh from jail
Hoes in packs, screaming out ATL
See I'm the type of nigga that was built for cash
Drive me and dropping putting down a smash
Knowing nothing in life, but how to make these hits
Get paper, spit game in, pull me a bitch

Hardcore niggas getting dead presidents
Where the real niggas went, I'ma let you know
Lay back with the strap, and they ain't found no mo'
These lil niggas tripping, all that hollering-screaming
I know yo momma saw dick, she should've swallowed that semen
Now I'm driving through your block, red hot like a demon
Cock it back, all you see is the beam from my demon
And it ain't no ping ping nigga, black-eye black-eye
No respect for the game, you better watch-out watch-out
Got this shit on lock, and now you locked-out locked-out
All that hate on a player, gone get you knocked-out knocked-out

Manishevitz,"Some men call half way around the world
If they've got a phone game to play
Then again some men
They call their mom every day

Old boys drink bad beer and throw
The cans out in the street
Playboys sit and sip red wine
Some drink malt whiskey neat

And if you can, you talk about some men
Baby if you can, you can talk about some men
And if you can, you can talk about some men
Baby if you can, you can talk about some men

Colonels collect the animal heads
And hang their guns up on the wall
Corn balls watch a television
Pull a gun out in the hall

Crew-cut rainbows hang on streets
Hoping they'll find a friend
Odd balls running fast enough
They hope that they won't find their end

And if you can, you can talk about some men
Honey if you can, you can talk about some men
Baby if you can, you can talk about some men
Baby if you can, you can talk about some men, oh yeah

Sleep all night, work all day
Work all night, sleep all day
Drink all night, sick all day
Sick all night, drink all day
Sing all night, if you can

We ain't soldiers don't just generalize
No categories because it takes all kinds
You can sleep all night, you can work all day
You can trip all night, peak all day

If you can, you can talk about some men

Mankind,"The time has come to relive the pain
Which will be better for me
But not so enjoyable for all of you!
On the 8th day,
God created mankind.
Why was He having such a bad day?
Why did He make all of you normal,
And leave out some of the important parts of me?
He made the teeth that I swallowed,
And the ear that was ripped from my skull!
The face that no longer exists!
Deep inside you are merely a mirror image
Of all my atrocities!
The ugliness that lives outside
Lurks inside each and every one of you!

A fugitive running
Fallen from God
Fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face

He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
And those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword

Stars in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness
With order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night

You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season, returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame

And so it must be for so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price

And stars in your multitudes
Lord, let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind wrong
I will never rest
And just to share
It's pleasures and belong
It's pleasures and belong
That's what I've been here for all along
Each day, till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars

Può andare bene
Può andare male

Ma non si sa
Qual'è il finale

Bisogna andare
Comunque andare
A camminare
Sulla terrazza 
Con vista mondo
Dove ogni alba 
È anche un tramonto

Che va perduta alla deriva
Ma se sei qui con me il mondo non c’è
C’è solo pioggia estiva

Vago nell’eternità
E sto qua giù, dentro una stradina

Poi ritornare con una vita
Lasciare al mondo un nuovo nome
Una vendetta, una speranza
O forse solo un po’ d’amore 
E il carburante del motore dell’astronave 

Il mondo è un'Arca di Noè 
Che va perduta alla deriva

Una riga più dritta dell'altra chiuse il confine

Con una gamba più zoppa dell'altra provammo a fuggire
Con la pelle di un altro colore mischiammo le vene
Trovati, battuti e portati sopra un campo di neve
E il sangue cadendo sembrò dello stesso colore

Fu per paura dell'esecuzione o per il dolore
Che con un braccio più freddo dell'altro stringevo il mio amore
Lei mi disse ""Sei freddo, fra le mie gambe c'è ancora calore""
Cominciammo a fare l'amore davanti ai soldati
Lei disse, tremando ""Che vedano come son nati
Che vedano gli esseri umani come son nati""
Con gli occhi negli occhi dell'altro andammo a vedere
Due lastre di ghiaccio lasciate dalla bufera
Improvvisamente travolte dai primi raggi della primavera

Il soldato più orbo dell'altro prese a mirare
E quello più monco dell'altro era pronto a sparare
Ma il soldato più muto di tutti si mise a parlare
""Fermi, abbassate i fucili, guardateli bene
Si lamentano l'uno con l'altro, son tutti contorti
Ecco che cadono a terra, guardate, son morti""

In fields where they lay a-keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east, beyond them far:
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and night.

Born is the King of Israel.

And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from the country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.

This star drew nigh to the north-west;
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

Born is the King of Israel.

Then entered in those wise men three,
Fell reverently upon their knee,
And offered there in his presence
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.

They bend on hov'ring wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds

Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow,

Come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together
Proclaim the holy birth
And praises sing to God the King
And Peace to men on earth

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may his His coming,
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive him still,
The dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem
Descend to us, we pray
Cast out our sin and enter in
Be born to us today

O come to us, abide with us

Instead of makin' they bucks, bank account runnin' out of luck
Now you stuck, do deals fulfill your dreams make cream
Keep my pockets long like streams, no strings

Attached, attack any nigga plottin' on my stack
Mo bounce to this, smoke an ounce to this
Make more gold than fish, one wish

Break bread with me
Nigga, is your man with me?
Thought you was beefin
You supposed to spend yo' cash with me
I'm hear to last with me
Hold me down, give me a whip,
Give me a bitch, let her blow me down
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, I'm so rhymin'
I promise you something and I betcha you don't find me
I got my evil
Purchase whatever I please
CO, give me the keys, aww please! I need two of these!

-Chorus X2
(Juvenile)
Imma be so corageous
And so contagious
Until fuckin' rap sheets gon' receive mo' pages
Listen to Juve 'cause it's my year mon (My year mon)
Invasion, Imma bout to kick it in gear mon (In gear mon)
Don't you see the soldiers and hoes when I appear mon? (Appear mon)
About bein' written on my face 'cause I don't fear none (Fear none)
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up
Skip's smoothin' the work and Wakko poppin' the chopper 
I scream to you 'cause I mean it
The only difference is you only throwing up shit when you scream it
I seen it
Shit, all the obsticals that I been through
What make you think Imma be scared of a bitch like you?
I'm yo' dog, lemme get it all, co-sign me
You ain't paid them last people yet
Dog, don't even remind me
My game knowledge, my game polished, and it's obvious
You can't block it, you can't knock it
'Cause it's profit

-Chorus X2
(Juvenile)
Can I untape the clips and chill ?
Show my niggas its real,
Can my people shop in Beverly Hills,
I got a lot of work I know that's gonna be ahead of me still,
But my beast mentality gon' keep me ahead in the field
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase,
Now cut through the talking and bring me straight to the safe,
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape,
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensics to trace,
I had a problem on my hand, a few bills I had been payin',
I figured about a lil'bit less than 75 grand,
and my dog Rocky, caught a nickel for a pistol,
Its serious when the federals comin' to get you,
Life is at a standstill, all change in this damn field,
What you say, can get you and ya mans killed,
This my last chance to come up, this gotta be it,
Juve comin up, the first round' lottery pick

Than step up in that thing and tell them niggaz what's up

[Chorus] x4
Go chubby boy, make the block hot
Go chubby boy, make her pussy pop

[Verse 2]
I got a brand new benz and it's heiniken green
In the front license plate read pussy machine
The most beautifulest thing shorty you've ever seen
Pimpin sew it where you show it nigga fresh and so clean
I'm the reason why young niggaz up they game
Plenty many bad bitches say they glad I came
I'm a legend in the bricks, playa check it fa real
Downtown mean mug nigga hard ta kill
Shorty shinnin ain't nuttin but a lil bitty thang
Three-hundred sixty-five diamonds beamin up in the ring
I'm the man girlfriend, got more money than them
Lea, Paul, Lil Carl and that nigga wit them
Oh so called ""D"" boy, stunnin fu gazy
In the hood say your lil girl look like baby
I'm the reason why niggaz gotta get up and get it
Right white one's playa wit the shirt and the fittie

[Chorus] x4
Go chubby boy, make the block hot
Go chubby boy, make her pussy pop

[Verse 3]
When I come through your city they go who is that
Young fella pimpin yella in a yellow Maybach
Nigga I came to show my chain, hardcore to the bling
Playa let's go inside where the bitches at [ruff]
Let me see it, pussy nigga, couldn't be it
If ya get it like ya say ya get it, nigga 10 a ki it

Buy the new 7 playa, push on them hatas
Step out witcha left out, homie steppin in gators

Hotter than Maimi in the month of July
Got your girl dick ridin', chubby boy still fly

Sheet might be satin and the pillows look suede
Yea, girl I know how to getcha, I got a 54 inch flat screen picture of me
Standing by a tree with some kackhi dickies on in a white tee
And I like the way you move, I like the way you step

The same fuckin thing we started havin sex
Then I heard the phone ring
She ignored the motherfucker 'cause she gettin good dingaling
I banged her head against the wall when
The phone keep ringin ( who the fuck is this callin?)
I grabbed the thing and pulled it out the socket
Then put my pullstick back in her center pocket
She said you make me feel so great
And I love ya like a fat kid loves cake
That's 50 line bitch cut it out
And if you really love me trick put the dick in your mouth
She sucked my thang and I'm about to skket

On my way downstairs lookin through his refrigerator
Then I yell where you're husband at
She said gone and I dnt kno when he comin back

And tonight philidelphia they aponents
Then I heard the door open up ( WHO THE FUCK!!)
I thought to myself another happy home broken up
Then I reach for my weapon
Before this nigga go to trippin
She said wait let me stop him
You better bitch or I'm guna have to pop him

Just motivation for these freaky hoes to show that ass nigga
I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass... freeze
All you niggas wanna touch my cash
The 40 cal's in the stash, and when I touch I blast
Television's in the dash, suede roof in the coupe
I'm the one nigga, young niggas knew it's the truth
And the dumb niggas I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerrillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
Yeah I'm rich, but I ain't just talkin' I live like this

Rocks in my ring, big as cubes in ya ice tea
I used to dream 'bout a Benz now I own like 3
I gotta wine-colored V, with the wine-colored V
And reclined leather seats, I ain't lyin' on my beats
You can tell I'm gettin' money how I shine in the streets
Blowin' on the best pine you can find in the streets
Rappers wastin' they time if they trying to compete
They records sales declinin' when mine hit the streets
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cus my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
You'll run yourself raggedy tryna out shine me
No matter what ya do, you're 2 steps behind me

A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us

The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
I gotta Magnum with a magnum in it
PlayStation and a plasma in it
Sittin' on 20 inches and it's tinted
Gotta hemi nothin' faster than it
The 50 Gs'll pass you in it, get real
Gotta Chevy more expensive than that Jag you rented
Excuse me, but let Young Pimpin' brag a minute
Gotta bottle of Louie and a flock of groupies hotter than Rudy

Bitch it's the king of the trill, I'm top of the line
My paint is on drip, my rims is on shine
My butter seats reclined, cherry oak is grip
With see to blow, and purple rain to sip

Now straight up off the rip, I'm letting boys know
I've never been a bitch, don't plan to be a hoe
So if you got some plex, you better keep it low
I bring it to your chest, soon as you hit the do'

You know me as a pro, respect me as a vet
I put it down befo', you ain't seen nothing yet
My candy still glossy, my four's still flossy
My rocks real icey, I'm looking kinda bossy

And feeling real saucy, it's time to get it crunk
Now watch me pop it fly, just like I'm popping trunk
The leader of the pack, the star of the show
When Bun is in the building, you already know

I'm Fresh, brand new
Every time, that I come through
Hoe look at my wrist, my neck
I just bust me a fat ass check, hoe

I'm the man, he's a wimp
If you wanna get ahead, get a pimp
Dope boy shoes, big rings
And only bad bitches say my name, hoe

Bitch you wanna roll with a pimp, then have it on your mind
It's all about this bread, so you gon' have to grind
I gotta stay on shine, so you know what that means
You gotta hit that track, and bring me back that green

Cause daddy need his ice, and daddy need his chain
We gotta keep it G, so rec' him as the game
A hoe need a pimp, a pimp need a hoe
And tricks need us both, so let's go get that do'

In case you didn't know, I haven't been told
But pussy on the corner, and it's as good as sold
It's tricks on the prowl, so stay out on that stroll
Cause I'ma sell your cot, and you gon' sell your soul

My pimping way too cold, but it's gon' keep me warm
With minks up on my back, and rocks up in my charm
So bitch ring the alarm, and tell 'em I've arrived
The greatest ever born, that's dead or alive

I'm Fresh, brand new
Every time, that I come through
Hoe look at my wrist, my neck

If you wanna get ahead, get a pimp
Dope boy shoes, big rings
And only bad bitches say my name, hoe

Bitch you know that Rap-A-Lot's the click, and UGK's the fam
It's middle fingers up, 'cause we don't give a damn
Them Caddy do's slam, that top gon' drop
Them four's gon' tip, them blades gon' chop

Them deuces get chunked, them screens gon' fall
It's Southside holding, so we gon' ball
And slabs gon' crawl, them 3's gon' swang
That woman gon' shine, that trunk gon' bang

And underground king, from P.A.T
I miss my dog, so free Pimp see
And I'ma hold it down, and rep for my team
To keep us on the map, so he can get that green

I work the triple beam, electronic scale
Even a baby bottle, whatever get that mail

Why Bun coulda be, so motherfucking trill

I'll floss on you bitchez doin' 90 on the free
Gettin' lost on you bitchez
See, if you less than 500, I'ma boss on you bitchez
Hustle, hustle real hard, Rick Ross on you bitchez

Got a loft that I bought, got a condo in New York
Spendin' boo cool money but I gotta play it smart, play it smart

Switchin' lanes on you bitchez
And I know you niggaz hear I do my thang on you bitchez

Yo, you think they like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet the house somebody's girl spend the night with me
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square face watch look like sponge bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You could look, but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze to every slug that we be packin', son
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin' on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got 'em gettin' close, and lookin' like a scooped-up

I play them diamonds well when I got that jewelery on

Twenty carat pinky ring, shit, I got it robbin'

Dominican shit, shit, I got it from fans
Yo, the stone is in my chain, so I call it the cab

Yo, maybe it's them VV's 'cause they sets susters
Sit on the next bus like the show on MTV

Like the wings on a plane when you sittin' in between 'em
They hittin' when you clean 'em, glitterin' when you seen 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin' in the ""Phenom""
Oops, I mean Phantom; my words got tangled, man
But this tiger stripe watch make this bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob; check the shit he did
He spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC at the white and gold house
Wanna convince me, love? Secret service me with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what I call a real chain of events, nigga

Mannie Fresh,"Go by the name of Weezie F.
An fuck 'em out the belly store with ten bags?
Fly as a muthafucka girly on my staple
'Cause her friends say I'm a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel
I'm up in Lil' Hatti
I'm blowin' on Jamaica
I'm in the pimper beemer
I'm with a salt shaker
Now I'm in Dade County
I see some thick bitches
I try to holla at 'em
But they all trick bitches
I think Trina sexy
Mama ya wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time
Yea I'm a ridah ma
The Birdman's boy
He own cash money
I pre-own cash money
Yea and I put her on cash money
She start wobblin' that ass for me
She start modelin'
She see the models in the Maybach
She call me Weezie F. Baby
And she make sure she say that

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up
Give em a lil' dip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Now I'm the daughter of a madam
Inside of a pink phantom
If ya man got that cash
Then best believe I met him
'Cause I'm sharp as a machete
And I cuss like Freddie
Niggas call me Betty Crocker
'Cause my cakes stay plenty
Got stacks on top of stacks
Cup in the meal ticket
No matter the consequence
My emphasis is to get it
It's Trina Weezie F. Baby
Mannie handle the scripts
It's all reminiscent to
Gladys Knight and the Pips
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick
It ain't gonna be no standin' around
Now lets get crunk in this bitch
And ladies
Show em yo shit
A lil' hip a lil' thigh
More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i
Or my big 600
Believe Trina done it
Believe them diamonds studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase grams cause I am what I am
Don't give a damn
Go

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up
Give em a lil' dip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips

Back to the lesson at hand
Stick to my plan
When it comes to seein' man after man
Don't give a damn about his car or his friends
Wh Wh Wh Wh What
Cause I'm gonna make my on ends
That's Wh What's up
Ladies lets say you want a man
But don't know how to do it
Dirty dance with em
Put a lil' back into it
Look at yo wall shorty
End up at the mall sporty
Try to dog waddy?
Make em spend it all on ya
Yep and make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin' for that kitty cat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that
Just let him know
Say make a bitch rich
Cause the badest bitch taught you that

See a fly nigga baby, yeah I don't trip
Just give em lil' thigh
Mama give em lil' hip
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don't trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Give em lil' die
Mama give em lil' hip
Then you give 'em lil' wind up
Give em a lil' dip
And if you see a fly bitch

And perhaps a kid or two

I most forget till he gets hot
And tells me not to talk such rot

And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?

Into Heaven I'm hurled!

Finding another world.

It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me started a symphony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

'Twas like a breath of spring, heard a robin sing
About a nest set apart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, love you""

I still recall the thrill, guess I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Your eyes made skies blue again
What else could I do again?
Keep repeating through again
""I love you, I do love you""

I still recall the thrill, I guess that I always will
I hope 'twill never depart
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart",Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart,1967
Manny Benito,"Una nueva sensación 
Es como un sueño en color 
Una mágica emoción 
Que haré perder el control

Se apodera de mí 
Y de nada puedo hacer 
Desde que allí te vi 
Me enamoré

Nunca te he logrado encontrar 
Y perdí la esperanza 
Disfrazaba mi ansiedad 
Entre mis sábanas blancas

Nunca imaginé 
Que el amor que soñé 
Tan transparente 
Sin aviso llegó

Tu y yo 
Somos la fórmula perfecta amor 
Tu y yo 
No puede haber mejor combinación

Qué misterios habrá cambiado mis sentidos 
Tu y yo 
Dos cuerpos y un corazón 
Fundidos por la pasión

De repente todo cambia 
Tu te sientes cambiar 
Lo insignificante ayer
hoy tiene un precio especial 

Saber que hay alguien 
Que te haré sentir 
y que ese alguien 
Vive por ti

Tu y yo, dos cuerpos y un corazón 
Fundidos por la pasión
Tu y yo, tu y yo, tu y yo",Tu y Yo,1994

Manny Charlton,"Do you remember who you believe angel
When the chart was in the rise
Do you remember your leader angel
For the people and the lies ¡­. mmmm, yeah

Does she remember oh those heartaches
And the taste of bittersweet
She turns the color to the voices in her mind
Sounds so far, too far to me

She was a noble heart
She was a noble heart
She's a child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way
Child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way

Lead

Take your weapon, dare to see her face again
¡®cause you'll be sad cause she's on the move
Will you ask the one outside to take your place?
The child that helped you rove

She was a noble heart
She was a noble heart
She's a child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way
Child with her head in a cloud
She's got double the tears in her eyes
She's got sad eyes
She won't go down
¡®cause she knows the way

Do you remember little sister
Do you accept the tears won't go
Do you remember little sister
Child that's left out in the cold

She's in your heart
She's in your heart

Said to love me she was born
But that was Friday payday
By Sunday she was gone
So I drove on down to Texas
Where I did not do to well
I fell hard for this woman child
Turn you she came from well
Lady Luck help me hold on
Lady Luck help me hold on
To one that I love
Well I had no luck with women
Thought I'd try my hand at cards
So I headed for Nevada
Gonna really take them on
But the way the hands were fallin'
And the way the money goes
You could say it's getting colder
You could say I nearly froze
Lady Luck help me hold on
Lady Luck help me hold on
To one that I love
So I started playing guitar
In a southern boogie band
And the ladies I was meeting
Make you want to buy the farm
Gettin' tired of saving souvenirs
Don't remind me where they're from
And the nights come on like magic
In the morning it's all gone

Hey lets go man

Yo, Freshly Snipes and Black-Ty, on your ass
One more time, bring it nigga, hey!

Said you wanna be a baller
More than likely all the niggas in the hood wanna be just like me
Dress just like me
Push up in a whip this pricey
Keep up a hoe stash and call them all wifey
Watch me get busy when they come to this mic shit
I talk shit
I'm quick to back it up with the quickness
And you wanna try to put me to the test
I'ma take over the South with my nigga Mannie Fresh
And yes, he was exposed to Black-Ty
Got in right away, next day, press play
The rest is history
Man I'm feelin' unstoppable like O.J. in his prime
Pushin' through the front line
So move bitch
I keep a lotta hoes 'cause I'm smooth bitch
Even niggas that's been rollin' w' Mannie for years
Is mad that they didn't get a track like his

Hey nigga (hey nigga), what it is (what it is)
If you wanna live longer mind your biz

And a nine is a terrbile thing to face

'cause the beat in the trunk and the flow so sick
From the west coast to down south
They keep Black-Ty in their mouth
'cause they know what I'm about
I ain't about no games
I got fourteen years in the game
And its all the same
I see a bunch of new-money niggas
Shoppin' in the mall
Showin' off with their ran-through broads
I feel sorry for you niggas
You don't know know better
Still wet behind the ears
Trickin' off the cheddar
Thinkin' that you're ballin' man
You better watch it
They'll get ya for your money man

Manny Klein,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be
I just have to stop and think, Why she fell for me.

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.",She's Funny That Way [Edited Version][Edit],2002
Manny Klein's All Stars,"To spend one night with you in our old rendezvous,
And reminisce with you that's my desire.
To meet where gypsies play, down in that dim cafe,
And dance 'till break of day that's my desire.
We'll sip a little glass of wine, I'll gaze into your eyes divine.
I'll feel the touch of your lips pressing on mine.
To hear you whisper low just when it's time to go,
 
Cherie, I love you so, that's my desire.",That's My Desire,2008
Manny López,"If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
How, tell me how will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or can I trust the way I feel
If you could read my mind
You see how hard I've tried
Still I can't decide

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Do you know if it's true
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky
And do you know if you can fall for
Just a moment
Is a moment for all time
Why, why am I so unsure
Is that love knocking at my door
Or the sound of my beating heart
If you could read my mind
You know I just can't hide
What I feel inside

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Oh, tell me could this be love

Manny Manuel,"Es noche y en su cuarto el sueño del primer amor esta escapándose 
Lloro y en su almohada lo encontró en cada lagrima alejándose 
Miro por la ventana esperando encontrar una estrellita 
Y hacerle su pedido para que el de la abandone y no la deje tan solita 

Estrellita dile por favor que es muy joven para preocuparse 
Dile que esa penas de la vida y con el tiempo va a volver a enamorarse 
Estrellita dile por favor cuéntale que hay rosas en la vida 
Que nos dan un día su perfume y otro dia ellas mismas te lastiman 

Yo se sera difícil resignarse a perder a su primer amor 
Que va a pasar el tiempo y muy adentro seguirá sintiendo un gran dolor 
Y llegara a pensar que su pedido no ha escuchado la estrellita 
Y llorara muy triste porque el la ha abandonado y la ha dejado tan solita

Y yo seguiré siendo el rey de corazones
Ay, ay no llores

Y yo seré por siempre tu rey de corazones

Con llanto lavaste tus pecados
Y yo también he aprendido a perdonarte
Y no olvido lo mucho que te he amado

Volveremos al mundo del pasado
Pero nunca, nunca, nunca, nunca olvides
Que yo cedo después de haber ganado

Manny Manuel,"Cansado de llamarte,
con mi alma destrozada,
comprendo que no vienes
porque no quiere Dios;
why al ver que inútilmente
te envío mis palabras,
llorando mi guitarra
te deja oír mi voz.
why al ver que inútilmente
te envío mis palabras,
llorando mi guitarra
te deja oír mi voz.

Llora guitarra,
porque eres mi voz de dolor;
grita su nombre de nuevo,
si no te escuchó;
why dile que aún la quiero,
que aún espero que vuelva,
que si no viene mi amor
no tiene consuelo,
que solitario sin su cariño me muero.

Guitarra, tú que interpretas
en tu vibrar mi quebranto;
tú que recibes en tu madera mi llanto; 
llora conmigo, si no la vieras volver.

Manny Manuel,"Quiero emborrachar mi corazón 
para olvidar un loco amor 
que más que amor es un sufrir

Y aquí vengo para eso, 
a borrar antiguos besos 
en las besos de otras bocas 

Si su amor fue flor de un día
¿Porqué causa siempre es mía 
esa cruel preocupación? 

Quiero por los dos mi copa alzar 
para olvidar mi obstinación 
y más la vuelvo a recordar

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado 
y pensar que otro a su lado 
pronto, pronto le hablará de amor 

¡Hermano! Yo no quiero rebajarme
ni pedirle, ni llorarle, ni decirle 
que no puedo más vivir

Desde mi triste soledad 
veré caer las rosas 
muertas de mi juventud. 

Gime, bandoneón, tu tango gris, 
quizá a ti te hiera igual 
algún amor sentimental

Llora mi alma de fantoche 
sola y triste en esta noche, 
noche negra y sin estrellas

Si las copas traen consuelo 
aquí estoy con mi desvelo 
para ahogarlo de una vez

Quiero emborrachar al corazón 
para después poder brindar 
por los fracasos del amor

Nostalgia de escuchar su risa loca 
y sentir junto a mi boca 
como un fuego su respiración 

Angustia de sentirme abandonado 
y pensar que otro a su lado 
pronto, pronto le hablará de amor

¡Hermano! Yo no quiero rebajarme
ni pedirle, ni llorarle, ni decirle 
que no puedo más vivir

Desde mi triste soledad 
veré caer las rosas 
muertas de mi juventud",Nostalgia,2004
Manny Manuel,"Nadie me daría dos días de vida
Por la forma en que me encuentro hoy
Tengo la mirada de ansiedad vacía
Ya no hay alegría donde voy

Penas y penas y penas
Hay dentro de mí
Y ya no se irán
Porque a mi lado tú no estás

Te recordaré
Como algo que fue
Sólo un sueño hermoso
Nada más

Si me perdonaras
Si todo olvidaras
Si tu amor volviera junto a mí

Qué feliz sería
Ya no lloraría
Sólo viviría para ti

Penas y penas y penas
Hay dentro
Penas y penas y penas

Manny Manuel,"¿Por qué dudas mi cielo? Si yo te quiero
Con tanto anhelo y devoción
Por favor no seas mala, calma esta llama
Para que alegres mi corazón

Yo te busco en las noches te llamo de día
Te dejo mensajes en el buzón
Me la paso rezando por ti penando
Será que no quiere escucharme Dios

De la casa a la esquina, la esquina a la calle
La calle a la plaza
La plaza al parque en que te conocí
(Que te conocí)

De Guaynabo a Aguadilla
Aguadilla hasta El Cabo
De El Cabo a Miami
Y no hay rastro de ti
(No hay rastro de ti)

Ven y cúrame con tus besos
Que me muero de pena sin tu amor

No me hagas sufrir ya más
No me hagas llorar
Ven y dame ese beso
Que lleve mi alma a la eternidad

No me hagas sufrir ya más
No me hagas llorar
Que ya fue suficiente
Con todo el cariño que no me das

Me la paso tan solo abandonado
Perdido en un lado de mi colchón
Sólo sueño con verte que cambie mi suerte
Para entregarte todo mi amor

Yo te ofrezco mi vida un amor sincero
Amor de novela en televisión
Eres mi poesía el verso que rima
La que me inspira en esta canción

De tu piel un lunar del lunar a tu boca
Tu boca en mi mente
Mi mente en la luna y no puedo dormir
(No puedo dormir)

En mis sueños te sueño
Sueño con tu pelo
Enredado en el viento y yo vuelvo a vivir

Ven y cúrame con tus besos

Manny Manuel,"Sutilmente te fuiste metiendo en mi corazón

Viste en mi un aprendiz de galán que quisiste atrapar 
Yo notaba que no te saciabas mientras yo más te amaba 
Con marcada malicia tu cuerpo se entregaba a mi cuerpo
Preparando el terreno inventabas alargar tu jugada 
Y ya vez que en tu propia maraña te quedaste enredada

Te creías la reina del cielo por tus dones de vuelo 
Te encontrabas tan segura de mí que hasta me hacías sufrir 
Y ahora vez que tu cruel vanidad se te ha vuelto dolor

Und packen ganz schnell ihre Sachen.

It hurts me so bad for us to part
But someday baby,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more

You're on my mind every place I go
How much I love you, nobody know
Yeah, someday babe,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more

So many days since you went away
I've had to worry both night and day
Yeah, but someday babe,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more

So many nights since you've been gone
I've been worried, grieving my life alone
Yeah, but someday babe,
I ain't gonna worry my life any more

So that's my story and this is all I've got to say to you:
Bye bye, baby, I don't care what you do
'Cause someday darling,
I won't have to worry my life any more

Manny Oquendo,"Speak low when you speak, love,
Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.

Speak low when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.

Speak low, darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.

Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.",Speak Low,1994
Manny Pacquiao,"You ask me if I love you
And I choke on my reply
I'd rather hurt you honestly
Than mislead you with a lie

For who am I to judge you
In what you say or do
I'm only just beginning
To see the real you

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

Romance's an honest strategy
Leaves me grappling with my pride
But through the years of maturity
Some tenderness survives
I'm just another writer
Still trapped within my truth
A hesitant prize-fighter
Still trapped within my youth

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

At times I'd like to break you
And drive you to your knees
At times I'd like to break through
And hold you endlessly
At times I understand you
And I know how hard you try
I've watched while love commands you
And I've watched love pass you by
At times I think we're drifters
Still searching for a friend
A brother or a sister
But then the passion flares again

And sometimes when we touch
The honesty's too much
And I have to close my eyes
And hide
I want to hold you till I die
Till we both break down and cry
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides",Sometimes When We Touch,1995

You got no soul
Behind your eyes
There's a big wall

Your mind is cold
Your heart is bold
Behind your eyes
There's a big wall

Now what am I gonna do ?
Bring the fire

And I'm climbing on the wall
Just to get in touch with you

Bring the fire

'Cause there's nothin'
That I wouldn't do
To get in touch with you

It's been a long long night
Till the stole the light
I got a big desire
I want the world set on fire

Last time I saw the light
Was just a little lovelight shine
And it was burnin' down in your eyes
So unsteady it drive me blind

A s'agiter autour de leur conversation
Ils doivent parler trés fort

Surveiller son petit voilier
Ni meme comme les clodos du pont

Elle tient un balai qui fait deux fois sa taille
Elle fait des pas immenses et secs

Je regarde ma vie défiler
Mille lumières, autant d'enfers, qui se croisent et se toisent et me ratiboisent
Et je vois un mur au loin, qui recule à mesure
Et je sais qu'un jour viendra où le mur s'arretera

Mais il n'est pas de marche arrière, encore moins sur le boulevard circulaire
Tete à queue sans queue ni tete où les radars immortalisent mon cafard
La grande spirale du râle m'engloutit, je navigue aveugle sous la pluie

Ondulant les vagues filantes encornées de brumes déchirées d'étoiles d'Irlande
Entre les gros tonnages qui font barrages
Les marées noires qui croient m'avoir
Je joue des coudes et roule à plein pot
C'est pas ce soir qu'ils auront ma peau
Je roule tout droit sur le periph' depuis des heures

Deux cent à l'heure je me sens bien
Je n'ai pas peur je roule vers mon destin
Les gyrophares nécrophages arriveront toujours trop tard pour ramasser mes dérapages
Mais je vois un mur au loin qui recule à mesure
Et je sais qu'un jour viendra où le mur s'arretera",Le Periph,2000
Mano Solo,"Tu joues seulement pour gagner à ce jeu sans règles 
Ou seulement les tiennes qu'il faut déchiffrer 
Comme les os d'un griot dans les clous que tu sèmes derrière ton dos 
Qui me transforme en statue de plaies sur laquelle tu jettes du sel 
Et tu disparais dans l'aveuglante douleur 
Et ce seront les sentiments d'un autre qui courront sur ta peau 
Comme un jeu de chien fou 
Ce seront ces mots que tu engouffreras 
Ses mains d'or et de satin ton favori butin 
Tu lui prendras tout ce qu'il a, tu y prendras plaisir 
Et lui dans le mutisme de l'échec, il ne pourras pas me dire 
Qui tu étais cette fois-ci 

De quelle facon tu prétendais tes envies 
Et de son coeur écrasé s'échapperont les milles questions 
Qui rejoindront les miennes dans le ruisseau 
Et tu iras d'un bond tranquille secouer d'autre mers, d'autre iles 

Changeant de couleur au gré du courant 
Te faisant rétif récif tu t'amarres de tristes épaves 
Que tu abandonnes la tripe à vif découpée par ton sillage 
Sans meme le radeau d'un mot gentil 
Et abordant d'autres rivages qui seras-tu cette fois-ci 
Pousseras-tu les memes cris, saura-t-il s'en amuser comme tant d'autres 
Se fera-t-il abuser du flot de tes jouissances 
De laquelle de tes révolutions seras-tu le fer de lance 
Sera-t-il transpercé de ton indépendance 
De quelle dorure peindras-tu ton coeur 
De quel déguisement habilleras-tu tes sentiments 
Ne lui laisseras-tu comme vague odeur que celle fétide d'un lendemain de fete 
Une fete que toi tu t'es faite 
Mais que lui ca lui aura fait perdre la tete 

Tu joues seulement pour gagner 
Tu joues toute seule",Pour Gagner,2000
Mano Solo,"Take a walk down memory lane and see where the path might lead you
Familiar things do change but in our minds they stay the same 
I can hear the voice of my Momma calling out her children's names.
She say come on in it's dinner time 
Let me help my babies fix their plates 
 
We all have memories we should not forget 
times that become part of our life 
A person so heart-felt 
When I think of you instantly I get sentimental thoughts
I get sentimental 
We were holding hands walking through the park 
It seems like yesterday 
It felt so good to be in love but our age got in the way 
I still feel the warmth of your arms 
I feel you on my face when I reminisce 
I think of this 'cause what I miss is you.
 
We all have memories we should not forget 
times that become part of our life 
A person so heart-felt 
When I think of you instantly I get sentimental thoughts
I get sentimental 
wonderful that's what you are unforgettable
You know my heart won't let me go.
Love-able 
So love-able
I get emotional when I think of your love
 
Sentimental thoughts of moments 
Captured in our minds as we grow up
Things in life do change for us, but
Memories stay the same.
Loved ones in our lives are important
Never take for granted someone
Spend some time while they're around.
 
We all have memories we should not forget 
times that become part of our life 
A person so heart-felt 
When I think of you instantly I get sentimental thoughts
I get sentimental 
wonderful that's what you are unforgetable
You know my heart won't let me go.
Love-able 
So love-able
I get emotional when I think of your love",Sentiments,2005
Manoella Torres,"Acéptame como soy 
José María Napoleón 

Te acepto como eres 
Con tu más grave error 
Con todos mis defectos 
Acéptame como soy 

Te acepto como eres 
Acéptame como soy 
Te amo a pesar de todo 
A tu pesar sé mi amor 

No hay nadie perfecto amor

El amor es imperfecto 
Lo perfecto es inhumano 

No hay nada que hacer amor 
Si me quieres dar la mano 
Acéptame como soy 
O vivamos separados 

Te acepto como eres 
Y a veces duele tu amor 
Me hieren tus reproches 
Lastimas mi corazón 

Yo tengo mis momentos 
Pero es más todo mi amor 
Te acepto como eres 
Acéptame como soy 

No hay nadie perfecto amor

Manoella Torres,"Quieres saber si un día yo podré olvidarte
Nunca mi amor, nunca mi amor

También querrás saber si yo te he sido infiel
Nunca mi amor, nunca mi amor

No sé que te hace pensar que mi amor dejará de existir
Por tí

Nunca mi amor, nunca mi amor

No sé que te hace pensar que mi amor dejará de existir
Por tí

No cambiaré de parecer sobre tu gran amor

Manoella Torres,"Ya que mas da, que me dejes que importa ya
Que me dejes ya e da igual si tu nunca me has querido
Ya que mas da, que te vayas lejos de mi
Y que me olvides, yo se muy bien
Si tu nucna me has querido

Tu no mereces que llore por ti
Ya conoci la tristeza de estar viviendo
Junto, a tu lado
Yo no ye guardo si queda rencor
Indiferencia es lo unico que ahora yo siento
Que te has marchado

Ya que mas da, que me dejes que importa ya
Que me dejes ya e da igual si tu nunca me has querido
Ya que mas da, que te vayas lejos de mi
Y que me olvides, yo se muy bien
Si tu nucna me has querido

Tu no mereces que llore por ti
Ya conoci la tristeza de estar viviendo
Junto, a tu lado
Yo no ye guardo si queda rencor
Indiferencia es lo unico que ahora yo siento
Que te has marchado

Indiferencia es lo unico que ahora yo siento
Que te has marchado
