Monks of Doom,"Rainy day blues on a Sunday 
Finding a means to my end
These are the blues that I feel on Monday
When I find myself drunk again

Give me salvation on Sunday
Fill my heart with corporate death
When the Devil speaks I will bite my tongue
When God talks I'll hold my breath

But you just can't escape what's been told you
No, the second coming hasn't happened yet
No, the ways of the world don't reassure you
I really cannot see a better bet",Blues on Sunday,1988
Monks of Doom,"Turn up the music way up loud
Dress yourself up in a shroud
The crayon fabric colors stains
... into buckets filled with rain

And dance the dance of summer's lost
And forget time and forget names
They'll have to run away someday not to come back
So they say

And if you were 
I saw you laughing with the animals today
I couldn't understand a single word you said
Each time we talk we turn the conversation black
Each time we talk we always get lost in the facts

And if you were to fall from grace
I'd have a picture of your face
Those colored laughing there at me
Tell me your histories

And if you had to leave this place
And if you vanished without trace
Completely barred straight from my mind
Bad memories left behind",Fall from Grace,1988
Monks of Doom,"On my relatively blank memory
All photographs leave scars
Of your insect inspiration
In the ice formed on my windows
Memories here are conjured up
Still inside they turn me up
And leave me feeling
Survival here is not enough

Like a spirit he remembers
Longer than your lifetime
Further than your mind can see
And further than your heart can heal

I cross a wander wall from east to west
Declare myself a king
A gesture that would have no meaning",The Haunting of An Eastern Man's Mind,1988

Monks of Doom,"When your final last exit comes home to haunt you
I'm feeling like I never felt before
I've surrounded myself with loose poets and creatures
And I feel like I don't need anything more

Won't you please save me from myself
I'm not scared of anyone else
Life creates havoc
And as luck would have it
I'm tired of living in hell

When your final last exit comes home to haunt you
And your visions of excess have all gone to seed
Well I said that I love you but I spoke without thinking
'Cause decisions I make have no way of keeping

Won't you please save me from myself
I'm not scared of anyone else
Life creates havoc
And as luck would have it
I'm tired of living in hell",Save Me from Myself,1988
Monks of Doom,"Paint a picture, let it dry
Check your thoughts and speak now of us
Look how you worry, pacing all around the place
Feel now the intuition in the air
[dreaming] thoughts, they move us so well

It is a penny for your thoughts my boy
Tell me all that you know
You curious colorful creature, won't you show

From day to day
When you live and you wake
The ... of tawdry ...

Like a fatal mistake
Indecision is a razor
All in good time we throw our options out the window
All in good time we go driving off the road

Pain and fury, tension ...
Balance, glory, triumph and pain
... the poetry of memory
You know that everything we had was real
Drifting away and still gaining speed

It is a quarter for your dream old man
Knowing all that you know
... the place the world has left you
Fighting for your hopes that fade away",All in Good Time,1989
Monks of Doom,"Swell surging forwards
Eroding the land
A test of your patience
A test of your hands

The presence of angels
A pall of thick smoke
On this table spill memories
Deceptions and jokes

Down on this beach
From the Irish Sea
The Lusitanian
Goes ...

Memories come back to you
From faces on walls
The faces of friends
That might have lied to us all 

Visions of yesterday
Go back through the years
Back to creation
With the exception of fear

Down on this beach
From the cold North sea
The ghosts of ... land
Sing out to me

Down on this beach
From the Baltic Sea
We will dance on islands
Like we are diseased

Down on the sand will come a thought that will mark
A place in your conscience, a scratch in your heart
Hope here is random, survival is sure
Your transcendence expected, so be reassured",The Beach of Deception,1989
Monks of Doom,"Laughter on his breath
The smell of fish clandestine hits
The thief he will aspire
To take the piece that he desires

Contempt for the rest
Know his past and second guess
Still it's on his shirt
The telltale signs with which he flirts

And it's on the radio today
Ringing in your ears it's in the way

He won't be coming out today
From the void into the fray
From a broken egg the storm is born today 

Eyes blind with rage
The deep caress of hell to pay 

She is all the world to all of me
She is fascination clandestine

She is burning now
Brilliant flames from off the bow
He is on the deck
Sailing towards untouched points west

She will return
Deep within our veins
We'll add it to our tab and wash away 

She is now omnipotent to me
Everywhere in all I think and see
And it's on the radio today
Ringing in your ears it's in the way

I wonder what she'd say
But her face is just a memory
And she hasn't got the New York Times to read
If May could see today

If May could speak today
I know just what she's say
To lots of folks you may be a saint
But a death threat still makes you feel faint

If May could speak today
But the worms just eat away
What May was yesterday",Broadcast at Midday,1989
Monks of Doom,"Lost in a paperback rain
Picking through books that you won't read again
Keeping your promises vague
Lost in the crowd in the circus parade

Keeping your Polaroids dry
Delirious fevers burn night after night
The cryptic malaise that you're in
The art that may come of it I'd recommend

To focus attention on books you might write
Ripped off from diaries, kept out of sight
The evidence you hide

Keeping your bed warm at night
It's not an illusion it glows very bright
With the young coal the fire is fed
Who you keep with you is best left unsaid

On finding particular friends
Remember that all moral fiber will bend
To put them in letters you burn as you write
Seen in reflections and not with your eyes
Cultivating lies",The Evidence You Hide,1989
Monks of Doom,"I was cross-eyed, stoned and painless
My pulse was up my eyes were red
My visions, situations, feelings
Hung on my lips and burned me up
And 18 hours spent asleep
Could not help me from thinking that
I had somehow managed to fool myself
I had missed the point while puttin' 'em back 

I can't help from thinking
As my heart keeps beating
Of what I'd love to do
To strip the flesh that hides these bones
Bare my soul without a sound
Burn my brain, lay waste to fear
Though I won't live that many years
And I can't shed that many tears

Claustrophobic, paranoid
Laughing at my routine cares
The charade of my brilliant life
Had drawn a crowd these last few years
As I entertain my audience,
The stage was torn by all I knew
Who took me to the moon above
Wrapped my soul in linen cloth 

I can't help from thinking
As my heart keeps beating
If I was Jesus Christ
And all the things I'd love to know
Why I feel the way I do,
And what it means to be alive
And make yourself a sacrifice
To never have to live a lie 

You take yourself so seriously
You're dressed in black but your soul is green
You've got an understanding of the world
That's only based on what you've seen 
And if you'd just admit to yourself
That it's not such an awful place
The grim facade that hides your mind
May yet reveal a smiling face 

I can't help from thinking
As my heart keeps beating
Of what I'd love to do
Locked away just me and you
If you can only see me through
And see what we could make it to
Forget the things that need no proof
And see the world with eyes of fools",Taste of Tendon,1989
Monks of Doom,"Trapped
A game of roulette
A marble and wheel
Revolver and steel
While down on his luck
A grimacing drunk
He spins on his axis
On top of the table
Espousing his views

Displaced of its day

Long streets I know very well
Wandering aimlessly, wavering endlessly
Leaving today for the next town that gets in the way

Trapped
By fear in my voice
I struggle to speak
I struggle to reach
That tone in your voice
The onset of fear
It spins like the world
As is everything near
Just from breathing the air

Trapped by my point of view
Locked in a waiting room where we are smothered desire
Lost in a notebook who's heartstrings sing out to you

Monks of Doom,"The surgeon was at the table
With his hands on a rusty saw

I am the rattle in the halls

From the west into the east

Monks of Doom,"What has become of Millicent Frastley?
Is there any hope that she is still alive?
Why haven't they found her?
It's rather ghastly to think the little child was not yet five

What has become of Millicent Frastley?
Last seen alone playing at the edge of the park
There was no one with her to keep her from straying away
And she wandered off into the oncoming dark

A silent and glittering black motor drew up
To where she sat nibbling grass
And an arm with two elbows then held out a tin filled with cinnamon balls
And beckoned the youngster in

What has become of Millicent Frastley?
Old feelings of horror, resentment and pity
Things which so seldom turn out for the best
As the last of the light died out in the west
The car unobserved sped away from the city

The Frastleys grew sick with apprehension
Which a heavy tea only increased
Though they felt it was scarcely genteel to mention the loss of the child
They phoned in the police

Police with their truncheons and notebooks descended
On the haunts of the underworld
In spite of their efforts, they ended with nothing
They could not find the girl

The car after hours and hours of travel
Arrived at a gate in an endless wall
It pulled up the drive and stopped on the gravel
At the foot of a vast and crumbling hall

And hope started to languish
It soon was replaced by all manner of fear
The family twisted their fingers in anguish
And got them all damp with the flow of their tears

The child was removed to a ballroom whose hangings
And mirrors were streaked with a luminous slime
They leapt through the air with their buzzings and twangings
To work themselves up to their ritual crime

And you always down to jack a bitch for her ride
Or the colors that you rep make others upset

Never once been seen alone
Ever since you can remember you was fully grown
Slangin' rocks on tha block with a knot in ya sock
Then you might be
Gang related! murder rap
Notches all in your belt
Robbery and sellin'
Trees the only jobs that you held
Been to more damn funerals than the reverend himself
Then you might be

With no thought of graduation or a fuckin' degree
Still clockin' ""g""s from what you learned on tha streets

Did your crew's name originate in Illinois?
Do you cross your enemies out with a ""k""
Then you gang related to muthafucka like Violent J

I'm always asked if I'm gang related
By police and the public and I'm startin' to hate it
If I wasn't already that would sure make me think
About the problems that I have and what I'd do to be free
Besides gang related's such a harsh word
For them to call a bunch of homies takin' over tha world
Willin' to die for everything that we built
The battleground we call turf where haters come to be killed

Take anybody killa
I know him but I wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him
He's fuckin' crazy as hell
You wouldn't know
Right now he's chewin' holes in the floor here at the studio
I don't even want to do this
But he asked me to and I'm scared of his pistol-whips
We're all sick in the hatchet's hatchery
But I just happen to be the master bitch-slappery
The bottom line, I won't say it again until you play it again
If you're gang related hope you're my friend
'cause if I see you wearin' some shit I don't like
I'm shuttin' your cranium down with a lead pipe

[Monoxide]
It was me, my brother, and my mom and pops,
Just standing on the porch we heard shots.
Somebody start tripping in the front of my house,
And start blasting at anybody walking around.
I got shoved to the ground, And he got shot when he ran.
Before the cops could even come, I knew my life began.
I was only seven when this all went down,
But I was 7 mile when we stopped moving around.
In the beginning it was different, but everything was cool,
Than it all started to change back in highschool.
Wrong Crowd, That was me.
In a pair of moon boots and some dungarees.
Gettin chased out of school by some thugs and thieves,
Until I had to start bringin' a piece to walk me.
This is how it was, and forever will be.
Known as a look into my history.

You don't want to, see me.

Now I'm 16 and I'm addicted to chicks.
And the only thing on my mind is which one will I get,
I'm so sick with it, that my mom's ashamed.
Cause every other day, it's a different game, a different name,
But the drama's the same, enough to drive me insane
Or better yet drive down the wrong way, down the wrong lane.
Before the fame or change changed the charm,
I was hittin' dime pieces before the tats on my arm.
Dropped out, 'cause me and school didn't fit,
Instead of hittin' tha books, I'd rather hit this bitch.
Plus if I didn't stop, I'd probably get shot,
'Cause I'll be damned if I'm about to keep runnin' all of these blocks.
Cross that out, I'd rather learn from the street,
Instead of just goin' to high school, to get my ass beat.
This is how it was, and forever will be,
Known as a, look into my history.

You don't want to, see me.
Y'all don't really wanna test me.

Parents trip, and I gotta get out,
All I do is sit around, and fuck chicks in a house,
And I got, no drive, and I'm almost twenty.
No job, but I got chickens a-plenty.
And I got one of 'em pregnant, From there we went to court.
Now I'm twenty two years old, paying child support.
This is just a couple of stories before we met.
And maybe now you can see why I'm a little upset.
You forget that I'm as human as you,
But you can really only know me by the music I do.
I don't hold it against, or no taking offense,
I'm just showing the other side of my fence

Monoxide Child,"On my last day,
When they call out my name
You can trust me, it all gonna' change.
It seems strange when I put it this way,
But I was always good at writin' what I really wanna' say,
I can't face the face with the fact that you left and your never commin' back
Hopin that I'd fall flat on my face
But the real disgrace
Is that you hide my daughter
From hell or high water
I guess it was all just a big lie
When you took her away I wanted to die
Why, why, why?
Is there a reason why you did all this?
Or was it all just a way to a little
Bitch [sample]
I can't believe that you would lie to her
All these years of makin' her think that I had just dissappeared
And even though I know we hate eachother
I would never try to keep her from her mother.
I really wanna' change my ways,
But I can only change so much.
Have you no choice that you abuse to change this crush into my life
I might look strange today,
So strange in a good way,
Don't wanna' go through it again,
Don't wanna' pretend that it never did happen,
I've really changed a lot over time,
And a lot of people hear it in the rhyme.
I used to live a life of crime,
Only crime was the struggle of tryin' to find
Where I fit in with the hustle
Had to tussle with the block a coupple times
And I thought it would double because I was always in trouble
But I knew I had to change my ways,
Or I probly wouldn't be standin' here today.
Wasn't sure at the time what I was doin,
Was so blind but I tried to do it.
Now I see a little bit of change really saved my life
An' gave me this to write
I really wanna' change my ways,
But I can only change so much.
Have you no choice that you abuse to change this crush into my life
I might look strange today,
So strange in a good way,
Don't wanna' go through it again,
Don't wanna' pretend that it never did happen,
Hard times I grew up in,
And the weed, yeah it's true I hit it,
I can freely admit it,
Did a lot that I knew I shouldn't
Had to stop when the cops started shoven' a pushin'
In the burbs now,
Still I get herbed out,
Early in the mornin' while yer goin' off to work now.
My situation, what I'm facin' all these changes could be wastin' away.
My situation, what I'm facin' all these changes could be wastin' away.
My situation, what I'm facin' all these changes could be wastin' away.

But I can only change so much.

As they Kneel beside my coffin family say their last goodbyes
But ita the faces of my babies got me trippin' thankin' god for breath
Expressions filled with pain has got me strappin' on the vest
And I know that I ain't living right I hang on borrowed time
And this life's gone leave them bastards cause they pops has got to grind
Little mouths have got to eat so I hug them hit the streets 
Spittin' time with them and money got me feelin' incomplete
And I ain't scared of any motherfucker fight the flames of hell
But a child without his dad has got me hiding in my shell 
Got me shikin' in my boots to see them face this world alone 
Are the strong enough to cope stuck in half a fuckin' home
As I lay them down to sleep its all on me their soul to keep 
And if I die before I wake I pray to 
God he's up there waitin'
With an army full of angels strapped with gats cause 
I'm defying
Since I first became o father only fear I have is dying

And all that you will ever see for life 
Death beyond the grave
How will they remember me
I only fear the lost of my voice
When its gone 
The only noise is the pen 
I'm a writer by choice
I can cut my tongue clean off
And smoke myself toothless
I still be on the mic 
Spittin' shit they call ruthless
The truth is 
I go deaf dumb and blind in one ear
And be the dopes deaf dumb blind guy you ever hear
I ain't scared of dyin

My return ain't bull ain't no reincarnation

Eyes open but I don't remember much
I try to focus but the light is bright as fuck
I go to sit up but I'm strapped and stuck
Stuck panic can't say nothin'
Like my jaw is wired shut
How the fuck did get to where I am is still a mystery
My memories not assistin' me
As I lay here in misery 
Literally hopin' some body would give me some kind of time
I'm I dead of alive 
Is this a dream or a sign
Is there a chance I can find my mind and rewind
But paint me behind blinds and find somethin'
Its like a game but nobody told me we were playin'
And the fact that I don't know if I'm alive and sane
And inside my brain only one thing remains
The fear of no knowing paralyzes all most everthin'
An second can be my last breath
And my best guess is nothin' with on memories left
I'm sorry

Sometimes I might even cut my t-shirt up
My hair changes depending oh how I feel

You see me round rockin' every label
They say 
""I got it""
But tonight ""the drinks on me""

My money don't define the type of girl I am

Tell me baby!

Tell me what's your definition of a woman
Think twice before you go round labeling me I'm not your typical superficial Princess
What do you see when you look at me?

Strip away all these things and see what lies beneath
It'll make it so much easier than you think

If you'd just open your eyes, stop trying then realize
All the pieces are here
Just seek you will find

When you look at me
When you look at me

Can you see me!

There are times when you feel
That you don't know where you fit in
So, you hide what is real
Even when it hurts to pretend
To be the one that you think
Everybody wants you to be
No one sees

The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
'Cause nothing needs to change
Sometimes it might seem hard
And your whole world falls apart
Just know that you when you feel that way

Even heaven cries, everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid of what you feel inside
It's alright 'cause even heaven cries

When you look in the mirror
And you don't see picture perfect
What they say breaks your heart
And makes you feel that you're not worth it
What if this fear hides in tears
Still play and make believe
So no one sees

The one you really are
But you don't have to hide your heart
'Cause nothing needs to end every way
Sometimes it might seem hard
Your whole world falls apart
Just know that you when you hear the rain

Even heaven cries everybody cries
It's okay to doubt yourself sometimes
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you feel inside
It's alright, it's alright

No you're not alone don't be ashamed

I try my best and thank the lord 
I´m blessed everyday
And though I've had my share of highs, it made me realize
That nothing ever comes for free
All I do is try and make the most of being me
But sometimes you get to the point
Where you just can´t go on and 
It feels like the end of the road
But if you keep going round
With your head in the clouds 
will you see what´s right under your nose?

And if it´s never gonna be
Don´t try to hold on
See everybody has a dream
That doesn't seem to go right
You´re not the only one who hurts
There´s people going through so much worse
And still I try, to live my life and get by

Everybody thinks they know how life should go
But nothing ever goes to plan
All we seem to do is wait around for something more
And though I've been just where 
You've been I tried to chase a dream
I've watched it crumble to the ground
That I´m still standing stronger than I ever have before
So you should keep moving on
Till you know that it´s right when it is you´ll know from the inside

Everyday all I do
Is never quite enough
And in every way, I can say
I've been close to giving up
If I wanted to I could be
Anything I wanna be
It´s taken time for me to realize
That dreams ain't always what they seem

So if it´s never gonna be
Don´t try to hold on
See everybody has a dream
That doesn't seem to go right
You´re not the only one who hurts

Or is this the final curtain call?

A flower always dies
I never felt the beauty
Why can't I see through other people's eyes?

It leaves me wanting more

I've got everything

So why do I still feel
Like my life's so incomplete
You made me beautiful
You brought me to my knees

Staring at an empty chair
Kidding myself you're there
You can't live in the past
It'll only make you mad
Everybody It'll take all you have

When your heart is like a shadow
Of someone you used to know
And it's time to let it go

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
Tomorrow is another day
You won't feel the same inside
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
And you don't have to have the reason why
Everybody makes mistakes

Why do I make hard
Harder than I needs to be
Nothing ever seems easy
There is no point looking down
Everybody scared of heights
But really fear is just a state of mind

If your hearts like a shadow
Of someone you used to know
Maybe try and let it go

Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
Tomorrow is another day
You won't feel the same inside
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody gets it wrong sometimes
And you don't have to have the reason why

No one can be what you need all the time
It just don't happen like
Things that we say
Games that we play
They can tear us all apart

I give my heart

If it's only for a minute you hold them
Some moments are golden

How many mountains I must climb
Not counting the wrong turns that I take
I'm gonna get there some how some time

That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre
That's what we are
We all want a love bizarre

The moon up above, it shines down upon our skin
Whispering words that scream of outrageous sin
We all want the stuff that's found in our wildest dreams
It gets kinda rough in the back of our limousine

For loneliness

I was proud
Such a fool
And now I'm comparing everyone to
You
It's a lie
That extraordinary love could happen twice
Let me say
If you ask me back I wouldn't hesitate
When you left you left me stained

So I tried
To erase all trace of emptiness stuck on me
But it remains

And even when I want to cover up
Layer after layer it is showing through
Something tells me I should give it up

Can't help I'm the type to get what I want

Monrose,"We were inseparable, somehow invincible
The way you touch me deep inside left me beyond insatiable
There was no one ever
You were irreplaceable

Hit by reality, I felt my whole world freeze
Suddenly the phone ring and I dropped right down onto my knees
Choking, breaking
The clouds came over me

You left me here without goodbye
Now I can't even find a way through the light
Stolen, stolen
Is there nothing left living for?
'Cause I can't even breath enough to cry no more
Stolen, stolen

You're everywhere I go, deep printed in my soul
I can see you, hear you, feel you, smell you, like you're still at home
Sleeping beside me
I've really lost control

What am I suppose to do, I can't escape the truth
Everything reminds me of the fact that I can't be with you

The sound of your voice, gone!
The look in your eyes when we used to make love, stolen, gone!

The fun and the fights, gone!
We laughed and we cried, gone!

Stolen from me, left with just a memory
Taken from me, I miss you every heartbeat

Monsieur Adi,"Mmm, da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Every day when I wake up
Tryna read my fortune on the bottom of my coffee cup
But it seems like I never finish
It's always half full, or is it half empty?
Maybe it's my own superstition or a kind of self protection
If it all looks bad, why would I wanna look ahead?
Oh, oh, oh, still sittin' here
Just watching the sun go down, (down), down, (down), down

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?
(Ha yeah, who really cares?)

Every conversation gets me high on motivation
Gets me craving of your own familiar situation *yeah)
Reach the unreachable, achieve the unbelievable
In the midst of all the madness, remember life's beautiful
Still I'm feeling restless, thinking I should rest less
Work more, play hard, ready for the encore
Is this the kinda life I really wanna live for? (two times)
In my heart I know, less is more (more)
More (more) more, more, more

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?

It's time to take this out of my hands
Is it all gonna be worth it in the end?
'Cause it's safe here in my comfort zone
Never stray too far from home (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But then again this way I'll never know, never know
Maybe I should go

Go crazy, go insane, go for everything
Get the money, dollar bills in your wallet, say ka-ching
Sign the dealy, make a mili, sound famili?
The urgency is sounding the drilly for the ma-milli
And then they really talk in Braille, actin' chilly
They got me feelin' like an achilles, silly, silly, I mean, really?
Really, really, really really though?
Really, really, really though?
Feel the vibration of the higher ground
Love always leads to the highest sound
Many conversations, people makin' speculations
As to my procrastination due to my revelations
And then they get fugazi
You call yourself a rider
You need to speed your loyalty up like Bugatti
Baby don't underestimate my underdog mentality
We 'bout to race ahead, ambition on Ferrari

Life goes on with or without you
It's up to you what you're gonna do
You could go or you could stay
Who cares anyway?
Life goes on with or without you
Damn it baby, what you're gonna do?
You could go or you could stay
But who cares anyway?

qui ne peut être que toi
on peut être fort toute sa vie

son feu s’est éteint mais pas le tien
avoir fait de son mieux pour hériter du pire

de l’appétit sans faim de l’amour

j’ai cru qu’elle le voulait aussi
mais ses yeux ne me voyaient plus 
même quand je lui faisais la cour
avec l’appétit sans faim de l’amour

mais elle a eu peur de ma peine
l’envie folle qu’on ne ressent plus
et qui revient par l’arrière cour
comme l’appétit sans faim de l’amour

qu’on peut perdre la guerre sans se rendre

Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote 
Pero el amor se escapa, aunque yo te mienta 
Yo estaba buscándote, sola aquí esperándote 

Y tú, mirándome sin hablar 
Y yo, hablándote sin mirar 
Y tú, no sé lo que estás sintiendo 
Pero yo me estoy muriendo 
No aguanto más 

Bailar contigo, y perdernos ésta noche 
Bailar contigo, sin que importe nadie más 
Bailar contigo, en la arena y los tambores 
Tienes la llama que enciende mi alma y nos hace volar 

Vivo imaginándote, sólo imaginándote 
Vivo imaginándote 

El mar de tu piel, quiero navegar 
Perderme en las olas contigo 
Bailando en las olas contigo 

Un barco de papel, te quiero regalar 
Para que vengas conmigo 
Bailando en las olas conmigo 

Y tú, mirándome sin hablar 
Y yo, hablándote sin mirar 
Y tú, ya sé lo que estás sintiendo

Todas se derriten sobre el mar 
Espuma sobre el mar 

Sigo caminando tras tus huellas 
Y aunque se derriten en el mar 
Yo te voy a encontrar

Monsieur Perine,"Cascabeles al viento, van girando al compás
Del sutil movimiento de la brisa al cantar
Estos versos celosos de la lluvia y el mar
Que cubrieron el tiempo de encanto tropical

Con el alma salvaje, caminando aprendí
Que con poco equipaje puedo andar por ahí
Y llegar a lugares y contar lo que soy
Soy montaña, soy valle y del río mi voz

Soy América hermana, caña mambe y ambil
Tengo sangre mulata y mi tierra es así
Una voz que no calla, poesía ancestral
Orgullosa gitana, de encanto tropical

De encanto tropical, tiene el color de la mañana
Encanto tropical, bajo la sombra del palmar
Encanto tropical, dulce misterio que me atrapa
Encanto tropical, entre recuerdos de agua y sal

De la rima violenta, de una ola nací
De corales y flores, la piel me vestí
En mi pelo el aroma, que dejó el cafetal
Va perfumando el cielo de mi tierra natal

Soy América hermana, selva playa y raíz
Una voz libertaria, que no sabe morir
Y aunque muchos quisieran, no lo puedo ocultar
Por que llevo en el alma, encanto tropical

De encanto tropical, tiene el color de la mañana
Encanto tropical, bajo la sombra del palmar
Encanto tropical, dulce misterio que me atrapa
Encanto tropical, entre recuerdos de agua y sal

Encanto tropical

I make my first stop at my homeboys ranch 
I ask him ""what's in the bag"" he says ""two acres of plants
It's easy going in but hell gettin out
I want to make this paper and I think I know how
surprise surprise I done made it back home
in an ice cream truck ""who want to buy a snow cone""
  
Hook - repeat 2X

I'm going to the valley
Vauco the valley
I'm goin to the valley what you think fo
  
[4] - From Texas to Cali we get our ye from the valley
We be hustlin on blocks moving in and out the alley
We call it medicine that's what you need when you get sick
Sometimes it's hard rock sometimes it's white pearl brick
Across, across the state line just me and my girlfriend
From powder to pine I got money on my mind
Stop wasting all my time and get me over to the spot
Unload all the cargo and meet me at the docks
  
[5] - Going back to the valley staying on top of my game
Meeting up wit my bitches snow white and mary jane
Only thing that ever mattered to me 
Stacking dollars shit we making a week
Who the cowards who the killas who's the niggas wit scrilla
Felt all up in they pockets rocking fo' niggas that try to kill us
Then maybe later you bitches bother me 
You wanted to pay you too late don't bother calling me
  
[6] - Going to the valley fo' soldiers in a caddy 
And in the back of the caddy got fifty pound of smally
Tryed to jack but can't catch me
I just keep that paper stacking
Always packin never slacking 
leaving you hoe ass niggas unhappy
Chopping burs when able, fucking hoes on the table
Watching cable in a Sable, Dope House is the label
Selling em three for ten to my closest friends
Rolling back to H-towm big body Benz
  
hook
  
[7] - Houston Texas cowboy wit a dime and a fiesta saddle
And I'm moving mo weight then a whole herd of cattle
I grip up the grain blowing up the panhandle
mobile phone on scramble cause rap hustlin is a gamble
Brick moving these H dudes gonna keep you grooving pursuing
Shit, hell on my surella ice water lyrical good fella
SPM got the hook up, say watch out 
I hit the highway, let twenkies crawl
I'm going to the valley
  
[8] - Man I'm flipping up to Mexico to hit some licks
In a Navigator bus bringing back some bricks
Get to checkpoint now I'm past the border
tell my guy alemar to play some more
Fat money cause we in the mix
I got that white girl and that stinky bitch
Better ryders and roamers can't really ask 
""We going out T?"" ""Bitch I'm headed to the valley
So I'm out about to make some money
Pull up to a trailor wit about 800
Unload it I flip it get paid let's ride
Chunk a deuce to the guys and I'm back to Southside
Cruisin wit a couple of pines
Trying hard as hell to make it back to H-Town
Flippin but only make one stop
Then I'm buring out moving shit to a dope house
  
[9] - Cruisin to the valley checking up on me campos
Make thirty calls so I can wire free samples
Get me a plane so I can make my drops
Flying real low to avoid the cops
Weighing my weed on a digital beam
Wrapping it in a plastic quick so I can make my green
My windows are tinted so nobody sees in it
Wit mary jane and snow white the sky's the limit
  
Hook

[10] - My package is small, stack em in the entire wall
Fuck the chotha must be loca
Everything a nigga want make it to the border wit the motha
Pockets rising better quit sizing me up
But these coffe beans fucking the smell up
What's up, back in the city 
de bull lada I'm talking pronto
Call me the head honcho start a new revloution
like a back poncho 
He yah see yah wouldn't want to be yah
Gots to flee, start the G
Switch the ride I'm headed back to the valley

They way that we roll down south
Start baby wit dope house josie wells gonna 
there ain't nuthin funna then being and outlaw runna

Dope game juggla, no nuts no glory
Real mobsters, they never worry

Thinking of my profits going to the valley 
It's all cavi
  
[12] - I'm flipping to the valley federalies
Fucking wit michael decodie motorcycles
?? cruises my disciples 
I'm the type to crew smoke two and synas
wit my G's I'll hunt you

parlaying down in the valley

[13] - I'm a creep 59
to the end of the rainbow land of the llello
Dope fiends on my payroll, got rocks to blow
behind the stop and go they holla 
goodness graious great balls of snow
Don't speed or trip when you see the lights
cause they can tell you're nervous just by looking in your eyes
in H-Town the business in booming
but it won't last long if you don't know what you're doing

Got me creepin for mi ruka and my boys blowing swishas

L be's moving by the ton
Packed up in tanks under the trunk, 59 to 77 
Collecting my lot not even sweating, back on 35

You know me your boy O-Z
Never left lonely wit out my G see
One trip cocks a flip

The currency connect from Houston to the valley

I couldn't find a way to say no
I took a check on all the meters in my room
I kicked the dog and said let's go
The clouds were hanging low above the path
I had my arm around a sundown
I pinned my baby into yanking Satan's crank
Bum deals with a thin smile, oh yeah

Pushin' up and pushin' down against the sky
Like there's muscles 'round my torso
Fourth dimension of smiles, strokes and knives

You got veins of iron, baby
Oh man this egg is way too hot
Lay on a rock and split open, oh yeah

All the lies I tell myself
There are ? coming on now
Like it's screwed itself in hell
You gotta go where this is headed
Kiss the sun to be alive
I'm a king ?
? burn my eyes

Looked pretty horny if I do say

The mountain screamed three times today

To fry a peak and melt away 
Launching titan's breath on mine

Well he walks up and he walks on down 
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep 
And it's waiting to take you away now

He's hooked up down to Mexico

Sometimes I think this pig will just explode
Sometimes I hope this torture just goes on
Well I'll stuff myself in a pi of darkness
And I'll slam 'till I can't see home

Would you like to hope for Eden, that I keep a steady hand
Do you want to milk the syrup of a thousand year old man
Shall we fuck each other's babies, let momentum do its best
Keep our shrieking little urges in our burned out little heads
Well I sense a slight recoil was it something that I said

Sometimes I think this pig will just explode
Sometimes I hope this torture just goes on
Well I'll stuff myself in a pi of darkness
And I'll slam 'till I can't see home
Dropping off the edge of nowhere
Everything I've ever known

Now this is what you'll get

Either you with me or against me punk hit 'em up
Provide housin' for these shrimp from the shells we dump
I'm makin' 'em bounce other niggas fail to bump
Til we takin' advantage of inflicting irreversable damage
It's the long awaited anticipated Likwit MC
Bombin' first 'cause I feel it's better to give then receive
You better believe, Xzibit stays savage above the average
When niggas try to switch turn bitch for the cup of tea
But all that's irrelevant it's like tryin' to turn a whore celibate
I dance with the devil for the hell of it
Burning down your lavish landscape on digital tape
'Cause everything you rhymin' about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?

Niggas are null and void I get swole like a Keloid
To overload your system with rhymes for millenniums
To shut down artists with beats the deep closure
Battlin' top rank for bank and exposure
So open up your door to me
'Cause if it's closed I'm a breakin' in with some pantyhose
Over the mic so you don't know who I sound like
Executing those who record and bite to sound tight
It's not permitted by the right
The Gustopo surprising these niggas like Benny Blanco
Remember me man? You thought I was a fan
Till I threw you in the back of a van
Yo these Drop Squad delegates rhymes are delicate
I spit on the mic to get these MC's pussys wet
For those with plans to clone me
The original it can't be done I'm digital (digital)

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yo who wanna come see the hard rock?
The non stop grid block yo whole block receive speed knot
You need not, get brave my bullets never graze
They hit close to home separating flesh from bone
So better get off on your own bitch
Rollin' chrome shit tryin' to own shit, I was moulded
After the best that the streets had to offer
The author of my own destiny so I suggest you stop stressin' me
I'll find out when I pull my nine out and blow your mind out
Play a deadly game with no fouls and no time outs
Inhale large amounts of dojah forever ready like a soldier
I'm lock mode and shoot from the shoulder
And burn down your lavish landscape digital tape
'Cause everything you rhyme about is actually fake
So make room for the legitimate nasty inconsiderate
Thinkin' you rankin' top dollar but really counterfeit

I don't want niggas soundin' like me
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't want niggas soundin' like me, you know what I'm sayin'?
On no album, you know what I'm sayin'",Nobody Sound Like Me,1998

Looking all over
You're searching and you're trying to find it
You don't know what it is, god is gonna show you

Is there anyway that i can be saved? (i'll say yes)

And i'm willing
To go all the way

Trying to find what's really real

But him and buddha can't save your soul

It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When the world say no
You'll still hear montell, when he says (i'll say yes)
When i'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(i'll say yes)
Even then, he'll make everything alright (i'll say yes)
I want to testify

All of my life, i'll say
Through the storming rain
You know i'll say yes
Heartache and pain
You know i'll say yes

So I'm going to seek a certain lad I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found him yet

Hes the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret
I'd like to add his initial to my monogram
Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
Someone who'll watch over me

Although he may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To my heart he carries the key
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me",Someone to Watch Over Me,2006

Montell Jordan,"Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
Don't you worry, you be strong, help you get along
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
He don't deserve a woman like you, woman you are

You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much
Till the morning he told you he was going away
He lied to you, mistreated you, he even raised his hand to you
You weathered the storm, but ended up in the rain

It's driving you crazy, you're wondering maybe
Think it's something you did wrong
You carried his baby, but now, now, now, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

You were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again, it won't be long

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you

Oh, the time has come to place all your fears aside
You owe it to yourself to give love another try
With someone who'll care for you, true to you
Make dreams realities for you, the rain is over
Just dry all the tears from your eyes

It's driving me crazy, I'm telling you, baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Take care of your baby, but na, na, na, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

Oh, baby, you were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again

I do know that sometimes circumstances

And, ""Is there anybody who can help us?""
I want you to know that God is not very far from you
Whoever you are, wherever you've been
Whatever you've done
He's right there
As close as the breath you just drew
As close as the fingers on the end of your hand
God is right there
He's everywhere
But you know, He only comes where He's invited
And when you need His help
All you've got to do is open your mouth and call out to Him
Just tell him yes

Breaking up a happy home
It's the lonely man who understands
She don't wanna be alone

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone

So I ask her if you treat her right
She don't deny that your love is tight
But sometimes she only needs a friend
When she calls on me, quarter after three
Holding pillows to the phone [Incomprehensible]
It's her lonely heart that you're tearing apart
You don't even have a clue

You don't have to be alone, baby
Anytime you cry, day or night
You'll never be alone
Use your heart as a telephone, baby
It's not too late, 'cause this must die

And it don't quit, and it don't stop
Fool we don't quit

Side, high noon clock strikes twelve that's high
I see haters trespassin' in my town
They must be sick in the head
They better be quick like Sharon Stone
And quicken their dead and quick on the draw
Western winds make the dirt gust
I still see you when you hear strikes I'ma bust
It's on, I've been holdin it down for years
Don't follow nobodies shadow (none)
A true desperado
21 guns salute when I come through
Why you sell a million copies sounds like your crew
I roll like no man, follow no man
Spittin wicked over tracks, me and see programmed
Hard, I keep comin raw, 'cause I'm hungry 
Don't sweat the industry 'cause no company are gonna own me 
That's why I stand my own ground 
and square off who ever want's to throw it down 
I bring it to the showdown

I'm a producer so they thought I would drop a compilation
Makin hard tracks spittin no conversation 
Look here, ain't no rapper feelin conversate for me 
And take it away from catitalles compersatin me 
Only my true dogs call me E A Ski punk
So when you acknowledge me put the mister in the front 
Spell it right, M-I-S-T-E-are Ski 
Composin gangsta tracks with mister see since eighty-three
You proberly heard me on Friday with Cube and Chris Tucker
Blast, I break a slow dog runnin for cover
How would I sound makin tracks if I couldn't rap
Bompin them so hard, my dogs give me def wounds
I'm wanted in four cities, Miami, New York, L.A. and Oakland 
With leavin the mic court smokin
Kick open the door, at the saloon 
Don't nobody move unless they want to throw down, here at the showdown

Pull up on the block bompin it hurts (Why)
Makin ya whole hood feel me like grill
And have your whole city high ride like George Steel
Fool you want the funk, we can bring it to the stage 
Face off like John Travltra and Nicolas Cage 
A lot of rappers calm east Oakland ain't frontin
Put them lyrically toe to toe to me and see who really run it 
And we haven't even gotta talk about the production tip 'cause on the real
None of them gonna quit
To handle my calibre this next level style combined me rhyme

Searching and looking
Looking all over
You're searching and you're trying to find it
You don't know what it is, God is gonna show you
He's gonna show you right there
What you're looking for
And all you have to do is say yes

I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes

Make sure you get this now

My friend said he needed someone
Not searching for just anyone
I recommend the name of christ
He said he didn't need him in his life
But mother's sickness, daddy's lung disease
Financial burden found him on his knees
He searched his heart and realized
Although I'm down, my soul can rise

Am I lost in sin? (I'll say yes)
Is there anyway that I can be saved? (I'll say yes)
If I run to you, will you, will you hear my cry? (I'll say yes)
Will you dry all these tears from my eyes? (I'll say yes)

And I'm willing

Trying to find what's really real

But him and buddha can't save your soul
Ol' elijah didn't die for you
It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When it feels like I can't go on
I'll just say (I'll say yes)
When the world say no
You'll still hear montell, when he says (I'll say yes)
When I'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(I'll say yes)
Even then, he'll make everything alright (I'll say yes)

Dig into a mine, and search until I find 
And if it's furs that she needs to keep her warm 
I'll wrestle a bear, to keep her lovin' right here

She wants it all the time

I don't wanna feel like this again

Hold you in my arms and sing you to sleep
When you're crying
I am going to dry your weeping eyes
Rock you in the midnight hour

Suddenly you're gone?
And where can I find the strength

Need to carry on?

Will I ever make it through
Wishing that I had one last chance
To say I love you 

Baby I know I was crazy
'cause I found out that lately
My life hasn't been much fun
Living all alone-please save me
Will you tell me what must I do
To bring you
Back into my arms where you belong
Loving me yesh, or is it too late?

Oh, darling catch me 'cause I'm falling
At night your name I'm calling 
It echoes off the wall, 'cause you're not here at all
You're leaving left me
Without the arms that kept me
Now finally
All the things I never got to say
Fade away and oh

I fall down on my knees at night
Asking God to make it right
But now it's too late (It's much too late)
I made a big mistake (I was wrong, I was wrong)
So now you're loving someone new
And I'm the fool you're toasting to
If I could play God for a minute
Then my life, you'd be right back here in it

What time is it? 
Oh, no 
Oh, no 

7 a.m. when reality sets in 
See, last night we said and did some things 
That we shouldn'ta did 
I know the morning after's always harder 
Than the night before, for sure 
Now we're lying here 
Trying to figure what we're suppose to do 
We're both wondering if we're getting back together 
Or I'm leaving you 
We had one drink too many, one kiss too many 
One ""No don't you say another word"" too many 
And it led us to the morning after 

1 - Last night when the love was too strong 
We couldn't fight it and you stayed 
Just a little too long 
So for now it's morning and yesterday's gone 
But can we move on? 

We ask ourselves ""Why oh why"" a thousand times, yeah 
And separately, silently in our heads 
We rehearse the lines 
I had a nice time (So did I) 
I gotta go now (Me too) 
Hit my pager (Certainly) 
Call me later (Most definitely) 
And then we leave 

Later on that day around six 
I get a call from you 
The slight tremble in your voice let me know 
Something wasn't cool 
And if I could turn bak the hands of time 
I'd go back to yesterday before we lost our mind 
To see if we'd do it all again 

Repeat 1 

Stay or leave, be strong or weak 
Decisions, decisions 
It all seems so easy 
If I knew then what I know now 
I'm sure that somehow we'd have no regrets

Montell Jordan,"Well here is my story that I tell to you 
You may not believe me but I swear it's true 
I escaped to Havana for a getaway 
In a tiny club with a cuban band on a Saturday 

And that's when I saw her from across the room 
Like something from a movie or a storybook 
She had a short dress with curly hair and chocolate skin 
That's how it all began 

I remember when she came into my life 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
Love was in the air 
Just like an ocean breeze 
And we were dancing to the sweetest melodies 
I held her in my arms until she danced into the night 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time 

Hifuela mijo tell me what happened next 

The next day I was walking to the marketplace 
I passed by the cathedral so I stopped to pray 
I imagined this journey without my friend 
And just like an angel she appeared again 
But before I could ask her why she had gone 
The Padre started yelling that ""She's the one"" 
And suddenly the Policia were everywhere with chaos in the air 

I remember when she had to say goodbye 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
I could not believe they said she was a thief 
And I stood there as they drove her away from me 
And what was I to do, now they've accused her of a crime 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 

I remember when I couldn't sleep that night 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
I had to find a way to bring her back to me 
So I made a plan of how to set her free 
And so tomorrow night, mi amore I will find 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 
Once upon a time 

So tell me, how did you get outta there? 

He disguised himself in sheets 
Waited for the guards to fall asleep 
Snuck into the tower, took the keys 
And then I told the girl, stick close to me 
He was in a sword fight 'till the death 
Everyone that watched just held their breath 
And then he ran 
I ran 
Jumped 
I jumped 
Climbed 
Faster and faster and faster 

Guards, stop him! Don't let him get away, Guards! 

I remember when she came back in my life 
And all at once-upon-a-time 
We made our getaway to another time and place 
We were riding while the tears rolled down her face 
She knows I can not stay so we'll say our goodbyes tonight 
It happened all at once-upon-a-time 

I remember when he came into my life 
Love was in the air like an ocean breeze

Break the darkness in my life like sunshine
Now I believe, now I believe that love

Love sets you free
(Sets you free)
You know it's gonna take you higher
If you just believe
(You just believe)
Believe that love will set you free
I know it's gonna take you higher, oh
(Higher)
Just believe
You just believe
And you will receive

I opened up with my hear
There was no doubt
That hatred pulls you in
And love pulls you out
If you believe in faith you will never fall
Love will take you higher than anyone

Love sets you free
(Love will set you free, oh)
It's gonna take you higher
(It's gonna take you higher)
Just believe
(I do believe, all you gotta do is believe)
Love sets you free
(Love will set you free)
If you just believe
Take you higher
Just believe
(I do believe, just believe it)
I do believe it

Only love can set you free
Let it be, everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe
Open up let it in
If you change everything will be
Love is blind love is sweet
If you only trust in me
Only love can set you free
Let it be, everything you need
A little faith, charity
If you just believe
Open up let it in
If you change everything will be
Love is blind love is sweet
If you only trust in me
Just believe, love will set you free",Love Sets You Free [*],2000
Montell Jordan,"Hey baby, I like it when you're next to me
With that body horizontally
Your pretty legs comfortable in my bed
In your lingerie with my pillow under your head

And honey I like you 'cause you trust in me
Just so glad to have you on my team
So I'll keep it real with you
Girl, I'm feelin' you, layin' here

Layin' next to you at night
Kissin' and holdin' you tight
All of these things I like
Girl you are mine, mine, mine

You got a lot of sex appeal
I love the way you make me feel
And what I feel is real
Girl, you're one of a kind

Hey lady, you know just how to treat your man
So I will always be your biggest fan
I'll tell it all over the world, you're my closest friend
Much more than my girl, would ya

Stay with me and you just might see some kind of jewelry
That I know you've been waiting on
Baby, you're the reason all my other girls are gone
What we share is so beautiful
And I think I might just spend my life waking up next to you

Layin' next to you at night
Kissin' and holdin' you tight
All of these things I like
Girl you are mine, mine, mine

Yo
(All of these things I like)
Turn around girl, oh

Layin' next to you

Listen
Shh..
You hear that?
Can you hear that?
Listen

Ohh, ohh, ohh

Lying in my bedroom next to me
Nervous like a child playing hide and seek
I never knew how fast that your heart could beat
It's like it's your first time

But now that your intentions have been revealed
You wanna feel what lovers feel
There's no need to pretend if you don't know how
I'm gonna show you now

1 - Just say what you're feeling
Your secret is safe with me
Tell me your deepest thoughts
Whisper your fantasies
My love will never stop
I'll kiss you as every drop
Of the rain drops down

No, you're not dreaming
This is reality
More than you bargained for
All that you'll ever need
Everytime you come
It's like heaven opens up
And the rain comes down

First you'll feel all warm and tingly
Right before your legs start trembling
And you explode, from your head to your toes
You're feeling something that you never felt before

Together we'll experience the warmth inside
Until the very moment that we both arrive
You'll scream, shake and cry
Feeling so remarkable, it's hard to describe

Repeat 1

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Making love in the rain
Losing ourselves in the storm again
Goin' everywhere
This is the closest that we'll ever come to heaven
Ahh

No you're not dreaming
Don't be afraid
This is the way we're gonna stay
No you're not dreaming
I'll keep your secret from yourself inside the living (?)

Montell Jordan,"Girl I've got a question, here it is
How much longer 'til you let me taste your lips?
You can make a nigga wait if that's your thing
But anticipation drivin' me insane

I'm losing my composure
Tryin' to keep my cool
You start me, then you stop me
So what am I supposed to do?
Sometimes you be actin' so scared
When you know in my heart that I care

[Chorus]
Why can't we, just get past the smalltalk and formalities?
want to tell you that I want you, but it seems so hard
To let down my guard, and reveal my cards
Your body's convincin' me, so why can't we?
Get right to the foreplay, and right now we'll be
Got me dippin' in your ocean, did I go to deep?
I'm just tryin' to see, baby why can't we?

Now I'm working hard to build your trust in me
But I can see that's not gon' happen easily
When you're livin' in your past and in your pain
It's so hard to let your roses bloom again, again

I'm never gonna judge you
Girl you know it's true
I'll take care of your garden
That's what I intend to do
You won't have to be so scared
'Cause you know in my heart that I care

Montell Jordan,"VERSE 1
I know I've spent my whole life running from you
Even though there's been some things you needed me to do
I did it my way and hurt you over and over again
But you were preparing me
To carry out your plan
Though you said that you'd walk with me, some won't believe
Cause the messenger you chose sings R&B
So the man that you rescued me from is the man that they still
And I don't know what to say
I need you to speak for me

CHORUS
So Lord, this is my prayer
Your â??work in progressâ?? humbly asks of thee
Once your promise is fulfilled, the world will be watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME
Lord help just one to see, the YOU in ME

VERSE 2
Someone listening right now needs to hear this tonight
Cause you're lonely and there's an emptiness you're trying to fill in your life
Well I guarantee that my God can do it, yes He can
His name is JESUS
You've got to let him in, and say

CHORUS
Lord, this is my prayer
Your â??work in progressâ?? humbly asks of thee (of thee, of thee)
When your promise has been fulfilled
And the whole world is watching anxiously
Lord help someone to see, the YOU in ME (Oh Lord)
Just help one to see, the YOU in ME (Please Jesus)
If only one could see, the YOU in ME

BISHOP EDDIE L. LONG
I want to speak to you right now
In the midst of your struggles, in the midst of your pain, in the midst of your
Confusion
You wonder, â??why am I here?â?? Glad you asked that questions
God said, You're set apart for a special work, for His glory
That others will see you, but not see you and see HIM
Oh you need to hear this; you need to hear this because
You've been listening to the wrong people
He ordained you, and you don't need anyone else's approval
You've come fully equipped to do what God ordained you to do
You existed with God, even before you were formed in your mother's womb
God knew you
It is amazing
You've tried everybody and everything
Jesus says, â??stop fighting Godâ?? stop fighting
He's knocking at your heart, saying, â??let me inâ??
You're so special
Let the glory of the Lord come through you, in the midst of all your confusion
He loves you

REPEAT CHORUS/ADLIB/END

Lord, Lord my, my, my, my prayer
I'm just a work in progress, but
I'm asking you, I'm begging youâ?¦
When you're promise has been fulfilled, and the world is watching anxiously
Come on and help someone, Oh Lord
I don't want nobody to see Montell, if they can't see you
I'm talking to somebody, can I get a witness
You gotta see past the man, in order to see the You in me

And all her dreams went up in smoke

Two years later, and things have changed
Hip hop evolved into a whole new game
NWA's holding down my block
Denise graduated the school of hard knocks
She made a few connects
Didn't skip a beat
Got a little deeper hooked up on the street
And wherever they led her, she would follow
Now she rocks fashions like a runway model
Jewelry, Louis, Gucci and guess

Sometimes to Rome

Tell me are you down for me (true)
My baby is stacked, she always got my back
And I swear I could never lose that (repeat 2x)

[Verse III]
Ooh, I have never met (true)
A sexy girl like you (true)
I never have to trip (true)
About you, and another dude (so true)
We can put in work (true)
But time will only tell (true)
If you are down for life (true)
Then it's us against the world (so true)

Where are you?
I'm fiening girl for you

Came so close
To losing you, almost
But oh I changed
Just in time
But now and then I wonder what if I

[Chorus]
What if I never met you at all?
What if I never turned you on?
What if I never loved you better?
Made you laugh when you are all pissed off
What if I never bought you thangs
What if I never stopped playing games?
What if I never ever changed?
What if I never

Now you might say
I lost my mind
Thinking about her all the time
Girl got skills
And sexy ways
She puts it down
And I keep her laced
So even when my friends don't seem to understand
Ain't nothing comes between a woman and her man
I left my past
And made you mine
But every now and then I wonder what if I oh

In my heart and mind
Is your love devine
I'm gonna let it flow
And let your love rain down on me

His love rains down on me
Gonna lift my voice and sing
Of the love and joy he brings
Everytime I praise his name
His love rains down on me

When I was in distress
I needed happiness (Come on)
So I got down on my knees
And asked you to comfort me

I know that thunder brings the rain
So I called your Holy name
And you washed away my sins
Gave me new life again

Gonna raise my hands and dance
Gonna give him all I am

Ahh, for shiggity
Mr. Boney Bone Corleone, Lil Zane
And the one and only busta Javiggadink
(Lil Zane, ahh ahh)
Yo, holla at em Zane
Let em know how we do pimpin'

[Verse 1: Lil Zane]
Wasn't for him, I wouldn't be alive
Chest high for tellin' lies, since then baptized
Look in my eyes can you see the pain
Why does the sun shine when it rains
Hard times got me feelin' daddy never did a thang
But God chose and put me in a Rolls and
Keeps my wrists frozen, never brown nosin'
Like an explosion, I'm causin' commotion
Spit the truth like a prophet, I talk to the ocean
People fear what they can't understand
I thank God that I can, I stay focused keepin' him in my plan
Never losin' my fate, haters gonna try to degrade
Gotta be in my state of mind or relate
Gotta know this is the end and ain't no time to waste
Time to face your fate and I pray you don't end up in a lake
Do whatever it take, so many mistakes we made
But we gon' all get it right once we down by the riverside

[Verse 2: T-Bone]
I'm gonna lay down...
All of my glocks and automatics
I'm charismatic like Craig Adix
Ya wreak havoc like road rages and bad traffic
It gets drastic but these fantastic
And attracting, no more packin'
Now we're fastin', has no more passion
How can I keep this life everlastin'
Sick of blastin' and dashin'
Flashin' like Charles Manson
They picked a ransom
Now I'm glory, holler, dancin' (ooohhhwee)
I'm flippin' to rippin' to comin' to lyrical size why'all never heard
Tellin' em reach them partners definitely on them corners flippin' birds
Forget the English spit rhymes para miente
Buster and Javanni bringin' beats like lethal prentice
Salsa, merengue, ritmos calientes
Azuca sabroso pa' ti why pa' mi
Headin' down to the riverside so I can lick the omen now
When I come out of the water a new man fin' to come alive
Revived with the Holy Ghost and tears in my eyes

[Verse 3: T-Bone & Lil Zane]
[T] I'm sick of packin' all these nines, slayin' dimes
And smokin' on the mighty whina
Chillin' with pretty mommas from Havana in the Bahamas
Most demons tryin' to see me hot like I'm in the sauna
And I'm just tryin' to get ya loose kinda like Madonna
[Z] Everybody I know, tell em it's time to go
Me and T-Bone in a six fo' sittin' real low
Bout to roll to the riverside, put that liquor to the side
Ain't no need for gettin' high; stay alive, payin' time
[T] Plus...
Hell should die in the end
Got me trippin' why'all
Never really and I never adverted
'cause I don't want to be left and burnin'
Flirtin' with death and ain't promised my last breath
Try some prison blues, all this fear's got me under arrest
[Z] I used to be a thug, sold drugs, might assault ya
Stepped up in the church, got converted at the altar
And I don't fault ya, fell back and he caught ya
Out tryin' to false better live what he taught ya

Montgomery Gentry,"His cows get loose and run right through the fast food parking lots
And Daddy gets calls from the mini-malls

When his tractor backs up traffic, the reception ain't too warm

You can't pull roots when they run that deep
He's gonna live and die, in the eye of an urban storm
Daddy won't sell the farm

He worked and slaved in '68, he bought these fields and trees
He raised his corn and a big red barn and a healthy family
He learned to love the woodlands, he can't stand to do them harm
There's concrete all around him, but Daddy won't sell the farm

Montgomery Gentry,"I've treated this ol body like a stolen car,
Just some old disposable machine,
Pedal to the metal and a trail of broken hearts,
Yea I'd fill it up with almost anything,
My motto was live fast and go out strong,
But I never thought that I'd live this long

Once I had a woman and she treated me real good,
The kinda love I never will replace,
One day I thought I ain't seen the world the way I should,
So one night I got up and stepped away,
I knew there'd be some lonely's coming on,
But I never thought that I'd live this long

There have been many times I really should have died,
But somehow I survived on my mistakes,
They say it makes me stronger, but why does it take longer,
Getting up these days

Yea I'm old enough to have a few regrets,
I'm still young enough to have my dreams,
Maybe that's the reason that my life ain't over yet,

I probably won't have time to see them all,

Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There's been street fights, blue lights
Long nights with the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I could take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's all right, I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stopped lovin' me

The bank man, the boss man, the lawman
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a danged thing wrong
I've been waylaid, freight-trained, short-changed
By bigger an' badder men
An' all I got to say is: ""Bring it on.""
Hard rain, rough road
So my life goes

That's all right, I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stopped lovin' me

Gotta have you

Every night when I'm greedy an' needing

Lazy summer sundown, front porch of this old house,
Lightning bugs in a mason jar, 
There's a four-lane comming through, they break ground at the end of June,
The counties taking half my yard

It don't matter too much anyway, in the scheme of things,
I still get more than I should

It's all good , It's alright, 
Lord it's always a good day when you're glad to be alive,
Everything I need, ain't too hard to find,
So I don't waste my time complaining,
Cause I don't see how I could,
It's all good

My pick-up truck just broke down,

That'll never change,

Spring Break '88
She came in to hear my band play
And man, we were on that night
Twin guitars and twenty minute jams
Tush, Cocaine, Sweet Home Alabama
I knew I had her in the palm of my hand 
When I stepped in the spotlight
Hot and heavy in that little alley
On a fifteen minute break
We shared a cigarette, a long kiss
Then she stood there by the stage
All night by the stage
Man, what can I say
She loved me
After five long years of tryin to be a star
I sold my axe and I quit them bars
Got a real job fixin trucks and cars
Had a couple new mouths to feed
But eventually that monthly wage 
And the finer points of the suburban age
All became bars on a cage
And man it was killin me
I started cussin, gettin mad at nothin
And blamin her for ruinin my life
Started sinkin, cheatin, and-a drinkin
But she stood there by my side
Right there by my side
With tears in her eyes
And she loved me
She loved me
Heaven knows the reasons why
I'll never know the reasons why
She loved me
She finally left three years ago
Married a man out in New Mexico
Calls to say the boys are really growin
God, I miss them kids
As for me, I'm twelve steps down the line
I found a church that I like just fine
I even got a gig playin these songs of mine
They all just reminisce
Hot and heavy in that little alley
On a fifteen minute break
We shared a cigarette, a long kiss
Then she stood there by the stage

Montgomery Gentry,"There's a story that my daddy tells religiously
Like clockwork every time he sees an opening
In a conversation about the way things used to be

Well, I'd just roll my eyes and make a beeline for the door
But I'd always end up starry-eyed, cross-legged on the floor
Hanging on to every word
Man, the things I heard

It was harder times and longer days
Five miles to school, uphill both ways
We were cane-switched raised, and dirt-floor poor
'Course that was back before the war

Yeah, your uncle and I made quite a pair
Flying F-15's through hostile air
He went down but they missed me by a hair

That's something to be proud of

But I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned 18
'Cause when you gotta fast car you think you've got everything
I learned quick those GTO's don't run on faith
I ended up broken down in some town north of L.A.

In his hair he found some gray
But he still ain't changed his lifestyle
He likes it better the old way
So he grows a little garden in the backyard by the fence
He's consuming what he's growing nowadays in self defense
He get's out there in the twilight zone
Sometimes when it just don't make no sense

Yeh he gets off on country music
'Cause disco left him cold
He's got young friends into new wave
But he's just too frigging old
And he dreams at night of Woodstock
And the day John Lennon died
How the music made him happy
And the silence made him cry
Yea he thinks of John sometimes
And he has to wonder why

He's an old hippie
And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new
He's an old hippie
This new life is just a bust
He ain't trying to change nobody
He's just trying real hard to adjust

He was sure back in the sixties
That everyone was hip
Then they sent him off to Vietnam
On his senior trip
And they force him to become a man
While he was still a boy
And behind each wave of tragedy
He waited for the joy
Now this world may change around him
But he just can't change no more

And he don't know what to do
Should he hang on to the old
Should he grab on to the new

Well he stays away a lot now
From the parties and the clubs
And he's thinking while he's joggin' 'round
Sure is glad he quit the hard drugs
'Cause him and his kind get more endangered everyday
And pretty soon the species
Will just up and fade away
Like the smoke from that torpedo
Just up and fade away

Where id pick a fight just to pick a fight
If he said black, I said white
If he took one side I took the other side
The dinner table we sat around
Was more like a battleground
And I lost more times than I won
I would of learned later on

That he was always preaching bout his past
I just kept screaming"" Come on, dad!
That was twenty years ago
You don't know me at all!

Yeah, you gave me my life, but its my life to live

But one night it got out of control
And right there we came to blows
And that was just enough to get me gone
I couldn't wait to prove him wrong!

Struck out on my own
Couldn't tell me nothing

Thought about the road I chose
Twenty years ago

""Well I left as fast as the leaves fell that autumn
I never looked back and I never once called him
But every time I talked to momma
I wondered if he was there,or if he even cared
I figured I walked out of him and the course of our love had run
Momma said 'no,no, you listen to me son, hes a stubborn man and he won't give in.
He believes what he believes, well you're just like him'
Well I could tell by her voice there was something wrong
She broke down, and said he ain't got long
So I caught the next plane home,
Thought about all the years gone
Had my pride that I let so much time go by
I ran up those stairs and stood by his bed
And I cried""

Thought I knew it all
But trying to talk to me
Was like talking to a wall

Throw down, throw down like hillbilly hippies

Fill up a crew cab truck
Like an old VW bus

Bring along an old 6 string

Hay bale over by the corn row

Montgomery Gentry,"I grew up with a bunch of good friends
That had my back through thick and thin
It was all for one
And one for all
Just to meet girls we started a band
Played a few bars and a high school dance
Man we thought
We had it all

In a small town
You can lay your roots down
Yeah it's one red light, football Friday night
Some cold beer, hangin' out
I ride those back roads
Until I get back home
And it kinda feels like I'm standin' on hallowed ground
Some nights I think I shoulda just stuck around
In a small town

I drove out on a July night
Flipped a bird to the city limit sign
That I blew past
Haulin' ass
I never thought that I'd look back
But a little town changed all that
And now I know
That good things go

The more I live the more I wonder why I never learn
I try and try but I'm no good at getting over you
I stare your empty pillow down until the teardrops fall
I turn my back so I won't think of you and face the wall
But I see your picture hanging there, it breaks my heart in two

Your little memory, just brings me misery
I'm barely getting by, ever since you said goodbye

Anywhere, any time, it's all I ever do
Every day that I die, I always think of you
Every day, every night, it's like this lonely room
Is an everlasting rain
Nothing seems to stop this pain

One night when I caught a little air
Flyin' over those railroad tracks
Back tire hit the gravel and I rolled it

Hit a few bumps, take a few falls

Piece of racetrack road somewhere
Underneath that new four lane
There's Chevy rubber that bears my name

We used to burn it down
Left some circles 'round that square
Left some crazy everywhere

Had to cover our tracks in the blacktop
Turned a stomping ground into a parking lot
Painted over our names, but so what?
We were here, we were here
Might have let that bridge on the river rust
The [?] grow wild where the party was
Ain't a footprint left down in that mud
But we were here, we were here

Somewhere along a back road fence
We lost some backseat innocence
You shook me all night long

Like summer grass,

Like a fresh cut rose,

Like an Irish stream,
And your voice,
Is filled with sweet beauty

And was playing soft
While Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time

If I falter, Lord, who cares?
Who but Thee my burden shares?
None but Thee, oh Lord, none but Thee.

Time for me will be more no more

That slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly)
Slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) slowly take control

The hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he
By changing for the better she had changed things for the worse
The words that made them happy once now echoed, echoed as a curse

Cuenta una leyenda
Que una hembra gitana
Conjuró a la luna hasta el amanecer
Llorando pedía
Al llegar el día
Desposar un calé
Tendrás a tu hombre piel morena
Desde el cielo habló la luna llena
Pero a cambio quiero
El hijo primero
Que le engendres a él
Que quien su hijo inmola
Para no estar sola
Poco le iba a querer

Luna quieres ser madre
Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer
Dime luna de plata
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel
Hijo de la Luna

De padre canela nació un niño
Blanco como el lomo de un armiño
Con los ojos grises
En vez de aceituna
Niño albino de luna
Maldita su estampa
Este hijo es de un payo
Y yo no me lo cayo

Luna quieres ser madre
Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer
Dime luna de plata
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel
Hijo de la Luna

Gitano al creerse deshonrado
Se fue a su mujer cuchillo en mano
De quién es el hijo?
Me has engaño fijo
Y de muerte la hirió
Luego se hizo al monte
Con el niño en brazos
Y allí le abandonó

Luna quieres ser madre
Y no encuentras querer
Que te haga mujer
Dime luna de plata
Qué pretendes hacer
Con un niño de piel
Hijo de la Luna

Y en las noches que haya luna llena
Será porque el niño esté de buenas
Y si el niño llora
Menguará la luna
Para hacerle una cuna
Y si el niño llora
Menguará la luna
Para hacerle una cuna",Hijo de la Luna,2003

sigue jugando en tu playa 
why escondido tras las cañas 
duerme mi primer amor, 
llevo tu luz why tu olor 
por dondequiera que vaya, 
why amontonado en tu arena 
guardo amor, juegos why penas.

Yo, que en la piel tengo el sabor 
amargo del llanto eterno 
que han vertido en ti cien pueblos 
de Algeciras a Estambul 
para que pintes de azul 
sus largas noches de invierno. 

A fuerza de desventuras, 
tu alma es profunda why oscura. 

A tus atardeceres rojos 
se acostubraron mis ojos 
como el recodo al camino. 
Soy cantor, soy embustero, 
me gusta el juego why el vino, 
Tengo alma de marinero. 
Qué le voy a hacer, si yo 
nací en el Mediterráneo.

Living to get down
As the song became my lover

I lost my cool

I'm feeling the bliss and the reason for this
Is the love in your kiss, baby

Send back my love
I sit in my chair

Filled with despair
There's no one, no one
No onecould be so sad
With gloom everywhere

I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude

Monty Are I,"All her hopes and dreams are below:

She closed her eyes, and then the girl was standing on the sky.
And through the clouds, with diamond eyes, she saw herself in the city. (the city)

She looks into the mirror and sees diamonds and grace.
Pure innocence, by the look on her face.
She thinks out loud and says,
""Your words are like the kindling to my fire,
And I've got tunnel vision and the light's not hard to find
The words that I sing say.""

And floating on above the world she waves the past goodbye.
And with a smile she finally found her destiny in the city.",Island City,2006
Monty Are I,"And ever since I left it all, I really felt I let you down. 
But we could count stories with my sheets
Two lovers in a noisy town. 
The good times don't mean shit when I'm relying on telephone lines 
To keep you from crying, so you don't leave me. 

And I must pray. 
Forgive me for saying, 
""Was this a mistake?"" But we can dream
But it's a complicated mess, and what it comes down to is just me. 
What if we touch lips just this once, and a blindfold leads to sinning? 
And she said, ""Holding my hand makes me comfortable, 
And just surround me with loving, baby. 

Not gonna wait around, cause I'm falling down and you're leaving town."" 
Thought she was fearfully free. 
And I just made up my mind, just in time for you to leave me. 
Now that that's out of the way. 

Invested all our time, for three great years we had a good scare. 
Now come give me a sign that you're just not messing with my mind.",Just in Time,2006
Monty Are I,"O brother where are you? (face forward and stop thinking.)
Do you admit regret in times of doubt? (we will think for you.)
A life of gun in hand, with a dedication to your land,
Inside out you've shown it's not what life's all about.

No, we can not believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead (mislead.)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,
We'll be here to see your life through.

I'm confused and punctured,
My conscience is my only means of direction.
Did I sign up for suicide, of a saddened bride?
Three more years, no white picket fencing, and suffering a mental conviction.

Please, don't you think that now we will look down,
On a man who's realized what's true to him now? (to him now)

But we still hold the pride.
When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.
When you return by the tides,
We'll be here to see your life through. (to see your life)

It's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see.
When you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell.
So cock the gun and fire into the eyes of a great desire.
A fleeting destiny that is turned into what is considered to be normal.
And I'm here for you.

No, we can not believe in what you said,
When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead (mislead.)

But we still hold the pride.

Monty Python,"[PROF. JONES:] Good evening. 
One of the main elements in any assessment of the medieval open-field farming system is the availability of plough teams for the winter plowing. 
Professor Tofts of the University of Manchester puts it like this: 
(A rocking beat starts and a 60s-style folk rock song with some heavy Caribbean influence begins.) 

To plough once in the winter Sowing, and again in Lent,
Sowing with as many oxen
Sowing with as many oxen
As he shall have yoked in the plough
Oh yes
Oh yes
As he shall have yoked in the plough.
Oh yes
Oh yes 

[PROF. JONES:] But of course there is considerable evidence of open-field villages as far back as the tenth century. Professor Moorhead: 
(Dramatic metal chords, reminiscent of British punk or perhaps groups like Black Sabbath.) 
Theeeeeere's ev-i-de-ence
Theeeeeere's ev-i-de-ence
There's evidence (evidence)

Farmsteads, hamlets, little towns - the framework was complete
By the tiiiiime ... (OF THE NORMAN CONQUEST!) The rural framework was complete
Rur-al
frame-work
wa-as
com-plete. 

[PROF. JONES:] This is not to say, of course, that the system was as sophisticated as it later came to be. I asked the Professor of Medieval studies at Cambridge why this was. 
[PROF. HEGERMAN:] (stuttering) Well, i-it may not have been a - a statutory obligation, but, uh, I mean, uh, a guy who was a freeman whuh - was obliged in the medieval system to... 
[PROF. JONES:] To do boonwork? 
[PROF. HEGERMANN:] That's right. There's an example, ah, from the village rolls, ah, in 1313. 
[PROF. JONES:] And I believe you're going to do it for us. 
[PROF. HEGERMAN:] That's right, yeah... 
(Pop beat sets in, reminiscent of the Beatles in their later period but with some of the spastic quality of a Joe Cocker.) 
Oh it's written in the village rolls
That if one plough-team wants an oxen
And that oxen is lent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the loooord's consent.
Yeah, yeah,
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent
Then the villeins and the ploughmen got to have the lord's consent

We're opera mad in Camelot.
We sing from the diaphragm a lot.

In war we're tough and able,
Quite indefatigable.

Monty Python,"Presenter Hello, good evening, and welcome to
'Blackmail'! And to start tonight's programme, we go to
Preston in Lancashire, and Mrs Betty Teal!
Cut to a slightly blurred black and white photo of a
Housewife with her face blotted out by a black oblong.

Presenter Hello, Mrs Teal!
Cut back to presenter. He picks up a letter and reads
It.

Presenter Now this is for ?15 and it's to stop us
Revealing the name of your lover in Bolton.
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '?15' (which flashes on and off
Quickly)

Presenter So Mrs Teal...if you send us ?15 by return
Post, please, and your husband Trevor, and your lovely
Children, Diane, Janice and Juliet need never know the
Name of your lover in Bolton.
Cut to a nude man (except for a collar and a tie) at
Organ. He plays a few stirring chords. Cut back to
Presenter.

Presenter (as he speaks he holds up the various items)
And now...a letter...a hotel registration book...and a
Series of photographs...which could add up to divorce,
Premature retirement, and possible criminal proceedings
For a company director in Bromsgrove. He's a freemason,
And prospective Tory MP.. that's Mr S. of Bromsgrove...
?3,000...
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: '?3000' (which flashes on and
Off)

Presenter ...to stop us from revealing your name, the
Name of the three other people involved, the youth
Organization to which they belong, and the shop where
You bought the equipment.
Cut back to nude man at organ with chords again. Cut to
Still of two pairs of naked feet and lower legs. Organ
Music over this. Cut back to presenter.

Presenter We'll be showing you more of that photograph
Later in the programme...unless we hear from Charles or
Michael. And now it's time for our 'Stop the Film'
Spot!
SUPERIMPOSED FLASHING CAPTION: 'STOP THE FILM'

Presenter The rules are very simple. We have taken a
Film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant
Details, which could wreck a man's career. But, the
Victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But
Remember the money increases as the film goes on. So
The longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So
Now, with the clock at ?300 this week 'Stop the Film'
Visited Thames Ditton...
The following film is shot in murky 8mm. As the film
Progresses we have a ? sign with numerals in one corner
Which increase. Shot of a residental street in Thames
Ditton (sic). Another section of a street with a figure
In a Robin Hood hat and raincoat - in the distance on
The far side of the road, so we can't really make him
Out. Cut to slightly closer shot of him about to cross
The road. Cut to suburban house. The man is standing at
The door pressing the bell and looking round rather
Furtively. Again shot from some distance and over a
Hedge. Cut back to studio. The presenter looking at a
Monitor and then at a phone. Back to the film: a woman
Opens the door. She wears a dressing gown over
Lingerie. A shaky zoom in to reveal her clothing. Wide
Shot of the house with door shut. Jump cut to shot
Obviously taken from a window in the house. Shaky zoom
In on window. We can see in the window...both the man
And woman enter the bedroom. He goes out of shot,
Taking his coat off. Cut back to studio.

Presenter He's being very brave here...
Cut back to the film: even closer perhaps of window. A
Series of short jump cuts. She is undressing. She
Throws off her dressing gown. A jump and she's taking
Off her negligee. Underneath she wears black corsets.
She produces a whip and seems to be beckoning to the
Man. Phone rings. Cut back to the studio. The presenter
Picks up the phone.
Presenter Hello, sir, hello, yes. No sir, no, I'm sure
You didn't. No, it's all right, sir, we don't morally
Censure, we just want the money...Yes, and here's the
Address to send it to:

They can really make you mad
Other things just make you swear and curse

There's something you've forgotten
And that's to laugh and smile and dance and sing

Don't be silly chumps
Just purse your lips and whistle, that's the thing
And

Always look on the bright side of life

Always look on the right side of life

For life is quite absurd
And death's the final word
You must always face the curtain with a bow
Forget about your sin
Give the audience a grin
Enjoy it, it's your last chance anyhow

So always look on the bright side of death
A just before you draw your terminal breath

Life's a piece of shit
When you look at it
Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's true
You'll see it's all a show

Monty Python,"Immanuel Kant was a real pissant
Who was very rarely stable
Heidegger, Heidegger was a boozy beggar
Who could think you under the table

Who was just as sloshed as Schlegel

Hobbes was fond of his dram
And René Descartes was a drunken fart
