Beat it up till its numb (she can get it)
Baby gurl you da bomb (she can get it)
(you can give it to me daddy)

Verse 1
She can get it, she wit it 
She a bad one, toes pigeoned
Ass heavy, mean pair of titties
Thighs so thick sexy witta pair of angelie jolie lips
Damn, you a star, grab yo girls meet me at the bar
And lets do it, freaky language I'm fluent
I'm cuban but my money jewish
Miamis so hot, but I stay cool
Thanks to the ice, on the jewels
Make em believe us just like jesus
Do me a favor tell your man to be easy

(Chorus)

Yeah
Now hold up, wait a damn minute

When were through she gon have to split it
Any time of the day, any day of the week 
Anywhere and ill be there, shawty is a freak

Verse 3
MIMS!
If she can get it, then I can give it
In a mercy all go in da civic
Ill break her off like a conjugal visit 
Suspended in mid air defy physics 
See I live it, she got a gap like bridgette, she get it
Ooh I'm so vivid, so descriptive
Girls they know how we move bad boy to 08 mike lowrie
From NY to cali
Bank roll, you cannot match ma salary
I run blocks from broadway to bowie
Call me the quicker picker upper like bounty

Elijah Blake,"Get Money! Get Money!

Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential

You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas giving orders now
The gold presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walking on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceiling
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feeling
Got my seats on the wood, playas giving me gap
Lyor like how I move, want her right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentioning Meek
Went and bought a new crib the weekend Wale released
Bitches, they keep coming
Bilie Jean thumping
I need to hear the trumpets, meaning machine gunning
I ain't missing nothing, got her sipping something
I could ship her something, you know that December coming

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

They see me leaning in some new shit
Now it's gold presidentials for the cruise ship
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talking foolish
I was skipping the classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a profit stuffing my pockets, you niggas starving
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold presidential Venus when I change the game

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

She wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 know we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talking that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers until the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
White T, gold Rolex

Cause that green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's who we are baby
All I ever need is girls and weed

Her shoe game remarkable
I feel solely responsible
I feel solely responsible",Presidential,2012
Elijah Blake,"Holdin' my daughter in the booth
Her momma out there somewhere in that Bentley tryin' to find a roof
Poof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick
Niggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof
Speakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop
Blow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem
Cause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary
Keep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy
But that was cool cause I was just there for the energy
Watchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my Hennessy
First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still
But hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still
Had faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil
Ran through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill
And I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still

Yeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now
I know they listenin' like
This young nigga be killin' this shit
Hip-hop is life's ciroc I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit
Let's go, esco bars nigga, like Nas nigga
The flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga
Hold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga

Stunna, what up blood?
""Whattup blood? What's poppin' my nigga?
Look, I know this the last one after this it's straight Cash Money, my nigga
So, it's YMCMB, wild life my nigga, let's get it poppin'""
Rich game
Off the chain, one hunnid
Suwoo

New coupe, remove roof
I'm from where niggas'll do your bitch and bitch niggas'll do you
Inevitably we take celebrity bitches and run a chu-chu
We puttin' on magnums, taggin' that wagon, some of these birds kookoo
And murder is what I do to
These Just Blazes, Kanyes, shit on Swizz, I handle my biz
The whole world know what I do to Dre's shit
Niggas know I'm classic, I ain't even gotta say shit
Frank Ocean more of a man than you niggas, get up off that gay shit
Fuck copyin' styles, niggas be tracin'
Whether it's me, the movie, or Jadakiss, niggas just can't fuck with Jayceon
So let's go

Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free

Wanna welcome everybody to Jesus Piece
After my album fades, my competition will lyrically be deceased
Niggas saying I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with heat, but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement
Let me find a gun to play with, I leave you niggas under pavement
Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you act like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now you up here and bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and Face just slashed the last beat up like a Ginsu
My album like a 'Rari, a lot of dope features
Glad you bought it, now sit back and just blow reefer
I know the concept behind it is gon' reach ya
Now turn this mufucka up and blow speakers

Ladies and gentleman
I would like to introduce to you
An incredible gentleman
He goes by the name Elijah Blake
Let's go

Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more
Every hood needs an anthem
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Winning comes with a price
No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free

And last but definitely not least
I wanna send a special shout out, to my nigga James Harden
Another Los Angele's nigga carrying rockets
Ballin' on you bitches",Freedom,2012
Elijah Blake,"Heard you said that you just need a real woman, baby here I come, I hear you baby
Had some mishaps and a couple setbacks, baby here I am, I hear you babe
Open up your door, well I really need to come in
I need it all, won't be no fronting
I hear you call, I'm bringing my love in, yeah
Gotta have you in my life

I'll be losing my mind every time you take me to your wonderland
When I look into your eyes, I get lost in your wonderland
When you goin' away I'm dreaming about you baby
Got me losing my mind every time you take me to your wonderland

When you said that, uh, I got that run back
You was talking good, I see you baby
Who would'a thought that, you was stating true facts
Now you got me hooked, you did that baby, yay
Open up your door, girl I really wanna come in
I need it all, won't be no fronting
I hear you call up, bringing the loving
Gotta have you in my life, ooh

I'll be losing my mind every time you take me to your wonderland
When I look into your eyes, I get lost in your wonderland
When you goin' away, I'm dreaming about you baby
Got me losing my mind every time you take me to your wonderland

When I can't find the words 'cause it feels too good
I say ooh baby, ooh baby
When your love is too much and I don't want to rush
I say ooh baby, ooh

When I look into your eyes and you take me for a ride
And you let me get inside of your heart, I just can't lie I say
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, oohhh, oh

I'll be losing my mind every time you take me to your wonderland
(Every time you take me there)
When I look into your eyes, I get lost in your wonderland
(Baby when u call)
When you goin' away, I'm dreaming about you baby
(I can't take it)

Keep it rockin' we on, keep rockin' we on 
Remember days that we do, yeah 
Remember days that we do, yeah 
Remember days that we do 
Remember days that we do
Nobody do it like you 

Yeah, it's been a while, since you came around 
I really miss your smile, hey 
Simple as it seems, it's only black and white 
Without you in my life 
Since we said goodbye 
Baby you've been on my mind, my mind 

How do I tell her, I don't love her like we do 
I'm still in love with you 
How do I let her know, gotta let her go, whoa 
Damn I miss my ex, oh 
Damn I miss my ex 

Still I think about, what we could be right now 
We could right our wrongs, whoa 
You found somebody else, but he can't tie you down 
And my new chick can't compete 
Since we're such about, you've been on my mind 
Oh why, oh why, yeah 

How do I tell her, I don't love her like we do 
I'm still in love with you 
How do I let her know, gotta let her go, whoa 
Damn I miss my ex, oh
Damn I miss my ex 

Emotions, commotion, the notion is to stay open 
Everyday I hold the 5th call me Beethoven 
Symphonies without sympathy, memories seem to visit me 
When I pass Tiffany's 
The distance between you and I, true alive 
For instance you need situations you rely 
One, you said that your love would never run 
Two, you did the things that you do 
Three, the change and you get said I see 

Four, silly game so insecure 
When you was in the open was when I closed the door 
So I can move on, I got sober for 
Another cruel winter, I remember that December 
Our anniversary, we made it through adversity 
The worst of me is coming out 
It's hard to watch you, time is running out 
Don't know what to do, yo, I'm done without my ex 

How do I tell her, I don't love her like we do 
I'm still in love with you 
How do I let her know, gotta let her go, whoa 
Damn I miss my ex, oh 
Damn I miss my ex",X.O.X. [Album Version],2013

Elijah Blake,"She's got no soul but still young minded
Yeah she's got a habit for drinking and driving
She pour it up, her tears are falling down
Looking for love but no one stays around
The worlds on fire, it's so cold right right now
In her head, in her bed
She told her mama don't worry, papa don't preach
She only need knowledge to help her get sleep
Throw some syrup in the red cup
Watch she blowing on that cannabis

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

He's gonna go broke from selling dreams
Before she overdosed off of his amphetamine
Feeling none of the things that she felt before
Wonder what will it be like at times she never thought
Someone is asking questions so deep
Six feet under but can't rest in peace
And they calling out for her but she's out of reach
Nobody wants to ?, that's already been ?
And right now the highs are controlling the lows

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory

She's so gone, she's so far away
In a cold ass cell on the right side of heartbreak
Just like the autumn leaves fall, April brings the rain
Separation slices like a blade, but only generates the pain
How could something so clear become so vein

She's just fading away
She's just fading away
Sleep with that purple by her side
Now she's seeing strobe light
Her last man did her wrong
And he left her mind gone
She's just fading away
Till she's gone like a memory",Fading,2015

Let's move past the bad times
But before those memories fade
Let's forgive but not forget
And learn from the mistakes we made

'Cause it's so clear every year we get stronger
So don't give up and don't say when
And just get back on the road again 'cause

Who never understood
Never looked inside myself
Though on the outside, I looked good

Then we met and you made me
The man I am today
Tracy, I'm in love with you
No matter what you weigh

'Cause without love
Life is like the seasons with no summer
Without love
Life is rock 'n' roll without a drummer

Tracy, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Tracy, never set me free, no, I ain't lying
Never set me free, Tracy, no, no, no

Living in the ghetto
Black is everywhere ya go
Who'd have thought I'd love a girl
Whose skin was white as winter snow

In my ivory tower
Life was just a Hostess snack
But now I've tasted chocolate
And I'm never going back

'Cause without love
Life is like a beat that you can't follow
Without love
Life is Doris Day at The Apollo

Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be without love
So darling, never set me free
No, I'm yours forever
Never set me free, no, no, no

If I'm left without my baby doll
I don't know what I'll do
Link, I've got to break out
So that I can get my hands on you

And girl, if I can't touch you
Then I'm gonna lose control
Seaweed, you're my black white knight
I've found my blue-eyed soul
Sweet freedom is our goal

Trace, I wanna kiss you
Let me out at the next toll

Without love
Life is like a prom that won't invite us
Without love
It's like getting my big break and laryngitis

Without love
Life's a '45 when you can't buy it
Without love
Life is like my mother on a diet

Like a week that's only Mondays
Only ice cream, never sundaes
Like a circle with no center
Like a door marked 'Do Not Enter'

Darling, I'll be yours forever
'Cause I never wanna be without love
Yes, now you've captured me
Without love, I surrender happily

Without love, oh Seaweed
Never set me free , no, no, no, I ain't lying
Never set me free, no, no, no
No, I don't wanna live without love, love, love

Elio e le Storie Tese,"C'era un uomo che viveva a Chicago e gli cresceva l'erba sulla faccia
Egli era infelice
Sulla faccia aveva l'erba, sulla testa piante che perdevano le foglie
Per tagliarsi I capelli usava la motosega

C'era poi una donna che viveva ad Erba
Era molto bella, però i suoi pori secernevano escrementi invece che sudor
Triste la sua condizione per l'infausta secrezione, cacca dalla faccia
Ella era infelice

Lui decise che per essere felice doveva emigrare da là
Addio alle delusioni chicaghesi, addio all'importantissimo nodo ferroviario
Si diresse all'aeroporto per volare fino ad Erba
E lì trovare l'erba sulla faccia della gente

Lei, di contro, per un caso che potrà sembrarvi strano decollò da Erba
Alla volta di Chicago
Questo nome suscitava nella fetida ragazza una nuova speme
Già dopo il decollo la gente voleva buttarla fuori

Ma il destino era in agguato sotto forma di pilota che, svenuto per le esalazioni
Nel suo sogno di pilota trasformossi in kamikaze e diresse verso l'aeroplan
Che da Chicago andava ad Erba
E il bagliore dell'impatto fece luce sui due volti, l'uno verde, l'altro invece no
E lui cadendo vide lei, e lei cadendo vide lui

""Mi presento, io mi chiamo Jonathan Grass""
Disse lui sfrecciando nel blu
""Chiedo scusa per l'audacia ma mi rendo conto che qui fra non molto
Poc'anzi moriremo, e per l'impatto al suolo, e per il grave scontro
E se mi è concesso per lo shock che entrambi abbiamo subito poco fa""

""Si figuri, caro amico, sono conscia anch'io del fatto che qui il tempo stringe
E per dimostrarle che è vero le metto la lingua in bocca"" (la lingua in bocca)

Il contatto dei due visi misto all'impeto d'amore, fece da rimedio di quella tragedia
L'erba si allungò all'istante per l'effetto concimante cacca più amore
Operano più miracoli di quanto non si creda
Ma la luce dell'amore fu oscurata dall'odore che quella puttana sprigionava
E lo sventurato amante, ritiratosi all'istante
Si negò all'abbraccio e disse, ""Pfui"", avviluppandosi nell'erba

Lui, cadendo sulla terra, disse, ""muoio sulla terra"", lei gli cadde sopra e ne morì
Originando lì per lì l'allegra aiuola dell'amor
In quel mentre due bifolchi, ivi intenti a tracciar solchi
Videro l'evento (""guarda l'evento"") e dissero, ""portento"" (""portento"")

Elio e le Storie Tese,"Allora ragazzi ricordo che per la castagnata in Val Pilzetta
Le iscrizioni si portano a Don Igidio giù in parrocchia
E ricordo ai soliti furbini che niente messa niente castagnata

Resta cun me Signore la Sera
Resta cun me e avremo la pace
Famme impazzi, famme pena
La notte mai più scenderà

Ti porteremo ai nostri fratelli
Ti porteremo lungo le strade

Tra l'altro è inutile che facciamo le prove del coro
Il mercoledì sera se poi la domenica a cantare siamo i soliti tre
Scusate la parola, mammalucchi

La strada è sempre quella ma la gente è differente, ti è nemica
(Dove speri di arrivar?)
Born, born to be Abramo (born to be Abramo)
Born, born, born (born to be Abramo)
Quello che lasci tu lo conosci, quello che cerchi vale di più
Andate e predicate il mio vangelo

Esci dalla tua terra, vai dove ti porterò
Esci dalla tua terra, vai dove ti porterò
Le reti sulla spiaggia abbandonate le han lasciate i pescatori
(Son partiti con Gesù)
La folla che osannava se n'è andata, ma il silenzio una domanda

Born, born to be Abramo (born to be Abramo)
Quello che lasci tu lo conosci, il tuo signore cosa ti dà?

Esci dalla tua terra, vai dove ti porterò

E anche un'ultima cosa, le signorine che si presentano
In oratorio a tredici, quattordici anni pittate come delle sciatose

Dedicarsi a certe attività, perché siamo qui per crescere
Per diventare adulti, per fare comunità e per essere l'uno

Elio e le Storie Tese,"When I was just a boy,
Everyone made fun of me,
Just because my penis was enormous,
My mom said it was gorgeous.

I work in a circus because of my penis,
And everybody says: “No problem!”,
Because my penis makes my living,
Now I became a famous actor,
And even though I’m just a slave to love,
I bought myself a rasta Harley.

Now I’m a slave to my new Harley
I got it from Bob Marley,
It’s rasta ‘cause it was Bob Marley’s,
Sometimes I reggae with Ziggy Marley.

I will relaunch the silent movie
Because Bob told me that it’s groovie,
And if you see that forty jumps of that children
We will act like: this is fondamentally the truth.

Twelve inches, it’s one foot
Of artistic reality,
That is what attracted all the critics,
Not my acting ability,
Because they simply don’t get it,
I don’t speak ‘cause I eat spaghetti,
And so my face is normally off-screen,
All of the people still come to adore me,
And now they’ve made me into a big style.

I relaunched the silent movie,
Because I am silent,
And even if I had been born dumb,
I’d have relaunched the dumb movie,
And if I had been born XXX
I’d have relaunched the XXX movie
I am your fire and your Venus,
Because I’m acting with my penis,
And so my penis makes my living,
My penis is very forgiving,
All my Harleys don’t forgive me,
And I’m asking for forgiveness,
Yes yes my Harleys don’t forgive me,
And I’m asking for forgiveness.

""Tu non vieni""
Non importa sai see'avevo judo, ma se serve
Vi porto i dischi, così potrete ballare i lenti
""Porta pure ma non entri""
Ma perchè siete così? Io che credevo..
Io che speravo.. Parteciperò!
Mi auto-inviterò! Dannata festa delle medie!

Mi presento (Burp) ""Ah, ah ciao ragazzi""
Faccio un vento e vi cambio il clima
Temporeggio bevendo spuma
Chiedo Fonzies e mi danno avanzi, Cristo perchè!?!
Parapiglia, scatta il gioco della bottiglia
Se avrò culo potrò...
""Tu non giochi""
Baciare...
""Abbiam fatto le squadre prima""
Palpare...
""Ma se aspetti tra un pò finiamo""
Si va beh, però poi balliamo
""Non ci rompere i coglioni!""
Sul piatto gira un geghegè, danzo da solo e me ne vanto
Fantastico zimbello io
Non consumerò, non deglutirò
Questa amarissima aranciata

""Uè ciao amici come state, bella questa festa, eh?
Oh ma mi fa piacere che sei venuto perchè
Sai chi ti saluta un casino?""
""Chi?""
""Stocazzo!!""
""Sei un boccalone, sei un boccalone!!""
""Eh beh, che scherzo del mega, cioè veramente
Che intelligenza scarsa, sempre questi soliti scherzi.
A me questa festa non mi piace il freddo non mi va giù
see'è della gente che non ci sta dentro
Non mi hanno invitato, non mi hanno dato dei Fonzies
Sui bicchieri di plastica non see'è scritto il mio nome
Non si può fare pallonetto, palloforte
Il gioco della scopa, un gioco della bottiglia
Non si può fare niente, non see'è amicizia
Poi non see'è convenienza, non see'è cortesia
E arrivando non ho visto neanche l'ampio parcheggio all' ingresso
Insomma dai basta finiamola lì""

Basta, questa festa è insoddisfacente
Vado a un'altra nella mia mente
Una festa molto particolare dove saranno invitati tutti
Molti amici, molti nemici e anche Panino!
Forza Panino! Forza Panino! Forza Panino!
Forza Panino! Forza Panino! Forza Panino!

Il fenomeno mestruale presso il grosso pubblico
Troppo spesso la donna colpita da questa bizzarra quanto innocua patologia 
Ha sofferto dell'ostilità dei conoscenti
Quanto del discredito che certa cattiva stampa ha gettato sul simpatico sciaquone 
(Evento peraltro abbastanza diffuso presso certe popolazioni)
Ecco che Elio e le Storie Tese dicono ""basta"" a questa criminalizzazione
E si propongono come ideali continuatori di un'usanza 
Il ciclo mensile appunto  
Che si perde nella notte dei tempi e rischiava di scomparire a causa dell'insensibilità dei più                               
Quella stessa insensibilità che aveva generato negli anni cinquanta il binomio ""mestruazioni - disagio""
E che cede il passo oggi ad una visione più completa e rassicurante
In virtù della quale ""quei giorni"" vengono vissuti come un momento di fantasia, gioia, intimità, colore 

Tu, cinque giorni di tristezza 
E poi corri incontro alla vita
Tu, io? Col tuo paracadute
Ti getti in volo e vai, zo vuoi? 
Atterri nel giardino di casa
Poi ti muovi sicura e fresca 
Come in un mattino di primavera
Nella tua cameretta c'è un signore 
Che aziona la pressa suoi tuoi piccoli 
Amici di ovatta che invocano aiuto
Ma lui te li ruba e va via

Teneri, fradici tappi per la figa pelosa

Figa pelosa li trovi anche in 
Confezione magnum da ottanta pezzi
I suoi bei sigaroni morbidoni

È tutto finito. 
Protagonista del tuo tempo
Protagonista della tua sessualità

Di un veliero proiettato verso il mare 
Del duemila al grido di ""cazzo, subito""
Essere donna oggi, non più cagafigli
Bensì dolce e caparbia cagatrice 
Dei tuoi figli, come Loretta Goggi 
Nella Freccia Nera, o in Maledetta

Elio e le Storie Tese,"Come è noto il nemico numero uno dei giovani
È il governo, alleato coi matusa
Per impedire ai giovani di essere tali
I pochi giovani che osano opporsi al governo 
Fanno una brutta fine, vengono ibernati
Fino alla maggiore età dopodiché disibernati
Ma allora è troppo tardi
Infatti a quel punto non sono piu' giovani
Ma un bel giorno I giovani vengono vendicati
Da un nuovo supereroe, Supergiovane
Che dà la caccia al governo
Con armi progettate da un pool
Di tecnici balistici giovani (miccette, raudi
Bombette puzzolenti, gavettoni
Jaguarmatic, sbiancate, l'allegro chirurgo, il piccolo chimico)
Fino ad affrontarlo nello scontro finale

Ci sono però anche le armi incruente
(Si tratta comunque di armi giovani)
Che sono la sua vera forza, la simpatia, l'umorismo
La gioia di vivere e l'argento vivo addosso

Usata solo quando non se ne può fare a meno
È ""figlio di puttana"", se pronunciata
All'indirizzo del governo
Lo fa piangere
(A volte il governo cerca di difendersi
Con ""lascia stare mia madre"", ma non funziona)

La sua tattica mimetica consiste nel nascondersi
Sotto il tavolo del governo
E coprirsi gli occhi (a volte con la frangia di capelli ossigenati)
Il governo, generalmente, cerca di fermarlo
Scatenandogli contro un'avanguardia
Di matusa rimproveratori e di secchioni
L'unica sostanza pericolosa per SG è la minestra
Che il governo riesce a propinargli
Attraverso una mamma al soldo dei matusa
Ma infiltrata nell'entourage di SG
Il veicolo di SG è un motorino elaborato Pinasco
Con marmitta a espansione, cilindrata non dichiarata
Stereo, cartolina tenuta con la molletta fra I raggi per fare crr
Ma privo della ruota davanti
(La quale costituisce un peso inutile
Dato che SG è in impennata perenne)
Una stecca di marlboro sotto la manica della maglietta
A maniche corte arrotolate costituisce
Un ulteriore elemento distintivo e intimidatorio

Che disturba la mia pubblica quiete?
Vedo un quacchecosa sul giubbotto
Poi c'è scritto che c'è scritto?

Sandro Giacobbe? Impossibile
Sandro non ha lo spessore
E poi c'ha il mantellino, minimo dev'essere

No, ma è un supereroe

Poi li subissa di cingomma nei capelli
E li finisce sputazzando il riso colla penna Bic

Traboccante di analcolico biondo

Come un vero Giamburrasca
Ma a contatto con il liquido esclama

All'istante, passa all'uso di eroina

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there

I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care

You betrayed me with a kiss

So wrong
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
Discussing all the things with you
I told you all my secrets
You told it to the world
And laughed about it
I would have given anything

I was too good for you

Why did it have to be like this
'Cause I miss you

But one day
I will find you

Elis,"Come calm my anger

Our love is like a perfect sky
Deep blue and the sun is shining
But it seems that sometimes
There have to be some clouds

And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Deep inside
And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Is about to rise

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger

Dark clouds is a perfect sky
And the air is getting colder
The rain starts to fall
We feel stormy wind in our faces

And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Deep inside
And suddenly I feel this destructive anger
Is about to rise

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger

Glaring lightning breaks the clouds
And thunder is rumbling loudly
The elements have turned mad
It seems that it all will break down

Please come and calm this anger
You're the one to calm this anger
And if you can't calm this anger
It'll surely devour me this anger

Der Wind verwehte drei Zeichen I'm Sand -
Laut sang, o sang das Meer.

Ein Narre schrieb drei Zeichen in Sand,
Eine bleiche Magd da vor ihm stand.
Laut sang, so sang das Meer.

Da lÃ¶schte sein Licht in ihrer Hand,
Der Wind verwehte drei Zeichen I'm Sand -
Laut sang, o sang das Meer.

Sie hielt einen Becher in der Hand,
Der schimmerte bis auf zum Rand,
Wie Blut so rot und schwer.

Kein Wort ward gesprochen - die Sonne schwand,
Da nahm der Narre aus ihrer Hand
Den Becher und trank ihn leer.

Da lÃ¶schte sein Licht in ihrer Hand,
Der Wind verwehte drei Zeichen I'm Sand -
Laut sang, o sang das Meer.




",Ballade,2005
Elis,"I was walking through the night
Suddenly I remarked a sound in the winds
An angel like voice singing a tale

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

Listening breathless to her voice
Which has touched me right there in my heart
I felt the tears run down my face

Through the cold and stormy night
Flies an angel
The black angel
White skin, red lips and long black hair,
Her wing is broken
The guardian angel

The storm drags on her clothes
Like an invisible warrior
Her wing broke with a sound
So disgusting that it froze my heart
Her voice became weaker
Losing this fight of blackness




",Black Angel,2005
Elis,"Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now

You just told me on the phone
Bad news I can't believe they're true
Fate is so cruel to you it seems
It caught you at your weakest point
Nothing left of your whole world
Besides chaos and smoking ruins
You thought there's nothing more to lose
You're wrong and he presents the proof

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

Why can't I hear you breath
Why can't I hold you now

You will need all of your strength
I hope that you can carry on
You fought the shadows of the ghosts
Now he's the one you will fight next
Knocking at your door as if
He is a guest you like to see
Don't let him in, just push him back
He is not welcome in your house

Please fight the devil inside you
Not enough time for us to spend

Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

To leave your prison
Your heart lies in chains
And who will break them
Your heart lies in chains

Maybe you will find a way to forgive yourself
Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind
Your cold cold heart has tortured my mind and soul

It tears you all apart
Restrained emotions
You're denying all your feelings
And it will break you
You're denying all your feelings

Maybe you will find a way to forgive yourself
Your cold cold heart has drowned my life in pain
Maybe one day you will find the peace for your mind

Took my soul
In his hands
My mind got dark

In his hands

To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands

He said sweet words
Said sweet words
With his voice
He seduced me softly
Seduced you
With his voice

When did I begin
To follow the shadows
They fill my dreams with pain and sadness
When did I begin
To feel the sorrows
Then I laid my soul into your hands

Once times were not so dark

Of my soul
Since then I feel

In the dark
Lost my mind

Has gone
The autumn leaves
Start to fall

I felt the world hold its breath
And everything turned slower
All was silent, softened by the snow

In a freezing white coat

Silently
The first snowflakes fall

An die ein sanfter Hügel sich geschmiegt hat

As darkness sunk into our hearts
The other one's shadow stood between us
A silent wall of doom darkening the sky

Deep as gray oceans in your eyes

Where flowers grew, now dust has covered everything

Estou ligada num futuro blue

Os meus pais nas minhas costas
As raizes na marquise
Eu tenho mais de vinte muros
O sangue jorra pelos furos pelas veias de um jornal
Eu não te quero
Eu te quero mal

Olhei a vida e me espantei
Eu tenho mais de 20 anos",20 Anos Blue,1972

Elis Regina,"Chegou, sorriu, venceu, depois chorou, 
Então fui eu quem consolou sua tristeza 
Na certeza de que o amor tem dessas fases más 
E é bom para fazer as pazes, mas

Depois fui eu quem dela precisou 
E ela então me socorreu, e o nosso amor 
Mostrou que veio pra ficar 
Mais uma vez, por toda a vida

Bom é mesmo amar em paz

Este amor, uma canção

O Redentor que lindo

Quero a vida sempre assim com você perto de mim
Até o apagar da velha chama

E eu que era triste
Descrente deste mundo
Ao encontrar você eu conheci
O que é felicidade meu amor

O que é felicidade, o que é felicidade",Corcovado,1974

perdoem a falta de amigos, os dias eram assim 
Perdoem a falta de folhas, perdoem a falta de are 
perdoem a falta de escolha, os dias eram assim 

E quando passarem à limpo, e quando cortarem os laços 
E quando soltarem os cintos, façam a festa por mim 
Quando lavarem a mágoa, quando lavarem a alma 
Quando lavarem a água, lavem os olhos por mim 
Quando brotarem as flores, quando crescerem as matas 
Quando colherem os frutos digam o gosto prá mim

Elis Regina,"Eu quero uma casa no campo
Onde eu possa compor muitos rocks rurais
E tenha somente a certeza
Dos amigos do peito e nada mais

Eu quero uma casa no campo
Onde eu possa ficar no tamanho da paz
E tenha somente a certeza
Dos limites do corpo e nada mais

Eu quero carneiros e cabras
Pastando solenes no meu jardim
Eu quero o silêncio das línguas cansadas
Eu quero a esperança de óculos

E um filho de cuca legal
Eu plantar e colher com a mão
A pimenta e o sal

Eu quero uma casa no campo
Do tamanho ideal, pau a pique e sapê
Onde eu possa plantar meus amigos
Meus discos e livros e nada mais

O meu peite percebeu
Que o mar é uma gota
Comparado ao pranto meu

Logo o sol se desespera
E se esconde la na serra

Nem tao pouco se admite
Quem do nosso amor duvide

Até a lua
Se arrisca no palpite
Que o nosso amor existe
Forte ou fraco
Alegre ou triste

Cuando miro al bueno tan lejos del malo,
Cuando miro al fondo de tus ojos claros

Me ha dado la risa y me ha dado el llanto

E diz com sinceridade o que desejas de mim
Entra, podes entrar, a casa é tua
Já te cansastes de viver na rua
E os teus sonhos chegaram ao fim 
Eu sofri demais quando partiste
Passei tantas horas triste
Que nem quero lembrar esse dia
Mas de uma coisa podes ter certeza
O teu lugar aqui na minha mesa
Tua cadeira ainda está vazia 
Tu és a filha pródiga que volta
Procurando em minha porta
O que o mundo não te deu
E faz de conta que sou teu paizinho
Que há tanto tempo aqui ficou sozinho
A esperar por um carinho teu 
Voltaste, estás bem, fico contente
Mas me encontraste muito diferente
Vou te falar de todo coração

Mas pra te abrigar podes ocupar meu teto
Pra te alimentar podes comer meu pão",Cadeira Vazia,1977

Chupavam manchas torturadas, que sufoco
Louco, o bêbado com chapéu-côco

Que sonha com a volta do irmão do Henfil
Com tanta gente que partiu num rabo-de-foguete

Não há de ser inutilmente, a esperança

Na figura de um bravo feiticeiro

Tinha a dignidade de um mestre-sala
E ao acenar pelo mar na alegria das regatas
Foi saudado no porto

Pelas mocinhas francesas
Jovens polacas e por batalhoes de mulatas
Rubras cascatas
Jorravam das costas dos santos

Entre cantos e chibatas
Inundando o coracao do pessoal do porao
Que a exemplo do feiticeiro gritava entao

Glria aos piratas, s mulatas, s sereias
Glria farofa, cachaca, s baleias
Glria a todas as lutas inglrias

Nao esquecemos jamais
Salve o navegante negro
Que tem por monumento as pedras pisadas do cais

Eu quero mais
Tenho o caminho do que sempre quis

E um saveiro pronto pra partir
Invento o cais
E sei a vez de me lançar

How lovely! this is where I want to be
Here, with you so close to me,

Please let me know that is real

Evito tanto

Volta sempre a enfeitiçar

De lembranças do passado

Que festa é o seu voltar
Mas quero que você me fale
Que você me cale

Deixe o dinheiro do pobre
E roube outro ladrão

Beija o barco e luz

Volta do mar, desmaia o sol

As overhead the sun is running down the day

It tells of war and hate it tells of power
The promises of freedom
And of all religions love and ways of life
And how to close your time inside a flower
Stop the seconds minutes hours
Close your time inside a flower
Live your life forget the power
The people passing by they stop to look at me
They all think I'm crazy cause I'm laughing in the wind
But I am free to be whatever I may choose
To win this freedom I know that somebody had to lose
I've learned of those who buy love
Read about those willing to sell it
When we're born it's for love
Some of us would die just to get it
What you gotta do is close your time inside a flower
Stop the seconds minutes hours
Close your time inside a flower
Live your life forget the power
We can give our love away and never lose ourselves
But no one can be something that you own
And if you think you've got the right to tell me what I am
I got no trouble leaving you alone
Close your time inside a flower
Stop the seconds minutes hours
Close your time inside a flower
Live your life forget the power
",Inside a Flower,1998
Elisa,"Just like a spy through smoke and lights
I escaped through the back door of the world
And I saw things getting smaller
Fear as well as temptation

Now everything is reflection as I make my way through this labyrinth
And my sense of direction
Is lost like the sound of my steps
Is lost like the sound of my steps

Scent of dried flowers and I'm walking through the fog
Walking through the fog
Scent of dried flowers and I'm walking through the fog
Walking through the fog

I see my memories in black and white
They are neglected by space and time
I store all my days in boxes
And left my wishes so far behind
I find my only salvation in playing hide and seek in this labyrinth
And my sense of connection
Is lost like the sound of my steps
Is lost like the sound of my steps

Scent of dried flowers and I'm walking through the fog
Walking through the fog
Scent of dried flowers and I'm walking through the fog
Walking through the fog

Words sounds music and I'm spinning in
Words sounds music and I'm spinning out
But I want to stay here
'cause I am waiting for the rain
And I want it to wash away
Everything, everything, everything",Labyrinth,1998
Elisa,"I don't wanna hear another plastic love song
And I don't need no more triviality
Cause I know there is more
That love could be
But you know that's not to say that I know just what I want out of
Life
It doesn't mean that I feel hopeful everyday I'm alive
But when you smiled at me I felt many things
Like lust and fear and dreams
And though it could hurt I've gotta try it anyway
When the door is flung wide open you don't stay inside your room all
Day
You go where there's a chance of losing the awful empty lie
That it's better not to need anyone than to take the crazy uncertain
Ride
And it's a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain
But at the best price you can
I don't know much more than your first name
But I might stick around till I know everything
Because who we could be remains to be seen
Is it the joke now or the dream
And I like the new beginning the slow show and tell
Sometimes I think the expectation is sweeter than the love itself
It's alright I'm gonna take my time I'm gonna take your mystery
You know it's simple don't you try to ignore take your freedom when
You're given the key
Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain
But at the best price you can
Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain
Like a new kiss and I'm flying out there
A great kiss and I'm crying in the streets
It's a killer kiss under a friendly rain
Hear me now sell me joy and pain

I'm such a fool to treat you like I do
When I take my fears and throw them all on you
But it's you so delicate so pure
Enough to seem unreal
Yes it's you so delicate so pure
It's so hard to believe
I love your laugh the way you say my name
I want you to be hard I want to know your pain
I was so wrong but now I see the truth
I blame it on my youth and I'm coming back to you
But it's you so delicate so pure
Enough to seem unreal
Yes it's you so delicate so pure
It's so hard to believe
I love the way that you walk
And the music in the way that you talk
Anybody gonna tell me that I'm crazy
I know with all my jealousy it's hard to live with me
Here in the dark I need you like a drug
Take anything you want the part of me you need
Wash over me desire has a face

Will you be the same after you've gone through every door
Teach me how to play your game and what you want to be
Will you recognize me when you've lost your honesty

Tell me you'll be happy once you leave us all behind
Tell me about the kingdom you've been building in your mind
Never really living is a lonely way to go
Will you ever understand there's more than what you know

Tell me who you'll be tomorrow
Where will you keep all your sorrow
Tell me who you'll be tomorrow
Where will you keep all your sorrow

Can I talk to you and will you listen will you see
I'll only take an hour of your precious misery
I'll be watching you and now I'm gonna tell you why
I don't think your way of life can take you very high

Who will ease your pain
Who will love you all along

Some fantasies they save me with the grace - it's a precious land
All around me little things are shining like they are one - are we sisters?
When I'm looking for the perfect things I stand up and put on another face
You're all exploring all you see you should live everything

I'm waking up in a good day so happy walking into the sun

perspiring deeply watching these fears as big as planets I'm hot
See you are living all you are in your eyes is there an end?
I really want you see me the way I am the way I am
Just gimme some time sister gimme some trust sister

Wild wise earth keep on turning...

And get ready to swallow one more time
'N caress the little world travelling with me
'N just keep dreaming dreaming dreaming.
Oh I should not be worried
There's no cage I would be trapped for
But the one I could build myself
Well you see a cloud is coming
Unconscious of its shape
And I ask myself if that's the heart of its beauty
Now I'm hungry and tired but what more

Get ready to swallow one more time

While the ground's missing
What's coming after?

To make my own way
To make it myself

The love that we made
Shines through my eyes
It's out of the maze

Carried by wind naturally dying
Never drank water
Never touched fire

A beautiful night's a beautiful night
Its colorful soul's embracing my song
And a cello's playing in my head
Just for me
And a new desire is blowing sounds
In my ear
Shall I go for a smile? Shall I or
Shall I keep it to myself?
But I would share it with you
If you could understand...

A beautiful night's a beautiful night
My happiness came like sand in the wind
Oh I think I saw a little poem
Falling off a starâ?¦ Oh, I think I saw it

Shall I go for a smile? Shall I or
Shall I keep this to myself?

Can I... can I step into your world?

Just for me
And a new desire is blowing sounds
In my ear
And I think I saw a little poem
Falling off a starâ?¦ And I think I saw it
Choosing your eyes as a place to spend timeâ?¦
Shall I go for a smile? Shall I or
Shall I keep it to myself?
But I would share it with you,

Elisa,"Hard times flowing and my eyes couldn't see stars shining
My heart couldn't feel the beauty of the rising sun
And I'm lost like a bottle that floats in the sea for ever
Will somebody pick up my hope? Will somebody try?
Will I realize?

'Cause it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting, hurting
I have been hurting and now
Only time will tell
Time will heal

Just pieces of truth that I chose to keep and
No matter if now they are gone
No matter if I am alone
Still I can get back on my feet and walk on
As I know there was something to learn
I know there will always be more worth moving on for

Though, it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting hurting
I have been hurting and now
Only time will tell

'Cause it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting hurting
I have been hurting and now
Only time will tell

I'd love to be one of those colorful early summer days
When everybody is happy that you came
Everybody smiles back at you as soon as your eyes cross their eyes
But something has to happen first
I know winter has to come before it blossoms

So it's broken broken
Something got broken like stolen
Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting hurting
I have been hurting and now
Only time will tell

Stolen, like if it was stolen
And hurting hurting
I have been hurting and now

That David played and it pleased the lord

The baffled king composing hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Well, maybe there is a God above
But all I've ever learnt from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah

I work 'til I'm done
I never look at the clock
I'm living out of time
In my cocoon
Smooth like water running down my throat
Days slide away
Drawing signs

I look ahead, and than behind
To see if my traces can make a straight line
The kids are laughing outside
No one looks at the sky
But it's gonna rain and
It's getting cold
The wind starts to blow while...

Something's shaking my soul now
Like a tree
But this time I know
Yeah this time I know
It's simply you

So I'll see you soon
I'll keep waiting
I'll see you soon
I'm here waiting.

I can't do what ten people tell me to do
I guess I'll remain the same, yeah

Con le cadute e tutto il male 
Come una musica, come un dolore

Nessuna replica, poco potere 
Mentre decidi se ti puoi fidare

Puoi solo credere, forse saltare 
Come un elastico, senza pensare 
Non c'è più tempo, forse fa male 

Anche se non trovi le parole 
Hai girato il mondo dentro a un cuore
Anche se puoi perderti a cercare 
Hai girato il mondo dentro a un cuore 
E devi dire grazie a te se resti come sei 
Dire grazie a te che 
Non ti lasci mai

To lose my fear so I could take a chance
And walk on through where I can barely stand

Ci sembrerà di essere più liberi 
Se dalle nostre mani 
Non cadranno più parole per noi due 

E sarà più semplice 
Sorridere alla gente senza chiederle 
Se sia per sempre o duri un solo istante 
E poi che ce ne importa a noi? 

Tanto basta così, così, scendiamo qui, qui
Che senza di noi c'è la libertà 
Si ma basta così, così, fermiamoci qui

Sarò sorpreso poi a vederti ridere 
Senza il bisogno poi di dover decidere 
Per chi, se non per me 
E allora sarà facile 
Tagliare l'aria se non lo si farà in due 
E ti vedranno correre su cieli di ciniglia e di popcorn 

Si ma basta così, così, scendiamo qui, qui 
Che senza di noi c'è la libertà 
Si ma basta così, così 
E tu baciami qui, qui 
Che l'ultimo sia e poi che senso avrà
Tanto basta così, così

Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

As you can see there's no one around",1979,2010

Poi ti saprò riconoscere anche tra mille tempeste 
Un bacio è come il vento 
Quando soffia piano però muove tutto quanto 
E un'anima forte che non ha paura 

Quando ti cerca è soltanto perché lei ti vuole ancora
Quando ti cerca è soltanto perché lei ti vuole ancora
E se ti cerca è soltanto perché

Elisa,"Ho visto volti impallidire
Non sapendo cosa dire
Si sono persi dentro un’illusione
Piena di luci e cose da comprare 
Piena di baci senza troppo amore

Dati per vedere cosa c’è un po’ più in là Più in là, più in là, più in là
Lontano da qui, da qui, da qui, da qui 
Ho visto occhi lacrimare
Non sapendo più guardare

Si sono chiusi tra la confusione
Per non sentire il peso delle cose
Forse sognando di volare
Via in silenzio un po’ più in là

Lontano da qui, da qui, da qui, da qui 
Lontano da qui, da qui, da qui 
È strana la legge che ci sconfigge
È buffa la spada che ci trafigge
Sembra vicino ma non si raggiunge
È troppo perfetta la bellezza sfugge Come la pace che si diffonde

Come la vita che ci travolge
Come la luna che alza le onde
Ho visto bocche sigillare
Verità da cui scappare
Per poi sorridere davanti a un fiore Schiudersi piano per il grande Amore
E ancora aprirsi per cantare via il dolore Un po’ più in là

Adesso sai
Sì tu lo sai
Si è rotto
Ogni cosa è inutile
Quando so che vorrei solo te
Ogni volta fa ridere
Come io finisca a pensare a te

Anche se non ti chiederò perché
Io non starò lì ferma immobile
Ad aspettare che mi spingi sopra il ciglio
Anche se non ti chiederò perché
Non mi pensare così fragile
Ed a aspettare che mi guardi andare a fondo
Come un sasso

A te che sai
Comunque sai
Non muore mai
Il ricordo
Ogni cosa è inutile
Quando so che vorrei solo te
Ogni volta fa ridere
Come io finisca a pensare a te
Anche se non ti chiederò perché
Io non starò lì ferma immobile
Ad aspettare che diventi ieri adesso e
Anche se non ti chiederò perché
Se mi conosci sai che era per te
Speravo mi parlassi di quel giorno di quel momento
Maledetto in cui ti ho perso
Maledetto labirinto

Anche se non ti chiederò perché
Io non starò li ferma immobile
A sentirti dire che non è lo stesso e
Anche se non ti chiederò perché
Non mi pensare così fragile
Da volerti anche se abbasserai lo sguardo

E tu prova ad uscirne adesso
E solo tu puoi uscirne adesso
E solo tu puoi uscirne adesso
E solo tu puoi uscirne adesso

Non volere niente
Non cercare niente

Davanti a una centrale d’asfalto

In cerca di qualche meta

E stavolta fargliela vedere, pagare
Con quella voglia di girare i piedi
E trovare la forza, il coraggio di andare

Non volere niente da te
Non sapevo niente
Non volevo niente da te
Non pensavo a niente che non c’è

E guardare il cielo per trovare un motivo
Da restituire al mondo

Pensando, vivi 
Sentendo, vivi 
Con te 
Con te

Delle tue guerre non m'importa 
Delle minacce poi non mi interessa 
Riavvolgerei quel nastro se potessi 
E tu interrompimi

Perché mi lasci troppi pensieri 
Col tuo silenzio mi avveleni 
E ti direi se hai il coraggio fatti avanti 
Non fare finta che 
Non ci sia più niente

Pensandoti qui 
Sentendoti qui con me 
Sorridi già 
Tu, sorridi già 
Stringendomi un po' 
Stringendomi un po' 
Di più

E appoggia qui le tue braccia (stanche, stanche) 
Dimmi che non nascondi niente 
Anche solo uno sguardo 
Ci riesce 
Anche solo un abbraccio 
Scioglie, scioglie, scioglie 
Sorrido già

Ti cerco, ti aspetto, mi giro nel letto 
Ci provo anche se sono sempre in ritardo 
A prendere te che sei parte di un sogno
Inseguo quel che è impercettibile al tatto
Tienimi per ogni alba che sorge
Dedicami ogni tuo atto ribelle
Dentro la calma che è pure delirio
Dimenticami, perdonami

Anche solo un abbraccio",Sorrido già,2016

cause i thought it died
this feeling inside

You shot me in the brain
then make my heart beat again
it drives me insane

Think that i'm still in love with you
and now i don't know what to do

Will start the sky to cryin'
But not even lightening
Will be frightening my lion

And with no fear inside
No need to run, no need to hide
You're standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all

If on courage you must call
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin' you're a lion
In your own way be a lion

If we could only cross these lines,

I see la vie en rose

That once we walked in a moonlight dream?

As moonlight fades in a veil of rain?

How much I want you back again.

I've gotta look you in the eye
And tell the world the biggest lie
What choice do I have
When you hurt me so bad
Wrecked everything we had
So

I'mma gonna say what I gotta say
I'mma gonna do what I gotta do
To unlove you

Elise Legrow,"I never know, what you're gonna do
You're always so far away

Down below, you used to tell the truth
Now, you're lookin' for something to say
You give me those eyes
And then look away

Do you want me down on my knees?
Are you livin' a lie?
Is this some kind of game
Baby, won't you tell me please?

Give me one good reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

Who do you love? What makes you happen
What do you need for satisfaction
Who do you love? I need an answer
Is it just about a good time, good time
Who do you love?

I wish you'd lie or tell me the truth
So I can decide for myself
Maybe you've tried what we used to do
With somebody, somewhere else

Give me one reason to stay
When you won't come right out and say

",Who Do You Love,
Elise Oudin-Gilles,"Est-ce que c'est de la patience ou est-ce qu'on sait faire le dos rond
Est-ce que c'est l'expérience que nous ont enseigné nos darons?
Mais ce qu'on a tous compris c'est que la vie repose toujours
Sur l'enchaînement des opposés, après chaque nuit il va faire jour

Partant de cette évidence ou d'une volontaire naïveté
On sait qu'après chaque inquiétude viendra l'instant de sérénité
Comme si à l'échelle d'une vie les choses devaient s'équilibrer
Après l'orage les éclaircies, aucun ciel ne reste encombré

Alors on s'est imprégné de cette capacité d'adaptation
Pour encaisser les coups on a su entrer en mode mission
On sait que les tunnels ont une fin dans chaque moment de lucidité
Et que nos efforts ne sont pas vains quand la vie passe à l'heure d'été

Summertime and the living is easy
Fish are jumping and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma' is good looking
So hush little baby, don't you cry

J'ai eu pas mal de patience et j'ai dû faire le dos rond
Pour traverser en silence toutes mes journées peintes en marron
J'ai gardé l'envie de croire ou j'ai toujours cru à l'envie
J'ai refusé de concevoir un présent cruel à vie

Comme le destin doit être aidé, j'ai avancé l'aiguille d'un tour
Je suis passé à l'heure d'été pour aller rejouer dans la cour
Comme le boxeur après le gong et le taulard après dix ans
Comme le civil après les bombes, après la lutte on est vivant

Vivant pour sentir le soleil, la nuit tombe de plus en plus tard
Et y a de la lumière de plus en plus longtemps dans nos espoirs
C'est vrai qu'on a passé l'hiver à donner des grands coups d'épée
Dorénavant la route est claire, on est passé à l'heure d'été

One of these mornings, you're gonna rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take to the sky
But till that morning there's nothing can harm you

Elise Witt,"Volver a los diecisiete
Después de vivir un siglo
Es como descifrar signos
Sin ser sabio competente
Volver a ser de repente
Tan frágil como un segundo
Volver a sentir profundo
Como un niño frente a Dios
Eso es lo que siento yo
En este instante fecundo

Se va enredando, enredando
Como en el muro la hiedra
Y va brotando, brotando
Como el musguito en la piedra
Ay sí sí sí

Mi paso retrocedido
Cuando el de ustedes avanza
El arco de las alianzas
Ha penetrado en mi nido
Con todo su colorido
Se ha paseado por mis venas
Y hasta las duras cadenas
Con que nos ata el destino
Es como un diamante fino
Que alumbra mi alma serena

Lo que puede el sentimiento
No lo ha podido el saber
Ni el más claro proceder
Ni el más ancho pensamiento
Todo lo cambia el momento
Cual mago condescendiente
Nos aleja dulcemente
De rencores y violencias
Solo el amor con su ciencia
Nos vuelve tan inocentes

El amor es torbellino
De pureza original
Hasta el feroz animal
Susurra su dulce trino
Detiene a los peregrinos
Libera a los prisioneros
El amor con sus esmeros
Al viejo lo vuelve niño
Y al malo solo el cariño
Lo vuelve puro y sincero

De par en par en la ventana
Se abrió como por encanto
Entró el amor con su manto
Como una tibia mañana
Al son de su bella diana
Hizo brotar el jazmín
Volando cual serafín
Al cielo le puso aretes
Y mis años en diecisiete
Los convirtió el querubín",Volver a Los Diecisiete,2006

Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost,
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

Lose their taste for kissing?

Eliza Baleanu,"I've searched through every city; every country
To find a girl (the perfect girl)
A girl who'll be the one; the one to marry
To marry me (to marry me)

I came I saw I conquered just like Caesar
Or so it seems (yes so it seems)
A knight in shining armour on a charger
The stuff of dreams (the stuff of dreams).

Mamma Mia what am I to do?
All these beauties, which one will I choose?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?
I just don't know who it should be  

So, I'll take them home to mama and let her decide for me.
In Spain I met Maria; full of fire
What Latin style
In France it was Elisa; such a teaser

That made me smile
The English girl was pretty what a pity
She was so shy, I wonder why?
And Lorna from California I should warn ya

Was free and wild, and I mean wild!
Mama Mia, what a mess I'm in!
Endless choices, where do I begin?
Could it be her? Or maybe her?

Perhaps Suzanne or Emily?
How will I know if she's the girl to love and hold eternally?
O, I'll take her home to mama and let her decide for me!",Home to Mamma,2005
Eliza Carthy,"Oh no
Here comes that sun again
That means another day
Without you my friend

And it hurts me
To look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more
To have to be with somebody else
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away

With so many people
To love in my life
Why do I worry
About one

But you put the ""happy""
In my ""ness""
You put the good times
Into my fun
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door

We've tried the goodbye
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Than you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you
Than live in this pain and misery

They say time will
Make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows
And turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down
And once again you my friend are nowhere to be found
And it's so hard to do
And so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk on, walk on, turn and head for the door, just walk away.",Walk Away,1998
Eliza Carthy,"I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore
Why they didn't tell me before
I have never been sure

And I sat and listened for hours
To boys that I'm not sure I liked
My evenings have passed me by

I have made myself a fool
In the company of men
I have cried in the night
With no light and then done it again

And they always think 
All I want is to stay
When what I really want
Is to get my fix and then get away

Now I don't want to be popular
And I don't want to be liked anymore
I don't want to be one of the beautiful people
Cause beautiful people are boring

I've given blowjobs on couches
To men who didn't want me anymore

Eliza Carthy,"Last night when I saw him
Last night last week
When I saw my lover with a flush in his cheek
I went up to the window and I held out my hand
He's a demon lover and a spiritual man

But I think somebody will tell him
'Cause they think that he ought to know
I've been looking from my bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching in your bedroom window
It's the skin I'm catching
Maybe I'll see you around tomorrow

Well I seek him in candlelight
Why do I seek
I can love his body and I don't have to speak
Well I stood by his shoulder and I blew on his fave
In his eyes were the pastures of a much greener place

But I think that stitches will mend him
And his feet choose a path that they know
Looking from his bedroom window and falling in love

I've been found out, what's my mother gonna say
But I was dragged down to a level of dismay

I'm in trouble 'cause I've been watching
Watching from your bedroom window
That's the train I'm catching

People fly by, in the traffics boom
Knowing, just where you are blowing
Getting to where you should be going

don't let them get you down
Making you feel quilty about
Golden rain, will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve and now

Climbing, forever trying
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
Now there's no justice
Only yourself that you can trust in

And I said high tide, mid afternoon

Eliza Carthy,"Willie Moore was a young man, his age 21 and he courted a damsel fair
Oh, her eyes were as white as a diamond after night and a wavy jet black wore her hair
He courted her by night and day until marriage they did agree
Oh, but when he came to get her parents' consent they said it could never be

She threw herself in Willie Moore's hands as often they've done before
Oh, but little did he think as he left her that night, sweet Annie he would see no more
It was about the 10th of may, a time i remember it well
That very same night little Annie disappeared in a way no tongue can tell

Sweet Annie was loved both far and near, she had friends almost all around
And near a little brook not far from her home the body of sweet Annie were found
Her parents now are left alone, one mourns while the other'n weeps
And near a grassy mound outside the cottage door the body of sweet Annie sleeps

Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say from the moment they both did part
And his last day was spent near his true lover's grave where he died of a broken heart",Willie Moore,2001
Eliza Doolittle,"If I woke up in the mornin'
And the world was back to front
There was sunshine in the evenin'
And the moon came out for lunch

I wouldn't mind walkin' backwards with you
At least we'd always know where we'd be goin' to
We could talk till we forget how to talk

And we could learn to laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

If everyone was gettin' young
There'd be a smile on your face
If all the friends that passed away
Came back to this place

We'd be puttin' down the daisies
Drinkin' milk and feelin' lazy
There's no sense in any senses
What's the use in independence?

We could play of the tears that came
We could walk till we forget how to walk
And cool till we forget anything at all

And we would laugh again
Like when we were children
We could learn to dance again
Like nobody is watchin'

We could learn to look right
Into each others eyes
'Cause we got nothin' to hide

We got nothin' but to laugh again
Like when we were children
Like when we were children

Back to front, front to back
Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

Front to back, back to front
Will you come backwards with me
Backwards with me?

We could learn to laugh again

We could learn to dance again

We could learn to smile again

Eliza Doolittle,"I don't have the reflection,
Of anybody checking their face,
In the shade of my glasses,
One way ticket on the fast train,
And I'm solo all the way.

I could maybe read a novel,
To push away the trouble,
That sits in the pit of my tummy,
But I know that it will find me,
When I finish the last page.

An empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey, 
No hand held in mine,
No I'll never, sever any time,
Tired of the journey,
No hand held in mine.

Will I always feel it more,
On a day when there's a storm,
Or a raincloud, so dangerous and lonely,
No one ever told me,
That the darkness is my fault.

And I'm looking out the window,
And losing both my dimples,
As they enter the ends of my smile,
'Cause I am a thousand miles,
From the place I need to go.

And empty hand I wave goodbye,
I feel a tickle in my eye.

I know you'll never change
Stinging me with your attitude
I've got the mind to walk away

I really don't like your arrogance
Or your policies
You're ninety-nine percent an embarrassment
Of just wrong (?) qualities

I don't mind it when you (whistles)
Brings out the best in me when you (whistles)
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
That you are the best in me

I like it when you (whistles)
Can I have some please of that (whistles)
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
So you are the best in me

I really don't like your skinny jeans
So take them off for me
Show me what you've got underneath
So we can do this properly

I really don't like the way you smile
When you think you're right
But I will forgive you, the yoke is in the middle
And we're chewing through the wire

I don't mind it when you (whistles)
Brings out the best in me when you (whistles)

I like it when you (whistles)
Can I have some please of that (whistles)
Satisfy my needs
Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
So you are the best in me

I dreamt that you were on a train
And you were leaving, you were leaving
Made me think of what I'd miss
Do you believe it, you believe it

I don't mind it when you (whistles)
Brings out the best in me when you (whistles)
Show your expertise
When the night always ends with a fight I'm excited
That you'll wind up next to me

I like it when you (whistles)
Can I have some please of that (whistles)

Sometimes I fake that I hate you and make up
So you are the best in me

Got my boxes by the door
Sorting through my memories
Cross legged on the floor

My diaries and scrapbooks, oh
They seem to take me there
I was always posh spice and you wore zigzags in your hair

Would you know, know
Know me
If you saw me
Saw me, saw me
Nothing but hopes and living the moment
Where we were meant to be
Ooooohhhh
Those days don't seem so far
When I'm flicking trough my old Polaroid
Photographs
Me and yoooouuuuuu
You always made me laugh
Dancing to cassette tape singles
That was big when I was little
Big when I was little
Big when I was little
Jut like Malcom in the middle
That was big when I was little

Oh this box is haunting me
I can't throw it away
School reports and birthdays cards
Feels like yesterday
Clip on diamantes
Makes me think of Friday nights
Leaving after class with me on the back of your bike

Would you know me, know me
Know me
If you saw me
Saw me, saw me
Nothing but hopes and living the moment

They were big when I was little

Super nitendo
And club nights at Bagleys
Smirnoff ice
Open mic nights and Acne wonder where you ended up
'Cause I just can't thank you enough
Avirex jackets and strawberry ribena
Nike tn's dreams of Wembley arena

Ooooohhhh

Once there were valleys where rivers used to run 
Once there was blue sky with white clouds high above 
Once they were part of an everlasting love 
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields 

Greenfields are gone now  parched by the sun 
Gone from the valleys where rivers used to run 
Gone with the cold wind that swept into my heart 
Gone with the lovers who let their dreams depart 
Where are the greenfields that we used to roam?

I'll never know what made you run away 
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?
I only know there's nothing here for me 
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see

And make promises by the hours

Valentines can't buy her

Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
Some speak of the future

In ceremonies of the horsemen

She knows too much to argue or to judge

Feeding off the plates of an un-united nation

Here don't change

With a lover in the street whose waiting to make a connection
To be the mother to the soul of your next abortion
She'll steal your money with the eyes of a baby's complexion
Then she'll laugh at you and your sexual invention

Smelling like a rose, in the flowers of devotion
Devoted the heat of a spotlight in motion
With a face full of mud even though you were only joking
As if you really understood the value of isolation

Asleep at the wheel
No windshield
But you know that the streets
Here don't change

With the smile you gives just to keep your mouth from closin'

Locked in neutral your engines are broken
Like candle wax that sun melts into the ocean

Like the moon that lights the tracks of the old train station

And not hold a gun in the face of the Earth's abduction

And learn to measure the stars.

I'm really worried about living.
How could it come to this?
Yeah I really want to know about this.

Then there came a day.
It moved out 'cross the Mediterranean.
Came to western isles and the freak young men.
And with their silver beards they laughed
At the unknown universe.
They could sit and guess God's name.

But they said,
How could it come to this?
We're really worried about living.
How could it come to this.
Yeah, we really want to know about this.
Is it like today?

Then there followed days of Kings, Empires and revolution.
Blood just looks the same when you open the veins.
But sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone.
But the furrowed brow has never left his face.

He said,
How could it come to this?
We've been living in a landslide!
How could it come to this?
Yeah, we really want to know about this.

Then there came a day, man packed up,
Flew off from the planet.
He went to the moon,

Eliza Gilkyson,"Once upon a time in a far off land
Wise men saw a sign and set out aross the sand
Songs of praise to sing, they travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring, guided by the light
They chased a brand new star, ever towards the west
Across the mountains far, but when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes, they'd come so many miles
And the miracle they prized was nothing but a child

Nothing but a child could wash these tears away
Or guide a weary world into the light of day
And nothing but a child could help erase these miles

The light below and the light within

[Chorus]
You mustn't try to push the planets 'round
It's enough to put your next foot on the ground
'Cause after all you know we all fall down, we all fall down
You shouldn't try to rearrange the cosmos
Just gotta keep a steady eye on the telescope
'Cause in the end you know we all fall down, we all fall down
'Cause after everything we all fall down, we all fall down

Time will bring the sun once more
This I know, this I'm sure
Show us what we're waiting for
Bring you back to my door
Time will bring you back around
Never doubt, never doubt
Turn the echo back around
Note by note, sound by sound
Time will will bring us back, time will bring us back

Elizabeth Ashley,"Far away far away
Are not all lovely things far away
As far at least lies that valley
As the bedridden sun in the luminous east
The paralyzed mountains, the sickly river
Are not all things lovely far away
Are not all things lovely far away

It is a valley where time is not interrupted
Where its history shall not be interpreted
Stories of Satan's dart of angel wings
Unhappy things
Within the valley of unrest

The sun ray dripped all red
The dell was silent
All the people having gone to war
Leaving no interrogator to mind
The willful looting the pale past knowledge
The sly mysterious stars
The unguarded flowers leaning
The tulips overhead paler
The terror stricken sky
Rolling like a waterfall
Over the horizon's fiery wall
A visage full of meaning

How the unhappy shall confess
As Roderick watches like a human eye
While violets and lilies wave
Like banners in the sky
Hovering over and above a grave
As dew drops on the freshly planted eternal dew
Coming down in gems
There's no use to pretend
Though gorgeous clouds fly
Roderick, like the human eye has closed forever
Far away far away

Roderick, whatever thy image may be
Roderick, no magic shall sever the music from thee
Thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep
Oh tortured day
The strains still arrive
I hear the bells
I have kept my vigilance
Rain dancing in the rhythm of a shower
Over what guilty spirit to not hear the beating
To not hear the beating heart
But only tears of perfect moan
Only tears of perfect moan",The Valley of Unrest,2003

Enchantment is borne on the breeze
And clothes in the silver of tender moonlight

Within them a soft flame gently glows
The breath of the night wind is filled with the scent of the rose

Your love in the heart of a rose

I have a dream of you
Fashioned of starlight
Perfume of roses and dew

Our paths may sever
But I'll remember forever
Deep in my heart, dear
I'll always dream of you

I've waited a lifetime for someone to say
The things you are saying to me
And darling, believe every word that I say
Just look in my eyes and you'll see
You smile and my tears have all melted away
My worries were all false and naught

It looks like the start of a beautiful day
Just holding you here in my arms
With you every day's a beautiful day
As long as I'm here in your arms

Elizabeth Elmore,"There was a stage and a pier up in western Massachusetts,
And the kids came from miles around to get messed up on the music.
And she drove down from Boden with a carload of girlfriends,
To meet some boys and maybe eat some mushrooms
And they did and she got sick
And now she's pinned and way too shaky.
She don't wanna tell the doctor everything she's taken
The paramedics hovered over her like a somber mourning family
They gave her activating charcoal, they flooded her with saline

Her:
""I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent,
They gave me oranges and cigarettes.""

He was rough around the edges:
He'd been to school, but never finished,
He'd been to jail, but never prison.
It was his first day off in forever, man
The festival seemed like a pretty good plan,
Cruise some chicks and get a sun-tan.
And his friend gave him four, but said only take one,
But then he got bored and ended up taking all four.
Ah, so now my man ain't that bored anyways,
The paramedics found him: he was shaking on the side of the stage.

Him:
""Everything was spinning and I came to in the chillout tent,
They gave me oranges and cigarettes.""
Her:
""I got really hot and then I came to in the chillout tent""
Both:
""They gave us oranges and cigarettes.""

She looked just like a baby bird, all new and wet and trying to light a Parliament
He quoted her some poetry, he's Tennyson in denim and sheepskin.
He looked a lot like Izzy Stradlin.
They started kissing when the nurses took off their IVs,
It was kinda sexy, but it was kinda creepy.
Their mouths were fizzy with the cherry cola,
They had the privacy of bedsheets
And all the other kids were mostly in comas.

Her:
""He was kinda cute, we kinda kicked it in the chillout tent,
And I never saw that boy again.""
Him:
""She was pretty cool, we kinda kicked in the chillout tent,
And I never saw that girl again.""

With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
And eyes made out of coal

Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say
He was made of snow, but the children know
That he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around

Frosty the snowman was as live as he could be
And the children say he could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day
So he said 'Let's run and have some fun, now
Before I melt away.'

Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'

He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic stop
He only paused a moment when he heard them holler 'Stop!'

Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying, 'Don't you cry
I'll be back again, someday.'

Pale moon is casting shadows from above

To and fro you sway, my heart's in time, I've learned to care!

Always like making the scene with Elizabeth

Why don't we just leave them all behind?

I got our friends pissed off and I don't know what to say
When they ask me how I feel I just turn away
I only wanna talk to her about it
It's not their concern

They got their own ideas about the way it should be
How can I tell them what she means to me now?
They'd never understand

I've got half a million bills to pay, you never hear a word I say - I dream of you,

Oh I feel so incomplete, oh, oh, it seems so incomplete,
If we could only close the distance,
If we could only cross these lines,
If we could only fill the space that's grown between us over time,

You don't hear me anymore, you don't touch me anymore, you don't know me anymore.

There's a wedding dress in a suitcase full of memories in the attic - I think of you,
Where the ghosts of summer butterflies they gather in the dust - I long for you,

Oh I feel so incomplete, oh, oh it seems so incomplete,
If we could only bring those days back when there were never wounds to heal,
When everything was perfect and the dream we had was real,

You don't hear me anymore, you don't touch me anymore, you don't know me anymore.

Oh I feel so incomplete, oh, oh it seems so incomplete,
When there were never any questions over who or what we were,
And the future only promised all the answers to our prayers

To justify the emptiness inside
No need to pray and turn for guidance to the Providence:
It simply won't provide.
No need to ask your friends 
For well-intentioned Good Advice

É que procuram em quem se agarrar
E você pra mim foi uma delas
Que no tempo em que eram belas viam tudo diferente do que é
Agora que não mais encanta, procura imitar a planta
As plantas que morrem de pé
E eu lhe agradeço por de mim ter se lembrado
Dentre tanto desgraçado que em sua vida passou
Homem que é homem faz qual o cedro que perfuma o machado que o derrubou
