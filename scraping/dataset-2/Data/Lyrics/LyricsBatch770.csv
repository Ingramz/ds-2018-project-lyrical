Natiruts,"Tempo ensinou, pra ter liberdade
Mais que amor, devo ter coragem
Pode trocar sua jóia cara
Por três cores de um pôr de sol
Ou seis animais de Deus
Por três cores de um pôr de sol
Se um sentimento meu
For a tempo de tocar
Um pêlo de corpo seu
Terei permissão pra dar
Coisas que não posso ver
Apenas posso sentir
É a vontade de ver o meu povo sorrir
Poder falar de novo
Não me deixe só
Seu destino é meu
E minha vida sofrerá se eu não vir longe
Seu sorriso sob o sol
E golfinhos sobre o mar",Praia dos Golfinhos,2003
Natiruts,"Se o dia te chamou, não demora
Pra buscar o que sonhou não tem hora
Muitos vão menosprezar a sua vida
Muitas setas vão mudar a saída
Um verdadeiro amor pode ajudar
Mas a vida nem sempre é assim
O carro que leva flores na prosperidade
As costas vem atropelar na hora da verdade
Tenha os olhos sempre abertos
Ou o mundo vai te engolir
Seja simples mas esperto
O que é seu, vai conseguir
Se o dia te chamou, não demora
Pra buscar o que sonhou não tem hora
Faça a mente adormecida agora se erguer
E dissemine ideias nobres em versos plebeus
Um golpe que passou pra derrubar
Nunca pode te levar ao fim
Quem tem brilho ainda precisa de fé e vontade
E batalhar que o tempo sempre trás toda a verdade",Tenha Olhos Sempre Abertos,2003
Natiruts,"Cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora
O meu cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora

Acordamos de manhã bem cedo para trabalhar
Deixando em casa os filhos, com olhar de esperança
Acreditando que alguns poucos homens venham a se lembrar
Do que prometeram iô iô, na tarde de um belo dia

Guardo até hoje a camisa que você me deu
Que dizia em letras grandes o Brasil é todo seu
Mas só que eu não me lembrei de então perguntar
Se um dia iô iô, esse homem ia voltar
A pisar na lama ao menos para agradecer
Com a mesma falsidade a quem o fez enriquecer

É, é difícil meu irmão, mas se você não tentar
Não pense que eles tentarão, não
É, é difícil meu irmão, mas se você não tentar
Não pense que eles tentarão, porque

Quem te governa não quer saber de você
Quem te governa não quer te ver feliz
Quem te governa não quer te ver sorrir
Quem te governa não merece ter nascido aqui no Brasil, no Brasil!

Cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora
O meu cantar (meu cantar), não deixa a alegria ir embora

O que adianta brigar por mudanças se nós
Não nos dermos as mãos, caminharmos todos juntos
O que adianta a gente reivindicar se lutamos entre nós
Matamos nossas crianças

Guardo até hoje a camisa que você me deu
Que dizia em letras grandes o Brasil é todo seu
Mas só que eu não me lembrei de então perguntar
Se um dia iô iô, esse homem ia voltar

A pisar na lama ao menos para agradecer
Com a mesma falsidade a quem o fez enriquecer",Cantar,2004
Natiruts,"No seu pensamento sou rei 
E o certo caminho eu não sei 
Há mil formas para sorrir 
Só uma para ser feliz

No espaço lancei uma canção que vai 
Uma linda canção pra mostrar
Força nos dreadlocks que só o tempo traz 
Que só o tempo traz
O bem que ela me fez, a noite toda dancei 
Se a onda não está aqui 
Talvez não possa sentir 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 

Só eu andei (solidão) 
Não encontrei (flor maior) 
Se amarrou receba o sorriso e tudo que é bom 

Dreadlocks longe estão dos seus valores 
Sinais dos pobres homens e suas cores 
Mas a música que te faz 
Ser feliz pra mim é demais 
E os segredos assim se revelarão 
E os receios só se quebram 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela 
Eu e ela",Eu E Ela,2004
Natiruts,"Olhe, vá em frente, não se esqueça
Liberdade dentro da cabeça
E a cabeça fora do que há
De mal pra você

Ouvindo a música, sentindo o que ela me traz
Subo até as estrelas para entender como é que se faz, faz, faz
Para esquecer a dor que os meus olhos não conseguem ver
Destrua o meu coração que estará destruindo você 

Você é filho da terra, dadiva dada por seu Deus
A fome dos meus filhos não será a riqueza dos seus
Ô chama que destrói, corrói o que é belo, tudo o que faz bem
Controle suas palavras, minha liberdade não pertence a ninguém
Mas o amor pode chegar, iluminar e colorir 

Quando um coração está cansado de ver
As lágrimas da rosa ao ver o espinho morrer
Mas, o carcará foi dizer à rosa
Que a luz dos cristais vem da lua nova e do girassol

Olhe vá em frente não se esqueça
Liberdade dentro da cabeça
E a cabeça fora do que há de mal para você

Olhe vá em frente não se esqueça
Liberdade dentro da cabeça
E a cabeça fora do que há de mal",O Carcara E a Rosa,2004
Natiruts,"Eu sou surfista do Lago Paranoá 
Eu sou surfista do Lago Paranoá

É meio-dia e eu vejo a seca castigar
Quinze por cento é a umidade relativa do are
Eu vou ao clube a fim de me refrescar
Mas sinto falta de uma maré pra me levar

Aí eu vejo a piscina de ondas funcionar
E na TV surf brazuca arrebentar
Eu logo tiro uma conclusão elementar
Vou comprar uma prancha
Pra no mundo do surfe me entregar

Eu sou surfista do Lago Paranoá 
Eu sou surfista do Lago Paranoá

Eu sei que o Hawaí não é aqui
Que o mar está longe daqui
Mas pra quê que eu quero o mar
Se eu tenho o lago pra mim?
Prometo que eu vou me esforçar
Pra um dia no topo eu chegar
E o mundo vai conhecer
Surf lacustre que eu vou desenvolver

Eu sou surfista do Lago Paranoá

Natiruts,"Enfrentarei todo o mal, só pra te ver
Junto da boca do mar, quero viver
A musa do meu astral, mentalize
Para acalmar geral, verbalize

Todas as luzes e todos os sons
E nem a claridade de um sonho bom vai 
Abrir os meus olhos e a minha cabeça
Se pra toda a idéia eu tiver uma barreira
Faço o que faço, sou o que sou
E de nada importa o que se falou
Dos versos do povo dessa tradição
Eu quero é cantar pro resto dessa vida",Verbalize,2004
Natiruts,"Pelo meu amor
Vou fazer tudo que for
Vou cantar
Vou sofrer
Me atrever e ser feliz
Eu quis voar
E trazer mais uma flor
E viver gritar correr

Quem diz que não
Vai saber o que sentiu
Sempre há sol pelo Brasil
Sempre há tempo de amar
E tentar outra vez",Bossa Nova Em Kingston,2005
Natiruts,"Eu sinto o cheiro de flor
Quando eu penso em você eu sinto um cheiro de flor
Quando eu penso em você me faz curar de toda dor

O Reggae é uma expressão de pura paz e amor
É o remédio para qualquer alma que está a sofrer
Sua beleza à terra do samba encantou
Como a flor mais singela que ofereço pra você
Mas não esqueça que esse mundo também tem muita dor
E que é preciso ter amor para enfrentar o que lhe faz sofrer
Vamos rimando fácil assim
E desejando a paz no fim
Terei coragem de chorar e jogarei flores no mar e brilho pra te merecer
Quem foi que disse que o dread não gostava de sambar

Jamais deixe nossa fé morrer!

E vem o sol que já vai brilhar traz a criança num banho de mar
Juro não fingir
Eu sei posso tentar
Ser eu depois você
Ser livre para amar
Não podemos fugir
Deixa o amor florescer",Cheiro de Flor,2005
Natiruts,"Quando surgi um tempo de esperança
Não vá pensar, não vá pensar
Que ao virar a esquina haverá mudança
Brilharemos pelos que virão por causa de nós
E da intervenção divina
Que abençoou abençoou a claridez da nossa sina
Canções ao violão libertando o coração
Oh Deus!

Deus perdoe a pobreza da nobreza
Deus proteja a vida de quem quer que seja
Eu eternamente cantarei a paz
Eu eternamente cantarei o amor
Eu eternamente cantarei para você mãe natureza
E quando o amor bater não vou deixar fugir
E a luz da esperança vai reacender
Do infinito a força para reagir e sumir com a dor",Eu Eternamente Cantarei a Paz,2005

Ainda há muito
O que aprender
Com África Bambata
E Salassiê
Com Bob Marley e Chuck D
O reggae, o hip hop
Às vezes não é esse
Que está aí
Sequela, a violência
Entrando pelo rádio
Pela tela
E você só sente quando falta
O rango na panela
Nunca aprende
Só se prende, não se defende
Se acorrenta, toma o mal
Traga o mal, experimenta

Que não percebi

E o fã já não
Te admira mais

Não colhi os favos de mel
Borboleta foi embora 
Mas casulo ficou 
Folha de bananeira minha cama pra deitar 
Mesmo que eu não queira 
Tô sem seu amor 

Até pensei que a brisa que passou 
Trouxesse os frutos amargos que o vento arrancou 
Mas lembrei, brisa não leva rancor 
Só sementes leves que ela tocou 

Vou pedir pra Deus trazer pra mim 
Cordão de couro, anel de marfim 
Pra proteger o chão de minha amada 
Pra proteger a nossa casa",Casulo,2006

Onde estará a fonte que esconde a vida

Os anos passam sem parar

Das angústias desse meu viver

E deixa a promessa de um dia voltar
Para os braços daquela que te quer bem
Se ela te deixou e disse que nunca mais
Saiba que levou sentimentos imortais
Mas se ela te beijou e disse que vai ficar
Isso são mistérios não se pode explicar
Ela diz que precisa-se acreditar
E vê nos astros coisas que não pode-se pensar (Ela foi aos céus)

Ela jura aquela volta prometida
E justifica alguma barra que ela passou
Mas ela sabe muito bem dos seus segredos
E reconhece que isso tudo pode ter um fim (Pode terminar)

E oferece para ele com perdão enfim

Couplet 1 :

et moi dans tout ça
j'ai l'im-pres-sion que je n'e-xis-te pas

ne te dé-file pas quand je te parle dis-moi pour-quoi

quand c'est pour moi tu ne fais pas comme ça
qu'est'ce que tu cherches en a-gis-sant comme ça

Couplet 2 :

Gandhi a dit
La violence jamais ne te grandit
Pourtant, j'ai envie d'oublier ce que le grand sage a dit
Dis-moi où tu vas
Tu sais tu n't'en tireras comme ça
Alors regarde-moi et dis-moi ce qui n'va pas

Pour les autres, tu as toujours un sourire
Pour les autres, ton meilleur côté à offrir
Alors dis le moi, je veux que tu sois là

Native Nod,"I see no stability in history
Since we're finding lies upon lies upon lies
Yet you base your life on inconsistencies
None of which have any backings provable
I'm not saying it's bunk to learn
What we believe happened before
Because they've all agreed upon the lie
And it's probably somewhere near the truth

But I'd much rather base my life
Around anything that's here before my eyes
Anything that's tangible
Anything that's a definite fact
Resting on the laws of physics
Everything we need to know
To solve our problems
Is here
Somewhere
Around us

Traffic for days
Let me walk a bit and I'll see where it get me

Didn't plan for death on the subway

Could've been me

Those summer days, that crazy phase
Like a jack-knifed car on the highway

Just two mad situations
Fire on the news, fire on TV
A bus, a train station
The crossfire sights of destiny

Now it's all gone slow motion, everything slow motion

I'm all out of emotion, I'm out of emotion

I go my own way but still I let you take me home
I love you till the morning but then I'l be done
These streets are my home darling
That's why I'm with them and not with you
I'll walk these streets till my feet turn black and blue
So you can call me a trooper or call me a lost soul
'Cause everywhere I roam, is my home
She called me many name but still I stay the same 
And she said you'll never see me again, but okay
So I... Smile and wave goodbye
While she.... Smiles trying not to cry
And still she don't know why.

Chorus:

She said she love me but she don't know why
She don't know, She don't know why. (x4)

Verse 2:

She said the only way I communicate is through my song
Well she likes to talk and I hate to listen but she just carries on
Bah dah dit dah dit dah day, scum dumb diddly dee dah day
Yes I communicate through song
She says unemotinally I ""?"" myself 
And that my pride is too strong
So I and I stand alone, Yes I continue to womanise
I give them a bit of my soul, for a piece of their pie
And still she, she calls me from time to time
Asking herself ""Why oh Why""

So I call her right back ask 'what time are you coming over?'
Turns up at mine, half nine, never on time
Looking oh so so fine

We stay up late and talk about our dreams
Oh how they differ but we'll make them meet
See she's got ambitions, and I've got visions
She's doing hers, I'm doing mine
Keep telling her that we'll be fine

She's here to see her in the city lover
We fight the cold together under cover
I hope tonight will be no different from the others
As we set the scene, set the scene

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I reached over and turned out the light

She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I broke into my come here smile
She looked at me with those bedroom eyes
I realize, I realize

The suns gone down and the demons on the street come out to play
City lights light up, drinkers drink up, ravers rave
Meanwhile we're inside, me and my girl
I tell her it's your world, she says mine and we're doing all right tonight
While I play my guitar she reads her magazines
She giggles in the background looking at the singers and the beauty queens
I turn around, to look at mine, I feel inspired
I write a couple lines and over to her I slide

There's no more trains coming this way
You better make your way home, son
There's something going down in London

Well, that ain't gonna stop me
So I step out the station and what do I see?
Traffic for days
Let me walk a bit and I'll see where it get me

Then it all went slow motion, everything slow motion
First came the flash of lights then the sound of explosion
And we're still in slow motion, we're still in slow motion

On these streets where I played
And these trains that I take, I saw fire
But now I've seen the city change in
Oh, so many ways, since the days of fire
Since the days of fire

Now I'm on the train, going that way
There were too many people coming this way
Delayed trains, delayed trains
Didn't plan for death on the subway

So I step out the station
Brazilian name all over TV
Realization, I was on the next train
Could've been me

Then it all went slow motion, everything slow motion
First the flash of light then the rise of emotion
And I'm still in slow motion, I'm still in slow motion

On these streets where I played
And these trains that I take, I saw fire
But now I've seen the city change in
Oh, so many ways, since the days of fire
Since the days of fire

One day going that way, one day going this way
Those summer days, that crazy phase
Like a jack-knifed car on the highway

Just two mad situations
Fire on the news, fire on TV
A bus, a train station
The crossfire sights of destiny

Now it's all gone slow motion, everything slow motion
The lights gone out, I feel no more emotion
I'm all out of emotion, I'm out of emotion

On these streets where I played
And these trains that I take, I saw fire
But now I've seen the city change in
Oh, so many ways, since the days of fire

Natural,"I recall
Back when we were eight years old
We'd close our eyes
Dream about the places we'd go
You and me
Built castles in the sand
We were the King and Queen
And we had the perfect plan
I woke up last night
Couldn't get it out of my mind
The things we dreamt
Just about a thousand times
We gotta' live our lives
And fate will take us there
We gotta' head out on the highway
With no fear

[Chorus:]
It's now or never
We can make it on our own
All I see is you and me
We can take our dreams and go

And I remember
All the things that helped us grow
I just know that this is now or never
It's the perfect time to go
So we turn
And head out on the open road
We left everything
That we used to call our home
We want the perfect world
And we'll find it out there
Cause the sun is always shining
Somewhere

[Chorus]

So leave the past
And don't look back
We'll never be the same
And for all time
With your hand in mine
We'll make it through the rain

My heart can hear it a three-dimensional sound
On the distant horizon
Things I don't know,outside my window
I want to see them clearly
I'll leave the light on,I don't know how long
I'll be traveling...so much faster...
Who's to know when I'll be back to see you again

From the promises I made inside
Yeah even when the skies are grey
I just take a leep of faith and fly

See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out

It was a beautiful day

In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always tryna diss back
If niggas keep telling you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps wrestle you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
Till I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringing the wrong raps to combat
Like bringing a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats

Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, seem him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'

Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews

Hand to hand on them street corners claiming you king

They got me shook up plus my nut was disturbed
Hide the chocolate pickin' up shells form off the carpet
Baracaiding the door for war like a hostage
It's my crib, got my name on the lease
Can't explain niggas just get arrained and released
But who snitched set me up, I think it's you bitch
Sacrificing my life for you two kids? 
Truth is, I got a business to lose eyewitness news 
Paper tellin' bitches to move, police turned this into a zoo
Mad reporters, I laugh as I'm sippin' my brew

Slapped her to calm her

It's senseless, enter my crib and can't prevent this
Blockin' my enterence, trying to knock it off the hindges

Just flushed the last hundred grams nigga subduct the math

Spoke to my rat heard him ask where the coke at
Predicate felon hope to never go back
They had survelance aware of all dealings
Knew about bitches that liked to shoot and loot kept in ceilings
Searching my spot behind curtains stay cursing
Chief of police finally meet him in person
But I just flushed the yayo what could he say do
Trying to flip on me, once was on the payroll
Trying to laylow he can't find what he need

Then the pussy, still rock gold fronts 
Turned out, no doubt

Yo I did it all when I was fuckin' wit the thugs 
Traditional, plus a nigga pops sold drugs 
Yo impeccable like the fuckin' Chinese rugs 
Still sexual, bone'en bitches right in the clubs

And get domestic 
Mad cause I don't fuck em like I use to

Soldiers small faces painted on the walls

Ending up by the jaw of the throat another law broke

Closing down spots popping a knot
Heard the foremores use binoculars watchin' the blocks
Calling phantom on the tape 
I'm the phantom of the wax
Now meat the man behind the music examing the facts 
I use it to my advantage, do this shit everyday 
Like sneaking gats up in grade eight 
Six Flags catch me getting on the popular rides
If a nigga violate, he get top of the line
Small hot ones locked in the spines
Transformed, roll out, pass it off to my man, no doubt
I keep shits disguising six shirts in the trunk
Imagine it gets six times worse when I'm drunk
Prepare for death first of the month
Open and rise, t's right here in front of you open your eyes
I can't explain it 'cause it's not normal 
Is niggas loyal, I talk about life and live it for you, this shit is soil

with some nosey friends
Six deep in a old BM
pushin' it to the limit
ripped up seats with cushion in it
change on the rug

while she drives, somethin' called dangerous love
got a airbag on both sides, no lie
doin' shit the average hoes don't try

Why does Uncle Sam got us held back

Dun, it ain't what you wear its what you drive
Them crackers in the bank don't give a fuck if you live
No affense, but y'all just gotta know that its tense
I'm energized everytime I rhyme I go the length
From point A to point Z you must have slept
I guess you never realize how high my joints be
So turn it up I found a new way to earn a buck
Rapping for the people hustlers and murderers
Doctors and lawers cops and Tom Sawyers
Type niggas ball players earning nice figures
Everybody play my shit loud at every party
Bitches get dicked down

Play it on the radio on different stations
It's something that you gotta have, like immunization
I came too far to stop in my tracks
Probably have a charge if it wasn't for rap
With my royalties, payin off lawyer's fees
My niggas be gorillas, fuck authority

influential, never stable in the mental
but clever, spittin' that same shit niggas is into
I'll bleed for the craft if I have to, think rational
lovin' money and weed, pussy and fast food
tatoo a dead Man's name on my arm
I'm a thug in the street that's still afraid of his Moms
everyday I watch a player get robbed, player get popped
I try to drink the pain away and pray that it stops
in the mornin' head straight to the spot, the juice bar
niggas tried all that other shit and what's the use God?

bottles mo' proof
for all the problems that a nigga go through
it's forever real 
'cause some scars can never heal
I'd rather throw the cards in and pray I get a better deal
guns excite me, keep atleast a hundred Wifey's
my duns up in the pens ya'll need to write me
street cadets, alias names and re-arrests
it doesn't take much to know that wrieffer helps relieve the stress
we make moves or get caught for the loot

gettin' chips from an alternate route 
but the same breed

livin' in a Man's World, still belongs to a tribe
took the family along for the ride
watch 'em eat
now I'm movin' with the same cats that'll rock me to sleep
never close your eyes, learn to roll with the wise
'cause some niggas 'll talk shit and play close to the sides
while I call the shots 
and stay supportin' the block
we livin' above the law until all of it stops
I still open doors, a thug nigga overall
and if you ain't know then black Man go for yours.

Chorus 'till fade...",Man's World,2000
Nature,"Yo Nate, shit is crazy, I shook hands with mad dead niggas yo, all the
Niggas that used to be on the block, Ill Will, Marty, Black Ed, yo Son
Mad niggas is gone, rest in peace though

Fifty-Two blocks, Gazelle frames
Bald heads and heavy chains
Somehow caught in the game
Back in '83, before cable TV
When these so called thug niggas played in the street
I used to hear the stories
Live niggas here before me
Like the Rich Porters, the Fat Cats, the Pauly's
Outlaw league, from the street to the Pen
Eyes glossy, niggas only speak when they bent
Off the perfect mixture
Forcin' down herbs and liquor
Only hot slugs 'll hurt ya quicker
Think it out and elevate, I gave years to the state
As a 92-are-7478, it set me straight
The changing of a stubborn cat
The one that used to hustle on the block mad hard and loved to rap
In goose down coats and wool hats, the youth in me
I guess life on the streets ain't what it used to be

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

Straight shots of Hen with no chaser
Mo' paper, stubborn, hard headed like Joe Frazier
The Gremlins, the pack that I come with
Keep gats by the stomach
Act up and stack hundreds
Niggas don't want it, see me I be the ring leader, Lion tamer
Do the bankhead and Macarena
A black entertainer, bottom line
Ya'll niggas know who got the hottest rhymes
Face it, I got the whole globe on some Nate shit
Straight from the corners to the covers of the latest Rap Pages
Turn the Projects to black Vegas
Don Kingin' niggas, make 'em sign blank papers
It's the American way, do my enemies pray or is it just me?
Hustlin', hopin' the fiends trust me
Talkin' to us, hold up, let me walk you through this
Wannabe pimps, hoes, often shooters
Niggas need to know what the truth is
Fuck the sarcasm
I miss my nigga Mark but God has 'em
When I see his flics I start spazzin'
I learned to let it go
But I guess livin' this life a nigga never know

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

I used to love Starters, thug garments
Boppin' into Spofford, R.O.R. on drug charges
Writin' on walls, fluorescent markers and krylon
Savin' my loot to buy a firearm
Broken safety, borough hall and Jay street
Hopped the train not knowin' that a fall awaits me
Problems came when I started slingin'
Late night I hear revolvers ringin'
The echos cause cops to start Rodney Kingin'
Many riots, is there any silence?
Everybody sipped Henny, hustled with many clients
Growin' up on the same block my Pops was raised
Rocked waves, blend tapes playin' on hot days
Brought the speakers out
Police made us put the wrieffer out
Peep it, I was too young to leave the house
I'm tryin' to see the World, runnin' the streets without a care
I remember it well 'cause I was there

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

I remember
When niggas used to live it up, live it up
Flashin' dough all night
I remember
When niggas didn't give a fuck, gettin' drunk
Shootin' guns all night

causing deep discussions
brothers that fight might only speak to cousins
rugged life but niggas in my fleet is stubborn
grandma's they turn to Stella's when they need some loving
my name holds weight, bigger than a Saint Bernard
some think because its rap that it ain't a job
think again, i try to sepearate my do's from don'ts
niggas be slittin they wrist, losing they hoes
some dudes be confused when they broke
misrabale, looking death in the eye don't blink quick to smile
my hoodrats be women now,  ?? lot
y'all'a always be my bitches lonely or not
how much ass can i pass up?  tilt your glass up
this one's for the kids in Arkansas that shot they class up
when I smoke I like my hash crushed believe it or not
Q-be	 forever niggas keeping it locked

smoking cheeba   
some supply it some'll grow it
reefer
some'll buy it some'll roll it
the chronic
if you try'd it then you know it

I play cards with Ray Charles
cheat for a grand

Trayino, Mike G should read his feet}?
Play these niggas
now in 98 no time to graze niggas
cause they might tell
white judges, like the icegrill
hoes set you up-the same way that Pac and Mike fell
Private affairs if I know your wife well
switch to  different subjects
some of the styles that I hit you up with
I make it hard for you to kick your tough shit
major adjustments 
i package a flame for all you bustas
wrapped up put on a shelf full of substance
i drug clicks,  anti-biotic, rarely spotted
niggas hear my name periodic
I feel we got it King of New York
only the real'll cop it

Chorus

I been all across the world on my quest for some herb
spots be selling dirt keep the federal resevere
smoking in bongs, niggas know that its 'dro in the Bronx
I like that stinky green shit that be growing in swamps
Half-Baked puff, puff, then you pass it to me
good weed'll make you eat the last shit on your plate
forget your songs separate stix from stones
if your chronic come with stix leave that shit alone

Nature,"I rap for all thug cliques bloods and crips
niggas who hate the cameras and loving the chips
caught in solitude old timers taught me how to move
fort apache Queensbridge corner athlete
at 6-1 170 plus
Hennyed up walk around like I could never be touched
the whole clique be heavily truck
peep the style though
tricking house notes and whips on these foul hoes
wild as Alpo crack crusade rap bu-ffets
a rare site like blacks in toupees
keep the Rollie shinin' true players know the science
and those that's behind me be the Giants 
while y'all are Jets
last place niggas minor threats
stay on the move till it's time to rest
ain't it bugged?
 so take it back to the time Rickle's with Doug
I used to fiend to hear my shit in the club
torchin it for the less fortunate y'all need to watch me
bitches start to swarm like the paparazzi
pussy and money it made me cocky
celebrity getting no sleep
drinking heavily and live the life some will never see

(chorus) 
I got a fist full of dollars (and you talking that shit)
rich rap scholar (and you talking that shit)
we plan to live forever (don't be talking that shit)
you better get your shit together (stop talking that shit)
it's the top of the division (still talking that shit)
knock'em out position ('cause we talking that shit)
anything can happen (so don't be talking that shit)
now watch me go platinum (just for talking that shit)

1's for the money 2's for the weed spot
undercover cops follow me though they need not
it's like I'm Rick James 
caught in the mix rockin' thick chains
from hood to hood ain't shit changed
supplying hits
the type of cat hoes eye and dip
tricking the same loot that some'll try and flip
why attempt to go against the livest clique?
Firm knowing you'll burn soon as the fire's lit
and by the time it sets in I'll be a veteran
aiming for the waistline hit you at the midsection
trick questions for game shows
call me arrogant too thugged out who do you blame though
payroll the whole clique salute the rich
moving out of the hood kids play where we used to piss
niggaas is humorous it's Nature who this?
claiming desperado aim shoot and they miss
but the fact is I'm giving back to the bridge
from the athletes to the hoes and blow trafficers
I'll do anything to be the man
from competing with fam 
hold guns squeeze with either hand
it's like I'm ambidexterous somehow stress this
talking about blowing knowing the family's restless
how many ways can you correct this?
so with that I exit I guees it's up to the experts

You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to kill that noise

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin

Group aspirations or ghetto illustions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building

Get ranked on, we beat niggas numb

We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar

The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, are fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your hoe, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth

Tryin to get me for that ice that lay on my wrist
It's like flippin on your wife, cause I made her my bitch
Feel me? I play with any card you niggaz deal me
Every nigga out the fam is guilty, I plead the fifth
Queens niggaz be the strength, the lock and chain
Thugs on the block know I got the game
You mighta heard me with The Firm and forgot my name, pardon me
It's N-A-T-you-are-E
The latest Barkley's, known to smack niggaz nonchalantly
Queensbridge, same hood as Nas and Mobb Deep
Ghettofabulous, class of nine-eight my fellow graduates
Well known savages, we elbow cabbages
Niggaz better duck or I'ma spray a round
I make it like the O.K. Corral, blazin 'til I lay 'em down

Fuck what y'all thought, y'all know the answer, is psychological
Tone and Poke beats, make me write phenomenal
I give lifetime scars like drama do, it's gangsta chronicles
Turn to page one, hurricanes come, I call 'em twisters
It's deeper than life Dunn, I'm four dimensions
More suspensions, SV-12; gettin pressed my cassettes need shells
Fuckin Mets need help
It's therapeutic, I lay it out clear
Y'all niggaz better use it
Nowhere else you find better music
You try to find it in the hall of fame
My man's callin shit fire, I just call it flame

Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
Queens to the heart from the start it was Run and them
No love faggot MC's respect none of them
Niggaz stop mumblin, get popped you're fumblin
Regulatin raps to rocks the block's bubblin
Five percent days, in the Bridge bobbin off calente
Wise enough to drop out the 10th grade
Hold that thought, twist up nigga, roll that short
Catch me with my chick that let me go back door
Hall of famer, don't make me shoot your game up
At close range, stand back watch the toast flame
Yo it's funny, the way a nigga act like that
It's only money, that make a nigga rap like that
Keep a roscoe, peep me on the Chris Rock show
You either beat me or you get your eye swoll, y'all know the rules

Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

Whoo, for the old school
Unh, unh, ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Rrricky... D!

Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty
Where people wore pijamas and went to bed early
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout
Tried to help lead black folk the right route
Delayed,Negative voices, many, once in prison 
for unwise choices that he once made
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)
So check the gift, everything no negative
That's what happens when you 
steer black folk away from negative
Not to mention chasin' charts, killin' 'em
There'll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick
Demise sent, can't mess with the mindset
Come run with us, December 1999 said
It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love, you took your love, you took your love
You took your love away from me

Chop the pie up, four ways, get lyed up
Infiltrate, never violate get tied up
It's all a chess game, choose sides, the best remains
True lies, vibes die when bums infest the game
Bogus shit shots, you woke but let your man get locked
I love this hip-hop, stock the bank let the Crist pop
Peep the next shit, push a big Benz, fuck a Lexus
The streets was hectic, so I stacked and made my exit
More doe to get, focus my thoughts for me to go legit
Ferosious shit, cop a huge castle, on the ocean cliff
Imagine that, a few years back, I was baggin' cracks
Magnum gats, playin' street corners, commitin' savage acts
Twistin' up, nuttin' but love, for niggas sittin' up
Hold your own, try comin' home wit out gettin' touched
Two for one, laws made foul how they do the young

Keep us from simply, unifyin', organizin'

I'd rather be civilizin', enterprisin', improvisin'

Told me leave those 85ers alone, blend wit the wise men
That buy 80 G stones, twin Mercedes at homes
Fuck a juck, spend 10 Gs alone on chrome
When I die they'll take my chromosomes and clone clones
Two hundred and eight bones

24 seve, the same shit, playin' the strip livin' dangerous
Bottle after bottle, soon became a ritual
The patterens we follow, others found 'em difficult
I guess it's obvious
As to what my hobby is
The root of all evil, pollute the scene niggas by the kids
Gettin' caught up, the same game done left 'em all stuck
I reminisce on V.S. touchin' my fourth cup
Me? My only problem is I'm more fucked
Knowin' in my heart I can't sleep, till I bust off nuts
Weed religion, for all my niggas that beat the system
And those bentin', sittin' since Conico Vision
why'all need to listen, it's journalistic
why'all hear the whispers ""Niggas in The Firm is twisted.""
Spit that fly shit that earn the bitches
Whip the chrome six up the F.D.R.
It's blessed we are 
See I never let 'em strees me god, forever stress free
While twistin' up logs of that Nestle
Who are you to question me? It's just my destiny
To kick back, kill time, and live successfully

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
A yo, for years I been buyin' my coke from the same cat
Dominican nigga who look black (that's right)
This summer I heard that (ha!)
I see me always swerve wit a (give it up!) where the bird at (yeah)
Apocalyptic, I pop biscuits (apocalypse), my bitch is topless
Not too excited I skeet skeet my own boxes
Drama King got the drama goods (bluh, bluh, bluh!)
Same place as the Domin' Osama Hood
Shoot up the thug and still puttin' the dame on it
The pimps had to give me a cup wit my name on it
I was ""Gordito""
I'm still Gordo or ""Gito""
Still know how to get the raw dough for cheap-o (cheap)
I'm lastin' all palm wit the connect of a ""perico"" (parakeet)
N.O.R.E. got no manners (no manners!)
I take a picture of ya ""culo"" wit the phone cameras
Go into ya own banners (ha!), they say my ballin' so hot like lone candles
And port or part of Santiago wit my own hammers (oh!)

[Chorus: Jaheim, Left Gunz]

[Verse 2: Nature]
Nature, alright, the year 2000 and 4 the War Report (port)
Niggaz make it out the hood, it's a small reward (ward)
We all fucked up and mauled cause that's all we saw (alright)
Tryin' to rob from the the rich and let the poor get poor (poor)
Or rob the poor cause niggaz be the hungriest (my niggaz)
I'm on the Internet - catch me on your Buddy List (I'll be in trouble, ha!)
Catch me where the money is, megas and millions (megas)
And the barrel got the kick of 11 guerillas (shout!)
Seen niggaz get hit and lose a whole lot of blood (what?)
When a nigga legit, a nigga knowin' how to stunt (stunt)
Uptown, Downtown, go wherever he at (wherever he at)
Nigga make it implication, shit better be fat (shit better)
Nigga small talk, it's all talk - let it be that (let it be that)
I get pussy from my friends (pussy!) give my enemies clap (ha ha!)
You don't want me on ya block (you don't want me) niggaz better be strapped
So relax nigga

You could look and see I'm Dirty Jerz down to the zippers on my sweats (oh)
Far from the type of cat that pay a bitch's rent
I got a +Fox+ like +Vivica+ and never gave her +50 Cent+ (ha ha!)
And I bet you ain't ready for war yet (uh)
My niggaz got stripes, who walk around like the Barbershop Quartet? (ooh!)
It's no way to harm this nigga
I don't need no bitch to pump eye until my arms get bigger
Still a problem in this the rap game, problem in the street
Yo Slay, they havin' problems, we can solve em wit the heat

That's when ya whole shit splattered all across the front porch in momma crib
And wit a couple hot slugs get behind ya ribs (ooh!)

Three'd be hat trick
Gave him more shots than the pediatrics
Came to his house and shot his left hand out
Left him with more scars than Mr. Def Jam South
To reach the sky, how far would a star go
To handle more cigars than a Cuban cargo
Makin money from everything I spoke in this
Wrapped by more ice than a broken wrist
Got ability to make missy a little tipsy
I'm more P.I.M.P than Mississippi (git it? Uh!)

I know you like to show off you're bust in gowns
'cause you go around jugglin guys nuts around
And we don't gotta wait till you're ass confesses
'cause you go around showing off you're ass in dresses
You watchin porn sittin there at you're macintosh
With you're hand in you're ass like you're jackin off
And you try goin harder than star wars Anakin
'cause you practice at you're house with a anus manikin

got a belt full of steel you can call me santa
You better keep your eyes peeled like a fuckin banana
And don't try to shoot me like some dumb retards
'cause I miss bullets like I'm sendin them e-cards 
Always equipped with the vest so don't aim for the bell-ay
'cause I dodge bullets like I play for LA
And I'm invisible 'cause you can't even see me son
But you're soft as shit I could shoot you with a bb gun
They call me stretch where I'm from 'cause I'm extended out
Find your ass in my house and I'll send it out
I got a custom made gun so the cops link my shot
So far.. how many mother fuckers do you think I got?

I can't call it, it's going too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never recorded

At a thousand degree Celsius I make MCs melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain
I walk across the Sun barefoot looking for shade
I rearrange your ribcage like a twelve gauge at close range
And change the position of your brain
My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that
Nigga, get ya wig peeled back
I scalp you like the Indians on horseback
Running Bull will hit you harder than running back

Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks
Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back
Heads is flipping like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analogue tapes to digital DATs
It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that
In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always tryna diss back
If niggas keep telling you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps wrestle you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
Till I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringing the wrong raps to combat
Like bringing a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats
Y'all niggas is wack, rapping over microphone feedback

Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, seem him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'

Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews
Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules
Incog another HAMO- D’s involved involved

Hand to hand on them street corners claiming you king

Stashing my riches, pass traditions like Olympics pass the torch flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts

Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill
Genetically form grade A pedigree
Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free

Reminiscing when they use to call me desperate
Minor drawbacks, I had to learn not to fuck with small cats

It's time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way
Predicting platnum in less then a day
So for that we toast amongst us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Seeing my dreams come true stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politician with the wisest brothers
It's Nature one of the greatest peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From now 'till the day that I'm stiff, fowl flagerant pay the rent
Always stay swift, stuck in my ways type shovanistic
Since a youth I had a thing for big jewels
Flooded rings and older bitches, holding my riches
In lump sums for trust funds fully recoved thugs lust to bust guns
While niggas get drunk beat wifes and cuss sons
A slow process called life, let's show progress

Don Cortes, white rags cherry bently
Cop shines from Italy speak money language fluently
Never fuck with the nastiest flashiest
Bought a house as big as Scarface to show my happiness
Rackin' the 6 0's for those that want to get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spread a mill small bills
Bring a smile to an ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue light a philly cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Salute with chill Remy gently escort four ladies an arm
The four caesars at the club Pentleys condo sweets I'm fancy

Yeah, I better pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming
Ooh cause the way you make me feel I feel like ooh screaming

Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now if you just wanna front, you know my styles tight
Niggas never should of plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tangeray 60 inch screen when we hang with Dre
I just flew in from Queens no bag and plan to stay
In the heat park this Royals Royce up in the beat
Seeing topless bitches rollerblading in the street

While I lounge in a jacuzzi sky cliff blue got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too, how we do?
Hit trees Cristal bottles, breeze tropical spread love till we wobble

Nature,"Five minutes to flush

Nature:
They say they just want to question me the interuption
4 in the morning they knocked and caught me fuckin'
Throw on something mad provocative play with the top lock
Buy me some time so I can hide the shit kinda quick
Move the guns clip the herb  
They got me shook up plus my nut was disturbed
Hide the chocolate pickin' up shells form off the carpet
Baracaiding the door for war like a hostage
It's my crib, got my name on the lease
Can't explain niggas just get arrained and released
But who snitched set me up, I think it's you bitch
Sacrificing my life for you two kids? 
Truth is, I got a business to lose eyewitness news 
Paper tellin' bitches to move, police turned this into a zoo
Mad reporters, I laugh as I'm sippin' my brew
They think they caught us

Hook:
4 in the morning Feds are out at the door
What you gonna do? 
What you gonna do when they come through for you?
Ooh ee ooh ee ooh ee yeah yeah yeah yeah
4 minutes left

Nature:
About a minute went by they knocked harder
My bitch went hysterical in shock
Slapped her to calm her
4-4 cocked to armor
It's been a long day now I raid with jakes playin' in the hallway
It's senseless, enter my crib and can't prevent this
Blockin' my enterence, trying to knock it off the hindges
Battering rams coming inches, my hoe was buggin'
Throw a fit thowin' puttin' coke in the oven
Like I'm Larry Davis the phone rang some D.A. bitch
""Nature turn yourself in"" I didn't say shit
Knowin' in my heart I'm a stay rich
It's abusing, confusing them until they lose patience
Try to ease up, calm my nerves with the cheeba
Hoping the door doesn't fall before the keys flush
Thieves rush, plus the riot squad
No surrender no retreat shit's deep but times is hard

Hook

Nature:
By the time they had busted in I had touched the cash
Just flushed the last hundred grams nigga subduct the math
They made me either that or let them take me
Still in my night clothes fake like I'm asleep
Spoke to my rat heard him ask where the coke at
Predicate felon hope to never go back
They had survelance aware of all dealings
Knew about bitches that liked to shoot and loot kept in ceilings
Searching my spot behind curtains stay cursing
Chief of police finally meet him in person
But I just flushed the yayo what could he say do
Trying to flip on me, once was on the payroll
Trying to laylow he can't find what he need
So instead I'm cuffed taken down for some weed
But it's just for a short say, I call the Firm then emerge
On the streets to return the next court day

Shoulda known she was a bitch that we both could'a boned
To post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone

Caught em sleeping in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights right off the Deacon
Feel awful speaking, for some reason feel the phone's tapped

We rich now, milk the whole cow, split the growth

Fluid in the windsheild wipes gone this light storm
That's forming in the sky, you coming home tomorrow
Will you drive or will you fly - hold up, my other side

Sending two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Asking your whereabouts, I gave em no leads
For all the nigga know them hoes fuck with police

Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too

Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose

?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit

Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get hed in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get hed too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue

Who in the hell wanna battle, the ill mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you ??
Motherfucker clueminati 98'

Nature Boy Jim Kelly,"Where there's a will there's a way, you can get it
The old daily grind drags you down, if you let it
We all soldier on, holding our head up high

Shoot from the hip make it quick but don't sweat it
Or here's a tip, zip your lip and forget it
Whichever way, worries gonna waste your time

Oh release me now
We don't need this anymore
Just release me now
Work out what we're fighting for

Don't be a fool blow your cool burning bridges
Use self control good as gold, get the riches
It all boils down, down to what we want

Don't dwell on doubt cast it out and dispel it
Seen tougher times and survived, lived to tell it
You've heard all the words, and now you gotta get it done

Oh release me now
We don't need this anymore
Just release me now
Work out what we're fighting for

Oh release me now

Nature's Touch,"Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2000
Nature's Touch,"The day is my enemy, the night my friend,
For I'm always so alone
Till the day draws to an end.

And the moon comes through,
To the monotone of the evening's drone
I'm all alone with you.

All through the night,
I delight in your love,
All through the night, you're so close to me.
All through the night, from a height far above,
You and your love brings me ecstasy.

When dawn comes to waken me
You're never there at all.

Roll up your sleeves, pull down you're hood

'Cause there's only one way, one way to fix it
One way, one way to make it better
One way to get out of this place if you want it

If you want it you can fix it, there's many who have dared
I tried, I've been inside for twenty two years
You could lose everything, they could bury you here
Very few leave in a merry mood here
But you never knew I've been in every room here
I know a few secrets that very few share, but listen
They don't even notice me, a bit of courtesy to clean the dirt you leave
It's a one way street can you work with me?
It's a five-star suite, something lurks beneath
Don't scratch the surface, don't turn a cheek
Don't speak of anything you have heard or seen
The lonely ignore you, the more you speak
And don't forget to wash your hands before you leave
There's something fishy in Cabana, maybe its the piranhas
This place will turn you crazy, think they're saving me for afters

'Cause there's only one way, one way to fix it
One way, one way to make it better
One way to get out of this place if you want it

Can't sleep or breathe, the heat is boiling
And in between good and evil, don't eat the poison
Follow your heart, if you can't beat them, join them
Walk into reception, seek employment
There's one way to change if two of us can make it
Why is it the bad things that always feel the greatest?
Bottle of grey goose, you're wearing the same suit
But you don't look as good as you did when you came through
Blunt in your suave shoes, be wearin' the blame truth
They say you and the devil are sharin' the same rooms
That's the very thing that threatens you
Overcome that demon and there's meaning in the methods used
There was never no hell or armada

Sometimes we gotta break away if we wanna make a change

(one way)
With their worst fears, will they remain the same?
Is this hotel the perfect place to stay?

It's a shame we fell apart
We could've been more amazing
Crashed after we discovered
Our very own lane

13's on my Impala, raw cone filled with chronic smoke
Homie, I got game like the Shuttlesworth fam
Milk these lames for what they worth
HUF socks, ashes on my shirt, three wheel motion all you motherfuckers
The Porsche in the garage then got a life for my dogs
I had nothing at all but now I take trips to Vegas
Rolling up, playing songs on my oldies playlist
Diamonds on my fist, Rollie on my wrist, my life's the shit

Standing over the terrace, made so much last year
These lil' niggas should be embarrassed
Claim we the same, but the difference is apparent
Copy my style so much they got me like 'where the fuck is their parents?'
Smoking so much that the public think it's scary
But I don't give a fuck, I'm rolling another one up
And giving middle fingers to you little fucks
Who get online and say I suck, long time you rolling papers and wearing chucks
And I ain't even had my best year, ten cars, 20 million, fuck I'mma do next year?

Oh yeah, that's bout as funny as Barbara Bush in a bobsled
Now how wrong can you be to think we play
Even a broken clock is right at least twice a day
So now ya feeling real low, ya no flow-crow
You slow hobo, stiffer than Robo
Oh, here's another side of being real quick
You might speak it fulla cracks, but you still ain't 
So don't try at those same style battle cry
I rock the you-train, the routes that I battle by
I listen to sister shit, it til they quite slow
No matter that white rap, shoot a Pharaoh with a psycho
Put down ya handgun, up which'cha hands son
Look cops they come, I ain't the damned one
I was only three steps from a peace prize
Pieces laid, piece of his eyes and his left thigh
Knuckle up, put em up, yeah guard your grill
And that's coming from Illtown, down the hill

They want me to come and come up faster, that could be arranged
Dump the last of the matinee, 'cause they couldn't stand the damn rain
The pain's the same, the game remains mine

Bite the head off a snake
Chew up from the first to last break and shoot 'em in the face

Give it up 'cause I'm hot wit' a warm hate
I won't stop, pop, til that head is screwed on straight

Instead he bit, instead of lookin me eye-to-eye, then I
Knew he was truly through, dumb plus the one

Hand the bill until paid is a coastguard 
The sonar  sounds that will throw your 
Feet to no more no tour show more 
First ability deeper agility 
No harassment pass the humility 
A new style blessed with a few styles 
Rhyme'll shine on I'm on a new prowl 
Clap your hands in the evening 
Come on y'all, say ""It's alright"" before leaving 
I like a party, over pumped and lovely 
All who flow, show, you think you love me 
Bow in the balcony, say ""Oww"" for me (Ow) 
Now dance, so shall we?
All night long to a long, good, strong song 
Hug, the rhyme'll shine on much stronger 
A tougher chart buster went tutta 
Summer, been back through another 
Autumn, I'm calling ya all in 
And falling off like a soft man stalling
A party's live and it dies it when I'm gone 
I'm born to see that the rhyme'll shine on

From the tongue of a great one, I'm prepared for basin 
Many are waiting, ain't in to tasting 
A song which is on and long but still cock-strong 
Wit an R&B cross on 
A switch tip, different from the last hit 
Uniquely Yorky, groovy and graphic 
A new rap? This is more than just that 
When I'm back, you know I'm strapped wit hot tracks 
And in fact, it takes the break to shake that 
Hottie of a body, waiting to get snatched 
Put a dip to the hip then come back wit 
Some ol' new improved holy

Involve the self in, many are melting

Praise is profits, systems knock it 
Who? But this ain't as smooth as I get 
A 90-man clan, a slam jam, bam stand 
And I can can, play and cram fans 
In any form or fashion, time for the cashing 
Throw em rhythm and rapping 
Half of half of even their half, then half of that half 
I smash when I rap

You got beef  well what we do  talk to the bunny  sunny 
He's the man  Bugs the thug wit the money 
Funny that you should mention as my family  they covered 
Wassup to my cousins and my sisters and my Warner Brothers 
Birds of a feather, flap and fold and be together 
No matter what your whatever, endeavor, find us better 
You mean he, she, them, him, those and others 
Let's kill two ducks in one, pluck, initiate the trouble 
For those who disagree, I maybe feel the need to front it 
Show me your whole entire crew, two shoes and I'ma run it 
Do you want it? Maybe so, but just know, we're rolling spreads 
You claim you want it but you need it just about as much as a hole in ya head 
This is a flow-er show, a product float a while ago 
With a new swing, I think so, bring it, sing it, act like you know 
And if ya don't, you won't by the time this track is done

Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's time for rum, man, yeah man 
Every time they coming at the dance, what you know 
It's for jamming, g'yeah know?

For candle after candle and still couldn't wax this

Check the check and who's def? Who's left ya? 
Standing back canning ya, plan ta stay back

Twelve years, twelve hundred, twelve inches and sold one 
Who's getting done? Who's swifter? Who's badder?

Naughty by Nature,"Yoke the Joker!

There are too many overnight emcees but one
And too many whacked who haven't paid dues
You have now entered the path of the Flavor Unit
And we are Naughty By Nature, and we will just do, by terminating you

I can snap, rap, pack, click-clack, patter-pat-pat
Take that ass to the point you have to ask for your ass back
A fucking joker smoker, taunted by no one
If I was born in Chung Li's temple I would've turned out a shogun
Smack the any-and-all talk, jokers I can't hawk
And all that shit I hear about me losing is small talk
I ain't a punk, I'll slot ya, furthermore I don't scare chief
The reason I called you 'pussy' 'cause you are what you eat, each
Look is a little closer to the center of a blowpipe
Don't speak when I am talking, this is my fucking shop
How dare you even try me? Don't you know you be funky, while
You're smiling backstage doing mother, ugh, doggy style
Hot, wild, raw, whores' still suave
Check out this style that I've
Soul-simulated, sounds from a stocky
Semi-social, never seem sloppy
See silly slapping suckers, sorry saps and slouchers
Straps slamming stouch, macking this mass is savvy
We see so-so-songs and some shots, so
Snaps stepping separate, start slowly, go solo
Set the cassette stereo, sounds diffing
Stood the Sagittarian, some marriage is a system
Smoke the joker, three times over
And owe her, go with the flow
Or I'm about to yoke a joker

All that straight faced shit like your heart had been through
Smile and give your face something the fuck to do
You're ugly, smugly, squiggly, dilly-wrinkled faced bastard
Someone needs to hit and run ya to run ya ass over backwards
Let's giddy up, yep yep, another fuck up
Grab your microphone, battle time shown up
Any freestyle I see while I prowl
I dial a new style, tell me about ooh-chow
Another victory, it's mystery
I smoke your skull, your brain'll come blistery
All fuzzy, dirty, dizzy, does he
Get the things he needs? Remember how blistery?
You ain't ready for the Freddy of rap
You can't kill me, I step into your dreams, you feel me
Slicin' your life away, just like I might today
I eat you the psycho way, I'm ripping shit right away,
I treat ya like a bitch in a ditch off of angel dust
Take you to a sure you can fly, just jump slut
You think you might say, a rhyme, then someone might order like
You couldn't wet shit up in a motherfucking water fight
All luck y'all, look at the props y'all
So proud I'm sure, suck my encore's
Swinging a bolo, your flow goes solo
I'll smoke ya
It's time to yoke the joker

The only way you would be getting dis jump like a girlie
Is if your father would've bothered to pull it out early
You ain't got a single drip drop, you're stripped of hip-hop
If I see ya disagreeing, you'll be getting your shit dropped
It's extended version, the side you can't fuck with
You'll get the jimmy MC, you're swift to kick the bucket
I'm tired of Mr. Nice Guy, place your price high
Bet on a battle rhymer, tell my chances are sky high
Never would you ever get the thriller, say y'all sweat
""Ya know that kid Treach, I took him out, he was no threat""
Because you know I'm better than that on my worst day
Taking competition's what I do in the worst way

Quick to do a hit, for you most likely I spoiled ya
I bored and ignored ya, then boringly floored ya
The proof is in the footing, my collar ain't wooden
It takes more than an axe to tax, bless the children
Physically, facially, racially made to be
Crazily paid or G, what a fucking way to be
Hot damn, I'm a man with a hand plan
This smack that then attract the new game plan
Eat your big beef, digest the rest, test
Shit, I was slept yet, then go to the next step
That's what I do, that's what I say, that's what I live
That's what I prove, that's what I move, that's what I give
Making other brothers want to go home and write shit
Bite what I might get, then up and say ""I quit""

I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you want to know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the are to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something  
Different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it, sorta properly
I say the last P stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me  
Exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cause he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Chorus]

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'cause after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn, skippy I'm with it

Mic check 1-2, strap it up, load the beat, cock the mic
And your rhyme better be fat, or you might have to fight
Yeah, there`s no escape from the terrordome
You know I`m nice when I`m bustin' fat rhymes on the metronome

MC`s never pass the mic to the Foxxx, cause
Once I bust a fat rhyme, you be a has-was
I beat you down on stage and when the battle`s over
You`ll be leaving your show in a hearse Nova

I`m flippin' the x`s three times and I`m back again
See, on my way down stage they had me strapped in
But once I hit New York and they losened the chains
I went and bought me a Tec, now I`m wild, insane

I`m on a hunt for a rapper who want to turn singer
I got my beat-em-down bat and a itchy finger
So if you`re nice with the mic and you want to flip
I`m the rap bounty hunter and it`s time to get yo ass whipped

Yeah, I`m comin' from the streets, pop
And please fight back, so you can get dropped
It`s time to see who`s nice and who can really rap
I smack the taste out your mouth, you want to be a mack

I`m not tryin' to shake the water and wake the gator

If a rapper disrespect me I smack him in his mouth
I tow him in a yoke, grab him by his throat - boom! then I knock him out
I keep heat and keep the clips in my sock
When my glock get hot you punk niggas better leave the block

Yeah, Freddie Foxx on a rampage
Every time I touch the mic the police is standin' front stage
'Cause I been labeled as a troublemaker
I send my baddest girl to your house to play the heart breaker

She`ll lay you down and put hickeys on your chest
Then turn around and blast you with a .33 shot Tec
You couldn`t rap, you was wack from the get-go
So you got bumped off by my head hoe

Called by the Militant Mack, my mentality is jail
Long as I`m strapped I can`t fail
Check this, I take the bass and I bust you in the eye with it
A piece of steel with a screen on top, I`m gettin fly with it

I`m bringin' suckers to the street again
'Cause them same broke-ass niggas ridin' on my meat again
Mr. Microphone flipped the beat again
Suckers got caught with the rhyme, felt the heat again

I`m breakin' it down, lettin' you know I`m never lettin' go
I beat your brother down, punk, just to let you know
This is hip-hop, gee, not `hit pop`
You mess around with the beats, get your boots knocked

I`ma slide, I`m in her when I see you suckers later

Well, to hell with you and your fat-o with the gurtle neck
So ol` golddigger, dig some dirt, there you have it
Want ring or a marriage, go get the carrot from a rabbit
Before I stab him for his lucky foot

Hit him with a puffy hook, hit the hare, now look how lucky looks
I`m not a chip on your shoulder, I`m a boulder on a path
Left a gash, you catch a headache in your ass
Class I`m disrespectin', I won`t see you trippin', clown

Shh - when I do, you be trippin', slippin' and fallin' down
All`s left to call cops
When I smack you with a leather wig and make you suckers suede bald spots
Chip-chop, flip the hip-hop, I chuckle

Many snap in a trap now new minds explode

Locked in a facility where time is froze

They give a man a cell quick before they give a man work
So we get into this black, this black cat syndrome
Grow older like there's no heart and no soul ingrown
Bars and cement instead of help for our people
Jails ain't nothing but the slave day sequel
Trying to flee the trap of this nation
Seeing penitentiary's the plan ta plant the new plantation
They say we'll take the animals from cottons and crops
Straight to forgotten wit locks plotting to rotting our stocks
They draw a crooked line and wait for your foot ta fall under
Serving most of my brothers another football number

Nowadays still we're captured, still hear wicked laughter while shackled
We're beaten and battered then cuffed after we're tackled

Hit one more time wit a black jack then dragged in the precinct
Still don't know what the back and forth, looking meaner, meant stripped
Made into a convict, booked then fingerprinted
How many more times of this humiliation?
How many more bouts do we have to lose while we fight for our rights in

I'm putting it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning
My skills, niggas I been rocking since lee twillz
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find
Thinking
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme shrinking
The sleeping MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spanking ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lesser, a man should never challenge a clan

Looking for the pink in poo poo.
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jamming ta while we planning ta jam
We bust plus we're the party

Men and even mannequins.
You're a fan again now I want to know whose the man again?

Steady breaking to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang

Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up. 
Shakes shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like your with us if not zip up 
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard 
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters 
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies

But sunshine was pretty as Puerto Ricans, so that thought went down wit the sunset

Get strapped up like the Mad Hatter, lips between hips like Mick Jagger's
Do some cabin stabbing like a dagger
Just cool, let's wet up the pool and rub-a-dub
Trade your dud for a stud, busting more than suds in a tub
So I love it when ya let it get it
Get thirsty like a dry reservoir, never sore when I wet it
Say pathetic but I say sunshine is super, put that poonany on the roof

Who loves ya best? 

Treat me like your young lady 
Special things you say to me 
Feels so good to be with you my baby 
Doesn't matter what they think

There's no need to feel ashamed because you're on my mind 

And every time I say ""I love you"" it's with a pride 
And every time I say ""I need you"" it's from inside 
Because my heart is forever,the things you do 
You do just for me,that's why I love you baby

And make you wish for the next night

Now here we go
I say I kick looking all rich
Like ya'll picked six in lotto
Money and menage is your motto
We follow with bottles
Of Henney and Remy, the gang and Uncle Vinnie
Get plenty, more like Demi
Come and get me
Are we eye to eye and are we mouth to mouth
Cuz the way down town's a hop skip and a bounce
Ya see I'll penetrate ya inner space
After a winner date, dinner date
Ain't no way, no where, no place I'll spend a day
Penetration

When big is you gonna feel it
From your ass to ever tight
You into bondage and ass smacks
You're rough boo
Yo style is why you tell me to cuff you
When I fuck you
The way you suck, oh
Makes me always wanna touch you
And I don't pay for ass
The way I fuck I want a buck too
Who needs a swinger, the thug or a malingerer, boo
You don't need a man, that's you and T-Boz
With them fingers but
I ain't mad if you goin' touch yourself
Cuz with this you ain't never got to fuck yourself
See, I'm your water man in your big cahona
You know when they sayin' packers run with a bullet
That ain't no rap list
Piling punanies, one frontwards, one backwards
On a broke ass mattress
Fix up and ask me how I like it hot
I go uh uh uh, menage-a-tois
Penetration

Some say I'm from rags to riches
From snitches to fishes
Who's the man? Shit I even got bitches after my bitches
From bitch to butch I'll fix the tooche
With one look
You be beggin' the three leg nigga to push
We had what four three hosematic who fought from pork
He was an heir from dook he even ate pussy
At the orgey for me
After they boned us they road us in two lex's and a Lotus
Other bitches showed us

Shock G and Hakeem would call and fuss cause they know we all kicked up dust
You remember when the cabby said daddy wouldn't pick up our RACE
You beat his ass then you spit in his face
I remember on the set from the trailer feens stole your jewels
and Big Stretch punched him out his shoes
Back then I was taken stashes quick who holdin
That's when every piece of bud I was rolen was stolen
we would laugh at the jacks over six packs and yacks
spit the emos over demos thinken ladies and lemos
you was a wild motherfucker who could never sit still

so I'm lookin in her eyes while they walkin me through

so we got over that, you held up got locked

Organized block cinemas away from the prison
With souls, lost rows and so on
Fall victim to the streets and so much can go wrong
Rebels meet crumble and majesties for salaries
Out of towners and goose downers introduce pounders
A lay loot for power evil roots shoot through cowards
Lettin other niggas just regulate they hours
Coke or chronic, philly roll millie by his scrotum

Dirty South, Dirty Jerz, nigga fuck what ya heard

Us big niggaz get pussy while songs get cooked
Fuck rough rhymes get hooked and young minds get shook

Not gon' play, don't fake, don't stop to rest don't pause none
Top dough top pro on bitches
Chop funk, not gon' bitch ass niggaz

Breast stroke the whole Mississippi to represent THE FUCKIN SOUTH

Bust dust to dust and turn ashes to ashes in masses
I'm massive mashing bastards faster
Question bout my pimping tell your bitch to ask it
Chip-chop like all tops the store stops (it stops here)
Cause I'm raws likes strawberries on shortstops (it comes now)
The Beast from the East, the big future for the Pharaoh
Diss my crew, do some spine travel on gravel
Some fuhrilla shit, go and, peel your shit

Naughty by Nature,"OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P, well, that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you want to know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the are to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong 'cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)

Who's down with OPP  (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something
Different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it, sorta properly
I say the last P stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me
Exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cause he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
Who's down with OPP  (All the homies)

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'cause after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn, skippy I'm with it

You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me)

Then I thought of a plan and you called me a pervert 
Shit, hurtin and you beefin cause I want you to jerk it? 
I wish I knew your booty call was a coochie brawl 
I woulda had a better ball at the booty bar 
Balls swole like a bowl with my dick in the dirt 
Shoulda wait til you got up and went and jumped in your purse 
See you felt below the belt, while I kiss it you hug it 
Ain't come to suck or fuck it, shit you ain't have to TOUCH IT 
My thang was cool, takin a nap on my lap 
Then you rub it til my balls catch a cramp from the back 
Smoke the tight sack, sport the nightcap, you spoke it right back 
Balls black and blue, nuts stingin like a spiked bat 
You ain't right rat! DAMN! DAMN! 

You're givin me the blues 

Girl I've got the blues (said I've got the blues) 

Wit yo' TEASIN ass 

It's all because of you 

You know what? You ain't leavin 

And those freaky things you do 

Get your hat, get your coat 

Your purse, and get out! 
You're givin me the blues 
Girl I've got the blues (is it the blues) 
It's all because of you (no no no no no no no)

So niggaz wan' take it there, huh?
Heh..
See y'all don't know what the fuck goin on
I know what time it is yo

It's time to erase a face in force in fact an inferno
Rise in my eyes, these twin 9'sll make em learn though
You poppin, plottin, plannin, half-steppin, threatenin
The streets clap loud like like thunderCLOUDS with the weapon
I'm steppin, to clarify, lookin with the hawk
in the arrow eye, turn the biggest part of your ass
into the narrow side, I'm that case you place, nigga
Tie yo' bitch, to the shitter nigga, throw yo' stinkin ass
by the liver nigga, need beef, I rag fags
Scream peace, get dragged dad
Gettin busy like Rashid street, in Baghdad
Havin your kids askin why did they have to drag dad, past
cause you'll be the last ass to blast fast
Way, above the rim
Word to Birdie I'm from Jersey leavin niggaz actin nerdy
Back sturdy, my dirt, by my lonely, FUCK with dis
Doin hits with more clutch, than the stick, so COME ON

Chorus: Treach

I do my dirt all by my lonely ""Hey!"" Find the phony
Past the mass, one deep, yeah the only
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin patrollin in a stolen black Cougar
I do my dirt all by my lonely ""Hey!""  ""Hey!""
	""Can't nobody hold me.. I do my dirt all by lonely""
Do or die, with slugs for the Ruger
Rollin patrollin in a stolen black Cougar

[Vinnie]
See I'm a one man dynasty; motherfucker
every artist on your label don't equal HALF of me
Rippin lyrics like they supposed to be, most'll be
plottin dreamin and scheamin to get CLOSE to me
Cause I spit shit, rip shit quick, and I'm sick wit
lyrics to MASH that ass is what I'm equipped wit
So fine-tune that bullshit, bring your best competitor
I'll be on that ass as if I was a fuckin Predator
Niggaz want to battle at a show, yeah I'll set it up
I go toe to toe, blow for blow and leave it wetted up
My time to hypnotize you, OK?
Never disrespectin the laws of Nature -- Obey Yo' Thirst
Vin Rock'll serve as the quenchin
Here's the last thing I'd like to mention
That when it's time to set it off, trust me son
I ain't the motherfuckin click, I'm the motherfuckin one
I do my dirt all by my lonely..

[Treach]
I roll with hundreds, sometime thousands, maybe a little more
But don't need NAR' a motherfucker when it's time for the war!
Some of these niggaz on the streets be actin so sweet
Talkin bout stalkin black like it ain't gon' get back to me WHAT?
What about them MC's after me (hahahaha)
Come see the first rappers laid flat on Banned From TV
Part 3 in 3-D, shot right in Jersey
On the corner with the goners lookin straight up at me (whoo!)
So fuck prolongin, I'm way PAST the strongarmin
Played hisself tonight, so he'll be GONE  BY  THE  MORNING
Sneak up, creep up, you out of pocket, the rule's no second chance
Lift a bitch out his shoes, watch the news

I die, you die, few die, who rob, its do or die
You fry, I fry, new play, new day, new God
Tell me, what`s the sense of this?
Tell me before they gotta jail me and mail me

You`ve never been to the ghetto till you had to enter this
Some plans, one chance, hold heat, hold head, hold theirs (hold ya head)
Peep rules, we proof, meet troops, speak truth, teach youth (teach the youth)
No crews, who`s who? New day, new rules, do you:
Break bread, wake heads, check heads, half-a-head for steak feds? (check `em)

Why, everytime a brother comin` up some pray ya through?

In my face stab in my back man
Rob and steal they want to kill me black man
Tell me now what the deal is black man
Don`t ya know the powers in our hand?
Cause we shine we end up six feet inland
When we could build one nation
And it`s comprised of all persuasion
African, Latin caught cagin`, Asian

I'm even goin' be rich or poor, dead or handcuffed
Niggas bust (BACK) but miss, and now the war is on
And we goin' celebrate when you get murdered, deceased and gone

Retaliation is a must when you fuck with us
Tell me what was on your mind when you loaded your pistol up?
Was it some gangsta shit, that couldn't been it (nah, that ain't it)
'Cause you bust four shots and still missed, now dig this

Don't know your name, but know your face
You made a mistake now you must be erased
Really though, I'm loc'ed, go, deranged, sick and insane
Drop rights, to start more fights than Mills Lane

[Chorus: Treach]
So fuck the shivers, the Chain Gang delivers
KABOOM!! The whole room the platune don't give a nigga what?
Your whole style got too much cut, nigga what?
Pick up your guns now WHAT THE FUCK!?!

[Chain Gang Platune]
Voluptuous vixen, wear my dime pair, watch it like Nixon
Niggas mad cause they can't put restrictions
They know we fixin', to put the Chain team in the main stream
Cut the bad blood like gang green, lyrical vaxine

Injected by this mind specimen, my Oestrogen
Make the best of men guess again, I'm fresh in wind
Consumed by the date stamp, tramps get amped
'Cause they can't cramp the camp, we leave 'em damp

Got them scared stiff like mannequins
Keep 'em panicin', then we vanishin' into the world at large
The Chain Gang Platune be the head niggas in charge

[Chain Gang Platune]
I serve to protect, self ??? on police premises
Break bones as rug-be-snug, slugs being sold and printless
Stay spittin' at your divisions, hit your visions
Chain but automatic interest got taste for higher proof liquors
If it gets adventures, affective niggas, arrest resistance
Timper screamin' that deaf vast words splintered without the whispers
Connects got prices for product, but Tune fathers vanish
Rock the cuts now I control sonic voices like ???
A thugs' mug shots' worth dollars
Holla, we strange drama killers, can't stop the
For pain is absolute vodka, tre, confrontation watch man
For the progress of nation, yo I'm eatin' through your concentrations...

[Treach]
I'm comin' out combat and com-bows
Competition is a combination of combustion
Too valuable for commandin' nothin'
I continue cuttin' destruction's smokin' or choke eruptions
From California to Connecticut, I can hear the functions
Continue the Lexus, (Spanish) tell them (Spanish)
Category code of the street let's see the next day
The Cruddy Click clicks and classics k-kloaw
Cause it's beef on the streets then kick, kick the cow
Catapult and critters kick 'em, quickers clap
Cookin' trio's like Crio, I'll split that ass that go show your crack
The killer cultural when I'm gun away to ???
Since you got murdered they left you, the bitches who said you deserved it

[Treach]
You can rap, you can sing, see it ain't no thing
Cause every nigga in my click is first nigga to swing
Place the call, make you fall, we can break them all
Cause every nigga we control, first nigga to roll

[Chain Gang Platune]
Guess who speak the truth? I see the noose when the tongue get loose
Neck choke, for the wrong shit you spoke
Took the wrong approach invincible
With the writin' utensil, convincin' you
On instrumentals my moody mental, sets the tempo
Abdul of the mic, but your flow
Slice and dice a extra nice, a writer from the deathest cypher
Jersey believes 'em right, but Chain Gang with the sane slang
Crazy, deranged, strange, with a sharp aim
And shootin' range as deep as Danny maintain gets forfeited
When we show up to play the sport
Niggas show the military support and fight for what you brought up
Play to a good battle, battle and got grazed
In the heart of New Jersey - straight land of the crazed
Bad blood boils and picky goals will destroy you
Fans, straight hand me the jams to unemploy you
Yo, so you better keep it real right and tight
Or that spotlight might only last for one night, aight!

You can rap, you can sing, see it ain't no thing

My pimps be curlin, crimpin, straight pimpin and illin 

My gangsta thugs on this club on the motherfuckin realin 

See, some motherfuckers got loot to get 

It's just some motherfuckers can't shoot for shit 

So my hustlers call my thugs for the slugs for the hit 

And yeah my thugs roll and shoot in the hoop like a six 

Came from east to the west playin steelo with Beelow 

Niggas fought drinkin corpse, too much cut on the kilos 

So we took every jewel that he just bought from Tito 

Then Beelow rolled him through the desert 

Left him bleedin in Reno, without a see-note 

A section or a solid to sell it 

Ain't married fuck a ring, save the carats for rabbits

You trick your grip, the bitch got rich and you's the hoe, woah

Clean diamond rings and suits, we ain't hatin nigga we hungry 

And we'll rob your ass with the quickness if you show me the money 

Call it whatever my nigga but I call it being a thug and a hustler 

And you gotta have the nuts to be both 

And I gotta roll with the raws 

And get with the steady regardless 

Fuck, how much your bitch and how many niggas you with 

See we the ones that like to crash the party 

Drink all the forties up and disrespect every nigga in there 

'cause we don't give a fuck (we don't) 

Just 'cause I be rappin and all my records went platinum 

Don't exactly mean I had to get rid of my Thug Mentality 

But I know some niggas be fakin themselves 

That's 'cause they hoes 

And when they get caught up in confrontations they be scared as hell 

Ain't nothin wrong with bein a thug, but y'all got to keep it real 

So don't you get your ass on wax tellin lies about how you live

Naughty by Nature,"We're in the time where many doors are too hard to enter in
And many people really ain't worth the mentionin'
Thugs, me hugs, and plus a little gentle friend
Or the mentals if I wile I get antetion then
Do my drama from court to case
While others turn they back I turn my hate to faith
that's why I'm here, but boo's, any place or date
If there's tear in my eyes you come to dry my face
Now that's deep, y'all turned from my fans to my friends
After the past, I didn't think I could stand it again
On the streets, me and Miny wonderin' shall I kill
I do for all, when will someone ask me how I feel?
Ladies, if you're down and my pics on you're wall
Just pop in this song and won't let you fall
To all my ladies, got ya letters and I love you to death
Now I appreciate the breath that the dear lord left

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

With the kindness of people and most don't even know
'Cause this wilderness was'nt designed to see us grow
My thugs through the years who've always been true
Just know that I take the bullet for you
Life ain't livin' without givin', worth fryin' for lyin'
Ain't jack for free, but I'm supplyin' if you're tryin'
Have friends before the Benz, respect before a Lexus
Mama's(Mama's) gave us life, but brotha's have to protect us(Protect us)
Some wonder why I still got love
Why I still live in the hood, and why I still share grub
Why I play with the kids, lose money on clubs
To keep my people off the streets and away from the slugs
Sometimes rats run traps while our sista's get named
Sometimes bitches do thangs, and our queens get blamed
But I'm puttin' things on blast for my women and G's
'Cause you woulda done the same for me

Why do I stand for my fam and put it down for my peeps?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my women fallin' down and put 'em back on they feet?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I put it down for the streets and my R.I.P's?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

Where's my ladies who support and understand when
Yeah I'm tired but I still gotta visit the pen
I appreciate you love the love I show them
Woulda want the same thing if I had to go in
Lost the love of my life over stress and strife
If I couldn't care for me, I couldn't care for a wife
So I looked at the Lord and what he said was right
""there's obstacles but everything is gonna be alright""
If you feelin' what I'm feelin', lay back and give me love
So when you see me on the streets or clubs give me hug
To understand unity, you gotta understand we
You and I, you and them, them and me, see
y'all did for me, now I'll bow for the royalty
Just to know y'all is the love the loyalty
Behind every strong man there's a strong lady with 'em
Behind me I seem to have a whole nation of women

Why do I shout out all my women and adore my queens?
(Oh, I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I destroy anything that stops my teams dreams?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I see my people is and tell 'em what I see to be?
(Oh, and I like it)
'Cause they woulda done the same for me
Why do I embrace the face that sets the mob free?
'Cause they woulda done the same for me

You ask why? My reply is 'I don't give a fuck!'
I'm a Panther, I love fresh meat
After I kill ya, I'ma leave ya body across 110th Street

I tie one to a truck and go drag ya ass

You couldn't beat me slick, snap that neck like a Chico stick
I know who beat'cha quick (who?), my grip
Failing this to some type of tournament
I cut ya fucking head off and use it as a Christmas tree ornament
Come and give me a test whoever claims to be the best
He's with the 40-below footprint on his chest
Fucked up, got stuck, go press your luck
Both of his legs were found in back of a garbage truck
Head found in the bar of a limousine
The rest of his body at a dove site in Queens

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)

Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done

Never knew my dad, mother fuck the fag
Where anyway I didn't pick up, flipped the clip up
Too many stick-ups, 'cause niggas had the trigger hic-ups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip, with this here clip, who wanna hit?
I had to eat, this money's good as spent
I'm doin' braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long 'cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the led to any tellin' crackhead
I'm still livin' broke, so a lot of good it would've did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

Why do I have to be like this? momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, that's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
Four squad stolen in cars in a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say somethin' positive? well positive ain't where I lived
I lived right around a corner from west hell
Two blocks from south shit, it was in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was usually home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids for cause of chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice than dope for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in that game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and goin' in on and knowin' not now
How will I do it, how will I make it? I won't, that's how

My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead, huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fightin', lightin' up the streets at night
Playin' hide and seek with a machete seeking freddy's wife
Some say I'm rollin' on, nothin' but a dog now
I answer that with a tech, who wanna bow-wow?
'cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowin' in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song?
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man to man talk can just walk down
If you ain't live you couldn't feel it, so kill it, skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
And ill town fell like I stuck-up props, got shot
Don't worry, I hit by a, flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
In teacher's schools, I'm the misfit child and outlast
But that's cool with the bull, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fuckin' with a ghetto bastard

If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
'cause you ain't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto
Why me?

OPP, how can I explain it
I'll take you frame by frame it

To have why'all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People scratchin' temple
The last P...well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like another way to call a cat a kitten

It's five little letters that are missin' here
You get on occasion at the other party
As a game 'n it seems I gotta start to explainin'
Bust it

You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you want to know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house

It's not a front, F to the are to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it

How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at
Who thinks it's wrong ''cause I'm splittin' and co-hittin' at
Well if you do, that's OPP and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Chorus]
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) [Repeat: x3]
Who's down with OPP (Every last homie)
You down with OPP (Yeah you know me) [Repeat: x3]
Who's down with OPP (All the homies)

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanest and meanest

I won't get into that, I'll do it...ah...sorta properly
I say the last P...hmmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who have another like ah girl or wife

And you just had to stop and just ''cause he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
That he had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care

'Cause in a room behind a door no one but why'all are there
When why'all are finish, why'all can leave and only why'all would know
And then why'all could throw the skeleton bones right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked ''cause if you're down I want your hands up high

Say OPP (OPP) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Chorus]

This girl ah tried to OPP me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partner's that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment, bust it

That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cause after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""

You got's to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said now look you to the stairs and to the stairwindow
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
'Cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start

Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him

Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP is you with
Him or her for sure is going to admit it
When OPP comes, damn-- skippy I'm with it

I got a plan, a pound, a payment; let's roll
I'm seeing red, the blue, the brown, black, and gold
Time to stand as one and snatch back the soul
Gangsters, we all can jack back control
Got the bitches coming with the booty and bubbly
Time to discuss streets 'cause shit got ugly
I thought they all facing enemy to enemy
Cause ain't a motherfucking thing here industry
Who in here banging over money, or a bitch that you ain't sure to get
Or soon as you get it, split it
Over a block that's hot, or a chain that he got
The nigga he popped, or over the dimes that HE dropped
Either way we got a bil' a day
Cause nowadays it's kids that spray, they feel that way
And if we chill and wait, and don't delibirate
You see they feel that way, and then they kill that way

I love my niggas to the death of me
I think it's my motherfucking destiny
My homies bringing out the best in me
Shout to my people out on the streets who don't be stressing me
See what you fake niggas can't feel
Is that the real recognize real
 
Niggas who rob and steal,
could give a fuck about image and sex appeal
So when they see you on the streets (Nigga you know the deal)
hey yo these so-called gangsters, as so-called hard
I seen 'em rolling with a million man entourage
But then they still get touched on by the law
That makes me think, what the fuck they even hired 'em for
You see we all in the same gang
Because we've all hit the same thang
But now it's time niggas game changed
And while he's sleeping calling us 'lost souls'
We send a million O.G.'s straight to the pole

As our people with a purpose, see the shit surface
They get us, 'cause the feds is the nigga you do the dirt with
Sick of pleading 'Your Honor' fuck you, contempt on getting calmer
Sick of these warrants, and drinking and driving drama
Time to, get connected, and stop making them records
Bout slanging and banging, but they can't hold it when it get hectic
A lot of niggas live soft and act hard
A lot of rappers be claiming they be gangsters but trackstars
A lot of cops kick ass, for quick cash, and fast cars

Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest

That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

See what started as a family forest
Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers
The world points to the sun and the sun says

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost
Lord, please tomorrow ain't promised to you nor me
So now we choose the roots, so we can plant new trees

Many minds always meet with pens and sheets
Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor

Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way

To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness

In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo, but watch your head n shoulder
Brother older bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save your flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom, ain't trying to be handsome

Being low down I do the showdown with any little ho round, no!
I wanna know who you're believing, through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said, ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not cause I hate ya!
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti Written on Ya Kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today

Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho

There's many hungry Hip Hoppers one reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what ya heard cause I ain't bailing no hay
Ain't chopping no crops, but still growing every day

From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found

Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us

Probably why it sell it to cities when I globe trot
No more wall the records and the Platinum and gold box

In the beginning we did a show in a gazebo
Now we got hits and takin' pics with the people
But they won't play me if I don't mix with the Migos
If you tell me my music didn't fit they program
Said that the music I make wasn't fit for the broham

But some people wanna delay the bag 
Even though you kill everything when you display the gas spray the mag
Nina blast like in laser tag to who paid the cash thinkin' I'ma stray the path
Ay did they doubt me often?

I'm close range
Fuckin with you I gotta get AK material, banana clip style
Let's do this, let's do this

[Tito]
Blow the spot like tea kettle whistles
Federal slugs, the lead'll kiss you
Infrared burners'll never miss you
All digital, hard physical, spittle you riddle you
Priest prayin over your body while you in critical
Come in a few, give out a doz this what the semi do
See what the Henny and Rémy do
BGF, Black Gorilla Family jet, Black Godfather finesse
Fifty caliber hole surroundin your chest
Bentley blue steel armored cars with boulder baguettes
We live in effect, blaze a gun while poppin a Tec
Recognize killers, nigga, pop a collar to that
Gorilla breed to the death, that's the shit that I rep
Code of silence, addicted to havin fattened the violence
AK-47 rapidly firin, got love for bloodshed and the sirens
Take banana clips to my gun, to keep my shit off balance
My heart filled with malice

From rockets that blast, yo we in your pockets for cash
Burgundy mask, bullets like a surgery slash
Internally burn your staff and dismember your ass
Coroners bag from autops' to medical lab
I leave you leakin like Carlito watch your memory flash
Quicksand for fam, tied a fuckin brick to your hands
I'm sicker with the Henny liquor with the clip to your man
When it's on it's on, do your moms bodily harm
Firstborn'll be your first gone, beef goes on
Permanent cash, put you in the tourniquet fast
Feed you glass and use you to fertilize the grass
Puff green when we fiendin to murder ya whole team
For cream, the infrared beams'll shatter your dreams
I flatter your queen and rip her right out of her jeans
Intervene and it's the homicide scene for your team

From hideous acts on the one gettin rid of the gats
A nigga back, no parole, now how pretty is that?
The city is trapped, bottles popped, Phillies is cracked
Niggaz is strapped, half bent, illin, spillin they 'gnac
Cars tinted, my rap image too large to mimmick
We mob in it, fake niggaz dissolve in minutes
It's codes to it, real killers they know music
Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisier-sippin, this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different, duck when the AK spittin
It's more to it, verbal wisely, all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it
Double-edged sword, rep for why'all seein the board
See why'all home soon, it's better than seein the morgue
So what's the conflict, who want to Don with this?
For the streets strictly we got the bombest shit

Hold the four-pound stable
Won't hesitate to rock a clown's cradle
Get put in the dirt like ground cable
Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval
That shit why'all spit sound fable
""American Me"" style, knife in the anal; who 'round to save you?
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with, a gym star, spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggaz out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit, for me to let it rip across your attic
Never violent with a silent but I toss your cabbage

Naya Rivera,"Those school girl days
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone
But in my mind I know they still live on and on

But how do you thank someone
Who was taken you from crayons to perfume
It isn't easy but I'll try

If you wanted the sky
I'd write across the sky in letters
That would soar a thousand feet high

To sir with love
The time has come
For closing books and long last looks must end
And as I leave I know that I am leaving my best friend

A friend who taught me right from wrong
And weak from strong that's a lot to learn
What can I give you in return
If you wanted the moon

I would try to make a start but I
Would rather let me give you my heart
To sir with love",To Sir with Love [Version],2010

I can make it anywhere, yeah they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicano's
Right there up on Broadway, pull me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash box, five sixty State Street
Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons with them pastries
Cruisin' down eighth Street, off white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but B.K. is from Texas
Me, I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whatup to Ty-Ty, still sippin' mai tai's
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high five

Dude I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can

But I got a gang of brothers walkin' with my clique though

End of the winter gets cold, en vogue, with your skin out
City of sin, it's a pity on the wind
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
M.D.M.A. got you feelin' like a champion

Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin’
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say can you believe it?
As we’re lying on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m guarded
You say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is  what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
When everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
‘Cause that’s all I’ve ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said, I’ll never leave you alone

You said, I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
She is the best thing that’s ever been mine

Oh, my girl so fine that you scared to tell her ""hi""
She a all-around ten like a high five
And we ain't fall in love, we skydive
I always get off when she's on, she's there
I'm gone, I call her ""fine"", she call me ""Sean""
And I love 'em quarter G, quarter freak
Quarter Puerto Ric, quarter sweet

South of France me and my Mona Lis
Bon appétit, mon amie

All in the club talking back
Wha' wha' what what they got
Pull out the club on 26's
Go str-straight to they momma's house

Now they just wannabe on the mic
They cut fucked up deals with music
And even if they got 25 to life
They'll be singing like Whitney
Before before she met bobby

Knowing they green like wasabi

Getting paid like no other dog now I'm stackin' chips
On the road like a trucker man had to take some trips
Doing shows for my brothers but strapped with extra clicks

Just in case any sucker would wanna run his lips
A female I don't trust her 'cause women like to trip
I stay all by my getty green hell with some time
There some crime that was petty seem still getting mine

All this hate trip I'm hearing, though you I ain't fearing
Better try to be growing old man with your children
Escalate what a nigga staring his last days nearing
Trying to get it right with God only one who I'm fearing

Hopin' I'ma make it, keep it real
Never knew I get the chances for a nigga to get paid
So I take it living like a player should
Wishin' that you could knowin' it's all to the good
Still down with the hood

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Last year my cousin took a fall, a sad song
Seem like we were just on the phone now he gone
People use to try to judge him sayin' he was wrong
But you can't try to judge a man you do you wrong

Smokin' out on a daily base I'm in the clouds
Drinkin' liqour fallin' on my face
Wondering how I survive all this foolishness
Up in the street ridin' dirty I ain't new to this
I'm packin' heat but the streets very hazardous
To a niggaz health watch your step you ain't Lazarus

You'll meet your death
I'm the man from the North, North site of the town
With the will to support me and keep 'em found
Stayin' down got your gold grills dro in the air
Barbecue on the grill sun cool for a player
When I ride through the streets hoes are plentiful
'Cause the life that we live so beautiful

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

This life we live
(Life as we see it)
See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful
(Oh it's so)
Oh, so beautiful
(Oh it's so beautiful)

Gotta take the good with the bad
Smile with the sad, love what you got
And remember what you had messin' with the ones
Who help me in the times
When I was flat broke didn't even have a dime

My family they was there, my niggaz they was there
The rest of ya'll left me for dead didn't care
I use to have dreams livin' large in this thang
And by the grace of God I'm still alive in this thang

I strive in this game to get all that I can
Never said I'm the man, respect me as a man
To you ones think I owe you somethin'
Now that's a joke, think you bad come

And get you somethin', how low to dope
Either treal either fake, you can love you can hate
Either go and get your own or you can't sit and wait
On the next man to come up you can peep this
You can do what I do handle your business

See it's, oh, so beautiful, beautiful

Oh, so beautiful

You may not come back to me 
Our future you'll never see 
Your throwing my life plans away 
Please don't go 

The only thing we have that we can call our own 
Is this sweet love that we share 
But if you leave tonight you may not come home 
And that's just one thought I can't bear 
Lets run away from here, to some place far away 
Cause if we stay our love won't last another day 
Don't throw my love aside 
Because of your foolish pride 

[Chorus]

I wanted you to stay 
But still you went away 
Together we can run 
Now look what they had done 
I'll never feel your touch again 
I'm left to see this tragic end 
Your throwing our love life away 

Please don't go, please don't 
Please don't go, I'm begging you 
Repeat (4x)",Please Don't Go [Remix],1986
Nayobe,"Its been awhile that we've been together 
The love we shared has meant so much 
And we've been patient, waiting for the right time 
Knowing that it would be wrong to run 
But tonight I know the time for love has come 
That special moment has arrived 
And now I'm sure this love we have is real 
And I know that our love will survive, 'cause... 

[Chorus:] 
Good things come to those who wait 
And we waited long enough for, the time for love is right 
Good things come to those who wait 
Now I'm ready for your lovin' so lets make love tonight 

Light up the night, I've dreamed about this moment 
That you and I would be as one 
But making love is something that we should always cherish 
Not something we only do for fun 
But tonight I know the time for love has come 
That special moment has arrived 
And now I'm sure this love we have is real 
And I know that our love will survive, 'cause... 

[Chorus] 
Good things come to those who wait 
Let me take you to a place where you have never been before 
Good things come to those who wait 
We have done our share of waiting, now there's nothing, love is gone

Nayobe,"I thought I knew what I was doing 
On that crazy summer night that I left you 
I didn't know what I was losing 
Didn't realize that no other man could love me like you do 
But like a fool I let you go, I let you slip away 
And now the pain that lives inside of me gets worse each day 

Give me a second chance for love
Give me a second chance for love

I knew I hurt you when I left you 
I can see the tear drops rolling down your face 
Now that your gone I can't forget you 
Now I realize that no other man could ever take your place 
But like a fool I let you go, I let you slip away 
And now the pain that lives inside of me gets worse each day 

Give me a second chance for love
Give me a second chance for love

I was a fool to let you go, to let you slip away 
And now the pain that lives inside of me gets worse each day

What else can I say
Love was in my eyes
You came and made my life complete

You gave your love to me

Take me, take me in your arms

Nazar,"Meine Augen waren geschlossen für 'ne lange Zeit
Wollte vor der Wahrheit flüchten, aber kam nicht weit
So viel Frust im Herz, der mich in den Wahnsinn treibt
Alles holt dich ein, Stimmen der Vergangenheit
Ich merkte, dass das Leben kein Spiel ist und
Ich bete um Vergebung für vieles, doch
Ich verlor zu viele Tränen in Kriegen
Ja und nichts gleicht den Wert von meinem seelischen Frieden
Ich bin lange nicht zurückgekehrt
Denn am meisten war mein Glück mir Wert
Doch ich steige aus dem Rauch wieder auf
Weil ich mich um meinen Traum nicht verkauf
Alles hat 'ne Kehrseite
Ich bin auch bekannt für ein paar Bomben, die ich verteilte
Weil es oft nicht reichte, wenn ich Menschen nur mein Herz zeigte
Geht in Deckung, weil ich euch mein' Schutz nicht mehr gewährleiste

Ich lade meine Glock in der Booth
Wenn ich die Augen schließe seh' ich meinen Kopf voller Blut
Ich tue das, was eine Fotze nicht tut
Was für Schutzgeld? Ich zahle nur Gott mein Tribut
So viele sind gekommen mit falschen Absichten
Wegen falschen Freunden musste ich im Knast sitzen
Meine Mutter, sie besuchte mich in Haft
2008 ist die Wut in mir entfacht
Ich habe geschworen für jede Träne von ihr
Dass diese Piç-Kinder alle ihre Zähne verlieren
Nach meiner Rache fing ich an mit der Musik
Hab mein' Frieden zwar gefunden, doch die Narbe in mir blieb
Ich verbrachte ein paar Jahre im Exil
Doch bestieg dann meinen Thron, denn ja ich hab' ihn mir verdient
Mein Temperament ist wie 'ne Stange Dynamit
Doch ich zahl dafür den Preis, dass man mein Lachen nicht mehr sieht

Baba, ich hoff' dass du vom Himmel auf mich siehst
Falls du's nicht weißt, es wurde schlimmer nach dem Krieg
Wir sind geflohen und haben alles verloren
Doch ich passe auf sie auf, das hab' ich Mama geschworen
Ich war seit zwanzig Jahren nicht an deinem Grab
Doch glaube mir, dass es gewiss nicht an mir lag
Denn ich kann nicht mehr zurück in unser' Vaterland
Doch du sollst wissen, dass ich immer für dich gerade stand
Bin jetzt erwachsen, hab' ne Frau, doch keine Kinder
Sie ist wie Mama drum vertrau ich ihr für immer
Und bis heute hängt dein Bild in meinem Herz
Mein Temperament hast du mir sicherlich vererbt
Mir zu verzeihen, hab ich von niemanden gelernt
Die Straße zog mich groß, ja, und vieles lief verkehrt
Falls du mich siehst, bitte verzeih mir meine Sünden
Warum ich sie tat, kann ich dir leider nicht begründen
Ich ging schon immer meinen eigenen Weg
Auch wenn er dafür sorgte Mama weinen zu sehen
An so vielen Tagen denk' ich an dich
Falls du mich siehst, kannst du verstehen warum mein Lächeln verstrich?

Ich kämpfe noch bis heute in der Booth
Denn die Vergangenheit ertränkte meine Träume in Blut
Ich tat so manchen Freunden nicht gut
Denn in mir drinnen, Bruder, schäumte die Wut
Mir wurde meine Konsequenz in meinen Genen vererbt
Doch mit den Jahren hab' ich aus Fehlern gelernt
In diesem Biz verlaufen Tränen im Nichts
Also erwarte keine Gnade, wenn du gegen mich bist
Seh' nur Dämonen um mich 'rum
Guck, meine Gegend zerbricht
Weil der Teufel hier schon jedem seine Seele zerriss
Bin aufgewachsen hier mit Drogen und Gewalt
Was für Liebe? Denn es wachsen keine Rosen am Asphalt
Mein ganzes Leben war ein Kampf in mir selbst
Mama sagte immer: ""Keiner wird dich fangen, wenn du fällst!""
Keiner außer mir hört die Stimmen in mir drinnen
Also behaupte nicht zu wissen, wer ich bin",INTRO 1984,
Nazar,"Du willst die Welt durch meine Augen sehen, dann bitte, guck!
Hier ist es düster, man sieht draußen den Sin-City-Look
Schon seit Kleinauf trau’ ich niemandem blind
Mein Stiefvater nimmt sich eine Liebhaberin
Und verlässt Mama, ist dann weg, Dadash
Guck, ich hab’ Wunden, bei den’ helfen kein Heftpflaster
Den Stressmachern in der Gegend, die dich testen wollen
Fällt es schwer, wirklich jedem hier Respekt zu zollen
Und mein Vertrauen hat er ’n Türspion
Schau, wie sie lachen, Mann, solange es sich für sie lohnt
Wie mein bester Freund, der plötzlich den Kontakt abbricht
Weil er verliebt in eine Kahba ist
Ich hör’ nicht zu, wenn einer von den Bastarden quatscht
Die waren Samen im Sack, da saß ich Haftstrafen ab
Dunkle Augenringe, wenn ich durch die Stadt fahre nachts
Und der Himmel spiegelt sich wider im mattschwarzen Lack

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie
Ich warte, bis mein Spiegelbild zerfällt
Gefangener meiner Selbst, Dadash, hier in meiner Welt

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie
Ich warte, bis mein Spiegelbild zerfällt
Gefangener meiner Selbst, Dadash, hier in meiner Welt

In meiner Welt werd’ ich von Kritikern gejagt
Von einem Nuttenkind-Politiker verklagt
Von dein’ Dutzend Freunden zieh’ ich erst ein Dutzend ab
Wo ist dein Bruder, wenn er grade keinen Nutzen hat?
Das ist der Grund, warum ich Massen meide
Ich seh’ bei jedem guten Angebot die Schattenseite
Ich mach’ zwar Kohle und unterschreibe eine Megadeal
Doch gehe essen mit dem Teufel auf ein Happy-Meal
Kein schwarz oder weiß, alles Grauzone
Schau, was ich heraushole, bis ich in ’nem Haus wohne
Faustgroße Hassklumpen, sie sich in mei’m Magen stauen
Lass mir nicht in die Karten schau'n, Aura wie ein Gartenzaun
Laufe ohne Fackel durch ein Höhlenlabyrinth
Denn ich kann mich nicht erinnern, ob ich fröhlich war als Kind
Um mich zu ändern, ist es eh schon zu spät, Dadash
Ich wurde durch diese Umgebung geprägt, Dadash

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie
Ich warte, bis mein Spiegelbild zerfällt
Gefangener meiner Selbst, Dadash, hier in meiner Welt

Das ist mein Leben, meine Welt, Dadash zendegim
Kein’ Platz für meine Träume, Dadash, c’est la vie

Nazar,"Ah, meine Gedanken sind düster, mal’ Bilder aus Asche mit schwarzer Magie
Komm’ in deine Stadt mit paar Kanaks und gründe eine Artillerie
Die Straßen geraten in Panik und fliehen
Ich hab’ grade die Scharfe geladen und schieß’
Meine Welt ist so dunkel, hier gibt es noch nicht mal Solarenergie
Sie beten zu Gott und hoffen auf die Gnade von Ave Mari
Mein Block war mein Babysitter
Hier gab’s keine Jedi-Ritter, Dicker, hier wird jeder Ticker
Kein Wunder, wenn sie sich ein’ Dreck um uns scheren
Denken, dass sie etwas Besseres wären
Keine Alternative für Ratten und Diebe
Weil alle von uns mit Verbrechern verkehren
Wir hatten keine Wahl, du Pisser
Sahen keine Farben glitzern
Es war ein hartes Schicksal
Und genau deswegen sind wir schwarz, du Wichser!

Wir tragen schwarz in uns
Leben auf ’nem anderen Stern
Wir sind Straßenjungs
Konnten nie was anderes lern’
Und wir fühlen nichts mehr

Vor lauter Hass in der Brust

Komm in meine Welt und wir fressen dich, Piç
Willkomm’ auf der dunkelen Seite der Macht

Gib uns ein’ Grund, wir ziehen gleich in die Schlacht
Komm in meine Welt, keine Rettung in Sicht
Willkomm’ auf der dunkelen Seite der Macht

Ah, schwarz ist der Rauch von den Bomben, wenn wieder die Gewalt eskaliert
Die Hälfte von uns, die’s in Zeitungen schafft, wird mit Balken zensiert
Die Köter auf Straßen, sie bellen seit Jahren im alten Revier
Sie bellen und bell’n, denn hier gibt’s keine Masken, die Falten kaschieren
Schützen uns vor bösen Augen, doch verbreiten Angst indem wir selbst so gucken
Träumen vom Himmel, doch nur um danach auf die Welt zu spucken
Atmen Smog ein, pusten Weed aus
Holen Stoff rein und machen Profit draus
Riskieren unser Leben auf schwarz oder rot, auf der Fahrt bis zum Tod
Denn auf Nase wird man Kamikaze-Pilot
Der Tag wird zur Nacht und die Nacht wird hell
Wie Ratten in Gossen nur abgestellt
Hier lernst du, wie man eine Waffe hält
In der Gesellschaft der Schattenwelt

Wir tragen schwarz in uns
Leben auf ’nem anderen Stern
Wir sind Straßenjungs
Konnten nie was anderes lern’
Und wir fühlen nichts mehr

Bilder unsrer Kindheit verblasst mit Schmerz
Vertrauten wir dann blind unserm Hass im Ernst
Dein Kopf war gefickt, Zukunft war grau
Yallah, yallah, Zukunft war tschau
Hass im Herzen und ein Loch in unserm Bauch
Hast du Feuer in der Brust, bleibt im Kopf dir nur der Rauch
Also raus auf die Straße mit der Knarre ins Gesicht
Kleine Päckchen verpackt und die Ware dann vertickt
Wallah fick dich, du Piç, wenn du uns nicht verstehst

Deshalb werden Diskussionen oft zu Thaibox-Turnieren

Nach dem Album ändern sie das Polizeischutzgesetz
Dabei will ich doch nur spielen, mach’ paar Mille mit ’nem Deal
Und bring’ Mama dann auf Händen in ein Villendomizil

Doch es gab zu viele Gründe weshalb ich dich dann aus meinem Leben verbannt hab'
Denn ich sah' dich in Träumen, doch war blind vor Liebe
Es war ein Tanz mit dem Teufel es noch hinzubiegen
Wir haben nach Freiheit verlangt doch waren beide gefangen
Es gab keinen Grund für einen Seitensprung, nur in deinem Verstand
Wir sind Fremde geworden, die sich sehr gut kennen
Denn Gewohnheit und Sehnsucht, waren immer schwer zu trennen

Und selbst wenn wir es gut machen
Könnten wir es dann vielleicht nie wieder gut machen
Ey, vielleicht sollten wir alte Träume ruhen lassen
Bevor sie uns verfolgen und nie wieder ruhen lassen
Denn wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind nicht für einander bestimmt, wir sind

Wir sind verschiedene Menschen doch trotzdem auch irgendwie eins
Andere Mentalität doch trotzdem auch irgendwie gleich
Wir haben gemeinsam gewonnen doch heute verlieren wir uns zwei
Denn egal was wir taten, es hat nie wirklich gereicht
Wir hielten so fest an dem Fallschirm im Biz, unser Band riss
Du hattest ständig die Angst das ein anderes Leben für mich interessant ist
Seh' dich lachend auf Fotos, doch weiß das du weinst
Die gemeinsame Zeit nutzten wir nur nicht alleine zu sein
Sag wo sind wir jetzt? Und wo waren wir davor?
Schau ich bin schon weg, und du mit der Lage d' accord
Wir sind Fremde geworden, die sich sehr gut kennen
Denn Gewohnheit und Sehnsucht waren immer schwer zu trennen

Und selbst wenn wir es gut machen
Könnten wir es dann vielleicht nie wieder gut machen

Bevor sie uns verfolgen und nie wieder ruhen lassen
Denn wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind nicht für einander bestimmt, wir sind

Wir sind Schatten und Licht, Schwarz und Weiß
Jung und Dumm, statt Smart und Reif
Wir sind Feuer und Wasser, (Feuer und Wasser) 
Hart und Weich
Treffen keine Entscheidung, wählen zwischen Kalt und Heiß
Wir sind Venus und Mars, Quadrat und Kreis
Es war ein schmaler Grat zwischen Knast und Frei
Wir sind Freund oder Feind, Arm oder Reich
Wir haben nie wirklich gewusst
Ist es wahr oder Schein?

Und selbst wenn wir es gut machen
Könnten wir es dann vielleicht nie wieder gut machen
Ey, vielleicht sollten wir alte Träume ruhen lassen
Bevor sie uns verfolgen und nie wieder ruhen lassen
Denn wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt
Wir sind, wir sind, nicht für einander bestimmt

K-K-Kiddie, ich muss diese ganzen Promistalker wegekeln
Boxe auf sie mit ’ner Flasche Johnnie Walker Black Label

Das Leben ist hart, die Seele ist schwarz wie Sänger auf Cosby-CDs

Ich esse nur Helal und deshalb opfer’ ich die Lämmer

Doch wart’ auf ein Signal, das du hoffentlich schickst
Weil ich bis heute nicht sicher bin, ob es dich gibt
Trotzdem such’ ich dich im Schatten der Nacht
Und halt’ Ausschau nach dir vom höchsten Dach dieser Stadt
Ich würd’ alles tun, um dich endlich zu finden
Bevor wir beide in der Menge verschwinden
Ich seh’ dich fast jede Nacht schemenhaft
Und spüre, wie die Reise mich nun träge macht

Ich habe dich in jedem Traum gesucht
Weil ich alleine bin, genau wie du
Vielleicht sind meine Rufe laut genug

Nur ein Zeichen und deinen Namen
Wo bist du? Schick mir ein Signal!
Du bist die Eins, für mich gibt es keine zweite Wahl

Ah, ich frag mich, wo du bist
Seh’ nur dich, weil niemand sonst in meinem Fokus ist
Bin auf der Suche und hoffe, dass sich die Reise lohnt
Zu dieser einen Person, eine aus einer Million
Die mich so wie ich bin mit allen Fehlern nimmt
Bei der die Makel, die ich habe, nie ein Thema sind
Die meine Wunden pflegt, bis die Narben heilen
Ich suche unentwegt, doch geh’ den Pfad allein
Und bin es leid hier im Dunklen zu warten
Dachte so oft, dich gefunden zu haben
Jede gebrochene Beziehung zerriss mir das Herz
Weil ich wirklich dachte, dass sie die Richtige wär’
Alle, die ich vor dir traf, sind längst Fremde
Ich hoffe, dass ich auf der richtigen Frequenz sende
Denn ich suche dich seit Ewigkeiten
Wenn du mich hören kannst, sende mir ein Lebenszeichen!

Und wo ich gerade steck, ich bin Lichtjahre weg
Von dem Rest, als ob ich jetzt zur Milchstraße jet
Kein Mitspracherecht, für niemanden mehr
Bin der Captain des Schiffs, komm den Zielhafen näher
Also mach dein Ding, mich interessiert nicht wann, wie und was
Deine Rede hat für mich keinerlei Anziehungskraft, denn

Wir geben nicht machtlos auf
Lass und schweben wie ein Astronaut
Und haben wir's zu den Sternen geschafft
Schauen wir auf die Erde hinab

Wir geben nicht machtlos auf
Lass und schweben wie ein Astronaut
Und haben wir's zu den Sternen geschafft
Schauen wir auf die Erde hinab

Und jeder Zweite von uns will zum Mond
Ist auf Pillen und stoned, was für ne Illusion
Ich hab' ne Mission, die weiter geht das Materielles
Immernoch die teuerste Rose, ohne das Wasser verwelkt ist
Ich wär gern in ner Galaxie, in der Papa der Held ist
Bau ein Raumschiff aus Erinnerungen, aber es hält nicht
Ich machte mir über die Ewigkeit gedanken
Die Fantasie ist Freiheit, so als geb es keine Schranken
Ich lege meine ganze Angst in Gottes Schoß
Denn Gott ist groß und ich jogge los
Ihr könnt mit Mund aufstarren, ich hab den Grundbauplan
Für meine Rakete fallen raus aus meiner Umlaufbahn
Yeah, das ist sowas wie ne Jedi Saga
Ich bin abgespaced, so wie Lady Gaga
Yeah, dieser Sound ist so Futuristisch
W-W-Weil es Zukunft Shit ist

Wir geben nicht machtlos auf
Lass und schweben wie ein Astronaut
Und haben wir's zu den Sternen geschafft
Schauen wir auf die Erde hinab

Wir geben nicht machtlos auf
Lass und schweben wie ein Astronaut
Und haben wir's zu den Sternen geschafft

Guck, ich hab die Guns geladen wie ein Waffentransport

Sie sprangen auf den Zug, zu viel Affen an Bord
Wollen Geld mit Blasen machen wie ein Bubblegum-Store
Ich bleib Kaiser, schreib weiter allein, ficke mit Thai-Fightern
Du läufst mit vollen Hosen nach Haus wie ein Heimscheißer

High-Five mal, oder friss den Bordstein jetzt wie Steinbeißer
Ah, ich besitz den Rap-Thron, okay?
Jetzt gibt's was auf die Ohren via Headphones von Dre
Ich bin back, o-okay, ich pack die Spinner hier

An manchen Tagen sagst du mir du möchtest Kinder haben
Am Tag darauf kommt es dazu das wir uns wieder schlagen
An manchen Tagen sagst du mir du willst mich heiraten
Doch nach ein paar Stunden muss ich mich vor dir verteidigen
An manchen Tagen willst du Sex doch ich hab keinen Bock
Dann gibt es Stress denn angeblich liegt es an meinen Job
An manchen Tagen bist du ehrlich und an manchen nicht
So ist das Leben ganz egal wie Krank es ist

An manchen Tagen bin ich alles für dich

An manchen Tagen würde ich sterben für dich

An manchen Tagen glaub ich wirklich das ich glücklich bin
Doch dann sehe ich wieder wie du keine Rücksicht nimmst
An manchen Tagen zeigst du mir nur wie verrückt du bist
Ich wollt's dir niemals sagen, doch in letzter Zeit erdrückst du mich
An manchen Tagen bist du da wenn ich dich brauch
Doch meistens streiten wir, weil du mir in Wahrheit nicht vertraust
An manchen Tagen will ich sagen es ist aus
Denn unsere Liebe steckt in unserem Herz schon Jahre lang im Stau
An manchen Tagen musst du heulen, weil du mich hasst!
Und dann sagst du mir du würdest es bereuen das du mich trafst

Ich will in Zukunft der Versuchung widerstehen 
doch der Teufel läuft mir häufig mit seinem Bluthund über'm weg
Abfuck, ich hab mich letzte Nacht abgeschossen 
als hätt' ich mit dem Bastard einen Pakt abgeschlossen
Den Wodka zur wehr gesetzt, doch danach leer geext
Es war einfach zu schmackhaft verlockend
Schenk den Champagner ein
Mein Kopf ist verdreht, denn Luzifer will heute Nacht mein Handlanger sein
Ich will nicht das die Leute meinen Hass fürchten 
und fliehen doch der Teufel sagt ich soll nach Oben Abkürzungen nehmen
Wenn ich hier und da mal über ein paar Leichen steige
Immer die gleiche Scheiße

Er will mir seine Hand reichen doch ich muss mich zusammen reißen
Jetzt heißt es keine Angst zeigen
In Kampf steigen und angreifen
Sein' Bann meiden
Ich kann fighten wenn's sein muss
Mann bleiben wenn's sein muss
Diese Satans Jünger würden sogar Schwanz reiten wenn's sein muss
Narkose, hier sind lauter Willenlose Leichen
Der Teufel lässt sie in die Pillen Dose greifen
Ich bin der resistente Anti-Körper
Geh' Trainieren doch fresse ständig wie ein Junkie Burger
Er hat Lockmittel doch wenn ich meinen Kopf schüttel
Kenn' ich genug Block-Kids die gern an seinem Stoff schnüffeln
An den Werktagen kann ich zwar nicht hören was er sagt, doch an Wochenenden wachsen meine Hörner wieder nach, wenn er sagt..

dass du für immer in der Siedlung bleibst
Andere leben das Casino Life schon Kino reif 
und du siehst das denen nicht mal eine Mio. reicht
Sie gierig werden und dich alle tierisch nerven 
und dir Klar wird auf diese Art willst du hier nicht sterben
Flüstert Mephisto: „Hier kann Gott dir nicht helfen“
Kann sein, doch ich kriege es Hoffentlich selbst hin

Es tut mir leid, ich bin der Typ, der nicht zeigt
Ob er dich liebt, denn ich finde keine Worte dafür
Sprach nur mit mir selbst und verlor das Gespür
Meine Mutter musste Mann sein, kein Platz für Emotionen
Hab' ich Liebe gesucht, war sie nicht die passende Person
Sie hat mich vorbereitet auf die Prüfung da draußen
Das ist der Grund, warum meine Gefühle jetzt taub sind
Mein großer Bruder hat mich nie gelobt
Denn vielleicht bestand darin für ihn ein Risiko
Jetzt bin ich selber so zu meinem kleinen Bruder
Bin in die Einsamkeit meilenweit gerudert
Ich kann bis heut meine Gedanken nicht zeigen
Doch kann sie schreiben, kann die Hälfte meiner Verwandten nicht leiden
Denn als mein Vater von uns ging, war'n wir lange alleine
Und meine Mutter trug uns unter ihrem Mantel des Schweigens

Denn Schweigen kann oft schlimmer sein
Hör mir zu, denn vielleicht fühl' ich mich dann nicht allein
Das sind Worte, die ich nie gesagt hab'
Doch heute zeig' ich dir mein Inneres
Denn wenn ich weiter schweige, weiß ich, dass es schlimmer ist

Ich war nie der Typ, der große Töne spuckt
Doch mein Stiefvater lehrte mich, wie man böse guckt
Für jeden Fehler von mir hab' ich von ihm Schläge kassiert
Hab' mich bis heute von sein'n Schlägen noch nicht regeneriert
Damals dachte er, es wär' das Beste für mich
Trotzdem küss' ich seine Hände, doch vergesse es nicht, eh-eh
Es heißt man soll vergeben und vergessen
Ich will in meinem Leben an Problemen nicht zerbrechen
Worte können Waffen sein, ich lege sie in Ketten
Lasse weder Freude oder Tränen für mich sprechen
Meine Gefühle zeige ich auf eine andere Art
Denn mein Herz verbirgt sich hinter 'nem gepanzerten Glas
Mein Schweigen wird oft missinterpretiert
Und das zeigt mir nur, sie wissen nichts von mir
Für die Frau meines Lebens schrieb ich an manchen Tagen
Nach all den Jahren kann ich immer noch nicht danke sagen

Das sind Worte, die ich nie gesagt hab'

Nazar,"Ich glaube, dass im Leben nichts nur so geschieht
Weil man die Dinge von unten nicht wie von oben sieht

Findet man Schätze, aus denen man seine Vision entzieht

Ja, ein Löwe hängt nicht ab mit allen Ratten und Schlangen
Guck, ich mach' das hier schon alles zu lang
Und jemand, der sich selbst nicht kennt, ist kein erwachsener Mann, nein
Mein Mosaik, es leuchtet in Kristallfarben
Auch wenn wir uns fühlen, als ob wir keinen Halt haben
Alles ist schon längst bestimmt und alles, was wir tun
Ist nur die Angst im Kopf, den Kopf von ihrem Hals schlagen
Und ich spür', wie die Kontraste verschwimmen
Ich sah im Pass, wo ich bin, dachte, ich passe nicht hin, doch
Das Leben zeigte mir, dass alles richtig läuft
Solange man sich selbst am Ende nicht enttäuscht

In meinem Kopf seh' ich neue Bilder von alten Zeiten
Album Nummer neun, ich hab' den Thron verdient
Alles, was noch vor mir liegt, ein Stück von meinem Mosaik

Sag wer ist der Teufel, der Bastard soll kommn' und ich biet' ihm die Stirn
Ging meinen Weg vom Iran bis nach Wien, außer mir kann hier niemand regieren

Zwischen Sex und Gewalt wird Gestrecktes verpackt und die Päckchen dann über die Grenze gebracht

Denn im meinem Viertel gibt es keinen Deal mit dem Tod
Wir chillen hier mit Sheytan und dealen mit dem Dope
Schenken Gott ein paar Tränen zum Abschied
Verlieren unser Herz doch verdienen unser Brot
Ja Haram ist normal wenn man täglich im Tipico chillt und sein Leben verzockt
Doch ich versteh' meine Brüder, denn ja ihre Zukunft war immer nur Nebel uns Smog

Doch am Morgen danach wachst du auf und merkst, dass an deinen Problemen nichts anders ist

Nazareth,"She's a night woman of my dreams
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam
Silver stardust in her eyes
In the way she leaves her sighs
Last night I fell asleep
Thought I heard her voice begin to speak
My mind is in distress
On my cheek I felt her breath
I could feel her body's warmin' glow
My frozen blood begn to flow
She's a night woman of my dreams
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam
Comes, stays, then disappears
In the morning sun my vision clears
I could smell the roses in her hair
But when I awoke she was not there

Oh, oh, night woman of my dream
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream
Oh, oh,
She's a night woman of my dream
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream",Night Woman,1972

Have you seen that vigilante man

Nazareth,"Mist upon the hill can remember murder,
Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,
Helped to cover up an approaching army,
Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.

Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,
Rolled up in their beds were children that play,
Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,
None of them would see the dawn next day.

Bloody were the blades that fell on children,
Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,
The mountains only know all the souls that died there,
Glen Coe from that day can recall the shame.

The quiet of the night never gave them warning,
The silence of the hills wouldn't let them know,
They'd never rise again on a mist filled morning,
Never see the sunrise above Glen Coe",1962 (Glencoe Massacre),1972
Nazareth,"Cat's eye, apple pie, what am I going to do,
The woman I loved walked out on me,

The woman I love has done me wrong,
What am I going to do.
Green beans, black eyed peas,
What am I going to do,
The woman I love has let me down,
What am I going to do.

She's a delta queen know what I mean,
As mean as wildfire lightnin',
She can win and break the heart of any man,

And she loved me somethin' frightnin',
But she left me for a dollar wavin' man.","Cat's Eye, Apple Pie",1972

Places I've been in my life.
In my life there's things I have done,
Times I have won in my life.

Ships I have known,
Winds that have blown.

In my time were people who cared,
People who shared in my time,
Welcomed the good accepted the bad,
Enjoyed what I had in my time.

People I've known
Times on my own

And now I'm growing old,
In memory I can hold

Can feel myself grow cold.

Turn off your white light

And the perfume he wore lingers on the king's road

Call out your legions, the savior is loose
Telling true stories you know that ain't no use
Your empire is burning you can feel the smell
Your hot rod , space pod, tax relief, kill machine
Is looking mean
And should be working well

Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy

Kissin' cousins just ain't my style
Not like some knight in shining armor
Touring with the sideshow
That was my blow
But we hung on for the fun
Lots of fun for everyone

Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy

Till the danger man with his danger plan
He took me aside
And then he took me apart
I was a young man with love in my heart
Oh, how he made me pay
It was the hard way
It was the hard way

Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy
Ooh, what a night!",Big Boy [*],1981

Nazareth,"Let me be your leader
Let me have control

Nazareth,"I don't want to take you prisoner
Or do it against your will
I wouldn't ever take you over
Only want a little part of you
Only want a little part of you

I would never leave you stranded
Alone on some point of view
Couldn't ever hold you under
Only want a little part of you
Only want a little part of you

I know that the world
All it's diamonds and it's pearls
Could never buy you
Could never even try to

Wouldn't ever bring you sadness
Leave you standing in the rain
Never thought you would be easy

Nazareth,"Moonlight eyes I see you smile
It lightens up my night
Your smile takes all the fight out of me
Moonlight eyes I hear you cryin'
It robs me of my pride
There's nothing I can hide from moonlight eyes
I got no control
You just roll me like the sea
Oh moonlight eyes

Mooonlight eyes you're grown now
I'll soon be out of touch
You'll lose that innocence
That cost so much
Moonlight eyes you'll find your pain
You'll say that I'm all wrong
There'll always be a place where you belong
I got no control
You just roll me like the sea
Oh moonlight eyes
Tell your sweet lies only to me, only to me

Moonlight eyes you soothe me
Moonlight eyes you're easy on my soul
Moonlight eyes you are the reason
The meaning in the words
The words to every song I've ever heard
Paralyzed in sweet surprise
Your every wrong is right
One look into your night
Oh moonlight eyes
I got no control
You just roll me like the sea
Oh moonlight eyes
Tell your sweet lies only to me, only to me

Nazareth,"The phone call was wrong
The i.b.m.'s have already gone
Talkin's too late
The future has ended now
Can't change our fate

So sorry now
But that don't change a thing anyhow
Let the games begin
The dealer laid hands out that no one can win

What made us this way
Something I'm doing or something I say
But could it be a fact
That I never thought I'd get caught in the act

And I, I don't know why I still keep
Hangin' around when I know that it's time
Popped the silo
Pushed the button
It's the big one this time

Doctor strange love, we're all in your movie now
You get no change love
Your bill is too high

The threat's on it's way
The package from hell that you ordered today
Pray to your sign
Your wish has been granted this time

And I, I don't know why I still keep
Hangin' around when I know that it's time
Popped the silo
Pushed the button
It's the big one this time.",Pop the Silo,1981
