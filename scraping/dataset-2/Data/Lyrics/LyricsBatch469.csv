Joe Cohn,"It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me feel blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.
For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still,
It had to be you, wonderful you,
It had to be you.

It had to be you, it had to be you.
I wandered around and finally found somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue,
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you.

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss,
But they wouldn't do.

For nobody else gave me a thrill.
With all your faults, I love you still.

It had to be you, wonderful you

It had to be you.",It Had to Be You,2007
Joe Cohn,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,2007
Joe Cohn,"I get up in the evening 
And I ain't got nothing to say 
I come home in the morning 
I go to bed feeling the same way 
I ain't nothing but tired 
Man I'm just tired and bored with myself 
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help 

You can't start a fire 
You can't start a fire without a spark 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 

Message keeps getting clearer 
Radio's on and I'm moving 'round the place 
I check my look in the mirror 
I wanna change my clothes, my hair, my face 
Man I ain't getting nowhere 
I'm just living in a dump like this 
There's something happening somewhere 
Baby I just know that there is 

You can't start a fire 
You can't start a fire without a spark 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 

You sit around getting older 
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me 
I'll shake this world off my shoulders 
Come on baby this laugh's on me 

Stay on the streets of this town 
And they'll be carving you up alright 
They say you gotta stay hungry 
Hey baby I'm just about starving tonight 
I'm dying for some action 
I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book 
I need a love reaction 
Come on now baby gimme just one look 

You can't start a fire sitting 'round crying over a broken heart 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart 
This gun's for hire 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Even if we're just dancing in the dark 
Hey baby",Dancing in the Dark,2007
Joe Cohn,"If there is someone lovelier than you
Then I am blind, a man without a mind
If there is someone lovelier than you

But no, I'm not blind
My eyes have traveled everywhere
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true

If there is someone lovelier than you
By all that's beautiful
Such beauty can't be true",If There Is Someone Lovelier Than You,2007
Joe Cohn,"Copper comes from Arizona
Peaches come from Georgia
And lobsters come from Maine
The wheat fields 
Are the sweet fields of Nebraska
And Kansas gets bonanzas from the grain

Old whiskey comes from old Kentucky

New Jersey gives us glue
And you, you come from Rhode Island
And little old Rhode Island 
Is famous for you

Cotton comes from Lou-siana
Gophers from Montana
And spuds from Idaho
They plow land 
In the cow land of Missour-a

Gold comes from Nevada
Divorces also do
And you, you come from Rhode Island

Pencils come from Pennsylvania
Vest from Vest Virginia

Joe Cohn,"Oh, give me something to remember you by
When you are far away from me
Just a little something, meaning love cannot die
No matter where you chance to be

So I'll pray for you, night and day for you
It will see me through like a charm 'til you return
So give me something I can remember you by
When you are far away from me

So I'll pray for you, every single day for you
It will see me through like a charm until you return

Joe Cohn,"I hadn't anyone till you,
I was a lonely one 'til you,
I used to lie awake and wonder if there could be
A someone in the wide world just made for me,
Now I see

I had to save my love for you, (I saved my love for you)
I never gave my love 'til you, (I saved it all for you)
And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.

I kept my love in secrecy,
I put it under lock and key,
I had to save my love for you!
I never gave my love away,
I waited for that lucky day
When I could give it to you

And through my lonely heart demanding it,
Cupid took a hand in it,
I hadn't anyone till you.",I Hadn't Anyone Till You,2007
Joe Cohn,"You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like glorious, glamorous and that old standby amorous
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much and just too very, very
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous, too marvelous for words

You're much, you're too much and just too very, very
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary

I'll ever adore,
So forgive me, do,
If I say to you
What I've said so often before.

I love you, Samantha,
And my love will never die.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Together, Samantha,
We could ride a star and ride it high.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
And if some distant day
You decided to say,
""Get along, go away, goodbye!""
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one-gal guy.
Remember, Samantha,
I'm a one gal guy.","I Love You, Samantha",2009

The bass that's in your face, sho' nuff shrugs your face

You know you want to be free
Darling, you know I'll let you go
You'd do the same for me
 
I understand
And darling, you are not to blame
If when we kiss it's not the same
I understand
It's not your fault because your heart has changed it's mind
You didn't mean to be unkind
I understand
Forgetting you will be far from easy
I've grown so used to your charms
I'll miss that old thrill and no one can fill
The place here in my arms
But if you find our love was really meant to be
Then darling, hurry back to me
And I'll understand

Joe Comfort,"When Sunny gets blue, her eyes get gray and cloudy
Then the rain begins to fall, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
Love is gone; what can matter?
No sweet lover-man comes to call

When Sunny gets blue, she breaths a sigh of sadness
Like the wind that stirs the trees
Wind that sets the leaves to swaying 
Like some violin is playing strange and haunting melodies

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same

When Sunny gets blue, pretty dreams will rise up 
Where her other dreams fell through
Hurry, new love, hurry here to kiss away each lonely tear
And hold her near when Sunny gets blue

People used to love to hear her laugh, see her smile
That's how she got her name
Since that sad affair, she lost her smile, changed her style
Somehow she's not the same",When Sunny Gets Blue,1962
Joe Comfort,"Somewhere there's music
How faint the tune
Somewhere there's Heaven
How high the moon

There is no moon above
When love is far away too
Till it comes true
That you love me as I love you

Somewhere there's music
It's where you are
Somewhere there's Heaven
How near, how far

The darkest night would shine
If you would come to me soon
Until you will how still my heart
How high the moon

""How high the moon""
Is the name of the song
How high the moon

Though the words may be wrong
We're singing it because you ask for it
So we're singing it just for you

How high the moon
Does it touch the stars?
How high the moon
Does it reach out to Mars?

Though the words may be wrong to the song
We're asking a high, high, high, high
High is the moon

Though the words may be wrong to the song
We're ought to make high, high, high, high
High is the moon",How High the Moon,1996
Joe Comfort,"The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, â??My dear friends I have given my all.
I'm sorry, it's all over now.â??
When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Oh, Mr. Paganini
Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini,
We breathlessly await your masterful dtente
Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to
Scat

We heard your repertoire
And at the final bar
We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of:
â??I never cared much for moonlight skies
I never blinked back at fireflies'
Would do

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini, please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it, wont you sing it?
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping
Scat

Listen Paganini,
We breathlessly await your masterful dtente
Come on and spring it
If the boys is bopping
Aint no need in stopping
Scat

I heard your repertoire and
At the final bar
We greeted you, we greeted you
With wild applause
But what a great ovation
Your interpretation of
Scat

Listen Paganini
Now, don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to
Swing it",You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini),1996
Joe Comfort,"The very thought of you and I forget to do 
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do 
I'm living in a kind of daydream 
I'm happy as a king 
And foolish though it may seem 
To me that's everything 

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you 
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you 
I see your face in every flower 
Your eyes in stars above 
It's just the thought of you 
The very thought of you, my love 

The mere idea of you, the longing here for you 
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you

Clap your hands this evening, come on
(Scratching), this is for the homies(4x)

(Rodney O)
I'm Rodney O and I'm back, on a track that's not wack
And my DJ, Joe Cooley's still on top of the stack
So you can say he's like wine, he's getting better with time
And General Jeff is by my side, to support my rhymes
We clock dollars, not dimes, we rock bells and chimes
And I'm a be	-boy 100%, like Moonshine
So listen up everybody 'cause you should not miss
""As we go a little something like this"" --> Slick Rick
Well I'm a true blue MC with plenty of pizzazz
Plantin and scratchin is Joe's favorite task
Is he the best? Well there's no need to ask
Take a look at him as he moves fast
As lightnin, and you know what's so damn frightenin?
You others are soft, and you still haven't ripened 
Yet, I'm not knockin you, I'm just rockin to
A funky beat that is just cold sockin you
I'n the face, we got pounds of bass
And check it out everybody, Joe Cooley's in the place

[Chorus 1]
(Rodney O)
I brought the microphone, Joe Cooley brought the mixer
I drink Coca-Cola, not hardcore liquor
'cause I'm playin it straight, the homies like the 8
""It's the power!"" that makes it taste so great
I'm kickin back in the hood, this beat is kickin real good
If you was kickin it like me, you wouldn't have to ask, would
This bass reflect, the maximum effect
This jam is for the homies, and it's comin direct
Straight from the heart, and I will do my part
This groove has been groovin straight from the start
This is for the homies, and the homegirls too
Joe Cooley, tell them what you want 'em to do

[Chorus 2:]
Say yeah, yeah, yeah(this is for the homies)(4x)

(Rodney O)
I'm gettin straight to the point
Hold a mic, not a joint
Like the end is lit up, so it's Joe and he cuts
Newmark is is brand, all gummies get canned
""This is for the homies!"" is the name of this jam
We rock it like an earthquake, we're conquerin states
Rodney O and Joe Cooley doing many tour dates
Dedicating this song, to the homies at home
This beat is on the street wherever you roam
We're household names, in the hip-hop game
So repeat after me, ""Joe, scratch that thang!""

So what up, niggas? Yeah, I got the funky jam
Come up on your blindside - aw shit, here I am

I'm not down with the r&b, it make me sick
Seeing a crooner tryin to add a rap a little bit
You know what I'm talkin about, that shit's not real rap
They try to add the hip-hop flavor, and it's still wack

Ugh - fever in the funk house
Yeah, and if you play, then you know what I'm talkin about
Who you're foolin when you say that you can fade the O?
I got a New York critic in a choke hold

He dissed my record cause he didn't like my vocals
Now I'm showin him the meaning of loco
I'm not friends with my peers, so I'm overlooked
I got the p-funk, fool, on a funky hook

I'm payin suckers back for all the years of dissin me

Never tell me dreams come true
Just try it and I'll start a riot

Ever tell me he will care
I'm certain it's the final curtain

Who tell you fate supplies a mate
It's all bananas

They're writing songs of love but not for me
A lucky star's above but not for me
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss
I guess he's not for me

And trouble begins to brew,
Whenever the Winter winds become too strong,
I concentrate on you.

When fortune cries ""Nay! Nay!"" to me
And people declare ""You're through!"",
Whenever the blues become my only song,
I concentrate on you.

On your smile so sweet, so tender,
When at first your kiss I decline.
On the light in your eyes when I surrender,
And once again our arms intertwine

And so, when wise men say to me
That love's young dream never comes true,
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,
I concentrate on you.",I Concentrate on You,1997

Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

So if you want to go walking, dear, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

You're sentimental, 'cause so am I, 
It's delightful, it's delicious, it's de-lovely.

So please be sweet, my chickadee, 
And when I kiss you, just say to me, 
""It's delightful, it's delicious, 
It's delectable, it's delirious, 
It's dilemma, it's delimit, it's deluxe, 
It's de-lovely"". 

I feel a sudden urge to sing 
The kind of ditty that invokes the spring. 

I'll control my desire to curse 
While you crucify the verse. 

This verse I started seems to me 
The Tin-Pantithesis of a melody

So spare us all the pain, 
Just skip the darn thing and sing the refrain

Do, sol, mi, do, la, si.

Why do we have it so rough 
Is it so hard just to stay close together

I've a feelin' what we really need right now, girl

Te voy a llevar a Puerto Rico
y abajo de la palma voy a besarte
pero no pidas que me case mami
papeles no voy a firmar

Mulata
mi prieta
mi cielo
te quiero
te adoro
divina mujer

Mujer divina
como fascinas
y me dominas
el corazon

Eh ah mi mulata
el corazon
cuando bailas el rico chacha te arrebata
el corazon
tiene mi mulata sandunga y sabrosura
el corazon
que yo me voy para el congo
el corazon
a comerme el sabroso mofongo
el corazon
ay

I could blossom out I know, 
With somebody just like you. So

I am so awfully misunderstood

Keep on smiling 'cause when you're smiling,

I used to hurry,
Each time it started to rain,
Now I see light,

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,2001

Joe Darensbourg,"I want to take you to a little room
A little room where all the roses bloom
I want to lead you into Nature's hall
Where ev'ry year the roses give a ball
They have an orchestra up in the trees
For their musicians are the birds and bees
And they will sing us a song
As we are strolling along
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose
 
The ball is over and tulips meet
Their little kisses are so short and sweet
The lilies nod to the forget-me-nots
When they're departing in their flower pots
But all the roses with their spirits high
Remain to love until they droop and die
And dear, why shouldn't it be
Just so with you and with me
 
In sunny Roseland, where summer breezes are playing
Where the honey bees are ""A-Maying""
There all the roses are swaying
Dancing while the meadow brook flows
The moon when shining is more than ever designing
For 'tis ever then I am pining
Pining to be sweetly reclining
Somewhere in Roseland
Beside a beautiful rose

Joe Darensbourg,"Love, oh love, oh careless love
You've fly through my head like wine
You've wrecked the life of a many poor girl
And you nearly spoiled this life of mine

Love, oh love, oh careless love
In your clutches of desire
You've made me break a many true vow
Then you set my very soul on fire

Love, oh love, oh careless love
All my happiness bereft
You've filled my heart with weary old blues
Now I'm walkin', talkin' to myself

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Trusted you now, it's too late
You've made me throw my old friend down
That's why I sing this song of hate

Love, oh love, oh careless love
Night and day, I weep and moan
You brought the wrong man into this life of mine
For my sins, till judgment I'll atone",Careless Love,1958

Joe Dassin,"Au coin des rues, devant les cafés
Et pour les queues de cinéma, la nuit tombée
Il chantait des chansons de tous les pays
Qui pourtant n’étaient qu’à lui

Et les passants s’arrêtaient le temps d’un refrain
En se disant qu’il aurait pu faire son chemin
Mais lui ne voulait pas de ce chemin là
Et sa vie lui allait bien

Tant qu’on a sa chanson à chanter
Et quelqu’un quelque part 
Qui s’attarde à l’écouter	
Tant que les filles sont belles
Que le soleil veut bien briller
Tant qu’on peut encore rêver

On n’a pas besoin d’argent pour être riche
Qu’importe les lauriers, il suffit pour bien vivre
D’aimer la vie pour ce qu’elle est
Et il chantait

Mais les gens qui ne voient pas plus loin que leur vie
Disaient : « Voilà bien la jeunesse d’aujourd’hui
Si chacun ne faisait que ce qui lui plaît
Que deviendrait le pays »

Tant qu’on a sa chanson à chanter
Et quelqu’un quelque part 
Qui s’attarde à l’écouter
Tant que les filles sont belles
Que le soleil veut bien briller
Tant qu’on peut encore rêver

On n’a pas besoin d’argent pour être riche
Qu’importe les lauriers, il suffit pour bien vivre
D’aimer la vie pour ce qu’elle est
Et il chantait

Et puis les regardait regagner chaque nuit
Leur petit pavillon, leur bonheur à crédit
Leurs amours régulières, contractées par notaires
Il n’en avait pas envie

Tant qu’on a sa chanson à chanter

Qui s’attarde à l’écouter
Tant que les filles sont belles
Que le soleil veut bien briller
Tant qu’on peut encore rêver",Le Chanteur des Rues,1979

De faire un détour loin des chemins programmés

Un jour m´a conduit à l´école
Emmitouflé dans un cache-col
Armé d´un cartable verni
J´ai connu les bons, les méchants
Les points sur les i, sur la gole
Il était quelques fois bien seul
Le deuxième homme de maman

Elle chantait ma mère
Elle chantait souvent
Des chansons d´hier
Des chansons d´avant

La première femme de ma vie
Je l´ai quittée pour être un homme
C´est toujours un matin d´automne
Que les enfants s´en vont du lit
C´est toujours un matin de pluie
C´est souvent pour une autre femme

Elle chantait ma mère
Elle chantait souvent
Des chansons d´hier
Des chansons d´avant",La Première Femme de Ma Vie,1989

Toutes ces rues qui ont des noms célèbres
Je les ai oubliées 
Mais je garde dans mes pensées
Tous les visages que j’y voyais naguère
Et mon plan de la ville est un calendrier

Toutes les rues de Paris portent un prénom de fille
Souvenirs d’un temps disparu

Y’a la rue Stéphanie et la rue Caroline
L’avenue de la fille inconnue
Le boulevard Virginie et l’impasse Martine
Ces jolis rendez-vous qui n’existent plus
Mais ma rue préférée
Celle où j’aimais rêver
Elle a un nom qui danse
La rue Marie Laurence

Pauvre Molière 
Pauvre Pierre Corneille
Pauvre Emile Zola
Malheureux Léon Gambetta 
Du paradis où vos âmes sommeillent
Pardonnez à celui
Par la faute de qui

Toutes les rues de Paris portent un prénom de fille
Souvenirs d’amours disparues

Y’a la rue Stéphanie et la rue Caroline
L’avenue de la fille inconnue
Le boulevard Virginie et l’impasse Martine
Ces jolis rendez-vous qui n’existent plus
Mais ma rue préférée
Celle où j’aimais rêver
Elle a un nom qui danse

Joe Dassin,"Vois cet oiseau blanc prisonnier du ciel
Dans sa grande cage étoilée
Moi, de temps en temps je me sens pareil
À cet éternel exilé

Lui, qui ne sait pas replier ces ailes
Moi, qui ne sais pas m´arrêter

Vois cet oiseau blanc prisonnier du ciel
Dans sa grande cage étoilée
Moi, de temps en temps je me sens pareil
À ce voyageur fatigué

Toi, de tout en bas parfois tu l´appelles
Lui, il voudrait bien se poser
Mais il ne peut pas replier ses ailes
Et toi, tu ne peux pas t´envoler",L' Albatros,1989
Joe Dassin,"Dance with me, I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is falling, and I am falling
Dance with me

Fantasy could never be so giving
I feel free, I hope that you are willing
Pick the beat up, and kick your feet up
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes, and love is all around us
I can take you where you want to go

Dance with me, I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is falling, and I am falling
Dance with me

Let it lift you off the ground
Starry eyes, and love is all around us
I can take you if you want to go

Dance with me, I want to be your partner
Can't you see the music is just starting?
Night is falling, and I am falling

Joe Dassin,"Devant sa page blanche
Un musicien commence
Une valse triste
C’est pas toujours gai, les artistes

Il chante pour lui-même
Les notes qui lui viennent
Comme un vent d’automne
C’est pas toujours gai, la Pologne

Sa chanson, son chagrin l’a volée au piano
Et elle tourne sur ta stéréo
Dans la nuit, quand tu as le cœur gros
Sa chanson, c’est l’adieu qu’il n’a pas su lui dire
Une musique pour se souvenir, se souvenir

Le soleil se rallume
Il a usé sa plume
Sur sa valse triste
Ca dort pas souvent, les artistes

Qu’importe qui tu aimes
Les adieux sont les mêmes
Et le vent d’automne
Va bien plus loin que la Pologne

Sa chanson, il l’a faite sans savoir comment
C’est peut-être son cœur qu’on entend
Quand un autre la chante en passant
Sa chanson, c’est l’adieu qu’il n’a pas su lui dire
Une musique pour se souvenir, se souvenir",Chanson Triste,1989
Joe Dassin,"Comme disait Valentine
Qui n’a rien inventé
A quoi sert l’aspirine
Quand on a la santé
A quoi sert d’être zouave
Sur le pont Mirabeau
A quoi sert d’être brave
Quand on n’a pas de pot
C’est trop, c’est trop

Il faut se contenter du temps qu’il fait
De l’eau que l’on boit
On n’a pas choisi, on est ce qu’on est
Et on a ce qu’on a
Si t’es gondolier à Tombouctou
T’es pas dans le coup
T’as pas d’avenir
Si t’es fourreur au Zaïre
Tu n’as aucun espoir
Si t’es fakir à Clamart

Comme disait Valentine
Qui n’a pas peur des mots 
A quoi sert la marine
Quand on fait du vélo
A quoi sert la Guadeloupe
Quand on est du Soudan
A quoi sert d’être en groupe
Quand on a mal aux dents
On perd du temps

On n’peut quand même pas vivre et mourir
Il faut faire un choix
C’est pour le meilleur ou pour l’Empire
Comme disait le roi
Faut pas se moquer des Parisiens
Ils n’y sont pour rien
C’est la faute à ton père
Si t’es natif de Quimper
Mieux vaut naître à Moscou
Que de ne pas naître du tout

Comme disait Valentine
Qui n’est pas un cerveau
A quoi sert Lamartine
Sans son alter Hugo
Comme disait Charlemagne
A son bon Saint Eloi
A quoi servent les dames
Quand on est Henri III
C’est pas la joie

Qu’on mette les villes à la campagne
Chatou en Espagne
Tout le monde veut du changement
Tout le monde sera content 
Tout le monde veut du nouveau
Tout le monde dira bravo",Comme Disait Valentine,1989
Joe Dassin,"Et ce type là devant la glace
De sa loge, une serviette autour du cou
Ce type là, je le regarde bien en face
Et je ne le reconnais pas, mais pas du tout

Le balladin de tout à l’heure
Qui chantait sous les projecteurs
Il redevient monsieur untel
Qui va rentrer dans son hôtel

Voici le décor à l’envers
L’autre côté de la lumière
Sur une chaise un costume blanc	
Une chanson déjà oubliée	
Et sur les murs de la cité
Des restes de publicité
Qui volent au vent

Le magicien qui a fini son numéro
Range ses cartes et son lapin
Et moi je rentre ma guitare et mon lasso
Et je me rentre dans ma peau jusqu’à demain

Un steak au buffet de la gare
Avec les visiteurs du soir
Et un whisky pour le moral
Dans une boîte couleur locale

Voici le décor à l’envers
L’autre côté de la lumière
Sur une chaise un costume blanc
Une chanson déjà oubliée
Et sur les murs de la cité
Des restes de publicité
Qui volent au vent

Et ce type là qui se réveille sans savoir
Dans quelle ville il a dormi
Ce type là, je le retrouve tous les soirs
Et je n’arrive pas à croire que c’est bien lui

Le balladin, l’illusionniste
Qui va refaire son tour de piste
J’ai devant moi monsieur untel
Un simple client de l’hôtel

Voici le décor à l’envers
L’autre côté de la lumière
Sur une chaise un costume blanc
Une chanson déjà oubliée
Et sur les murs de la cité
Des restes de publicité
Qui volent au vent",Le Costume Blanc,1989

Dans un pub rétro
Tout près de la cité
Chaque soir il va jouer
Fox-trot et tango
Musique à grand-papa
Pour des tas d’fils à papa
Du Cole Porter et du Gershwin
C’est de la routine
Il n’est pas fâché
D’aller se coucher

Le premier métro
S’en va dans la nuit
Trois notes et trois mots
Avant d’aller au lit
Il fait des chansons

Il est plein d’espoir
Il s’endort en pensant
Sûr que ça va plaire aux gens
On verra ce soir
Il faut que je l’essaie

C’est de la routine

Joe Dassin,"Je me baladais sur l'avenue le coeur ouvert, un inconnu
J'avais envie de dire bonjour à n'importe qui
N'importe qui et ce fut toi, je t'ai dit n'importe quoi

Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées

Tu m'as dit ""J'ai rendez-vous dans un sous-sol avec des fous
Qui vivent la guitare à la main, du soir au matin""
Alors je t'ai accompagnée, on a chanté, on a dansé
Et l'on n'a même pas pensé à s'embrasser

Aux Champs-Elysées, aux Champs-Elysées
Au soleil, sous la pluie, à midi ou à minuit
Il y a tout ce que vous voulez aux Champs-Elysées

Hier soir deux inconnus et ce matin sur l'avenue
Deux amoureux tout étourdis par la longue nuit
Et de l'étoile à la Concorde, un orchestre à mille cordes
Tous les oiseaux du point du jour chantent l'amour

Joe Dassin,"Mon papa est parti quand j´avais trois ans
Il laissait pas grand-chose à ma pauvre maman
Rien qu´ cette vieille guitare et quelques bouteilles vides
Je ne lui en veux pas de nous avoir quittés
Mais de m´avoir fait la pire des saletés
Avant d´ partir, il m´a donné l´ nom d´ Suzy

Comme cadeau d´ rupture, c´était gratiné
J´ai passé mon temps à me bagarrer
Pas un seul moment de paix de toute ma vie
Y en a eu des filles qui m´ont fait rougir
Y en a eu des gars qu´il a fallu punir
Croyez-moi, la vie n´est pas drôle quand on s´appelle Suzy!

Alors, j´ai grandi vite, j´ai grandi méchant
Mes poings ont durci, ma tête en même temps
J´ai couru de ville en ville pour cacher ma honte
Mais je me suis juré par tout c´ qu´y m´ faut
De fouiller les bars et les tripots
Et de tuer l´homme qui m´avait donné c´t horrible nom
C´était Kansas City
Au mois d´ juillet, la poussière volait, la langue me brûlait
J´ suis rentré dans un bar me mettre à l´abri
Dans ce sale bistrot, ce truc pourri
Devant un poker était assis
Le chien galeux qui m´avait appelé Suzy

D´après une vieille photo trouvée chez ma mère
Ce serpent visqueux, c´était bien mon père
J´ai reconnu sa balafre et son œil tordu
Il était grand et laid, tout gris, tout courbé
Il m´a regardé, mon sang s´est glacé
J´ lui dis ""J´ m´appelle Suzy, comment vas-tu?""
Puis ""Je vais te faire la peau""
Exactement comme ça que j´ lui ai dit, ouais!

Je me suis sûrement battu contre pire
Mais j´en ai perdu le souvenir
Il bottait comme un cheval et mordait comme un crocodile
Mais quand j´ai vu qu´il allait tirer
J´ai pris mon colt, il n´a plus bougé
Il m´a balancé un grand sourire tranquille
Il me dit ""Mon fils, ce monde est dur
Il faut être blindé pour réussir
Je savais que je n´ serais pas là pour te pistonner
C´est pour ça qu´ j´ t´ai donné ce prénom
J´ t´ai mis dans la pire des positions
Et si tu t´en es sorti, c´est que j´ai gagné
Tu viens de faire une sacrée belle bagarre
T´avais bien le droit de m´en vouloir
Moi, j´ t´en voudrais pas si tu me tuais aujourd´hui
Mais avant d´ le faire, remercie-moi
Si t´as le cœur solide et de l´estomac
C´est qu´un jour, un enfant d´ salaud t´a appelé Suzy""

Il m´avait eu! J´étais fait comme un rat!
Et y m´ dit ""Fiston"", je lui dis ""Papa""
Et le cœur tout retourné, je suis reparti
Et de temps en temps, moi, je pense à lui
Quand j´ai un coup dur dans cette garce de vie
Et si jamais un jour, je fais un garçon
Eh bien, je crois que j´ vais l´appeler
Gaston, ou William, ou n´importe quoi

Elle passe la main sur son cou 
Fait la grimace

Que même au bout du monde
Je peux suivre de loin

A l’heure qu’il est, Je sais qu’elle est plus belle
Que toutes les autres femmes de la ville

Et je suis le roi des imbéciles
De n’être pas ce soir devant l’école
Guettant la sortie des enfants
Qui caracolent
 Au devant de leurs mamans

Je la connais si bien
Que même au bout du monde
Je peux suivre de loin
Son chemin quotidien

A l’heure qu’il est, je sais qu’elle se demande
Comment me chasser de son souvenir
Avec ce gamin qui me ressemble
Dans chaque geste et chaque sourire
A l’heure qu’il est, cette heure était la nôtre
Elle ne l’est plus, c’est du passé
Peut-être un autre
Saura t-il mieux l’aimer

The streets were still empty and glistening wet
I said:” How would you like
To share my Sunday Times?
The way to read a paper is over
Somebody else’s shoulder”
You said:” yes”, you said:” yes
I’d like to read the Times with you”
And we had tea and times for two  

We went through good times and bad
Side by side and ad by ad 
With time and Sundays flying by
Like paper planes in a summer sky
And Sunday was my favorite day
Until that Sunday you went away
Now you’re gone and there’s no one	
To talk about elections with
And argue over sections with

It’s Sunday morning, Sunday Blues
‘ve got piles of old papers full of bad news
And I won’t get out of bed
Until the sun has set
I’ve read the editorials, the week-end reviews
But I can’t get through on the rest of the news
‘cause now you’re gone, now you’re gone
I think of you between the lines
And I can’t get through the Sunday Times",Sunday Times,1989

Elle m’a fait la bise et puis elle est partie comme une fleur vers une plage lointaine
Elle nous avait plantés là, ma plante et moi ensemble, Je l’arrosais
Pendant toute la belle saison on patientait à l’ombre, on attendait

Ma plante perdait ses pétales et moi je dormais mal, c’était septembre
Nous vivions à petit feu, nous attendions tous les deux lassés d’attendre
Je la négligeais un peu, elle ne m’en voulait pas, elle comprenait 
On passait des folles nuits devant notre télé, on s’amusait

Ma violette africaine
Fleurs de printemps s’en viennent s’en vont
On retrouve dans la peine 
Ses compagnons des quatre saisons

Nous étions abandonnés, et comme les nuits d’hivers se faisaient longues
Je ramenais à la maison des copains, des chiens perdus, des vagabondes
Et ma plante vivait d’mégots et d’épingles à cheveux, elle se fanait
Elle se penchait vers la vitre, guettant sa maîtresse ou un peu de soleil

Le printemps a mis longtemps à m’apporter une gentille demoiselle
Elle m’a reprisé le cœur, elle a rangé mes placards et mis ma plante à la poubelle
Mais j’ai sauvé ma camarade, elle a réintégré sa cheminée

Sous ses larmes
L’ombre d’un amour
L’ombre d’un chagrin

Mais dans la glace

Joe Dassin,"Louis a fait le mur
Le mur de Fresnes dans la bure
De l’aumônier, il était sûr
De son bréviaire et de sa tonsure
Et il s’est dit:
« J’y suis, j’y suis! Enfin j’y suis.»
C’est dans l’église qu’on l’a cueilli

Puis il s’est fait la malle
Blotti dans un sac de toile
Déguisé en linge sale
Tous ses amis entouraient déjà 
la blanchisserie:
« J’y suis, j’y suis!» Qu’il leur a dit
Mais les poulets y étaient aussi

Oh! BYE BYE LOUIS, bye bye bye 
Oh! BYE BYE LOUIS
C’est la vie, c’est la vie Louis
Et sur le mur de sa prison
Il grave un petit bâton
Ca fait soixante douze évasions
Une fois de plus, il a failli
Voir sa femme et les petits
Qui s’impatientent à la maison
La promenade en rang par trois
Le boulet, la soupe aux pois
Louis n’a pas le goût à ça! 
BYE BYE LOUIS, LOUIS BYE BYE

Dans la prison qui dort
Peuplée de rêves de coffres forts
L’alarme sonne et chacun sort
Pour voir Louis qui s’évade encore
Et qui s’écrie:
« J’y suis, j’y suis! Cette fois j’y suis.»
Puis on le ramène dans son lit

Oh! BYE BYE LOUIS, bye bye bye 
Oh! BYE BYE LOUIS
C’est la vie, c’est la vie Louis
Les copains disent:« Ne t’en fais pas
Ca sera pour une autre fois.»
Mais Louis est sombre au violon
A la pensée que ses amis 
Font des casses dans le midi	
Pendant qu’à l’ombre il se morfond	
A ne rien faire de ses dix doigts
Il perd la main pour son travail
Il avait tant le goût à ça!

Dans la cohue 
De la salle des pas perdus
Elle courait après son train du soir
Je l’attendais
Depuis déjà tant d’années
Le temps d’y croire, elle m’avait échappé

Elle était OH
Et moi j’étais comme un fou
Elle était OH
A se mettre à genoux

Des cheveux blonds
Y’en avais plein les wagons
Mais ce n’était pas ceux que je cherchais
Six heures trente six 
En direction de Senlis
Et chaque tour de roue me répétait

Qu’elle était OH
Et moi j’étais comme un fou
Elle était OH
A se mettre à genoux

Dans ce train qui se traîne
Dans des forêts d’H.L.M.
Sous un ciel de fumée
Elle se cache peut-être
Dans un coin d’fenêtre
Mais comment la trouver- Eh Eh Eh

Elle était OH 
Et moi j’étais comme un fou
Elle était OH 
A se mettre à genoux

Voilà mon train qui s’envole
Je vois des gondoles
Des pigeons, des palais
En gare de Venise
Elle me donne sa valise
C’est comme si j’y étais- Eh Eh Eh


Je n’y suis pas,
J’ai la banlieue devant moi
Et une fille qui saute sur le quai
En gare de Sarcelles

Dans mes idées fumée je fais à peine son brouillon

Un halo de tabac 
Dansant dans la lumière

Mais qui pourrait me dire la couleur du papier ?
Y avait sûrement un lit puisqu’on s’est aimé

L’oubli ça tient à qui ?
Une inconnue qui passe
Qui s’égare une nuit
Au fond de mon impasse
L’oubli, ça tient à rien du tout
Mais pas à nous

Une fugue en Normandie pour arroser le beau temps
Un retour à Paris, je ne sais plus trop comment
Sauf la vague impression que c’était foutu

And I bow to a gypsy king
He taught me everything y know
And he plays a mean tambourine

So he got a gold ring in his ear
I got a brass one in my nose
For any mother’s son for any mamma’s cub
That’s the way it goes

I like my life it’s all I know
There’s nothing that I lack
So why do I dream
Of the bark of a tree
To scratch my back
And figure out
Why I groove on rainbow trout

Dreams dreams dreams
Recurrent dreams
Why do I have these dreams
Right foot in
And right foot out
That’s what it’s all about
Dreams dreams

I watch the world go by
Thru the bars of my mobil home
Why ain’t I satisfied
What do you mean by yellowstone

Now he’s got a foulard made of silk
I got a collar I’ve got a chain
But he drives our car he pays my bills
I only dance when it doesn’t rain

Like any bear I ever seen
Midway’s where I was raised
But why do I dream
Of sweet running streams
So cool to wade and
Tell me why
I get so sleepy in wintertime

Dreams dreams dreams
Recurrent dreams
Why do I have these dreams
Left foot in
And left foot out
That’s what it’s all about
Dreams dreams

He’s got a lunch box I got a pail
I climb a ladder he plays the drum
He got a moustache I got a tail
We just doing like we always done

Two steps is all I knew
Two steps’s o.k. by me
But why all these dreams
Of rolling around
On daisy greens
I got no clue
Just this feeling of déjà vu

Pour te revoir faire un détour

Toute une vie pour ta vie
L´éternité pour un jour
Pour un sourire, un regard
Pour le délire d´un espoir

Je vais courir le monde pour te trouver
Je vais briser la glace qui nous sépare

Joe Dassin,"C´était le quatre juin, le soleil tapait depuis le matin
Je m´occupais de la vigne et mon frère chargeait le foin
Et l´heure du déjeuner venue, on est retourné à la maison
Et notre mère a crié de la cuisine ""Essuyez vos pieds sur l´ paillasson""
Puis elle nous dit qu´elle avait des nouvelles de Bourg-les-Essonnes
Ce matin, Marie-Jeanne Guillaume s´est jetée du pont de la Garonne

Et mon père dit à ma mère en nous passant le plat de gratin
""La Marie-Jeanne, elle n´était pas très maligne, passe-moi donc le pain.
Y a bien encore deux hectares à labourer dans le champ de la canne""
Et maman dit ""Tu vois, quand j´y pense, c´est quand même bête pour cette pauvre Marie-Jeanne
On dirait qu´il n´arrive jamais rien de bon à Bourg-les-Essonnes
Et voilà qu´ Marie-Jeanne Guillaume va s´ jeter du pont de la Garonne""

Et mon frère dit qu´il se souvenait quand lui et moi et le grand Nicolas
On avait mis une grenouille dans le dos de Marie-Jeanne, un soir au cinéma
Et il me dit ""Tu te rappelles, tu lui parlais ce dimanche près de l´église
Donne-moi encore un peu de vin, c´est bien injuste la vie
Dire que j´ l´ai vue à la scierie hier à Bourg-les-Essonnes
Et qu´aujourd´hui Marie-Jeanne s´est jetée du pont de la Garonne""

Maman m´a dit enfin ""Mon grand, tu n´as pas beaucoup d´appétit
J´ai cuisiné tout ce matin et tu n´as rien touché, tu n´as rien pris
Dis-moi, la sœur de ce jeune curé est passée en auto
Elle m´a dit qu´elle viendrait dimanche à dîner
Oh, et à propos
Elle dit qu´elle a vu un garçon qui t´ ressemblait à Bourg-les-Essonnes
Et lui et Marie-Jeanne jetaient quelque chose du pont de la Garonne""

Toute une année est passée, on ne parle plus du tout de Marie-Jeanne
Mon frère qui s´est marié a pris un magasin avec sa femme
La grippe est venue par chez nous et mon père en est mort en janvier
Depuis, maman n´a plus envie de faire grand-chose, elle est toujours fatiguée
Et moi, de temps en temps j´ vais ramasser quelques fleurs du côté des Essonnes
Et je les jette dans les eaux boueuses du haut du pont de la Garonne",Marie-Jeanne,1993

Quand l'amour fait place au quotidien
On n'était pas faits pour vivre ensemble
Ça n'suffit pas toujours de s'aimer bien
C'est drôle, hier on s'ennuyait
Et c'est à peine si l'on trouvait
Des mots pour se parler du mauvais temps
Et maintenant qu'il faut partir
On a cent mille choses à dire
Qui tiennent trop à coeur pour si peu de temps

On s'est aimés comme on se quitte
Tout simplement sans penser à demain
À demain qui vient toujours un peu trop vite
Aux adieux qui quelque fois se passent un peu trop bien

On fait c'qu'il faut, on tient nos rôles
On se regarde, on rit, on crâne un peu
On a toujours oublié quelque chose
C'est pas facile de se dire adieu
Et l'on sait trop bien que tôt ou tard
Demain peut-être ou même ce soir
On va se dire que tout n'est pas perdu
De ce roman inachevé on va se faire un conte de fées
Mais on a passé l'âge, on n'y croirait plus

On va descendre ensemble si tu veux
Et quand elle va nous voir passer
La patronne du café
Va encore nous dire ""Salut les amoureux!""

C’est presque la dernière page
Quand on se dit je t’aime un peu par pitié

En guise de cravates des cordes de lin.

Et puis contaminèrent les gens du voisinage

Car ils étaient encore plus bêtes que méchants

And everybody calls it polk salad, polk salad
Used to know a girl lived down there 
And she'd go out in the evenings and pick her a mess of it
Carry it home and cook it for supper
'Cause thats about all they had to eat, but they did all right

Down in Louisiana, where the alligators grow so mean
There lived a girl, that I swear to the world
Made the alligators look tame

Everybody said it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang

Everyday ?for supper time, she'd go down by the truck patch
And pick her a mess of polk salad, and carry it home in a tow sack
Polk salad Annie, the gators got your granny
Everybody says it was a shame
Cause her momma was a workin' on the chain gang
(A wretched, spiteful, straight-razor totin' woman
Lord have Mercy, pick a mess of it)

Avait l'horreur morbide
De ce liquide
Que l'on appelle de l'eau
La plus mauvaise
Etant la flotte anglaise
Billy à l'aise
Nous vengea de Waterloo

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
Ah qu'il était content le Napoléon
Il dit à Billy ""Toi tu me plais
Pour tout ce que tu as fait
Moi je te donne la Bourgogne""

À la mer des Antilles
Toutes les filles
De Billy raffolaient
Des Messalines
Des reines et des tsarines
Des Ursulines
Tout le monde y passait

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
Pour trousser les jupons et les cotillons
Avec tous les enfants qu'il a fait
Je me demande si tu n'es
Ou si je ne suis pas bâtard de

Messieurs, Mesdames
Voici la fin du drame
L'adieu aux armes
Laissez vos larmes couler
Billy l'unique
Billy le magnifique
C'est historique
Est mort assassiné

Car le bon vin de Saint Emilion
Ça vous donne un cœur de lion
Mais l'ennemi guettait le pauvre garçon
On lui a glissé dedans son verre
De l'eau à dose mortelle
Il est mort dans un dernier glou-glou

Ou Monsieur de Bordeaux

Bien plus qu'il ne l'est d'eau
Aussi, je te dédie cette histoire attachante
Espérant que demain, toi aussi tu la chantes",Billy le Bordelais,1999

Je voudrais bien lui faire un peu de conversation
Mais c'est la pluie d'orage qui vient tout arranger
Il pleut des seaux bip bip
Oh la pluie lui tombe sur le nez

Elle est désemparée qu'elle est belle sous la flotte
Je vais aller l'aider à remettre sa capote
Bientôt dans son abri la voilà qui me sourit
Je suis trempé bip bip

Qui n´avaient pas de rendez-vous.
Mais on verra bien,
C´est gagné d´avance,
Les amoureux de demain,
Vont nous inventer d´autres danses.

Un peu de tendresse au milieu du disco.

Joe Dassin,"Et si tu n'existais pas,
Dis-moi pourquoi j'existerais.
Pour traîner dans un monde sans toi,
Sans espoir et sans regrets.

Et si tu n'existais pas,
J'essaierais d'inventer l'amour,
Comme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts
Naître les couleurs du jour.
Et qui n'en revient pas.

Et si tu n'existais pas,
Dis-moi pour qui j'existerais.
Des passantes endormies dans mes bras
Que je n'aimerais jamais.

Et si tu n'existais pas,
Je ne serais qu'un point de plus
Dans ce monde qui vient et qui va,
Je me sentirais perdu,
J'aurais besoin de toi.

Et si tu n'existais pas,
Dis-moi comment j'existerais.
Je pourrais faire semblant d'être moi,
Mais je ne serais pas vrai.

Et si tu n'existais pas,
Je crois que je l'aurais trouve,
Le secret de la vie, le pourquoi,
Simplement pour te créer
Et pour te regarder.",Et Si Tu N'Existais Pas,2000
Joe Dassin,"Happy birthday,
C´est pas parce qu´on est seul qu´on n´a pas le droit de danser
De boire du champagne à sa propre santé
De tout illuminer et de se répéter, ""La vie, la vie est belle!""

Happy birthday,
Il est beau mon gâteau, cette année un peu plus petit
Et y a plus de bougies et je vais dîner aux chandelles
En bonne compagnie, la speakerine ce soir est belle

L´an dernier nous étions toi et moi
Cette année tu manques à mon gala
Et je danse sans partenaire
Un ballet qui n´en finit pas

Happy birthday,
C´est pas parce qu´on est seul, qu´on n´a pas le droit de parler
Du beau temps, de la neige et des anniversaires
Qui se sont éloignés, des prochains dont tu n´auras rien, rien à faire

Happy birthday,
Je me suis fait cadeau du blouson que tu n´aimais pas
Et d´un bel agenda pour tous mes rendez-vous d´amour

Joe Dassin,"Quelle bonne idée d’avoir fait du feu
Qu’on est bien quand il pleut
Avec une bonne discothèque
Bien au sec

Ont l’air de sortir du bain

Nous devrions avoir pitié
De ceux qui vont éternuer

Dans les bois, dans les mares
Organisent des meetings
Chez les cygnes
On se mare

Je n’en sais rien, Sylvie, c’est déjà loin, Sylvie

On perd jusqu’à la mémoire
D’un air que l’on a chanté
Et tant d’images nous séparent
Des paysages familiers
D’une rivière, d’un banc de square
Et d’une chambre où tu venais	

Qui se souvient de nous, Sylvie
Qui peut penser à nous ?
Qui sait encore, qu’il y a longtemps
On s’aimait fort, on s’aimait tant ?

Mais tout s’efface, tout se remplace, Sylvie

Et le bonheur lui même passe, Sylvie 
Comme le temps, Sylvie, comme le vent, Sylvie

On perd jusqu’à la mémoire
D’un air que l’on a chanté
Et cet instant et ce visage
Que l’on voudrait se rappeler
Ne sont que des châteaux de sable
Bientôt la mer va remonter

Qui se souvient de nous, Sylvie 
Qui peut penser à nous ?
Qui sait encore, qu’il y a longtemps
On s’aimait fort, on s’aimait tant ?

Où je me faisais un saut, histoire de me fringuer
Un gramophone jouait de fausses chansons russes
Sur un rouleau grinçant comme un portail rouillé

Elle n´avait l´air de rien, elle n´était pas grand-chose
Et pourtant sans savoir pourquoi je l´ai suivie
Tu hésites un moment, tu n´oses pas puis tu oses
Un moment de culot va bouleverser ta vie

Elle s´était acheté du tabac à rouler

Elle n´avait l´air de rien, elle n´était pas grand-chose
Voulez-vous prendre un verre, un pastis, deux alors?

On a pris l´apéro, le repas dure encore, et encore, et encore

Depuis, de temps en temps on reprend l´autobus
Le cent-soixante-six, direction Clignancourt
Et on va faire un tour dans ce marché aux puces
Où j´m´en veux tellement d´être allé faire un tour

Elle n´a plus l´air de rien, moi je n´suis pas grand-chose

Près à n'importe quoi et je pense 
Qu'on sera heureux tous les trois 

Tu sais, je ne vais pas te voir grandir 
Et c'est pas moi qui va t'apprendrai à lire ou taper dans un ballon

Mais ta maman fera tout pour que tu deviennes un homme

Juste une minute

Voilà, tout doucement",À mon fils (Sébastian),2010
Joe Dassin,"Et si tu n´existais pas,
Dis-moi pourquoi j´existerais?
Pour traîner dans un monde sans toi,
Sans espoir et sans regrets.

Et si tu n´existais pas,
J´essaierais d´inventer l´amour,
Comme un peintre qui voit sous ses doigts
Naître les couleurs du jour.
Et qui n´en revient pas.

Et si tu n´existais pas,
Dis-moi pour qui j´existerais?
Des passantes endormies dans mes bras
Que je n´aimerais jamais.

Et si tu n´existais pas,
Je ne serais qu´un point de plus
Dans ce monde qui vient et qui va,
Je me sentirais perdu,
J´aurais besoin de toi.

Et si tu n´existais pas,
Dis-moi comment j´existerais?
Je pourrais faire semblant d´être moi,
Mais je ne serais pas vrai.

Je crois que je l´aurais trouvé,
Le secret de la vie, le pourquoi,
Simplement pour te créer
Et pour te regarder.",Et si tu n’existais pas,2010

Je n'ai jamais été aussi heureux que ce matin-là

C'était l'automne
Un automne où il faisait beau
Une saison qui n'existe que dans le Nord de l'Amérique
Là-bas on l'appelle l'été indien

Tu vois, comme elle je reviens en arrière
Comme elle je me couche sur le sable et je me souviens
Je me souviens des marées hautes
Du soleil et du bonheur qui passaient sur la mer

Down and down I go
Round and round I go
Like a leaf caught in a tide

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1998
Joe Deniz,"I was just a lonely Melisande, Pity pity me.
Came a little wizard, waved his wand,
Dreamed you up for me.

Now I feel a tingle each time I glimpse your face go dreaming by;
Proving the heart is quicker than the eye.

When I Look At You, I hear lovely music
Can it be my heart that sings?
When I Look At You I look at an angel
Tell me where you've parked your wings.
Dizzy me, Silly moon, crazy quilt of a sky
Are you real, or a dream

But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide, just wait

It's no good unless he loves you, all the way
Happy to be near you

Deeper than the deep blue see is

Joe Derise,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dream",Polka Dots and Moonbeams,1989

Somewhere there's music
How near, how far
Somewhere there's heaven

Joe Derise,"As a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties,
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.
What a dunce I was before.
What a break! 
For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?

Dear, when in your arms I creep,
That divine rendezvous,
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep,
Let me dream that it's true!

Kiss me twice, then once more.
That makes thrice, let's make it four!

Like a nightingale without a song to sing
Oh, why should I have Spring fever
When it isn't even Spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Is just the heat rising off the road.
The rainbows I've been chasing keep
On fading 'fore I find my pot of gold.

And more and more I'm thinking that
The only treasures that I'll ever know
Are long ago and far behind
Wrapped up in my memories of home.

Home was a swimming hole
And a fishing pole
And the feel of a muddy road
Between my toes.
Home was a back porch swing
Where I would sit
And mama'd sing 'Amazing Grace'
While she hung out the clothes.
Home was an easy chair
With my daddy there
And the smell of
Sunday supper on the stove.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.

Now the miles I put behind me
Ain't as hard as the miles
That lay ahead.
It's way too late to listen
To the words of wisdom
That my daddy said.

The straight and narrow path
He showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.

Home was a swimming hole
And a fishing pole
And the feel of a muddy road
Between my toes.
Home was a back porch swing
Where I would sit
And mama'd sing 'Amazing Grace'
While she hung out the clothes.
Home was an easy chair
With my daddy there
And the smell of
Sunday supper on the stove.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.

The straight and narrow path
He showed me
Turned into a thousand winding roads.
My footsteps carry me away
But in my mind I'm always going home.",Home,1991
Joe Diffie,"The siren on the street outside, didn't even turn your head
It couldn't cut the silence between us in this bed
You're staring at your wall and I'm staring at mine
So we don't have to see each other cry

Back to back heartaches, side to side tears
If we don't face the problem the pain won't disappear
There's still some love between us, why else would we be here
With back to back heartaches and side to side tears

We lie here like statues in some ancient tomb
Man, it sure gets lonely with five walls in one room
This wall we built between us, we had to tear it down
But one of us will have to turn around

Back to back heartaches, side to side tears
If we don't face the problem the pain won't disappear
There's still some love between us, why else would we be here
With back to back heartaches and side to side tears

Joe Diffie,"Window seat 30,000 feet above the ground
Blue moon beams on silver wings brings me down
Slipping off my coat for the long night flight
I find a note she wrote last night
I can almost hear those words as I close my eyes

Goodnight sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
God hold you in His arms, while we're apart
Though you're far away, your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are

These days I leave the one who needs me more and more it seems
It's a high price that she pays for the dreams I dream

So goodnight sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
God hold you in His arms, while we're apart
Though you're far away, your love will stay
Tucked away here in my heart
Goodnight sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are
Goodnight sweetheart sleep tight, wherever you are

By the way he sat and stared
And me, I'd come to push and shove
So I pulled up a chair

We talked of roads untraveled 
We talked of love untrue 
Of strings that come unraveled 
We were kings and kindred fools
And just when I'd hit bottom
That old man raised his glass 
And said at least we had our chances
There's those who never have

So here's to all the soldiers 
Who have ever died in vain 
The insane locked up in themselves
The homeless down on Main
To those who stand on empty shores
And spit against the wind
And those who wait forever 
For ships that don't come in

He said it's only life's illusions 
That bring us to this bar 
To pick up these old crutches 
And compare each others scars 
'Cause the things we're calling heartache 
Hell, they're hardly worth our time 
We bitch about a dollar 
When there's those without a dime

And as he ordered one last round 
He said I guess we can't complain 
God made life a gamble
And we're still in the game

Joe Diffie,"You came home tired each day at 5:15
I'd be waitin' in the drive
With a Rawlings glove, a ball cap and a fungo bat
I could count on you to hit some flies

You'd say, ""Son, just keep your eye on the ball
Know when to duck and when to swing""
I guess you knew those rules you taught me then
I'd carry with me to this day

You made me what I am
You turned this little boy into a man
I count myself among the lucky
Knowing just how much you loved me
You'll always be my closest friend
You made me what I am

All decked out in a tux for the senior prom
You said, ""Son I'm proud and gave me a grin""
Slipped me a twenty and the keys to the family car
A couldn't sleep a wink 'till I got in

At 21 I stepped out on my own
Can't count the times I slipped and fell
But you always kept your faith in me
Even when I had none in myself

You made me what I am
You turned this little boy into a man
I count myself among the lucky
Knowing just how much you loved me
You'll always be my closest friend
You made me what I am

I better go, it's almost dark
I've rambled long enough
I just came by to see the stone
And tell you, Dad, I miss you so much

You had to love me

Joe Diffie,"Yesterday I missed my exit
On my way to Sears
A song was on the radio
I hadn't heard in years

For a minute there the interstate
Was 2nd Avenue
And I was singing, ""Everlasting Love""
And driving home to you

Somewhere down that road not taken
Will forever live those dreams that were forsaken
Just every now and then I think about what would have been
Somewhere down that road not taken

By now we'd have our own business
And a house just out of town
In a neighborhood that smelled like dinner
When the sun went down

Two kids playing in their rooms
With toys we never had
A little girl who looks like you
And a boy, just like his dad

Somewhere down that road not taken
Will forever live those dreams that were forsaken
Just every now and then I think about what would have been
Somewhere down that road not taken

What if I had asked you?
And what if you'd said, ""Yes""?
There's no way I'll ever know
Still I can't help but guess

Somewhere down that road not taken
Will forever live those dreams that were forsaken
Just every now and then I miss a place I've never been
Somewhere down that road not taken

Yesterday I missed my exit
On my way to Sears
",That Road Not Taken,1994
Joe Diffie,"There's a place I can go,
Where I know I'll always be welcome,
Night after night.
When your memory comes around,
I just take a ride down the road,
And look for the light.
When I see that old sign flashin',
That's when I know I'm on my way.

[Chorus]
I'm goin' out to the wild blue yonder.
Break through this cloud I'm under.
Out to the wild blue yonder,
And let my mind wander away.

Maybe I can find a friend there,
Someone who's been where I am,
And knows what to do.
With a heart that won't stop breakin',
And a mind that won't stop takin' me back,
To the image of you.
Tonight, I know my destination;
A place where no one knows your name.

When that whiskey pours like rain.

Joe Diffie,"The whole thing started at the dawn of man
He was sitting on a rock with a club in his hand
The very first time he laid eyes on her
She was dressed to kill in a saber-tooth fur
The hadn't invented any words to say
But he asked her in a primitive way
Do you want to go back to the cave

[Chorus:]
Back to the cave make a little fire
A man and a woman and a primal desire
That's the way it is that's the way it was
Before he made the wheel man was making love
A million years later in a Texas bar
A cowboy's listening to steel guitar
When she says hi my name's Irene
She's wearing bright red ropers and tight blue jeans
His eyes light up and his brain goes dim
He tries to be cool but she hears him say
You want to go back to the cave

(Chorus)

So you be Wilma and I'll be Fred
We'll throw the cat out the window put the kids to bed
Take a little trip through history
Do what's always come naturally
In the time machine at the end of the hall
We can be a couple of Neanderthals
Do you want to go back to the cave

(Chorus)

Don't blame us for the way we behave
The only way we know goes back to the cave
It's been done instinctively
Through pre-history
The road to the future
Leads back to the cave",Back to the Cave,1995

But I'll tell you a Christmas tale

You may think you've heard it all 
But you ain't heard nothing yet
About that crazy Christmas 
The North Pole can't forget

Well, Rudolph was under the weather 
He had to call-in sick
So he got on the horn to his cousin, Leroy
Who lived out in the sticks
He said: ""Santa's really countin' on me 
And I hate to pass the buck.""
Leroy said: ""Hey, I'm on my way."" 
And he jumped in his pick-up truck

When Leroy got to the North Pole 
All the reindeer snickered and laughed
They'd never seen a reindeer in overalls 
And a John Deere tractor hat
Santa jumped in and said: ""Just calm down
'Cause we've all got a job to do
And like it or not, Leroy's in charge 
And he's gonna be leadin' you.""

[Chorus]
And it was Leroy, the redneck reindeer 
Hooked to the front of the sleigh
Deliverin' toys to all the good ol' boys 
And girls along the way
He's just a down home, party animal
Two-stepping across the sky
He mixed jingle bells with a rebel yell 
And made history that night

Before that night was over 
Leroy had changed their tune
He had 'em scootin' a hoof on every roof 
By the light of the neon moon
Santa wrapped his bag with a dixie-flag 
He was havin' the time of his life
And you could hear him call 
""Merry Christmas to y'all
And to all of y'all a goodnight.""

There's just something women like about a Pickup Man

Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
'Cause there's something women like about a Pickup Man

You can set my truck on fire, and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I've got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man

A bucket of rust, or a brand new machine
Once around the block and you'll know what I mean

You can set my truck on fire, and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe DeVille
I've got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just something women like about a Pickup Man
Yes, there's something women like about a Pickup Man

On a road to happy ever after
And the story goes that the real world
Snug up and stole their sunlight and their laughter

They stood there in the dark and trying to see
That's the way I picture you and me

Sometimes love's no fairy tale
Matches made in Heaven sometimes fail
Well, we know love's so hard to find
Should we give up on us and leave it all behind
Or rewrite this story twice upon a time?

We could start at chapter ten, see those hearts again
Finding all the clouds have silver linings
And we're sure by chapter twelve all the stars that fell
Are back up in the sky and brightly shining

The choice is ours, the pen's still in our hands
We can right the wrong or we can write the end

Sometimes love's no fairy tale
Matches made in Heaven sometimes fail
Well, we know love's so hard to find
Should we give up on us and leave it all behind

And your feet are bare, in your cotton gown

Met in high school in the sixties
Everyone knew it was love from the start

One July in the midnight hour
He climbed upon the water tower
Stood on the rail and painted a 10 foot heart

In John Deere Green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters 3 foot high

And the whole town said
That he should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere Green

They settled down on 80 acres
Raising sweet corn, kids, and tomatoes
They went together like a hand and a glove

On a clear day from their front yard
If you look and know what to look for
Off to the east you can still read his words of love

In John Deere Green
On a hot summer night
He wrote Billy Bob loves Charlene
In letters 3 foot high

And the whole town said
The boy should have used red
But it looked good to Charlene
In John Deere Green

Painting over, it ain't no use
There ain't no paint in the world that'll cover it

But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

A man, a maid, a kiss, and then goodbye

Love came, planning to stay
Green Dolphin Street supplied the setting
The setting for nights beyond forgetting
And through these moments apart memories live in my heart
When I recall the love I found on
I could kiss the ground on Green Dolphin Street

Oh! Will you never set me free?
The ties that bound us
Are still around us

A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings

Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fair ground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!

First daffodils and long excited cables
And candle lights on little corner tables
And still my heart has wings

The ""Ile de France"" with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is Spring's
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings thrown aside dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings!
These foolish things remind me of you

Gardenia perfume ling'ring on a pillow
Wild strawb'ries only seven francs a kilo
And still my heart has wings

The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange how sweet to find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me

Two lovers on the street who walk like dreamers

And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain

I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
Oh, and more, much more than this
I did it my way

Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption

I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way

I've loved, I've laughed and cried
Had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing

To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
""Oh no, oh no not me
I did it my way""

For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way

The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way",My Way,2008

I see the sweet signs of defeat,
Like you're beaten but you feel no pain

Checking if you're alone,
Like a reflex from my guilty mind

I fall away into the background,
Like a shadow on the wall,
To leave you with your peace of mind

I watch from my window up high,
All alone in this room,

I think it's time that I changed my view

Like a king in his lonely kingdom,
A ruler who had no rules
Ooh, 
Oh I got nothing got left to lose,
I think it?s time that I changed my view

Why did you choose my way?
Why did you come down this lonely street?
Was it to meet me?
Was it to tango? 
Well the roots they sound so sweet

Sweeter than gold,
Sweeter than fame,
Sweeter than honey
Won't power the money

Walking along this lonely street,
Someone I'd like to meet,
Someone I'd like to know,
As a kindred soul

oh so spiritual the sound ran down like waterfalls
Running away never the same
Changing my view of you everyday

And his heart's as empty as a dead man's eyes

Joe Eddy Hines,"The last to know, party's over and we won't go
No one to laugh at our jokes anymore
There's the door, don't forget your hat.
The stores are all closed, couldn't buy a break anyway
Saint Jude he couldn't save you or me, I suppose

[Chorus]
More miles than money, look at out lives and it's so funny
More miles than money, we fall in love and it's never funny
We're the last, very last to know.

Last to know, we play the jokers in this minstrel show
Cause no one cares in this showbiz crowd anymore.
Got another cigarette, I'm not quite through with this story yet,
Nothing left here that we should fear, I suppose.

[Chorus: x2]

From the cradle to the grave all the memories never saved
Nothing here that we should fear so I'm told.
As the night slips away and we stumble towards another day
There's nothing more that we can say, I suppose.

Joe Eddy Hines,"If you found me lost on your porch one night,
Would you take me in and hold me tight?
And wrap a dream around my head,
In case I tumble out of bed?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

If you found me hanging without a prayer,
Would you cut me down and lay me there?
And wash the sins off of my hands,
So I might get another chance?

Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time
Just one more time

If I lost the buttons on my coat,
And I couldn't find the golden note,
Could I use your hands to find the light,
So I might make it through the night?

So I count my blessings in this world of sin;
The holes in the wall let the cold come in;
Could I use your skin to keep me warm,
So I might make it through the night?

Would ever wonder why I ever said good-by

Would ever wonder why I ever said good-by

Would ever wonder why I ever said good-by

And I noticed you weren't there when I got home

I just can't blame you at all
I've been on both sides of that wall
Just one thing before you say so long
I never meant to do you any wrong

I still think about the time we had together
Never could mean more than what it means
Thank you for helping me though all that rough weather
I don't think you'll be alone, sunshine turning",B.B.Q. & Foam,1979
Joe Ely,"Hey, whistle man, what's that on the track?
Looks like a crawdaddy sunnin' on his back
Hey, whistle man, why don't he run?
Looks like he's darin' this train to come

Blow your whistle, blow it low
Looks like he' rearin' up some more
Crawdaddy, crawdaddy, you better hide
Crawdaddy opened his pincers wide
Lord, he opened his pincers wide

Whistle man, whistle man, wasn't he brave?
A little crawdaddy tried to whoop this train
He was brave all right, brave as any man
But his judgement, Lord, wasn't worth a damn

The glitter of the party life turns my face to home
Lovers and acquaintances all through the land
Celebrate a grain of time down miles and miles of sand
The wheel of fortune has stopped again
Though the winning number was lost in the wind
But I heard a gypsy swear it was stolen by someone
Who steers a lonesome chariot in circles around the sun

Joe Ely,"I was standin' at a big hotel
Wishin' everybody well
But if anybody paid me any mind, it was hard to tell

A big policeman on his beat
Pulled his pistol and he pointed at me
Lookin' down the barrel I could see the gates of hell
Standin' at a big hotel

So I went walkin' down the avenue
Lookin' for someone who looked like you
But I never saw a face that seemed to ring a bell

I stopped beside the five-and-dime
Just window shoppin' and wastin' time
When along came a gal who sold me all she had to sell
She left me standin' at a big hotel

I lost my mind in the wilds of Hollywood
And I did some time in the shadows where I stood
I let the cards fall where they fell
And then I found myself standin' at a big hotel

A blind lady with a old tin cup
Had her pencils all sharpened up
She was standin' in the door just to see what she could sell

But nobody bought a thing all night
They just thought she was a pitiful sight
Now the Lord helps the gal who helps herself
Standin' at a big hotel

Oh, but I know what you're thinkin' today
I can feel it though I'm miles away
Everybody knows I love my southern belle

But from the East to the wild, wild West
They say a bird in the hand is best
Here I am with a bird dog and a bottle of muscatel
Standin' at a big hotel

I lost my mind in the wilds of Hollywood
And then I did some time in the shadows where I stood
I let the cards fall where they fell
And then I found myself standin' at a big hotel
Yeah, I found myself standin' at a big hotel",Standin' at the Big Hotel,1979

Dreamin' of Lorraine
Came so tired of ridin'
Cross the Savanna plain
Still feel the wheels a-rollin'
Feel them just the same
Steel wheels still a-rollin'
On a long night train

She met me at the station
Took me to her room
Was a time of meeting
Was a risin' moon
Angels set the table
With candles and beer
Heard that midnight train moan
Miles away from here

Lay me down a pallet
Lay it soft and low
Lorraine, lay beside me
Sad I had to go

Gypsy boy I traveled with
Played his old guitar
We watched that candle flicker
Like some low morning star

But the time to part must always come
Time the bells must ring
Time for lovers to say goodnight

Joe Ely,"I was standing at the end of the very longest line 
Between everywhere and nowhere, I could not make up my mind 
Stole enough to keep me honest, walked a crooked mile, I know 
I had more time than money, I had no place left to go 
Closed my eyes and chose a destination like any good refugee 
I stuck a fork into a road map right through Nashville, Tennessee 
Swimming pools, country stars 
Hitchhiking on the shoulder of the road to nowhere fast 
I flagged down a ride, next thing I know we're haulin' ass 
I turned to the scarecrow, to the lion, to the tin man 
I said ""Everyone in Nashville gonna wonder where we been, man"" 
'Cross the bridge into Memphis, I had my hat in my hand 
Paid our respects to The King and drove on to the promised land 
Welcome to Nashville, land of opportunity 
Welcome to Nashville, your cab driver knows Alan Jackson 
Welcome to Nashville, the dreams are shoulder-to-shoulder 
Welcome to Nashville
We crossed against the light on Broadway, we just got into town 
Nobody saw the blind man who was showing us around 
He'd just moved back to Nashville for the forty-second time 
Introduced himself as ""Hey buddy, can you spare a dime?"" 
He was back without a vengeance, he arrived there with a thud 
He was living on the sidewalk, he was thinning out his blood 
I told the hotel clerk about my band and our show in town tonight 
He said ""Let me guess, John, Paul, George and Ringo, am I right? 
Take a look around you, buddy, don't you know where you are? 
You can't throw a rock without hitting some guy with a guitar
Since you brought it up I must confess I got my own band, too"" 
He said his name was Wallace Hartley, I said ""Fancy meetin' you! 
Welcome to Nashville, everyone's a songwriter 
Welcome to Nashville, get yourself a crappy day job 
Welcome to Nashville, they're gonna tear you a new one 
Welcome to Nashville
If a tree falls in the forest and there's no one around 
If a band plays in Nashville, does it make a sound? 
We did our bit, three minutes that nobody came to see 
But we sure put some time out of its misery 
Singin' 'bout wallpaper cowboys and Hemmingway cats 
To a conflict of disinterest from their boots down to their hats 
I sang 'em six or seven hundred of my very best melodies 
They just said ""Boy, ain't you got any other songs than these?"" 
I go walkin' after midnight, goin' where the lonely go 
I got heartaches by the number, hear that lonesome whistle blow 
I took the grand tour, lived the nightlife, saw the rose garden too 
Found a good-hearted woman but I can't stop lovin' you 
If it's only make-believe, well, who's to bless and who's to blame? 
'Cause I walked the line and they never even called me by my name 
Welcome to Nashville, man, these guys are serious 
Welcome to Nashville, I've got a friend who's got a friend 
Welcome to Nashville, would you like fries with that? 
Welcome to Nashville, now go on home",Dream Camera,1984

Hotter than a pistol on a Saturday night

As you pull up to the curb in your black Sedan
It don't take her long, she knew you were comin'
With a slam of the screen she's off and she's runnin'
Now she's sittin' there beside you, you forget about the heat
You leave your troubles at the curb and take your passion to the street

With a steam-heated love
With a burning desire and a tropical fire in your blood
With a steam-heated love
That hurricane feelin' it's got you reelin'
You can't even wait for the flood

You put your arm around her and you tell her the news
And the white lines and the freeways, they twist like a fuse
While the pilgrims from the East with their U-Haul trailers
Build cities out of canvas just like shipwrecked sailors
And the asphalt sweats while the welders weld
And your wheels are hotter than the hinges of hell
And you better watch your step if you're just standing around
Because the buildings ain't constructed, they erupt from the ground

With a steam-heated love
With a burning desire and a tropical fire in your blood
With a steam-heated love

I seen a woman on a motorbike

With her lipstick in the night

In a back street shack was a young boy strummin'

Said I was headed for the Silver City
All along the line, I was dreaming all the time
Dreaming of the shining Silver City

I kissed my love goodbye, said ""Honey don't you cry""
For I'm going to the Silver City
If you could read my mind, you'd know that I'll be fine
Soon as I do my time in the Silver City

Two weeks and a day, I slowly made my way
To the gates of the Silver City
Finally one night, I saw the flaming lights
I had made it to the Silver City

I honestly believed that I would be received
With the golden key to the Silver City
But my first night on the town, bandits knocked me down
They welcomed me to the Silver City

""Musta' been a freak mistake"" I said as I did wake
In the gutter of the Silver City
With a throbbing head, I begged for my bread
Half-smiling as I bled in the Silver City

Oh, how can there ever be such misery in the streets?
How can it ever be in the Silver City?
But soon enough I saw how easy it was to fall
And not be seen at all in the Silver City

Got caught for a crime I done, policeman said ""Son""
""Don't you try to run in the Silver City""
He locked me in his jail, no one to go my bail
Oh, when can I sail away from the Silver City?

Now the moon cries through the bars, my love shines in the stars

Joe Ely,"Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night
Well Dallas is a jewel, oh yeah, Dallas is a beautiful sight
And Dallas is a jungle but Dallas gives a beautiful light
Did you ever see Dallas from a DC-9 at night

Well, Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down
But when you are up, she's the kind you want to take around
But Dallas ain't a woman to help you get your feet on the ground
Yes Dallas is a woman who will walk on you when you're down

Well, I came into Dallas with the bright lights on my mind
But I came into Dallas with a Dollar and a dime

Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eye
A steel and concrete soul with a warm hearted love disguise
A rich man who tends to believe in his own lies
Dallas is a rich man with a death wish in his eyes",Dallas,1990
Joe Ely," Drivin' to the Poorhouse in a Limosine
Livin' on soda-pop and nicotine
Brushin' off the glitter from a 2nd-Hand suit.
Lookin' for a Marks-A-Lot to polish my boots.
That's the life I live in a rock and roll band
Drivin' to the Poorhouse just as fast as I can.


Sleepin' in the back-seat at the Shopping Mall
Parkin' at the pay phone waitin for a call
If it wasn't for 'collect' and 'I.O.U.'
I'd be up to my neck in 'Overdue'

Me and my baby rollin' hand in hand
Drivin' to the Poorhouse just as fast as I can.


Diggin' through the bottles and magazines
Hope I got some money for some gasoline
Government agents nippin at my heels.
I'm a limo-length ahead of a jailhouse meal.

Me and my baby rollin' hand in hand
Drivin' to the Poo house just as fast as I can.


Feelin' like a sailor in a submarine
Feedin' quarters to the car-wash keepin' her clean.
Dropped my last dime thru the cracks in the floor
Hope the promotor don't take the back door.

Slingin my name like it was mud

Prospected for gold
In the wilds of Alaska
In the Yukon cold

My great Grandfather
Fought the Civil War
On the side of the South
In the Infantry Corps

My own Grandfather
Was a hell of a man
He rode Rock Island Railroad
In the blowing sand

All this makes me wonder
What they'll say about me
Oh he was just some fool rambler
Dyin to be free

O-o-oh, I need one good woman to pull me through
O-o-oh, I got one good woman just like you

My great great Grandmother
Wore a calico gown
She had a double-barreled shotgun
That she never set down

My great Grandmother
Was a Cherokee bride
You could find her every evening
Down by the riverside

My own Grandmother
Had a heart of gold
She had eyes like an Angel
And an ocean for a Soul

Joe Ely,"You're afraid to lose your cover
Afraid to bare your soul
Like an Alfred Hitchcock lover
Who slowly goes out of control

Your love is like the city
Only shines at night
Your love has no pity
Baby baby that's all right

Your vanity is your castle
You're like a neon sign
And the poor lost souls in your shadows
You forget, they are friends of mine.

Your love is like the city
Only shines at night
Your love has no pity
Baby baby that's all right

Little Johnny Vain lost his head
While you broke a young girls heart.
And Cecil D. Demille once gave to you
The 'Cast of Millions' part.

Your love is like the city
Only shines at night
Your love has no pity
Baby baby that's all right

Swept beneath the bed?

Joe Ely,"Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he cocked his hat
And he wore his gun all wrong
We had the same girlfriend
And he never forgot it
She had a cute little Chihuahua
Until one day he up and shot it
He rode the hard country down the New Mexico line
He had a silver pocketwatch that he never did wind
He crippled the piano player
For playin' his favorite song
No, Me and Billy the Kid never got along

Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he parted his hair
And he wore his gun all wrong
He was bad to the bone
All hopped up on speed
I would've left him alone
If it wasn't for that Senorita
He gave her silver and he paid her hotel bill
But it was me she loved and she said she always will
I'd always go and see her
When Billy was gone
Yeah, Me and Billy the Kid never got along

Me and Billy the Kid never got along
I didn't like the way he tied his shoes
And he wore his gun all wrong
One day I said to Billy
I've got this foolproof scheme
We'll rob Wells Fargo
It's bustin at the seams
I admit that I framed him but I don't feel bad
Cause the way I was livin' was drivin' me mad
Billy reached for his gun
But his gun was on wrong
Yeah, Me and Billy the Kid never got along

Me and Billy the Kid never got along
But I did like the way he swayed in the wind
While I played him his favorite song
Now my baby sings harmony with me
To La Cucaracha
She winds her silver pocket watch
And pets her new Chihuahua
I moved in to the Hotel and got a room with a shower
We lay and listen to that watch tick hour after hour
Outside I hear the wind
Blowin' o so strong

Joe Ely,"Here I am drinkin'. I am caught thinkin'
I wasn't always lonely like this.

It must be the liquor that makes me remember
The ones that I swore I'd forget.

But I was unkind. I left them behind
And now I can just reminisce.

Where is my love on a night like tonight?
Does she still see the same stars as I?
Where is my love on a night like tonight?
Does she still see the same stars as I?

I left pretty quick. I give justice the slip
I gave up the ones that I love.

I was strung out on need. I had to leave
But I left myself with no choice.

Now my romance is gone. I'm exiled alone.
I'm holed up somewhere near love.

Where is my love on a night like tonight?
Does she still see the same stars as I?
Where is my love on a night like tonight?
Does she still see the same stars as I?


Don't ask my advuce on the secrets of life.
Just buy me another round.

I got no more answers. I took too many chances.
The path that I chose was unwise.

That's why I'm lonely. I'm broke and I'm only.
Some wanderer wondering why.

I wonder if she sees them in me and if we gone too far

Old Hank made it here, we’re all sure that you will

Speeding my young life away
Singing my song, none of them wanna hear us
And I don't think Hank could've done 'em this way

When the moon was full
He had no money in his pocket 
Just a locket of his sister framed in Gold
He headed for el Sueco 
Stole a rooster named Gallo Del Cielo
Then he crossed the Rio Grande
With that roosted nestled deep within his arm

Gallo Del Cielo was a warrior born in heaven
So the legends say
His wings they had been broken 
He had one eye rollin crazy in his head
He'd fought a hundred fights
And the legends say that one night near El Sueco 
He fought Cielo seven times 
Seven times he left brave roosters dead

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in San Antonio
I have 27 dollars 
And the good luck of your picture framed in gold
Tonight I'll put it all 
On the fighting spurs of Gallo Del Cielo
Then I'll return to buy the land 
Pancho Villa stole from father long ago

Outside of San Diego 
In the Onion fields of Paco Monte Verde
The Pride of San Diego 
Lay sleeping on a fancy bed of silk
And they laughed when Saragosa
Pulled the one-eyed Del Cielo from beneath his coat
But they cried when Saragosa  
Walked away with a thousand dollar bill

Now the moon has gone to hiding
And the lantern light spills shadows on the fighting sand
A wicked black named Zorro faces Del Cielo in the sand
And Carlos Saragosa fears the tiny crack 
That runs across his roosters beak
And he fears that he has lost 
The 50,000 dollars riding on the fight

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in Santa Clara
The money's on the table 
I'm holding now your good luck framed in gold

Is riding on the spurs of Del Cielo
Then I'll return to buy the land 
Villa stole from father long ago

The signal it was given
And the roosters rose together far above the sand
Gallo Del Cielo sunk a gaff into Zorro's shiny breast
They were separated quickly
But they rose and fought each other time and time again
And the legends all agreed
That Gallo Del Cielo fought the best

But then the screams of Saragosa
Filled the night outside the town of Santa Clara
As the beak of Del Cielo 
Lay broken like a shell within his hand
And they say that Saragosa 
Screamed a curse upon the bones of Pancho Villa
As Zorro rose up one more time
And drove Del Cielo in the sand

Hola my Teresa 
I'm thinkin of you now in San Francisco
I have no money in my pocket 
And no longer have your good luck framed in gold
I buried it last evening 
With the bones of my beloved Del Cielo
I will not return to buy the land
That Villa stole long ago

Do the rivers still run muddy
Outside of my beloved Casas Grandes
Does the scar upon my brother's face
Turn red when he hears mention of my name
And do the people of El Sueco
Still curse the theft of Gallo Del Cielo
Tell my family not to worry 
I will not return to cause them shame",Gallo del Cielo,1995

I ain't sung my song
But light the road and kiss me on my way
About leavin' I ain't strong

I rolled down under a fat sun
Just knowin' you're the one
The miles were taken from me for a while
But the one consolin' thought

Was the reasurance of your partin' smile

I saw it in you

I'll see you next summer when the peach trees are ripe
I'll follow my dreams where ever they take me
Now I'm headed home, I saw the light

The sun, the wind
The trees that bend
I saw it in you
I saw it in you

Sometimes, I follow the song in my heart

She calls me to dance
My back's about broken
From choppin' the plants
My soul is so thirsty
I can't sleep at night
She walks in my dreams

To toil and to strife
My father before me

He took nothing for granted
He said son never bend

Some men could give you
Ranches and Rivers
With fences of Barbed Wire
To keep out the cold
But me, I got nothin'
No Titles to nothin'
Just a Love and a Fire
More Precious than gold

Your daddy works me in the ground
He knows something's goin' down
Will you pack your things and ride with me

Tomorrow at sunrise

In the town where the brothers fought
Across the river from the moorish mosque
That the spanish christians bought
Her hair was dressed by vesps
Woven in the leather wind
She grew up int the country
You could see it in her innocent grin

Run preciosa, run for love
The olive trees need rain
Memories of your gypsy past
Still ride on the midnight train
Your lover's heart was way too wild
You saw it in his face
You walk the graveyard with his child
In a veil of spanish lace

The son of tony camborio
Drove a souped up red renault
With a muffler rusted as the red wrought iron
Around his father's burial vault
The civil guards raise their sleepy heads
When she spins to watch the car change lanes
Tho so many years have passed
Not that much has changed

Run preciosa, run for love

Memories of your gypsy past
Still ride on the midnight train

In shadows of lavender-grey

From the church where the white doves lay
The flashing lights of the civil guard
Around a red renault they flash
Not that much has really changed
Tho so much time has passed",Run Preciosa,1995
Joe Ely,"Saint Valentine drove a red Continental
With a headlight out and a dent in the side
He swore it wasn't his, it was only a rental
But he drove it every single night

Saint Valentine wore shades and a cowboy hat
He looked straight outta Lonesome Dove
You never saw his eyes but you knew down deep inside
He was longin' for a long lost love

The original lover had a broken heart
To the ground his blood did flow
And for every drop that touch the earth
A red, red rose did grow

Saint Valentine ate pizza every Monday night
And chased it with Johnny Walker Black
The waitresses would stare but he just didn't care
He just wanted his lover back

Saint Valentine wore a T-shirt of the Virgin Madonna
With the sleeves cut out and a tear through the heart
He wore it like a shield to protect his pride and honor
He was tired of livin' so far apart

The original lover had a broken heart
To the ground his blood did flow
And for every drop that touch the earth
A red, red rose did grow

Saint Valentine would circle the shoppin' center mall
With his radio wailin' the blues
He'd park outside the door of the video store

And the Ranchero Radio plays
You won't find me around in the lights of the town
I'll be out where the day meets the shade

I only came for a holiday to sit in the Mexican wind
I only came for the whiskey, but suddenly she walked in
She wore a dress made of lace
And the light on her face
I felt the room start to shake
It shook a black Spanish love seat behind the bamboo shade

I only came for the sun, but I wound up with the moon and the stars
When her eyes met mine, the room filled with Spanish guitars
The kerosene in my blood
Came on like a flood

Put my hand on her heart
While the bows of the palm trees swayed

There's a pain in my back and not a bit of grip in my hands
A flash of steel in the night

They said to the waitress, ""Honey, you're lookin' fine""
""And Mama, won'cha bring us tamales?""

Her new tattoo did show
It was Napoleon with a big black eye
She was lettin' every body know

""Na'cho mama!""
""I'm na'cho mama, na'cho girl, I didn't bring you into this world!

Joe Ely,"Sherry was a waitress at the only joint in town
She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around
On main street after midnight, a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hanging from her lips, a beer between her legs
She rides down to the river, and meets with all her friends
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny was a loner, older than the rest
He was goin' in the navy, but couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town, he sold a little pot
The law caught wind of sonny and one day he got caught
But he was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

Sonny's playin' eight-ball in the joint where sherry works
When some drunken out-of-towner put his hand up sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue, laid the drunk out on the floor
Stuffed a dollar in her tip jar, walked out the door
She's running right behind him, reaching for his hand
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They jumped into his pickup, sonny jammed it down in gear
Sonny looked at sherry, said ""let's get on out of here
The stars were high above them, the moon was in the east
The sun was setting on them when they reached miami beach
They got a hotel by the water, a quart of bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They soon ran out of money, but sonny knew a man
Who knew some cuban refugees, who dealt in contraband
Sonny met the cubans in a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The card were on the table when the law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

The cubans grabbed the goodies, sonny grabbed the jack
Broke the bathroom window and climbed on out the back
Sherry drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled sonny and was reading him his rights
She stepped out in the alley with a single shot 410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

They left the lawman lying, they made their getaway
Got back to the motel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money, he blew a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this
She watched him as his taillights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

It's main street after midnight, just like it was before
Twenty-one months later, at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper and a cold six-pack of beer
The headlines say that sonny is going to the chair
She pulls back onto main street in her new mercedes benz

Where the willows hang down 
And the wild birds all warble
With a low moaning sound 
Down in the hollow 
Where the waters run cold
It was there I first listened 
To the lies that you told 

Now I lay on my bed
And I see your sweet face
The past I remeber
Time cannot erase
The letter you wrote me
It was written in shame
And I know that your conscience
Still echoes my name 

The nights are so long 
And sorrow runs deep
And nothing is worse
Than a night with out sleep
I'll walk out alone 
And look at the sky
Too empty to sing 
Too lonesome to cry 

If the ladies were blackbirds 
And the ladies were thrushes
I'd lie there for hours
In the chilly, cold marshes
If the ladies were squirrels

And it's on that lonesome railroad track

But it sure can't take my soul

Beatin' out a beautiful tune

Shinin' by the light of the moon
If you ever felt the locomotive shake the ground

Down the road to destiny
Can you hear that eagle call?
I got to find ol' Joe before he loses it all

Where there was little to take and even less to save
Where they buried their heroes in unmarked graves

Then you throw it all away to chase some crazy star

Joe Ely,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head
That didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't
Bad so I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled through my closet
For my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
And I shaved my face
And combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs
To meet the day

I'd smoked my brain the night before
With cigarettes and songs
That I've been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Cussin' at a can that he was kickin

Then I crossed the empty street and
Caught the sunday smell
Of someone fryin chicken
And it took me back to something
That I'd lost somehow
Somewhere along the way

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy
With a laughing little girl
He was swingin
And I stopped beside the Sunday school
And listened to the song
That they were singing

Then I headed back for home
And somewhere far away
A lonely bell was ringing
And it echoed thru the canyon like
The disappearing dreams of yesterday

On the sunday morning sidewalk
Wishing lord that I was stoned
Cause therels something in a sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
On the sleeping city sidewalk

The first sight he remembered was the Statue of Liberty's back
He lost his mama on the Brooklyn street when he was just thirteen
He made his way out west, he'd seen some pictures in a magazine

He worked a while as a roughneck in the Floydada Black Oil fields
And the Fat Oilmen of Texas would watch him a-tap his heels
As the oil poured in and the cotton grew and the Cadillacs fell like rain

The sun was comin' up and the birds was singin' sweet
When a car come around the corner, long and lean and brown
Pulls up to the curb beside me and rolls their window down
A man throws me a dollar and I asked him what's that for
A pack of Luckies and a Paper over at the corner store
I peer into the window there's a man and a woman inside
Holy Jumpin' Bolts of Lightnin' it's Miss Bonnie and Mr. Clyde

I made a joke about Lucky Strikes that I never should've used
Their patience was proportional to the shortness of their fuse
Bonnie's pretty little trigger finger was twitchin' by her side
And Clyde was cleanin' his fingernails with a foot long Bowie Knife
I brung 'em back the Cigarettes and the Dallas Mornin' Sun
I told 'em they made the papers front page and column one
Ah, we don't need no smart-assed kid actin' as our guide
Now just run along like you never seen, Miss Bonnie and Mr. Clyde

Excuse me sir I says to him, but I thought you was a business guy
I might have a little proposition that just might catch your eye
The biggest haul of Fort Knox Gold they're a'haulin back tonight
And loadin' it up in an Armored Car at the crack of the mornin' light
Bonnie grabbed me by the belt loop and pulled me in the car
And Clyde held a saw'd-off to my head and lit me a big cigar
If you're on the level then we might just be partners on the side
But don't even think about double crossin' Miss Bonnie and Mr. Clyde

Within a week I'd been transformed from a beggar to a wanted man
The dreams I'd had of a glamorous life were now, oh so close at hand
Bonnie kept makin' eyes at me, it was hard to look away
She looked like an innocent country girl who had somehow gone astray
Clyde once imagined he was Robin Hood but now his greed was startin' to show
Instead of spreading the wealth around he was Wallerin' in the Dough
And when he started slappin' Bonnie around something went off in me inside, I said
If you keep slappin' Bonnie around, I'm gonna have your hide, Clyde

Clyde would've shot me then and there if he wasn't so sluggin' drunk
'Bout the time he raised his shootin' iron he passed out on his trunk
Me and Bonnie made our break, in Clyde's Caddilac De Ville
Bonnie was already on my lap as we flew thru Louisville
We got married in Niagra Falls, I got a job as a paper man
Within a week the headlines came, showed Clyde on an old divan
Shot full of holes, the both of them, which the paper then Identified
As the love who led him to his grave, Miss Bonnie and Mr. Clyde

We just couldn't believe we got away with a scheme as big as that
We were buying drinks and tossin' scraps to all the dogs and cats
We rented us a barrel that night at the Whiskey Still
And decided to spend our Honeymoon floatin' down Niagra Hill
We made the maddest wettest bumpiest love fallin' down that waterfall
Like a crazy pair of desert doves who had never seen rain fall

But We never went back to hear the tale of Miss Bonnie and Mr. Clyde",Miss Bonnie and Mister Clyde,2007

I want to take you away, away from the crowd
And have you all to myself, 
Alone and apart out of a dream,

Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about

Down to New Orleans
Back to the city

That I earned along the way
To wake up beside you

Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gif when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper, speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped, my raps are toxic

But you get done, you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes

But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick, your lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said

Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(Ooh he got an afro) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra

A starry summer sky,
A laughing you and I, alone.
It all comes back to me now, 
A sea of midnight blue,
Your face uplifted to my own.

We called it a thrill of the moment, 
And blamed the moon up above,
We didn't know what the glow meant,
We never dreamed it might be love.

And now each lonely night I pray, 
That it will all come back to me someday.",It All Comes Back to Me Now,1996

It brings back the sound of music so tender
It brings back a night of tropical splendor
It brings back a memory ever green

I'm with you once more under the stars
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine

To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are, swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part

What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, please make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

Joe Firstman,"I been strangled by these songs 
But I ain't in the wrong 
And I ain't impartial no more
So as I try to die 
Sell the blood from my eyes
A good they will pay you for
I don't mind if you don't mind about me

Like sweet Savannah skies
I'm too young to die
My Carolina kin
I'll be home again

My sweet mama insists 
That my innocence has been levied 
And auctioned for gold
But she can't afford this clergy's accord 
Or at least that's what all her lawyers had told her",Savannah,2003
Joe Firstman,"You would invite me in on a whim
And I'd stay as long as you let me
I'd watch that smile that would stretch to your chin
When you said that you'd never forget me
It took that whole bottle for me to say
""Oh, I wish you would stay""
And I'll take all your worries away
While wondering how I'm gonna get you to quit smoking
But you stay and smile at my jokes
And my anecdotes
So I owe you now
But this road sign ain't forever

'Cause I'm saving all the love
That I'm supposed to give to Jesus
So that I can give it all to you
And the Lord's gonna be jealous
But he ain't never seen you let your hair down
And when we're dancing to the alter
The preacher won't believe us
Your mother fucking hates me
And the Lord will deceive us
But I'll still be giving it away
I'm gonna give it all to you

You come and watch me play the piano
And I'm supposed to watch your thoughts as you think
And I'm young and wrong
But your hair is long
And it's dark as the wine that we drink
Remind me of old East Bay Street
And of Friday night
Remind me you're taken
And that I am mistaken
But still to call you
When I turn 25

And when we're dancing to the alter
The preacher won't believe us
Your daddy's gonna shoot me
And the Lord will deceive us
But I'll still be giving it away
I'm gonna give it all to you",Saving All the Love,2003
Joe Firstman,"We were bearing down on you
A testament to all the hell I put you through
Now your wedding bells 
And bowery maids

The roses in your wedding braids
Your cheap invitation
There was a woman all in white
Just a chord in a song 

That I'd been meaning to finish
Stuffed beneath your presents 
And written in your minutes
I can't forget it

Only when you glow I know 
I'm lonely
I'm gonna break
I was your slave

I was your slave
When I see you lie awake 
In your secondhand grave 
I'll lie along the side of you 

And die along the side of you
I'm just like the others 
And I tend to bother you
It's me, it's me that you love 

Don't you get it? 
Just admit it
It's me, it's me that you love 
Don't you get it? 

Just admit it",Secondhand Grave,2003
Joe Firstman,"Well at this time of intervention 
You were high on the attention that I loaned you
As I just resort to reports of indiscretions when I owed you
The underground has never found you broken down 
And bloodshot like your heroines
You dress up like you're Marilyn 
And sell yourself to rich boys 
That you know

And you know that 
I cannot save you 
If you can't save yourself
I cannot save you
Save you from yourself

Just as she was learning how to smoke
She tends to focus on the way 
That she's perceived, indeed

Is the lioness obsessing when she bleeds?",Slave or Siren,2003
Joe Firstman,"July came to me like an angel 
And I warmed to her 
I took to her like a handout
And so I wait for her 
Like a check in the mail 
And I slept with her in a dream last night
Well I was lying like a salesman 
Down on that boulevard
She would barter for a tightrope 
Like a discount spool of yarn

I been messing up
You've been resting
I guess I should get some sleep sometime
I been reaching in my bag
Joking like a cocaine hag 
And you will always speak your mind

You were sleeping like a baby 
After painting your decisions on the wall
I was weighing all your wishes in my head
Instead you caught me out there wandering the halls
I was sicker than a cancer 
But you were pivotal in my recovery
Out the door you came
Knowing you would never stay
Knowing I could never ever leave

Joe Firstman,"""When did you stop caring?"" she said
As she slowly pulled the gun from my head
""And when did you become so removed?""
The curse of having nothing left to prove

As I fly away
I'll fly away

You said you'd never have my baby
So I went out and adopted a highway
""When did you become so deranged?""
And I thought all this time I was just ashamed

I'll fly away
I'll fly away

They got me on trial again
And all I did was kill a little time my friend
But I can save a seat for you
And I can hold a place in line
You should let your family know
You may be gone a while

We'll fly away

Joe Firstman,"I been goin' through life with my fists up
Keep a bottle around the house I tend to drink from
And a baseball bat beside my bed at night
If only I could let myself love someone

For a while there I wasn't breathing so well
Can you hear me? If you need me to sing louder I will
Feel like I've been asleep behind life's wheel
While my heart's been sinkin' to the bottom of the well

Been takin' a slow walk through the fast life
Gettin' nowhere 'til it's show time
So I said ""rah rah rah rah rah
I'm gonna give 'em hell tonight""

Busted my wrist in a fist fight last night
Should have punched more squarely, held my hand more tight
I convinced myself I wasn't wrong, but I knew I wasn't right
Sometimes you gotta step right outside of that bar room

I threw 100 punches, got this big black eye
I got banned from Indiana, felt like I was gonna die
So I screamed ""rah rah rah rah rah""
You should have seen the other guy

Woke up on a couch in a house I'd never been
Still had all my same clothes from last night, must have passed out in 'em
Smelled the tequila burnin', pourin' out from under my skin
Dreamed about all the trouble I'd been gettin' in
It was a fuckin' repeat

You know the same one about all my teeth fallin' out
So I scared myself awake to find them safely in my mouth
And I said, ""rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah""",Fight Song!,2006

I want to take you away, away from the crowd

Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, ""Quiet down""
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My attire sells, how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs
My sister the next stripper, my brother the next victim
My usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after

Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost

Won't let the pearly gates up in this

So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say it never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing
Left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like ""Flacko where your ass been?""
Heard you done with fashion, now yo ass is acting
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in Venice, Tommy and some mean Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture
Changed Hip-Hop on ya, smoking like a rasta was my pops culture
I be damned if I die sober
I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all

Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they're sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher, grab your lighter fluid
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap with fashion four way, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the ""love"" word

More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who needs friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, hashtag #Fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more

Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck

I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga bigger back

Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?

It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, mother fuck cops, what a blood clarts
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, bug shots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em switch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places, like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces, Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Mason Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason

I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking

And my generation fucked, and my society

It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the high in me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely

I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?
I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

And shout outs my pretty women in the spot tonight
Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Beamers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
Cause I be playing with these womens like they're sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher, grab your lighter fluid
Might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how he do it
Sit back and watch me do it

And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt, or is it too late?
I'm a man of my law, I gotta keep my weight up
But who will lean if I fall? But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap with fashion four way, yeah I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ay just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the ""love"" word

More power to you, more power to you my lovely one
What's up bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who needs friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out, hashtag #Fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male

Joe Fox,"Buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fear
One, just year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, nigga lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit, like the hard headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat?
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chtta chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga bigger back

I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?

It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, mother fuck cops, what a blood clarts
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, bug shots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em switch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip

I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?
I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young, am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up, did I fuck it up?
I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young, am I still too young?

Joe Fox,"Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong

My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places, like apartments, basements
Garbage vacant, lots, garages, spaces, Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Mason Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my eye and lung 'til later die at 71

I lay down now
This someone's journey in the streets who gotta keep a, peace, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs who bang and never stood a chance
Some boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement
And my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the high in me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me, it's gotta be
A whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I've given

Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face it all I need is right where I belong

I lay down now
This someone's journey in the streets who gotta keep a, peace, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray the Lord my soul to keep

Joe Gilman,"I once had a girl 
Or should I say she once had me 
She showed me her room 
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? 

She asked me to stay 
And she told me to sit anywhere 
So I looked around 
And I noticed there wasn't a chair 

I sat on a rug biding my time 
Drinking her wine 
We talked until two and then she said 
""It's time for bed"" 

She told me she worked 
In the morning and started to laugh 
I told her I didn't 
And crawled off to sleep in the bath 

And when I awoke I was alone

So I lit a fire

But I kept saying girl you're wrong, go home

For a pretty girl it's a heavy load
And even so who'll pay your fare

To give me the love she knew someday I'd need

Joe Glazer,"Now, if you want higher wages let me tell you what to do
You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you.
You got to build you a union, got to make it strong,
But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long.
You get shorter hours, better working conditions,
Vacations with pay. Take your kids to the seashore.

It ain't quite this simple, so I better explain
Just why you got to ride on the union train.
'Cause if you wait for the boss to raise your pay,
We'll all be a-waitin' 'til Judgment Day.
We'll all be buried, gone to heaven,
St. Peter'll be the straw boss then.

Now you know you're underpaid but the boss says you ain't;
He speeds up the work 'til you're 'bout to faint.
You may be down and out, but you ain't beaten,
You can pass out a leaflet and call a meetin'.
Talk it over, speak your mind,
Decide to do somethin' about it.

Course, the boss may persuade some poor damn fool
To go to your meetin' and act like a stool.
But you can always tell a stool, though, that's a fact,
He's got a yaller streak a-runnin' down his back.
He doesn't have to stool, he'll always get along
On what he takes out of blind men's cups.

You got a union now, and you're sittin' pretty,
Put some of the boys on the steering committee.
The boss won't listen when one guy squawks,
But he's got to listen when the union talks.
He'd better, be mighty lonely
Everybody decide to walk out on him.

Suppose they're working you so hard it's just outrageous
And they're paying you all starvation wages.
You go to the boss and the boss would yell,
""Before I raise your pay I'd see you all in hell.""
Well, he's puffing a big seegar, feeling mighty slick
'Cause he thinks he's got your union licked.
Well, he looks out the window and what does he see
But a thousand pickets, and they all agree:
He's a bastard, unfair, slavedriver,
Bet he beats his wife!

Now, boys, you've come to the hardest time.
The boss will try to bust your picket line.
He'll call out the police, the National Guard,
They'll tell you it's a crime to have a union card.
They'll raid your meetin', they'll hit you on the head,
They'll call every one of you a goddam red,
Unpatriotic, Japanese spies, sabotaging national defense!

But out at Ford, here's what they found,
And out at Vultee, here's what they found,
And out at Allis-Chalmers, here's what they found,
And down at Bethlehem, here's what they found:
That if you don't let red-baiting break you up,
And if you don't let stoolpigeons break you up,
And if you don't let vigilantes break you up,
And if you don't let race hatred break you up,
You'll win. What I mean, take it easy, but take it!",Talking Union,1996

What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
Don't care to go
I'm home about eight
Just me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
I'm savin' my love for you",Ain't Misbehavin',1987
Joe Grauso,"Don't even go to a movie show
If you're not by my side,
I stay home by my radio,
But I'm satisfied!
All my flirtin' days are gone,
On the level from now on!

Don't go for any excitement now,
Books are my best company.
All my opinions have changed somehow,
Old-fashioned as can be!
When you really learn to care,
There's a thrill in solitaire!

Keepin' ou of mischief now,
Really am in love, and how!
I'm through playing with fire,
It's you whom I desire!

All the world can plainly see
You're the only one for me!
I've told them in advance
They can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin' out of mischief now!

All the world can plainly see
That you're the only one for me!
Say I've told them, told them in advance
That they can't break up our romance!
Living up to every vow,
I'm keepin', keepin' out of mischief now!",Keepin' Out of Mischief Now,1987
Joe Grauso,"I hate to see that evening sun go down
I hate to see that evening sun go down
Cause my baby, he's gone left this town

Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
If I'm feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my truck and make my give-a-way

St. Louis woman with her diamond ring
Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her
That man I love would have gone nowhere, nowhere

I got the St. Louis blues, blues as I can be
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me

I love my baby like a school boy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his mint 'n rye
I love my man till the day I die",St. Louis Blues,1987
Joe Grauso,"Cold empty bed, springs hard as lead
Pains in my head, feel like old Ned
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
No joys for me, no company
Even the mouse ran from my house
All my life through I've been so black and blue
 
I'm white inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
I'm so forlorn. Life's just a thorn
My heart is torn. Why was I born?
What did I do to be so black and blue?
 
I'm hurt inside, but that don't help my case
Cause I can't hide what is on my face
How will it end? Ain't got a friend
My only sin is in my skin
What did I do to be so black and blue?
Tell me, what did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do?  What did I do?
What did I do? Tell me, what did I do to be so black and blue?
What did I do to be so black and blue?",Black and Blue,1989
Joe Grauso,"Peg o'my heart
I love you, don't let us part
I love you, I always knew it would be you
Since I heard your lilting laughter
It's your Irish heart I'm after
Peg o'my heart
Your glances make my heart say ""How's chances?""
Come, be my own, come make your home in my heart
",Peg O' My Heart,1989
