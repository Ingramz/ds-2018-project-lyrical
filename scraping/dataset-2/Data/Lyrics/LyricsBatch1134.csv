Bill Trujillo,"Maybe I should have saved those left over dreams
Funny, but here's that rainy day
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that it might turn out this way

Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my lover near
It's funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here

Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here",Here's That Rainy Day,1999
Bill Trujillo,"I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain
 
I'm always chasing rainbows
Watching clouds drifting by
My schemes are just like all my dreams
Ending in the sky
Some fellows look and find the sunshine
I always look and find the rain
Some fellows make a winning sometimes
I never even make a gain
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows
",I'm Always Chasing Rainbows,1999
Bill Trujillo,"The night is like a lovely tune
Beware my foolish heart
How white the ever constant moon
Take care my foolish heart

There's a line between love and fascination
That's hard to see, how many names such as this
For they both have the very same sensation
When you're locked in the magic of a kiss

Her lips are much too close to mine
Beware my foolish heart
But should our eager lips combine
Then let the fire start

For this time it isn't fascination
Or a dream that will fade and fall apart
It's love, this time it's love
My foolish heart",My Foolish Heart,1999
Bill Turek,"When the mellow moon begins to beam
Every night I dream a little dream
And of course Prince Charming is the theme
The he for me
Although I realize as well as you
It is seldom that a dream comes true
To me it's clear
That he'll appear

Some day he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay

He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would, would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for the man I love",The Man I Love (G. & I. Gershwin) 1924,2004
Bill Turek,"Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, holding your hand

Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

You can say that you're leading me on
But it's just what I want you to do
Don't you realize how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you

On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I get misty, and too much in love

I'm too misty, and too much in love",Misty (Garner & Burke) 1954,2004
Bill Turner,"I can't wait forever
Even though you want me to
I can't wait forever
To know if you'll be true
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me wait too long

Can't you see I've waited too long to love you
To hold you in my arms
Time won't let me
Time won't let me
Time won't let me aw
Oh

Bill Van Riper,"I remember holdin' on to you
All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico
One place I may never go in my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high
But I can't remember if we said goodbye

I only miss you here every now and then
Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean
Most Novembers I break down and cry
But I can't remember if we said goodbye",Goodbye,2002

Bill Vitt,"Well they tell me of a pie up in the sky 
Waiting for me when I die 
But between the day you're born and when you die 
They never seem to hear even your cry 

[Chorus]
So as sure as the sun will shine 
I'm gonna get my share now of what's mine 
And then the harder they come 
The harder they'll fall, one and all 
Ooh the harder they come 
The harder they'll fall, one and all 

Well the oppressors are trying to keep me down 
Trying to drive me underground 
And they think that they have got the battle won 
I say forgive them Lord
They know not what they've done 

[Chorus]

Ooh yeah oh yeah woah yeah ooooh 

And I keep on fighting for the things I want 
Though I know that when you're dead you can't 
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave 
Than living as a puppet or a slave

Yeah, the harder they come,
The harder they'll fall one and all",The Harder They Come,1973
Bill Vitt,"You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lotta nerve
To say you gotta helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that's winning

You say I let you down
You know it's not like that
If you're so hurt
Why then don't you show it

You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with

Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you?"" ""Good luck""
But you don't mean it

When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them

And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem

I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you",Positively 4th Street,1973

Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well, that long black train, got my baby and gone

Train, train, comin' round the bend
Well, it took my baby, but it never will again
No, not again

Bill Walker's Orchestra,"(Joy to the world the Lord is come) 
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant woman 
He grew up in another small village 
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter 

Then for three years he was a traveling minister 
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born 
And where he did go he usually walked 
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home 

Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big city 
Yes here was a man 
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness 
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world 

Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world 
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him 
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him 
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies 

Then he went through the mockery of a trial 
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves 
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled 
For the only piece of property that he had in this world 

And that was his robe his purple robe 
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross 
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends 
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone 

And today he's a centerpiece of the human race 
Our leader in the column to human destiny 
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever marched 
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas 

All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever reigned 
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth 
So powerfully as that one solitary life 
Here was a man (joy to the world the Lord is come)",Here Was a Man (Dialogue) [Live],2012
Bill Walker's Orchestra,"I'm gonna try to be that way
Once upon a time there lived a man
Many years ago in a foreign land
Knew how to live right, tried to be a light
Gave everybody a helping hand

I'm gonna try to be that way
I'm gonna try to be that way
Do the kind of things a man oughta do
Say the kind of things a man oughta say
I'm gonna try to be that way

He never done anybody wrong
He tried to help everybody 'long
He brought a better land to make a better man
Out of the rich or the poor
Or the weak or the strong

And he preached love and brotherhood
He went around doin' good, doin' good
Everywhere he went
They knew that he was sent
And the people started actin' like they should
",I'm Gonna Try To Be That Way [Live],2012
Bill Walker's Orchestra,"These hands aren't the hands of a gentleman these hands are calloused and old 
These hands raised a family these hands built a home 
Now these hands raised to praise the Lord 

These hands won the heart of my loved one and with hers they were never alone 
If these hands filled their task then what more could you ask 
For these fingers have worked to the bone 

Now don't try to judge me by what you'd like me be 
For my life hasn't been a success 
Some people have power but still they grieve 
While these hands brought me happiness 

Now I'm tired and I'm old and I haven't much gold 
Maybe things ain't been all that I planned 
Lord above hear my plea when it's time to judge me 
Take a look at these hard working hands take a look at these hard working hands",These Hands [Live],2012
Bill Ware,"Night and stars above that shine so bright 
The myst'ry of their fading light 
That shines upon our caravan 
 
Sleep upon my shoulder as we creep 
Across the sand so I may keep 
The mem'ry of our caravan 
 
This is so exciting 
You are so inviting 
Resting in my arms 
As I thrill to the magic charms 
Of you beside me here beneath the blue 
My dream of love is coming true 
Within our desert caravan",Caravan,2001
Bill Ware,"Ooh

Lord, dear Lord above, God almighty,
God of love, please look down and see my people through.

I believe that God put sun and moon up in the sky.
I don't mind the gray skies

A brighter light on high.

Do unto others as you would have them do to you.

And have a brighter by and by.

Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue

From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling,
It's you, it's you must go and I must bide.

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow,
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow,
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow,
Oh, Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so!

But when ye come, and all the flowers are dying,
If I am dead, as dead I well may be,
You'll come and find the place where I am lying,
And kneel and say an Ave there for me.
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me,
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be,
For you will bend and tell me that you love me,
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me!",Danny Boy,2006

I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

about a valley but he lives in an alley 
filled with papers thrown away -- Lord tell me

Tell him I aint gonna live-I aint gonna live to get much older.

Whoa, Lord. Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen - bless his heart-
I aint never done nothing to, he done shot me in my shoulder.

Make it a good day, just the same

Let us love one another, let us love

No special greeting, special greeting for the day

No happy easter, no merry christmas, only how are you today

Make it a good day, anyway

Let us help one another, help your neighbor, he's your brother

Let us love, let us love, hey now, let us love, love one another

Help your neighbor, he's your brother, let us love, now let us love

That he'd been, an old man told me what he'd found
Said it don't make no difference whether you're
Out or whether you're in, though the world keeps
Goin' round and round.  Goin' round and round.

Said he looked at the places talked of the faces that he'd seen
Then he turned the pictures upside down.
Said it don't make no difference how many places you've been
Said the world keeps goin' round and round.
Goin' round and round

Then he put up the pictures shook his head, and with a grin,
He talked about his ups and downs
Said it don't make no difference how many fixes you've been in
No, the world keeps goin' round and round
Goin' round and round.

Betty Joe Johnson, don't you pull no Daisy Mae on me
Daisy Mae she did me dirty, so I had to leave her for 
Anna Lee.  Anna Lee she had big street feet.  
She spent her nights out on the row

So I started seeing Sally Jackson, I had to let Anna Lee go
Sally Jackson was a player
Had another man along with me
So I just took me one step backwards
Checked up on old Anna Lee
Anna Lee still had them street feet
Liked to dance all night and sleep all day
So I just took one more step backwards, 
checked up on old Daisy Mae
Daisy Mae was still doin' dirty, 
so I'll tell you what I had to do
Had to go just one step further Betty Joe Johnson 
Yeah, and that's how I know you

Looked at the places talked of the faces in life he'd seen
Then he turned the pictures upside down
Said it don't make no difference how many places that you've been

I can remember sometimes
I could just stand off all by myself

And throw 'em down on the ground for ties
Yeah, and I'd make up songs, I'd sing

To talk to me about my mind

To things that I might say or do
I'm really not that complicated
Your good doctor friend, he oughta talk to you

Things that he never should forget
And why does he spend his evenings
Smoking them funny cigarettes?

I have a friend that knows your best friend

He said he saw y'all at a party
Sniffing white powder up your nose

By people standing on their own two feet

Or you can stand up where you're at

Monkey's looking dead at you

Just to get an ounce of truth from you

That it's my loving you

That it's your loving me
That makes my life a paradise

When lovers meet
And light a spark
Their eyes give the game away
Somehow it's a feeling you can never hide
No matter how hard you try

When lovers speak
It's from the heart
And all of the things they say
Are part of the magic and the mystery
You hear in a gentle sigh

The fun and games
The things that I can't forget

It's free for the simple love is there for you
To bring all the feelings out

You might try it
But you'll never change things

No one comes…[?]

Let's celebrate what life's about
Let's sing out the melody
The words and the music to our song of love
Are sweeter than anything
'Cause if we wait
We might lose out
On things that were meant to be
With all of the secrets that the heart can hold
Left dangling on a string

Bill Withers,"When I'm kissing my love, 
I can hear a thump thumping in my head 
When I'm kissing my love 
I close my eyes and see a pretty city with a million flower beds 

I can hear the angels sing, 
Songs that only angels sing 
And I can feel my heart just a-thumping and a-skipping 
When I'm kissing my love 

When I'm kissing my love, 
I feel the blood pump-pumping in my veins 
When I'm kissing my love 
She's such a tender send with a sweet young frame. 

She's so good at what she does, 
All she wants to do is kiss and hug, 
She's got me in love 
And I can feel my heart just a-thumping and a skipping 
When I'm kissing my love

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Wake me up, I must be dreamin' that

What am I supposed to do, congratulate you?
Whatever...
How you in love wit her, when every thug hit her
Just met her off a lap dance now you babysit her
And get her everything she need
From pills to weed
Bite into the forbidden fruit like Adam and Eve
I can't believe you all in, when the snake bitch crawlin'
Watch her slither, body glitter
I know you did her, you was wit' her when she shed her skin
She gave you head again to make sure the venom sunk in
Poison, she fucked all your boys and brought the sex toys in
Vibrators, she said she was a dick hater
She didn't want you to fuck her, just masturbate her
Now you in love wit' the hoe

You in love wit' that hoe [11x]

Now this is some sick shit said
I'm smackin' bitches wit my dick head
And yellin' 'all tricks dead'
And if you paid for the pussy ain't nothin' wrong
To her you just anotha nigga pealin' off ya Sean Jones
This hoe love pullin' down jabodes
Behind closed doors, niggaz ready to bust those
But some niggaz be like 'I love you'
We like 'Fuck you dyke, suck a pussy too'
The bitch is raw, I mean yo bitch is raw
Sucked the milkshake straight out the straw
Flippin' up outta her drawers like Dominique Dawes
Now you runnin' round tellin' niggaz she all yours

[Chorus:]

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
How you love that hoe when you know what she is
Got five baby daddies and eight different kids
Her last man did a bid for some shit that stank bitch did
Now she pregnant wit' your kid so you wish you slid
Last week you said you loved her and you can't get ridda her
This week she gave you crabs and gave your ass Cymatia
Fuck you Ms. Jackson, I still don't pity ya
Bitches lie and suck dick after dick
And still some niggaz can't cope wit' it
And be like...
'I love you, I need you'
Fuck that!

Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Every tear will be a memory
So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again

Hello means the birth of a smile
And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain

I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties.
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's.

So my dear I swore,
""Never, never more!""
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out.
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! 
How I lost out!

I could cry salty tears,
Where have I been all these years?
Little wow, tell me now,
How long has this been going on?

There were chills up my spine,
And some thrills I can't define.
Listen, sweet, I repeat,
How long has this been going on?

Oh, I feel that I could melt,
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt,
Finding another world.

Kiss me once, then once more.

What a break!

Toting off more than their tires can stand
?Cause it's no money down, no payments till
Every square inch of the whole world's filled with

Stuff, stuff, stack it on, stack it on up
Stuff, never gonna ever get enough stuff
Oh it's treasure till it's mine, then it ain't worth a dime
It's stuff, oh, spreading like weeds
Dragging me under in an endless sea of stuff
Stuff there ain't no end
Got to get a bigger place, so I can move in
More stuff

Drag it in, pack it in
The man with the most
He just wins more stuff

Stuff, stuff, stack it on, stack it on up
Stuff, never gonna ever get enough stuff
Oh it's treasure till it's mine, then it ain't worth a dime
It's stuff, oh, spreading like weeds
Dragging me under in an endless sea of stuff
Stuff there ain't no end
Got to get a bigger place, so I can move in

Bill Xtillidiex Muir,"Go on if you want it.
An otherworld awaits you
Don't you give up on it.
You bite the hand that feeds you.

All alone cold fields you wander
Memories of it, cloud your sight
Fills your dreams, disturbs your slumber
Lost your way, a fallen knight

Hold now, aim is steady
An otherworld awaits you.
One thousand years, you ready?
The otherworld it takes you

Go into the sand and the dust in the sky
Go now, there's no better plan than to do or to die
Free me pray to the faith in the face of the light
Feed me fill me with sin now get ready to fight

You know you will
You know you will
You know you know you know you know that you will
You know you know you know you know that you will

Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight
Fight fight fight

Hope dies and you wander
The otherworld it makes you
Dreams they rip asunder
The otherworld it hates you
Free now ride up on it
Up to the heights it takes you
Go on if you want it.
An otherworld awaits you",Otherworld,2002
Bill Yates ,"Once in my youth, I stood on this mountain 
And planted some pines in the sand 
Every day I looked their way 
But just couldn't understand 

Why they never grew like I thought they should do 
I just couldn't understand why 
Now, I've rambled around this wide world through 
And today I just happened by 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I bet you wouldn't know me now

I'll never forget the morning I left 
The hum of the bees in the hay 
The farther I walk, the harder they talk 
How silent it seems here today 

There's an old rail fence that we built, inch by inch 
Surrounding the old family graves 
And there's one gravestone standing all alone 
There waiting to join me in the shade 

Tall pines, tall pines 
Reaching up for the clouds 
Tall pines, tall pines 
I've come home to sleep beneath your boughs",Tall Pines,1991
Billboard Top 10 Karaoke: 1970's,"Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
And I's feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
It rode us all the way to New Orleans

I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I wass holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin' hon' if it ain't free, no no
And, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know, feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee

From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
There Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold

One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But, I'd trade all of my tomorrows, for a single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', that's all that Bobby left me, yeah
But, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
Hey, feelin' good was good enough for me, mm-hmm
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGhee

Put away your impulsive dreams
Our story's only just started
Do you get what I mean
Because we
Don't want to run before we walk
There's time to see us running
We should think before we talk
'cause I feel it coming
If rules were meant to break
And love can fade away
Then we don't need to make promises
I've been there once before
I gotta know for sure
The hardest things to keep are promises
Some things are best left unspoken
Until the time is right
Some hearts are easily broken
Tempting fate with sweet lies
I don't want to run before we walk

Could it be for me

Someone's back for more

You give pride while I take the fall,
You never thought to warn me did you,
Just sit back and watch it all,
You straight jacket my dreams,
And chainsaw my intentions,
I hate to shatter your illusions,

Got you believing love won't last

Don't blame us all for a fool's mistake

Things they advise, I should let go
They're calling you ice, then I see you glow
You're making me crazy, what can I say
I'd do anything to take the pain away

When you gonna realize that you're lonely
I can see it in your eyes, you don't have to be

Lovers in the dark, counting every star
Finally when your trust is in me
I'll give you my love, real, slow and tender

When the morning comes you'll know what I feel, so real
Dream of your smile, night after night
The one that you hide from the daylight

Stop all those tears, doubt in your mind
Leave all your fears way behind

And I'm alone again

Have we got anything left to save

I can't keep acting so brave

There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
To make us realize our night is over

When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes
Against the sun that rises over the land

I watch you walk away
Somehow if have to let you go
Now it's over

If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget

Though there might have been a way
I have to force myself to say
It's over

So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all

I send my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me

Don't come back, it won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me too

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom
Again?

Retrace my lips
Erase your touch
It's all too much for me
Blow away
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?

Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Would roses bloom?
Could roses bloom?

Laying us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife

Never had no kissin'
Oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me
But no one to love me
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

I've heard it said
That the thrill of romance
Can be like a heavenly dream
I go to bed with a prayer
That you'll make love to me
Strange as it seems

Someday we'll meet
And you'll dry all my tears
Then whisper sweet
Little things in my ear
Hugging and a-kissing

All at once I knew
Darlin' love was near
I thrill to my finger tips

But only my heart obeyed
A flame grew from just a spark

Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely

When the wind through the window
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirsting
Till you feel like bursting
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes
Till somebody's found you
And put their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die

But when the Lord up above you
Send's someone to love you

Just like a leaf that has blown away
Gone with the wind
My romance has flown away

yesterday's kisses are still on my lips
I had a lifetime of heaven at my fingertips

now all is gone

Gone with the wind
The gladness that thrilled my heart

just like a flame love burned brightly
Then became an empty smoke dream
That has gone with the wind

And I drive a little too fast
And I'm reckless it's true
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair

So I talk a little too much
And I laugh a little too much
And my voice is too loud
When I'm out in a crowd
So that people are apt to stare

Do they know, do they care
That it's only
That I'm lonely
And low as can be
And the smile on my face
Isn't really a smile at all

So I smoke a little too much
And I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request
Are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare

So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking his place
But what else can you do
At the end of a love affair

Do they know, do they care
That it's only
That I'm lonely
And low as can be
And the smile on my face
Isn't really a smile at all

So I smoke a little too much
And I drink a little too much
And the tunes I request
Are not always the best
But the ones where the trumpets blare

So I go at a maddening pace
And I pretend that it's taking his place
But what else can you do

Billie Holiday,"You don't know what love is
Until you've learned the meaning of the blues
Until you've loved a love you've had to lose
You don't know what love is

You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is

Do you know how lost heart feels
At the thought of reminiscing
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing

You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes
You don't know what love is

Billie Holiday,"Smooth road, clear day
But why am I the only one
Travelin' this way
How strange the road you love
Should be so easy
Can there be a detour ahead

Wake up, slow down
Before you crash and break your heart
Gullible clown

You fool, you're headin'
In the wrong direction
Can't you see the detour ahead

The further you travel
The harder to unravel
The way he spins around you
Turn back while there is time
Can't you see the danger sign
Soft shoulders surround you

Smooth road, clear night
Oh lucky me, that suddenly
I saw the light
I'm turning back away
From all this trouble

My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless

Of ever returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you

Gloomy is Sunday
With shadows I spend it all
My heart and I
Have decided to end it all

Soon there'll be candles
And prayers that are said I know
Let them not weep
Let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream
For in death I'm caressin' you
With the last breath of my soul
I'll be blessin' you

I wake and I find you asleep

Tell you what I will do
I'll put on my best gown

Starry eyed and dreamy
And nights are luscious and long
If you're kinda lonely
All by you're only
Then nothin' but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

When the wind through the window
Blows across your pillow
And tells you sleepin' is wrong
If love goes a thirsting
Till you feel like bursting
Then nothing but the blues are brewin'
The blues are brewin'

Suppose you want somebody
But you ain't got nobody
You only get a gleam in your eyes
Till somebody's found you
And put their lovin' arms around you
You got the feelin' you want to die

But when the Lord up above you
Send's someone to love you
The blues are something you loose
You're so busy doing
The things that you're doing
That love ain't got no time
For brewin' the blues

I get a kick though it's clear to me

I'm wondering why it's me you're wronging
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you body and soul

I can't believe it
It's hard to conceive it
That you'd throw away romance
Are you pretending
It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear

My life a hell you're making
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you body and soul

What lies before me

Mighty fine music
The murmur of a morning breeze up there
The rattle of the milkman on the stair

Sure that's music

The perking of the coffee right near by
That's my favorite melody

And anytime I think my world is wrong
I get me out of bed and sing this song",I Hear Music,1992
Billie Holiday,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tomtom
When the jungle shadows fall
Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock
as it stands against the wall
Like the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops
When the summer show'are is through
So a voice within me keeps repeating
You, you, you

Night and day you are the one
Only you beneath the moon and sun
Whether near me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you
Night and day
Day and night

Why is it so
That this longing for you follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room

I'll try to love
Now I still cling
To faded blossoms
Fresh from worn

Like the love affair I mourn

Another to me

Not your kind

Sunshine's around me

Stirring to sing

My hours are slumberless
Dearest the shadows
I live with are numberless

Of ever returning you
Would they be angry

Have decided to end it all

For in death I'm caressin' you
With the last breath of my soul
I'll be blessin' you

Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be

She'd be so much better off if I went away.

She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,

And touches with her hand the summer trees,
Perhaps you'll understand what memories I own.
There's a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down,

A winding country lane all russet brown,
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely.
That spring of ours that started so April-hearted,
Seemed made for just a boy and girl.

I never dreamed, did you, any fall would come in view
So early, early.
Darling if you care, please, let me know,
I'll meet you anywhere, I miss you so.
Let's never have to share another early autumn.",Early Autumn,1995

Billie Holiday,"The night is bitter,
The stars have lost their glitter,
The winds grow colder,
And suddenly you`re older
And all because of
The man that got away.

No more his eager call,
The writing`s on the wall,
The dreams you dreamed have all
Gone astray.
The man that won you
Has run off and undone you.
That great beginning
Has seen it`s final inning,
Don`t know what happened
It`s all a crazy game.

No more that all-time thrill
For you`ve been through the mill,
And never a new love will
Be the same.

Good riddance, good-bye.
Every trick of his you`re on to -
But fools will be fools and where`s he gone to?

The road gets rougher,
It`s lonelier and tougher.
With hope you burn up,
Tomorrow he may turn up.
There`s just no letup
The livelong night and day.

Ever since this world began
There is nothing sadder than
A one-man woman
Looking for the man that got away . . .

Billie Holiday,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice, warmer than the summer night
The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height.
Each star it's own aurora borealis, suddenly you held me tight,
I could see the midnight sun.

I can't explain the silver rain that found me--or was that a moonlight veil?
The music of the universe around me, or was that a nightingale?
And then your arms miraculously found me,suddenly the sky turned pale,
I could see the midnight sun.

Was there such a night, it's a thrill i still don't quite believe,
But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

The flame of it may dwindle to an ember, and the stars forget to shine,
And we may see the meadow in december, icy white and crystalline.
But oh my darling always i'll remember when your lips were close to mine,
And we saw the midnight sun.",Midnight Sun,1995
Billie Holiday,"This moment, this minute
And each second in it
Will leave a glow upon the sky
And as time goes by, it will never die

Through the darkness of the night

Like the lights of home before me
Or an angel, who's watching over me
This will be my shining hour

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust,1995

Was tinged with the sadness
Of a great love for me

Again, I was wrong

And only last year
Everything seemed so sure
Now life is awful again

So if I could employ
A little magic that will finally destroy
This dream that pains me and enchains me
But I can't because I'm mad
I'm mad about the boy",Mad About the Boy,1999
Billie Holiday,"Look at me, 
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
I can' t understand
I get misty, just holding your hand.

Walk my way,
And a thousand violins begin to play,
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
That music I hear,
I get misty, the moment you're near.

Can't you see that you're leading me on? 
And it's just what I want you to do,
Don't you notice how hopelessly
I'm lost
That's why I'm following you.

On my own,
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love.

Too misty,
And too much
In love",Misty,1999
Billie Holiday,"The concert was over in Carnagie Hall
The maestro took bow after bow
He said, ""My dear friends I have given my all.

When from the balcony way up high
There suddenly came a mournful cry

Please play my rhapsody
And if you cannot play it won't you sing it?
And if you can't sing you simply have to
Scat

Listen Paganini,

Go on and sling it
And if you can't sling it you simply have to

We greeted you with wild applause
But what a great ovation

I never blinked back at fireflies'

So, Paganini don't you be a meanie
What have you up your sleeve?
Come on and spring it
And if you can't spring it, you simply have to

Billie Holiday,"This bitter earth
Well, what a fruit it bears
What good is love
Mmh, that no one shares?

Ooh, that hides the glow of a rose
What good am I?

Yes, can it be so cold?

Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

Lord, what a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me

That thrilling kiss

Find romance on your menu

And the difference is you",What a Diff'rence a Day Made,1999

I'll understand
Then in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word

Maybe I shall meet him Sunday
Maybe Monday, maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day

I like every single thing about you
Without a doubt you are like a dream
In my mind I find a picture of us as a team

Ever since the hour of our meeting
I've been repeating a silly phrase
Hoping that you'll understand me one of these days.

And took put it in her pocket

She was truckin' on down the avenue
Without a single thing to do
She went peck, peck, peckin' all around
When she spied it on the ground

She took it, she took it
She took my yellow basket
And if she doesn't bring it back
I think that I would die

You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

While strolling neath the moon
Don't say things in December
You'll regret in June

Ware your remarks
Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon
Don't be erratic
Be diplomatic
To keep your heart's in tune

Will upset your apple cart
So don't lose your head

And climb that stairway to the stars
With love beside us to fill the night with a song
We'll hear the sound of violins
Out yonder where the blue begins
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal
Over the rim of the hill?
Can't we sail away on a little dream 
And settle high on the crest of a thrill!

That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Promise you`ll always continue
To be mine

He's the big affair I cannot forget
Only man I ever think of with regret

Tell me, where is the shepherd for this lost lamb?

There's a somebody I'm longin' to see

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could, always be good
To one who'll watch over me
