Passion,"I hear the sound of an army waking

Passion,"Lift your head weary sinner, the river's just ahead
Down the path of forgiveness, salvation's waiting there
You built a mighty fortress 10,000 burdens high
Love is here to lift you up, here to lift you high

If you're lost and wandering
Come stumbling in like a prodigal child
See the walls start crumbling
Let the gates of glory open wide

Fix your eyes on the mountain, let the past be dead and gone
Come all saints and sinners, you can't outrun God
Whatever you've done can't overcome the power of the blood

Come stumbling in like a prodigal child

How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved

My chains are gone
I've been set free
My God, my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood His mercy rains
Unending love, Amazing grace

Just pretend that things are mobile and will never stay put

Comes burying my burnt remains
These puddled clouds
Oh I, I understand now

But darkness falls likes shattered pieces
Dangling, shimmering
Torn and tattered and crowned
Oh I'll not be told ""No"" to ""No more!""

You must believe to hear me sing these
Messy morsels of my self-assuring love
Oh it's painful kneading
Yes, I lie and I wrangle with prospective angles
That glare me down and face me with all I do wrong
Why do they all look like me?

So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh
Just to prove I'm alive
And it's alright
Cause tonight there's a way I'll make light
Of my treacherous life

If I had hands I'd hold up high
My lofty dreams and my alibi's real name
But I have no strength
So I toss and I turn and I spit in the urn
There's a ghost in your eye
There is someone that knows more than I
But I'm quick to deny

Buried deep under the water
Your resting on your laurels
Is stepping on my toes

What side is this anyway?
Put down your sword and crown
Come lay with me on the ground

You come beating like moth's wings
Spastic and violently
Whipping me into a storm
Shaking me down to the core
But you run away from me
And you left me shimmering
Like diamond wedding rings
Spinning dizzily down on the floor

The confines of these rooms, yeah they get you to
And lying in our bed while tossing and turning
And it wakes you up, it puts you in the mood
But that's alright 'cause
We both know what the other wants
And it goes to show why we're not alone
And still we're here in this God forsaken place
I can hear what you're saying, I can see it on your face

So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't
Somebody else told me (something 'bout)
Where you live can 'cause you (suffering)
Guess that's something else that's wrong with our room
With the walls colliding
Someone said stop hesitating
We both know we're suffocating
Let's go out and find ourselves a home
And find ourselves a home

Honey please, you don't need to tell me
What we need, yeah we both know that
A bedroom floor with our clothes strewn all about
Yeah we're stuffed in here together begging for a new way out

So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor
Let's go 'til we can't

We both know we're suffocating
Let's go out and find ourselves a home
And find ourselves a home

We can barely speak, we can barely sleep, now we're leavin'
Barely take the time, take the time to try
Try to make this living hell, break this barren shell
Shell it out for something better than we think
And better than we ever dreamed

So let's go, let's go 'til we can't anymore
Let's go 'til we can't
Let's go, let's go 'til we fall to the floor

I made my case, you sat and crossed your arms
And you didn't make a sound
You were looking out the window at the city
Then you turned and said you loved me
And it took me by surprise
You were perching in your corner
And I couldn't see your eyes

Interposed His precious blood

Flying above the ocean
And I will never stop hiding

Tearing my wings off forcibly
He took my faith and my belief
The innocence was left there

I wish I had told this long before
Mom could have sewn the wings he tore
With a golden wire

So I will never be flying

The things that he could not regret
I hope his soul will burn in fire

God is speaking to someone
Right now
I don't know where you are, who you are
God has a message for you
You see, oh, thank you lord

See, whatever it is
That you've been searching for
Searching and looking
Looking all over
You're searching and you're trying to find it
You don't know what it is, god is gonna show you
He's gonna show you right there
What you're looking for
And all you have to do is say yes
Help me

I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes

I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, i'm gonna say yes

All of my life, i'll say
(shhhh!)
Make sure you get this now

My friend said he needed someone
Not searching for just anyone
I recommend the name of christ
He said he didn't need him in his life
But mother's sickness, daddy's lung disease
Financial burden found him on his knees
He searched his heart and realized
Although i'm down, my soul can rise

Am i lost in sin? (i'll say yes)
Is there anyway that i can be saved? (i'll say yes)
If i run to you, will you, will you hear my cry? (i'll say yes)
Will you dry all these tears from my eyes? (i'll say yes)
So many questions, lord

All of my life, i say yes
But i'm ready
And i'm willing
To go all the way
Yeah, say yes

You're spinning around on a ferris wheel
Trying to find what's really real
Now old confucius is wise, i'm told
But him and buddha can't save your soul
Ol' elijah didn't die for you
It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When it feels like i can't go on
I'll just say (i'll say yes)
When the world say no
You'll still hear montell, when he says (i'll say yes)
When i'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(i'll say yes)
Even then, he'll make everything alright (i'll say yes)
I want to testify

All of my life, i'll say
Through the storming rain
You know i'll say yes
Heartache and pain
You know i'll say yes
Everyday
You know i'll say yes
All over the building
Everybody, stand up on your feet
And say

And try to conjure up a resolution for my hang-ups
But it cannot be done
I told them what I need was a supernatural act from God
Then they looked at me like I was so crazy
Like it was too hard

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate
Or wash my tears away

I want to pray like they did in the upper room
I will not leave because I need to hear from you God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough
I want to walk in Your will and be favored
No matter how long I must put in my labor God
And my mission won’t stop
I’m standing in the need of a breakthrough.

I told somebody I was sick in my body and they they read
Me a list of all the doctors in this pamphlet but not if they’re human
What I have it doesn’t require a vaccine or anything
What I need is the healing virtue of the Father not a doctor

I’ve learned to lean not unto man
Because I know that he cannot
Take the pain away or make rain dissipate

Some people try to help me out others try to pull me through
But they cannot figure out what they can’t get it right
Sorry but it’s not your fault- I’m in need of a breakthrough
Everybody’s praying for me putting in petitions for me
Trying to keep the faith as wait for a breakthrough
Wrestle with the angels until we get a breakthrough

Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Streetlight, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anythin' to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
And now the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night

Streetlight, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'

If it ain't one thing, it's another
Why me, I believe in karma

If the Devil wasn't alive, Mack would be stressed
Riding around town in a bulletproof vest
Police everywhere amour cars and shh
Worried about being another victim of a hit

But my relationship too strong for real I'm a saint
A child of God and if you hate me then you ain't
Be the only G I know to take it all with no triggers
So I put my faith in Him and never no niggas

As a result of that I'm cool, seem like I'm never nervous
So catch me Sunday mornings in that 8:30 service
Told me ride with me son and I'll never leave you lonely
Yeah, troubles for a reason, 'cause now you got a testimony

Most people get outrageous when they hit they knees
But I'm a thank you for the simple things the grass and the trees
I'm grateful for everything my fame and good wealth
I'm blessed with good money but most of all with good health

God, if they don't think I'm sincere, they don't know me, never knew me
And I tear up every time I think how good You been to me
I should of lost a few times and walked away without any pay
But I got favored with You and You gave it to me anyway

So when you blind in a situation believe, He can show you
And if you ever need a hug then just believe He can hold you
So turn to the Lord for He's the best to consult you
And that's the realest thing that Mack 10 ever told you

Life is driving me crazy
Everything ain't all gravy
If it ain't one thing, it's another

Thank you for letting me conquer my enemies and they plots
And thank You for letting my momma survive them five shots
It was up close and personal a lot for a kid to see
All the stuff I been through how could I not be a G

I know you got a purpose for me, it ain't no if ands or maybes
God in case I never told You, I want to thank You for my babies
Although I'm a gangster, rapper I'm pretty smart and well rounded
I never sell my soul and I promise to stay grounded

He said all you got to do is just speak it and believe it
And everything I prayed for, I eventually receive it
While the Devil work overtime, the suckers stay doubting You
I'm aware of all my blessings and I know I'm nothing without You

I write short films""
o.k. grab your popcorn ain't no more sunshine.

Come on, O.K., peep it my techs swing low like sweet chariots
Bust em and burry em
That be his faithness sending flowers to they wait
And crying at they wake
And mourning with these motherfuckaz mothers
Fotr plottin out a way to kill they brother
Another nigga bled another niggaz gone be bleeding
'cause I ain't trynna hear that shit this evening
y'all niggaz best believe in
Guerilla warfare
Lets creep across the cemetery how they get there
I tell ya was this nigga from Lake Olmstead
My nigga said that he been fucking up dope since day one so instead
of pumpin the shit in Olmstead
I suggest he take that stupid shit to Sunset
But naw,but naw he want to play bad Billy bad ass and shit
I'm flawing my game like I can't perform the hit
I threw on the fucking plastic bag
wrapped my hands around his ass the squeezed
til the nigga can't breath
Limiting cheese about my trap,how the fuck imma catch the mouse
If you busting ya gun and steady runnin ya mouth
But down south I ain't no hard ass nigga
But best believe real come the thriller
Motherfucka I feel ya
Blast them hollow points,'cause hollow points get points across
They want the juice but they don't want to pay the cost
Now who's the boss
My nigga ask these hoes
I'm nuttin in they mouth and they nose
They eyes if they ain't closed
The lifestyle that I chose who knows may make me rich
But if them feds kick down them doors then lifes a bitch
I'm sittin in the patty wagon thinking bout the snitch
And wit my phone call I know exactly who to hit
My niggaz Don Perry we got some bodies to burry
Hide them niggaz with rugers and hide them lugers with Karen
Now its very nescesary that this bid go through
'cause I already know my niggaz threw
ain't no motherfuckin sunshine

chorus:Aint no motherfuckin sunshine, Its only tech nines and clips and 
niggaz that equip for whatever
I thought you knew better,but you still ran your mouth now you runnin from 
them fuckin Georgia Boys from down south 

ain't no sunshine my nigga, the sun ain't gonna shine
Till I reach about a million
Talkin billions with Brazilions
I got this funny feeling that I'm gone be filthy rich
And I'm gone marry money 'cause money's a faithful bitch
If it ain't one thang its ten more so fuck another
Surrounded by undercovers everytime they see they sucker
My mind be in the gutter,but that's how I burn the house
Because  I try to prove what these pussy niggaz bout
These niggaz make me shout,yea they frustrate me
Because I sell dope I guess that's why these niggaz hate me
Make me recall,think it was the fall of 96
But time don't matter nigga doing the same shit
The Narcs about to hit
His habit made em tell
Officer and the law,bastard crooked as hell
They lookin for Terrel
Mixed him up with Derrel it's 2 Derrels
They hit they doe with Marquel
Breakin em on the phone,told my niggaz time to bail
They knew we shot them niggaz they just lookin for the shells
They try to best they nail,like nail give me a break
Us cooley high niggaz,us niggaz is hard to take
We,appreciate they bust
We,appreciate they threat
We,appreciate that we so smooth they ain't caught us yet
Now Karen want respect,claim I'm doing her wrong
But my name is not Rome,I don't know where I belong
Pumpin her up with these songs,so so-long to all three
get O.U.T. but first let me get my thangs
The ho had bring me box with the lock that she was holdin
She brought my shit downstairs,my fuckin box was open
I'm holdin my breath before I mothafuckin hurt her
Rambaling through my shit no shells from the murder
I asked her calmly where the fuck is my shit
""Troy that's all I had""
What the fuck you mean bitch
It should have been six empty bullets and my ruger
Fuck trynna explain popped her,had to shoot her
I knew that the murders would interfer with my grindin
But what the fuck you expect if the sun ain't shinin

chorus

My mind is fucked up {why} I keep on picturing Karens head jerking
Disturbing me while I'm working
This clouds lurking over me,like a cartoon
Too hot in the streets I got to stay in my room
Soon to be charged 3 murders second count
But once in this will, twinzo I leave her out
Yo burn for your nigga,bout the dope visit my brother
Its back to Atlanta,shit too hot in Augusta and I knew I shouldn't trust her 
'cause I keep thinking bout her ass
Bout 2 or 3 knocks at my door and who is that
Just that fast,niggaz done ran up in my shit
Ski mask and guns and they, shooting to hit
I ran up stairs to get my gat yea that mack
I'm running and ducking one grazed me cross my back
But then I reach my gat,payback I'm bustin rockets
Ran back to the stairs took two clips off in my pocket
His gun I heard him cock it went the bustin over there
I'm poppin on them pussy niggaz, die nigga yea
I pop one in his ear,told him I would fear nothin
Snatched a mack up off the nigga,and is there Karen's cousin
Then I rushed into the bathroom then turned off the light
I heard somebody footsteps approaching to my right
Now bullets taking flight.I'm bustin in all directions
I laid in the tub praying for my protection
Done hit me to perfection I was fucked up in the game
While laying in the tub I heard them niggaz call my name
My 6'3 frame to be filled with bullet holes
If I gotta leave some more of them has got to go
I ran back to the stairs and went the bustin with mine
All directs wit tech 9
but they waitin in line,I was fine shit went to the phone to call Greg
Boom,Boom done took two to the head

From city to city sometimes it's hard man
My girl is 'bound to have me trippin' though
She tellin' me she love me more than I will ever know
I miss the crib yo, I'm in the streets
Doin' shows four nights out the week
Yeah, sometimes the king misses his own throne
Pastor Troy and I miss home, A-T-L

Atlanta, I'll rep for you, I'll always be there for you
Atlanta, I'll rep for you, I'll always be there for you

I done seen more hotels than my house
I done seen my home boy running his mouth
I know it sound crazy but baby understand
Every night I'm out at least ten grand
So we can rock Louis Vuitton and have fun
While puttin' up a college fun for my son
And when we sip we sip Dom Perignon
And when we dip it's an Aston Martin
I know sometime it feel like I am just headed for the cheese
And every time you want to chill it's like I up and gotta leave
But baby I am your king and the crib is my throne
I can't wait 'till I get back home, to A-T-L

Yeah, yeah we crankin' this for all the G's on the east side
We doin' this for all the Gangstas on the west side
We doin this for all the kings on the south side

Ayo this ya boy Pastor Troy checkin in right, yuh
(This from the soul)
Ayo, on this joint right here man we bout to just break it down to you
man just the transition to becoming..a man (This from the heart)
That some of y'all gone have to go through man everybody on the sound
of my voice (This from the soul)
Everything gone be cool man, From Boys to Men

[Verse 1] Pastor Troy
No one to doubt me, I'm not here lonely
Childhood secrets still wid my homies
I recall days when I blazed up on the hill
Not knowin' wud the future would hold, just kept it real
We ridin' on the 'Lac with the boys to other schools
We catch 'em at dey football games and act a fool
And everybody know my name, it's Michael Troy
We made all them bullies respect Falcon Boy
I got my folks worried, I'm suspended everyday
Sometimes I ain't tell 'em and caught the train to the A
The FirePoint Station, Supreme location
I'm only 15, tho at the lil' scene

[Chorus] 
No one to pry me, I'm all alone
No one to cry on
He'd shelter from the rain..to ease the pain
Changing from boys to men

[Verse 2]
I've done seen stabbings, i've done seen shootings
I've done seen a robbery, i've done seen two
But I ain't even 15, so when i turn 16
I'm'ma get dat chrome thing wid da beam
My team was da wreckin' crew, like juice
The type of niggas on our side do, who was the truth
I bet them killaz on his side respect game
That other nigga from the southside, was lame
My name is Stone, Charlestown to the bone
Lil' Wayne and Scooby, we rocking MCM and Gucci
I'm nine years old, that nigga let me touch a Uzi
I wanted to kill, just like i saw up in the movie
No wonder one of my friend shot himself in his head
Playin' wid the gun from under his mothers bed
Don't want to call his name too tough, we'll call him Fred
We watch my nigga while he bled (when we was young)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] Eight-ball
Lord knows we be tryin hard, God watching over us
Mama told me ""baby dun be goin to school cuttin up""
Did I listen, hell naw, listen let me tell ya'll
Streets transform mamas only into eight-ball
Errywhere I go, niggaz know I speak that poetry
See my +Chilouette+ like I'm +Alfred Hitchcock+ and they know its me
Bottom line met a lot of niggaz on the grind 
getting them dimes
Murder they ass, escape the scene like I committed the crime
A friend of mine, don't rap he doing illegal business
18-Wheeler, Fed, X, bricks, did wid killaz
He smoke and dipped'em drunk with Crys and get to beating his bitches
Them bitches down though, come straight back after they get through strippen
I'm outta' town, next to the church see his lil' brotha cryin
Told me his brotha killed himself, I said nigga you lyin
He put the gun to his mouth and blew his brain out
He couldn't handle this goddamn shit that we sang 'bout",Boys to Men,2004
Pastor Troy,"You've got your home of the brave 
And I've got my land of the free.
You conform to what society says
And I conform to me.
Looking for light in the corners, 
Getting caught in the spider web.
You look at me as though I'm giving a performance
When I'm just feeding my head.

And you know that I'm doing alright
And I won't explain myself to you just to avoid a fight
How I'm living ain't correct, 
But for me, its just right

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

I've got a pair of ruby slippers that 
I don't wear much anymore
And if I had the nerve, 
I'd click my heels and return
To the wonderland I knew before.
I'm waiting on a slow boat to China, 
Gonna sail away to the sun.
I've been searching for myself, 
And I know I'm gonna find her
If I break away from everyone.

So, the way that I act may not fit in.
Just because I have a mind of my own,
Doesn't mean its a sin.
I don't ask you to give up; 
Don't expect me to give in.

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

Some like to live for the moment, 
Taking life into their hands every day.
And if they don't get killed, 
They get so high off the thrill,
They could float to heaven anyway.
And others want to save for tomorrow,
Thinking money is security.
Well, I understand the need, 
But I don't get the greed.
Y'know, they all seem pretty crazy to me.

You can tell by the expression I wear.
Though I seem a little strange to you
I don't really care.  I've got the freedom to be;
There are others like me everywhere...

I'm not completely insane.
I'm maybe just a little bit crazy.
There's no one to blame, 
Got no shame 'bout my game,
Don't want nobody to save me.

the sun goes down as the darkness prevails
Loss of conversation with jazabell
She's so high always treatin' her nose
Her blood run black when her cycle flows

Knowin' she done been wit every man in town
Maybe I'm hellbound for living insane

Black on black, with black tip.
I can't help but represent.
I'm not content, I want more.
Who the fuck you take me for?
Studio rappers not the fortay.
drop my top and bust my A.K.
No mo play, in G.A.
Yeah, that's a classic.
Ridin' in the classic.
Totin' me a classic
Send em to the casket.
Send em to the morgue.
Slap me a nigga cause I'm motherfuckin' bored.
Chamillionaire, I camouflage in my surrounding.
Get my desert E's and get to motherfuckin' poundin'.
Up and down the streets,
Throwin' heat, out the driver's seat,
Ridin' to the beat,
Tell them nigga just lay weak.

Why you lookin' at me? Hear a nigga
I ain't ya bitch
You don't want a street nigga that have to get wit this shit
'Cause I ain't gon' quit
Til 'em choppa bullet flippin
They spleens, layin' all lower then yo chest or ya chin
Man I'm in it to win
I give a fuck bout a friend
I care more bout the dough, and even more bout the Benz
Niggaz look at my chain, then they clutchin' they burners
They think they got us, we ?? finna get ugly this summer
Yeah I roll with a stunna, I got a lot on the line
But still its kill or be killed before a nigga take mine
I give a pass to niggaz, when they look at my bitch
Just they admire her walk, or just impress that she thick
I'm reppin' Southside ?? nigga, nigga Yo Gotti!
Bricks in the dashboard Benz big body
Royce 5'9"" and them hustles out of Detroit
Get it how we get it 'cause they importin' Ex boy

Why you so hard nigga? Pause
I done tried so many times
To get my violent temper to comply with my mature side
But the other side is where the 45 is, hidin'
And I'm fa' sho childish, hi, I'm countin'
1, 2, seeking you niggaz with the peace, with the peek-a-boo trigger
When I come, through, with the honorable spirit
Eyes lighting up with shine like the ""Chronicles of Riddick""
Nigga forget it
Nine times outta ten, times' on my side
If your nines in the car, 'cause mines on my side
Why you lookin' like dat?
Nigga ain't no hoes here
I'm about to ask the waitress what she put in yo' beer
We can get it on, we can do whatever boy (whatever boy)
Don't you ever push your pedal, pump your brake
Better untwist your face
Spoken word, mixed with school, mixed with crunk
This should hit you, get you pump, if it get you drunk
It can get you jump!

[Chorus]

Bitches trip, niggaz quick
To pull out they chains on sight
Niggaz flip, soon as they announce my name on the mic
So I, gotta kinda watch them niggaz
You know them niggaz roll up beside you
You don't know if they like your car, they don't like you
By the way they lookin', you can't tell if they grimmin' you or admiring you
Whether envy you when they see your tires spinnin'
So you greet 'em as polite
Ly as possible, that nine sit on yo lap, be disrespectful then you leave 'em at the light
Hit that window and squeeze that toaster
Pull off fast and I promise
That I just put his Regal in 3-wheel motion without havin' hydraulics
I call it like I see it
Walk it like I did it
Nigga coughin' up yo kidney
Cough, talkin' bout the kid
My people, I came expectin' the same kinda respect that you want
Some of you steppin' in something by coming and testing it once
They won't let you do nothin' unless you cutting a check
Let me ask you a couple a questions, nigga

Self-employed so I'm paying me
Stayin' true 'cause it stay to be
Won't loud part candy captain then get a ticket then pay the V
Rap 84 of the 83, ain't rhyme them and they end with me, 
How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see
Now we got mob block live again
Look at these whips we're riding in
Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
Sliding in I'm never super post when
I'm getting closer I'm just... the face
All the sinners star calling God, 
All the rappers start calling Mace, 
Drop sounding like an earthquake, 
Trunk bound to make an earth shake
Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day
Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade, 
You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade, 
She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel, 
Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks
So I'm pulling up and then you know what
They looking at me like what is that

Don't know what to call that
So they call, they call, they call it
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Hold up, hold up, hold up, 
That's what they call it.
Soon they see roll up, uh, roll up,

Told Brad to send me a track, 
He send me a track to sound like a trap, 
I don't know normally do this, 
But hey when I do it sound like the trap, 
Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap, 
I'm just hoping you try to try me, 
Get drag around by your suit tie, 
You can catch me in the forn city, 
They don't even know I rap, 
First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map, 
Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai
She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai
Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese
Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches
Wanna book me for five G's, 
Read the sign and say stop please, 
Can't knock me, my trunk knocking, 
My making woman looking knock me, 
Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too
God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two, 
My trunk are open like pickable, 
Me I'm... to be sipping through, 
Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn em up and my speakers do.

Hold up man, just hold up man, 
Rap to state then pour down, 
Chew up cheese then throw up grants, 
Then guess some bread you know I'm jam, 
It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine, 
One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine, 
Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day
If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay, 
Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel, 
Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill, 
Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want n autograph on her fake breast, 
Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist, 
Check it out when my lack is out, 
Don't worry bout it, I ain't stressed, 
Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test.

Pastor Troy,"I remember when I met 'cha, I was only sixteen
Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?

She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better
As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name White Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali

I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on

(And I love you)
You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

(And I love you)
You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

(And I love you)
You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great

Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas

All the cars, all the clothes
Wit all the stars and all the hoes
First class flights, a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard

See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster, baby, I love you

Drink good, smoke good

Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi
And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease

I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding

I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine

A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me?
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie

Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be
Them niggas from the South
So one to the two, the three, the fo'
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, so I'ma get 'cha some mo'

They tried to hit me like 50 but bitch I'm still livin'
Flinch and I get ya hit, do it like them Georgia boys
The A-K with the rubber grip, it's something they ain't seen before
Look Jon I think they scared, let's bring them down south
And show 'em how the Chevy's look and how our hoes bounce
Shorty don't want no trouble, shorty don't wanna fight
But let him keep talkin' I bet ya shorty gon' die tonight
I planned on gettin' put out the club before I came
My hood down for whatever, we all ride with them thangs
Breakin' bottles across niggaz heads, fuck what a hater said
Them gangstas don't live long as the ones that ain't breakin' bread
I tried to keep it up, just quit and let my man's get it
Don't see no bricks but I still got my hands in it
Cash then I turn a key, I told y'all I'm a blow it up
G-Unit soldier, my nigga, now come and throw it up

Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up motherfucker, throw it up
Throw it up (where you from), throw it up
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club
If you scared to throw it up get the fuck out the club

Pastor Troy,"I remember when I met 'cha, I was only sixteen
Who would ever thought that me and you would get the cream?
We took a lot of trips together, you stayed down
Remember when we start hoppin' on that Greyhound?

She say she like to play hide and seek in the ride
And sure I'll open up the trunk and hide her inside
She say she think I'm cheatin' wit a girl named Jane
You ain't just my baby, bitch, you my everything

I was broke but you made things better
As long as me and you together, we can get this cheddar
Whatever, her name White Sally
I met her through my homeboy Rico out in Cali

I thank Reagan for the haters when ya got hard
You bought me jewels, Gator shoes and some big cars
Yeah, you took me out in the hood, gave me good thangs
Now we on a private plane eatin' chicken wings, come on

(And I love you)
You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

(And I love you)
You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

(And I love you)
You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

And I love you, baby, muah, hugs and kisses
Fuck them niggas and fuck them bitches
Been in this game since 1998
Nigga, take the safety and shit but I'm great

Maybe it's fate, destiny, you tell me
Damn near ten and that shit been free
But I'm PT so I gots to cruise, nigga
Really ain't shit to prove to y'all niggas

All the cars, all the clothes
Wit all the stars and all the hoes
First class flights, a nigga live in the lights
But see you in the dark, this stuff is kinda hard

See where I park, valet costs a note
Drop another fifty just to check my coat
Probably leave wit yo' chick, know how I do
It's Pastor Disaster, baby, I love you

(And I love you)
You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

(And I love you)
You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed
Candy on my old school

(And I love you)
You the reason why I quarterback
Took a nigga out the projects
Put me in a cul-de-sac

That's why I get it how I live, boy
'Cause you took me
From a young broke nigga to a Rich Boy

Took me from a gun totin' nigga to a Big Boi
Too legit to slip, now I got papers on my shit, boi
And not just a weapon, I'm talkin' 'bout titles and deeds
You payin' rent you can't afford and can't break out of your lease

I'm out of your league, I might as well be Ivy
All over ya ass like injections in a stripper's hiney
Rhyming is a skill that requires timing
Like dual ejaculation while my lady's riding

I'm 'bout to cum, I'm 'bout to cum at the same time
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, that's how I slang mine

A generation came up under my style
From penetration of the nation when I was just a child
Now, who's really in the critics talk 'bout me?
Andre 3000 and three mo' niggas that's really fie

Let me break it down, I get fly at that mouth
I stay fresh to the hosiery we 'posed to be
Them niggas from the South
So one to the two, the three, the fo'
Satisfied? I'm satisfied, so I'ma get 'cha some mo'

(And I love you)
You the reason why I ride good
You the reason why I shop good
Drink good, smoke good

You the reason why these hoes choose
You the reason why a nigga sprayed

Eh, si hay Dios, seguramente entiende de emoción, si hay Dios

Podrás llevarte a aquellos que me importan
Despojarme de mis ropas, desviarme de la luz
Podrás llenar de oscuridad mis sueños
Podrás porque eres tú
Podrás romper de nuevo el juramento
Deshaciendo las cadenas que te ataron una vez
Pero dame tú el valor, que tengo miedo
O, puedes darme una esperanza
O, arrancarme, al fin las ganas de seguir por ti

Montar un numerito de esos de fatalidad
Según lo que establece el reglamento del aparentar
Podría haber llorado un mar de lágrimas
Saladas, arrojarme a los abismos
Y partirme en dos el alma, desatar la tempestad
Y el huracán de mi garganta
Y confesar desesperado que no puedo con mi rabia
Aunque en mi actitud no soy tan evidente
No puedo sufrir más
Que el dolor cuando es por dentro es más fuerte
No se alivia con decírselo a la gente

Lloraré si sé llorar
Como el tímido rocío del clavel, en soledad
Estaré todos se irán, ya lo sé
A tu lado en cada golpe
Como lo hacen las orillas y la mar
Como lo hace el campo y el agua que lloverá

Gee, it's been a long, long time
Since those hot and humid Texas nights
When we went swimm'n in the tide

Corpus Christi seems so far away
And I'm not talk'n 'bout the miles
And there ain't much I wouldn't give today
Just to see one of your smiles

 But here I sit alone in Denver 
 Sipp'n the California wine 
 And I've got all night to remember you 
 I'm in a lone star state of mind

Save the girl and ride away
And I was hoping as the credits rolled
He'd make it back to her someday

From here to your front door
I'd be there tomorrow if I left today

Pat Alger,"heard a siren late last night,
You must have felt me shiver,
Shaken by a wave of fright,
That you calm with a whisper.
And fear gave way to better things,
Like a warm summer and sweeter dreams.  

Like a warm spring rain, on a roof above;
The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain. 

When living leaves my pride bruised up,
I'm fragile as a feather.
The storms of life just won't let up,
You're like a change of weather.
When dust settles on my dreams,
You wash them clean.

The way you call my name, when we make love.
While the world outside my window goes insane,
You're here to remind me, a few good things remain.

Not a soul in sight 
The city's lookin' like a ghost town

He's headin' back from somewhere 
That he never should have been 
And the thunder rolls 
And the thunder rolls 

Every light is burnin' 
In a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone 
In her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle 
Hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather 
That's kept him out all night

Out of control 
Deep in her heart

When he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him

A strange new perfume blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes

At our house tonight 
Slow music playing 
And soft candlelight 
On her lips I keep tasting 
The warm red wine 
I'm there in her arms 
But it's all in my mind 

The snow is piled high on the highway tonight 
I'm a ship lost at sea on this ocean of white 
Eighteen wheels anchored somewhere out of Dover 
I wish I could hold her 
Instead of huggin' this old cold shoulder 

This old highway 
Is like a woman sometimes 
She can be your best friend 
But she's the real jealous kind 
She's the lady that leads me

Pat Alger,"You know a dream is like a river
Ever changin' as it flows
And a dreamer's just a vessel
That must follow where it goes
Trying to learn from what's behind you
And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Too many times we stand aside
And let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow
It has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline
And say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids
And dare to dance that tide
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
These waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
If I never try
So I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry
There's bound to be rough waters
And I know I'll tke soome falls
With the good Lord as my captain
I can make it through them all
And I will sail my vessel
'Til the river runs dry

Pat Alger,"Just the other night a hometown football game
My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be

She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers

She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
Inn her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all

And as she walked away and I looked at my wife
And then and there I thankedd the good Lord
For the gifts in my life

Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care

Just an ordinary man.
When I close my eyes,

When the last man dies for just words that he said,
When there's shelter over the poorest head,
We shall be free.
When the last thing we notice is the color of the skin,
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within;
When the skies and the oceans are clean again,
Then we shall be free.
We shall be free, we shall be free.

When this world's big enough for all different views,
When we all can worship from our own kind of pew,

And nobody walks a step behind;

Anyone who did never went through anything painful

Shatters when we walk through something hard
So, we walk on whatever may come

To tears and laughter, the great unknown

Stepping off the edge, I'm facing all my fears

When I feel like throwing it all away
I look back over my shoulder
And I can see Your goodness every single step that I have taken

Motorbike ride in the mid-day heat
The dust that hung from the desert skies
Run, though we run it still burned our eyes

And our movements traced by a stranger close by your side
And in the shadows of a promise, you can take my hand
And show me the way to understand

And you think you can stand by me
And if you really, really want me to stay

And we moved out of sight, with a silent sound
A beach that wept with deserted waves
That's where we slept, knowing we'd be safe

But there's a lot I can learn, and a lot that I've yet to see
You know you've got my life lying in your hands

You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found

At a pool hall where they all hang around
You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew
And talk about what they're gonna do

Or did they look down, and see what you found was true

As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in

Every hope that you rejected, every truth that was a lie

Pat Benatar,"Once there was a man, and he lived to sing the lions song

It will lead us to the higher ground

Let it be done right now

Once there was a man, and his words became a song of love
And his song became the golden dream
One love is the light, shining over everyone that believes
It will lead us to the higher ground
One day every eye will see truth before the light
Let it be done right now

Some wait, so long
Because our love is strong
This hard road traveled on
Will lead us home
Forever

Hear the lion's song, voices cryin' like a desert wind
Yeah he's gone unto his father's land
Afrika tonight, for we truly are one in our hearts
Colors woven in the golden dream

One day every eye will see truth before the light
Let it be done right now
One day every voice will speak strong against the night
Let us be one right now

I need you back into my life and turn this darkness into light
I'm all alone in this house, turn this house into a home

Empty silence surrounds me, lonely walls, they stare

Pat Benatar,"When they found you, you were driven and hungry
You were playin' for your life then
You were livin' for the chance to be heard
What they promised, what they offered
Was more than you'd ever hoped for
To walk away, ya' know that would've been absurd
And talk about absurdity, it was madness
It was everything in excess
It was too much, too many, and too little time
It was faceless people in jackets and ties
Who thought of you when they made love to their wives
Somehow, it wasn't what you had in mind

[Chorus:]

Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back
So they might as well get used to the idea
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over
You got no one to blame but yourself
So don't put it on nobody else
Put it behind you, start over, today

There were parties and photos and televised award shows
And covers of magazines
There was gold and platinum and everyone was smiling
You were coming apart at the seems
There were jerk offs too numerous to mention
When everybody shared the dream
But when it came time to share the nightmare
They were conveniently nowhere to be seen

(Chorus)

Oh they'll argue what they gave you was exactly what you wanted
And just to be fair, ya' know that some of it's true
That's why ya' gotta be careful, 'bout your wishes
Take your time and think 'em over
Sometimes those wishes just might come true

Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back
So they might as well get used to the idea
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over
Tell 'em you've had enough, and if they don't like it it's tough
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over
You're Takin' It Back

Wake up, you don't want to make up

Pat Benatar,"Oh I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship,
Has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crushing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places
That alone I'd never find

And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

And I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever

'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door

And every time I play an ace
My partner always trumps
Guess I'm just a fool who never looks before he jumps

That love would turn the trick to end despair
But know I just can't fool this head that thinks for me

All the things we used to say
How come hearts can grow so cold
Just because we grow old

Things were simple then
Why does it have to end?
Can we be little children again?

Through the eyes of innocence
It can be as it was then
Childlike love is heaven-sent
Through the eyes of innocence

Today is just tomorrow's memories
Broken pictures, faded dreams
Embracing thoughts that bring us pain
Desperate eyes seek in vain
Through the eyes of innocence
See the smile of youth again

Through the eyes of innocence

Moody river, more deadly than the vainest knife
Moody river, your muddy water took my baby's life

Last Saturday evenin' came to the old oak tree
It stands beside the river where you were to meet me
On the ground your glove I found
With a note addressed to me
It read ""Dear love, I've done you wrong""
""Now I must set you free""
""No longer can I live with this hurt and this sin""
""I just couldn't tell you that guy was just a friend""

Moody river, more deadly than the vainest knife
Moody river, your muddy water took my baby's life

I looked into the muddy water and what could I see?
I saw a lonely, lonely face just lookin' back at me
Tears in his eyes and a prayer on his lips
And the glove of his lost love at his fingertips

I hear your name and I'm a flame

Flame, flame of desire 
Only your kiss can put out the fire 
Oh you are the lover I have waited for
Your the mate that fate had me created for 
And every time your lips meet mine

Down and down I go 
Round and round I go 
In a spin, lovin' the spin I'm in

Like a nightingale without a song to sing

When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
Hearing words that I have never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing

Of something that never happened, yet you recall it well
You know the feeling of recognizing someone
That you've never met as far as you could tell, well

Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The laugh that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall

She gave your very first kiss to you

Pat Boone,"When I was a lad and old Shep was a pup
O'er hills and meadows we'd strayed
Just a boy and his dog we were both full of fun
We grew up together that way

I remember the time at the old swimming hole
When I would have drowned beyond doubt
Shep was right there to the rescue he came
He jumped in and helped pull me out

So the years sped along and at last he grew old
His eye sight was fast growing dim
Then one day the doctor looked at me and said
I can't do no more for him Jim

With a hand that was trembling I picked up my gun
I aimed it at Shep's faithful head
I just couldn't do it I wanted to run
And I wished they'd shoot me instead

I went to his side and I sat on the ground
He laid his head on my knees
I stroke the best pal that a man ever found
I cried so I scaresly could see

Old Shepy he knew he was going to go
for he reached out and nipped at my hand
He looked up at me just as much as to say
We're parting but you'll understand

And no more with old Shep will I roam
But if dogs have a heaven there's one thing I know

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know we'll never forget

There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
And she's buying a stairway to heaven

Ooh, it makes me wonder, ooh, it makes me wonder

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
Just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
Ooh, it makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show

How everything still turns to gold?
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When the being one is all and all
To be the rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to heaven

",Stairway to Heaven,1997
Pat Boone,"After all jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red

And the wind whispers Mary

A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterday's life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife

And the wind, it cries Mary

The traffic lights they turn a blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'Cause the life that they lived is dead

And the wind screams Mary

Will the wind ever remember?
The names it has blown in the past
And with its crutch, its old age and its wisdom
It whispers ""no, this will be the last""

And the wind cries Mary",The Wind Cries Mary,1997

And promising never, never to part

Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean

Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

Pat Boone,"I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his workshop 
And told his plans to me, so
 
[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list and checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're a wake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree
So! You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
 
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day
You'd better write your letter now
And mail it right away
Because he's getting ready
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So

Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb

You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by.
 
Sometimes I wonder, how I spend
The lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody 
Haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new 
And each kiss an inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song

Besides the garden wall, when stars are bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale 
Tells his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart it will remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrain.",Stardust [1st Recording],1997

They did the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango
They did the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Heel and toe?) I don't know

Last night at Papa Joe's my buddy met a lovely dove
She was the kind you never find but keep on dreamin' of
She did a dance we never saw before but sure did love
It was the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Fast or slow?) I don't know (ooh)

Ooh la la la la la la la
(Ooh la la la la la la)

The crowd was tappin' and a-clappin' as the music played
His heart was right in time with every little move she made
Though he was shy she took his hand and said ""Don't be afraid""
""Let's do the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(Nice and slow?) I don't know

Ooh la la la la la la la
(Ooh la la la la la la)

He did a spin and shook his shoulder
To get the zing of it, the sway and swing of it
But every time he tried to hold her
She'd shake and shout ""Olé"", (Olé) then go the other way

Now all night long he did it wrong but still it ended right
My buddy walked her home and got a kiss and held her tight
So you can bet he'll be at Papa Joe's tomorrow night
To do the Wang Dang Taffy-Apple Tango Mambo Cha Cha Cha
(To and fro?) I don't know

Ooh la la la la la la la


Now all night long?he did it wrong ?it ended right?.they kissed goodnight

You're gonna miss me, honey, in the day they say's to come.""

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,
You don't know what love is.

Do you know how a lost heart fears
At the thought of reminiscing,
And how lips that taste of tears
Lose their taste for kissing?
You don't know how hearts burn
For love that can, not live yet never dies.
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes,
You don't know what love is.",You Don't Know What Love Is,1965

I see you, I feel you,
That is how I know you go on

And last for a lifetime

I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one
I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after""

Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless

Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you

Angels have no thoughts of ever returning you
Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?
Gloomy Sunday

Gloomy is Sunday with shadows I spend it all
My heart and I have decided to end it all
Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are said I know
Let them not weep, let them know that I'm glad to go

Death is no dream for in death I'm caressing you
With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessing you
Gloomy Sunday

Dreaming, I was only dreaming
I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart

Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you
My heart is telling you how much I want to do
Little white flowers will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you

We'll fix up your kettles, please dear missus, we'll sharpen your knives
And we always agreed that together we'd stay

We worked for a song but the money it didn't come in
Now brothers are kindred but hard times betray
And so we stumbled apart on the old changing way

For the spikes and the brothels, they're shameful to see

It's a ''thank you for nothing, we'll see you someday''

Leave at home what you value enough
And laugh all your senses away
When you want to love everyone, how can you love

Those film stars and beauties will please you tonight
If you go to bed with a book
But they can't hold a candle to something that trembles
If you need to do more than look

They come from rich fathers and twinkle their eyes
And you're begging them please not to go
When you're starved for some loving, they can make you feel special
The painted ladies I know
If you're seeking fortune, if you're seeking fame
And you're looking yourself in the eye
And God help the children, playing their game

You've got to take it while you can

Billy turned and he walked away
He said, I must be going
There's just no knowing
Who follows me around
They see my fancy clothes
And they want to shoot me
I'd rather be dead on my feet
Than dead down in the ground

Pat Donaldson,"This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams have withered and died

Once I was bending the tops of the trees
Kind words in my ear, kind faces to see

Then I struck up with a boy from the west
Played run and hide, played run and hide
Count one to ten and he's gone with the rest
My dreams have withered and died

Silver moon sail up and silver moon shine
On the waters so wide, waters so wide
Steal from the bed of some good friend of mine
My dreams are withered and died

If I was a butterfly, live for a day
I could be free, just blowing away

This cruel country has driven me down
Teased me and lied, teased me and lied
I've only sad stories to tell to this town
My dreams have withered and died",Withered and Died,1993
Pat Donohue,"Back down memory lane, I began as my mother's bright idea
A short time later they all watched in awe and all of a sudden I'm here
She was also my father so I hardly got to see her
I was afraid of the dark, but it was only 'cause I was a believer

I was told when I was two years old
She swore that I would be special
I took a good look around and thought
Don't worry mama this city's gonna help ya

Georgia, you'll always be home to me
Georgia, I belong to you and yes you belong to me
When they ask me where I'm from
I'm proud to say that I'm your son

I'm movin' on using mostly dirt roads until I find my way
Campbellton Road, can't forget Cascade or remember both MLK
There's somethin' about Atlanta, doesn't cease to amaze me
Oh, after all you even raised the people that raised me

And my old man is very dead, can't be mad now why bother?
And you have been my mother nature also my godfather

Georgia, you'll always be home to me

Pat Donohue,"Savoy, the home of sweet romance
Savoy, it wins you at a glance
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance, to dance.
Your form, just like a clinging vine
Your lips, so warm and sweet as wine
Your cheek, so soft and close to mine, devine
How my heart is singin' 
While the band is swingin'
Never tired of rompin' 
And stompin' with you, at the Savoy,
What joy, a perfect holiday

Pat Donohue,"Don't lose your head
Then lose your guy
You can't lose a broken heart

If you ever break up
Then try to make up
It's tough to make a brand new start

You'll regret in June

Before you speak
Or you may be sorry soon,
Don't be erratic 
Be diplomatic

And I had nothing but shadows
Then one morning you passed
And I brightened at last
Now I greet the day and complete the day
With the sun in my heart
All my worry blew away
When you taught me how to say

Grab your coat and get your hat
Leave your worry on the doorstep
Just direct your feet
To the sunny side of the street
Can't you hear a pitter-pat?
And that happy tune is your step
Life can be so sweet
On the sunny side of the street

I used to walk in the shade
With those blues on parade
But I'm not afraid
This Rover crossed over

If I never have a cent
I'd be rich as Rockefeller
Gold dust at my feet
On the sunny side of the street
Grab your street",On the Sunny Side of the Street,1999
