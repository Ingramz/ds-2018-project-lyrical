Belford Hendricks,"What a difference a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain

My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

Lord, what a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy

Nothin' but blue skies do I see
Bluebirds singin' a song
Nothin' but bluebirds all day long

Never saw the sun shinin' so bright
Never saw things goin' so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my, how they fly

Blue days, all of them gone
Nothin' but blue skies from now on
Blue skies smilin' at me

That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forever more, that's how you'll stay
That's why darling it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too",Unforgettable,1995
Belford Hendricks Orchestra,"Was it in Tahiti? 
Were we on the Nile? 
Long ago, say an hour or so, 
I recall that I saw you smile.

And, I remember you. 
You're the one who made my dreams come true, 
A few kisses ago.

I remember you. 
You're the one who said ""I love you, too. 
I do. Didn't you know?""

I remember, too, a distant bell 
And the stars that fell 
Like rain out of the blue.

Well, when my life is through 
And the angels ask me to recall 
The thrill of them all 
Then I shall tell them ""I remember you.""",I Remember You,1997

But you cry the whole night through
You can cry me a river 
Oh, yes, you're goin' to cry me a river

Now you say you're sorry for being so untrue
You may cry a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Yes, I did, child; yes, I did, my child

You drove me nearly out of my head
You stood by and never shed a tear
But I remember every word that was said
Oh, yes, I remember, never fear

You may cry me a river, come on now
Cry me a river
You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you (oh, how I cried)

You nearly drove me out of my own sweet head
You stood by; you never shed a tear for me
I remember every cruel word, everything that was said
Yes, I remember, never you fear

You may cry me a river
I cried a river for you
Yes, I cried a river for you

Turn back the tide of life; I cried--salty water runnin' down
I cried I love you
I cried I love you
I cried, I cried

You may cry, oh; she may cry now a river of tears 
A river of tears for you
You may cry now; she may cry, oh, she may cry now
You may cry, oh; she may cry now a river of tears

and to other places aggra-
vate all our cares.
We'll save our fares!

I've a cozy little flat in
what is known as old Manhattan
we'll settle down
right here in town!

We'll have Manhattan
the Bronx and Staten
Island too.
It's lovely going through
the zoo!

It's very fancy
on old Delancy
street you know.
The subway charms us so
when balmy breezes blow
to and fro.

And tell me what street
compares with Mott Street
in July?
Sweet pushcarts gently gli-ding by.

The great big city's a wonderous toy
just made for a girl and boy.
We'll turn Manhattan
into an isle of joy!

We'll go to Yonkers
Where true love conquers
In the whiles
And starve together dear, in Chiles

We'll go to Coney
And eat baloney on a roll
In Central Park we'll stroll
Where our first kiss we stole
Soul to soul

And ""My Fair Lady"" is a terrific show they say
We both may see it close, some day

The city's glamour can never spoil
The dreams of a boy and goil
We'll turn Manhattan
into an isle of joy!

Believable Picnic,"Here the bridges just aren't long
Enough, I walk but never
Reach the other side
Here this building's never tall
Enough for me to touch the sky
I've heard about a place where
Everyone knows how to fly
Shangri-La

Here statues on a palace
Lawn are all the friends I had
That turned to stone
Tears rolling down their ivory
Cheeks they didn't make it home
I'm going to a land where all the
Hearts beat at one time
Shangri-La

Everybody's fine in Shangri-La
Children draw the trees there in
Crayola forest green
Everybody smiles in Shangri-La
Built inside the pearly whites so
Bright they light the day

Here within the land of make
Believe, it's lipstick and a comb
And it's Judas on a throne
Weird how silver lies and golden
rules they teach their
Kids in school to never say
Forever so they severed all
Their ties with Shangri-La

They say it never rains in
Shangri-La a multi-colored
Rainbow fades into a neon sky
Taste candied coated halos
While pakadotted ponies teach
The children how to fly

Here our seasons have all
Learned to share the summer
Sun can warm the winter air
Here leaves only fall to kiss
The ground and it makes
The sweetest sound
We'll start another language
Using all the words that
Rhyme with Shangri-La

The silver snow in Shangri-La
Turns to silver sand so it will
Never melt away come along
With me to Shangri-La we'll
Build a silver snowman on the
Warmest summers day
No one ever cries in Shangri-La
We take a kiss and mix it
With a glass of ocean wine
And if you close your eyes in
Shangri-La a million falling stars
Will gently whisper you to sleep
And when whisper you to sleep
And when you wake you'll find
It's not a dream",Shangri-La,1996
Believable Picnic,"I want to be a space man
Way up in the sky
In a tiny little capsule
Where I can bide my time

Like a robomatic rocketboy
Who journeys back into the stars
To hang with all the angels
Somewhere out beyond Mars.

Branded, stranded, but not alone
Sent here, light-years,
From my home

Left to be done
Before we fly into the sun

I don't belong here
Feel like I've come from outer space
I don't belong here
I'm only visiting this place

Listen for a transmission

Do my best to do my duty
TIll the day that he comes

Come in, come in Commander Cosmo
May day Mission Command

My wings are waiting for me
Heavenly home, up in the sky
There's no place that I'd
Rather be

And my work on Earth is done

Will be given to me by

Believer,"No one is righteous, not even one
There is no one who understands
The Anointed One of God they shun
No one

All born of flesh have turned away
Worthless together they have become
No one does what is right, all disobey
No one

Blood sacrifice
Faith had begun
No one must die
Not even one

Their throats are open graves
Their tongues practice deceit
Ruin and misery mark their ways
Ruin

The poison of vipers their lips outcry
Their feet are swift to shed blood
There is no fear of God before their eyes
No fear

A righteousness from God has been made known
Through the faith one has in Jesus Christ
Believing that His shed blood will atone
Our sins

There is no difference for all have sinned
Falling short of the glory of the Lord
But redemption comes from Christ within
Believe",Not Even One,1989
Believer,"When evil men advance to devour my flesh
When enemies attack, their will to oppress
When bloody wars break loose and armies draw near
In the day of distress my heart will not fear

Pain, mental torment
Saved from death

Trapped in mental pain, agony within
Life consumed by anguish, endurance wearing thin
Tormented by misery, struggling to stand
Growing weak with sorrow, my grief is in your hands

Struck down but not destroyed, you lift me from the depths
You brought me from the grave, redemption from death
Hard pressed on every side but not in despair
Never on my own, your presence everywhere",Tormented,1989
Believer,"Libera me, Domine, de morte aeterna in die illa tremenda

On that dreadful day when heavens and earth
Shall move, when you come to judge the world through fire)

Believer,"Beneath the sun, all deeds done, meaningless are they
Labor in vain, tormenting pain, incessant toil
Chasing the wind, grasping (for) what's been, wearisome longings
Ages now gone, time passes on, but the earth remains

A time of birth, a time of death, perishing mortals
Men are like grass, which soon doth pass, destined to die
Houses of clay, doomed to decay, foundations of earth
Men come from dust, and to the dust, in death all return

The Lord did mold, man's flesh and soul, a creation of soil
But just as man, from dust began, in death will face judgment
But Christ was slain, bearing our pain, taking our sentence
The Christ was dead, the blood He shed, absolves the guilty

The hold of the grave, broken away, by the Risen Saviour
Prophecy fulfilled, His perfect will, providing eternal life
Death is certain, for every man, but belief gains life
He who believes, life he'll receive, even though he'll die

From dust you came
You must return
Can death you escape?",Dust to Dust,1991
Believer,"Dreamers, enticed to turn away
Kneeling, to gods born from clay
Praying, to images carved to stone
Bowing, though sins are not atoned

Hearing, only silence through your cries
Seeing, nothing with lifeless eyes
Worthless, are the objects idolized
Blinded, men fall to their demise

Unholy, lovers of themselves
Money, the lust of which compells
Brutal, without self control
Defying, the Redeemer of their soul

I am the first and the last
Yahweh, Creator of ages past
Ruler, Author of the Book of Life
Fortress, Saviour of impending strife

""I am the Lord

Believer,"Toxic waste corrupts the air
Adulteration of man's breath
The sky pours forth rains of acid
Waters of life now bring death

Clear cuts espose the land
Forest ravaged by greed
Corporate lies being bought
Destruction for profit their creed

Surrounded by nonpoint filth
Pollution's silent killer
Ignoring our earth's decline
Out of sight, out of mind

Established upon the deep
Founded upon the seas

From the fall came its disease

Pollution corrupts your soul
Wake up from your careless sleep
Open your eyes to see
What you sow you'll surely reap",Nonpoint,1991
Believer,"The end of time is drawing near
The angels prepare for the harvest
Separation of the wicked and righteous
The corrupt the fire infest

Sifting of humanity
Extirpation of the heathen
Cast into the infinite holocaust
Where time's end is never seen

Signs of the end have come
Nation will rise against nation
Famines wage war on the land
The birth pains have begun

These omens of sanity are obscured
Hidden from the insane minds

Otherwise their eyes might see
And in turn become healed

Brainwashed by this decaying world
Always searching to belong
Endless fear of being alone

Taught to listen to the wise
But only heard the fools

Now being murdered by stupidity
Realization of the truth
Brings freedom in captivity",Stop the Madness,1991
Believer,"How long, will you, simple ones, love your, simple ways
And continue to reject the calling of wisdom?
Fools mock, at making, amends, for sin
You fools detest turning from evil

Does not, wisdom, cry out, aloud, does not
Understanding raise her voice?
The wise, attaining, wisdom, and discipline
Listen and add to their learning

Worth more, than silver, yields more, than gold
Nothing you desire can compare with her
Those who, find her, through Christ, find life
All those who hate her love death

Why don't you open up your mind
Can't you hear wisdom's cry?",Wisdom's Call,1991
Believer,"Reason argues the existence of God
If the incarnate was crucified
The dialectical paradox concludes
That God has already died

The very nature of man's independence
Implies accountability for one's actions

Reveals the magnitude of my freedom

Particles in motion in a corner of the universe
The origin of life and evolution an accident?

Yo lo fui una vez
Al estar junto a ti
Era la ley

Ahora ya no estas
Y fue un dolor
Perder tu amor
Y no ver tu valor

La brisa del mar
Me hacía amarte más
Sentir, soñar
Aprender a vivir

La brisa se fue
Y yo te perdí
Por que, no sé
No te olvides

Al final, será
Como ayer
Más que un recuerdo
Al final, será
Lo que no fue
Y nunca pudo ser
Hey hey
Tu nombre está en mi piel

Eres mi obsesión
Una dulce pasión
Que al final se llevó
Mi corazón

Las lunas de abril
Me hacen recordar
Tu amor
Tan lentamente

Y amarte nunca fue un error
Ni fue una falsa tentación
Tampoco lo decidí yo
Me distes un amor intenso que perdí

Y será como antes

Y será como antes",¿Quién Es Feliz?,2006

Que me dejo con el alma rota

Porque por ti puedo existir
Porque por ti puedo morir
Ahora...

Me tiembla el corazón
Solo de ver
Que ya no me abrazas mas
Que de tu vida me aleje
Sin apenas comprender
Porque tu amor es cruel quiza
No eres feliz estando junto a mi

Why vine a decirte adiós
No puedo engañarte más
Tus besos no saben igual
En tu vida hay alguien más
Nunca te podré olvidar
Porque por ti aprendi a amar
Aunque a ti te de igual

Me he vuelto el fantasma de tu voz
La que no recibe amor
Why aun asi no me importo
Reincarnaste en mi otro yo
Why es irrepetible why es irreversible
Como termino...

See a million people, everyone's so lonely
But we don't have to be alone tonight

You, you, lalala a you a
If I could see a little light, 
If I could find some piece of mine,
If you just give me a sign
I can see a little ligh, I don't know where you are, maybe
Near or maybe far, I just need a little light
Stay alone in my room, every moment passing too soon,
Watch the candles burn into the night",See a Little Light,2006
Belinda,"Verso 1

Con la noche en la cintura, tu recuerdo a flor de piel 
Voy perdiendo la cordura con la luna hasta los pies, 
Voy tratando de acordarme, pero todo esta al revés 
La vida es un instante, que no nunca vuelve otra vez 
Why entonces te das cuenta, de lo que puedes perder 
La suerte da la vuelta, como un amante infiel 
Mañana no será, lo que pudo ser ayer 
Ya no hay sueños de verdad, si no se tiene fe 
Why quien hay? 
Why quien hay? 

CORO 

Solo un rumor, solo una voz, que me viene a hablar de amor 
No hay nadie más, en mi rincón 
Solo Dios sabe quien soy 
Solo un rumor, solo una voz, que me viene a hablar de amor 
No hay nadie más, en mi rincón 
Solo Dios sabe quien soy 

verso 2

Tu silencio es un reflejo de los sueños del ali 
Why tu nombre es un recuerdo que se olvido de mí 
Mi alma esta en la mente quien me la podrá comprar 
Para que hoy no me mientas, ya no quiero verte más 
Why quien hay? 
Why quien hay? 

CORO 

En mi vida quiero una utopía 
Pero hay silencio envuelto en agonía

Se que te tengo enchulado
Bailame pegado

Llego el momento de bailar

Te conozco
Pero me gustas
Si bailamos pegaos
Bien acaramelados

Te conozco
Pero me gustas
Si bailamos pegados
Con los ojos cerrados

Esta nena tiene tumbado
Y te tiene alborotado

Vente conmigo y no seas tan guillado
Se que te tengo demasiado pillado

Cuando yo te robo
Se enciende la moto
Dale suavemente sin parar

Sigue el movimiento
No pierdas el tiempo
Llego el momento de bailar

Afincado, apretado
Sigue guayando con los ojos cerraos

Afincado, apretado
bajando con los ojos cerraos

Si bailamos pegaos
Bien acaramelados

How can a man let his love go unspoken 

I couldn't stand to see us end up that way
Just another tragedy
And every night I promise another day 

Whatever it takes 
I will be there
By your side baby anywhere
When you're lost and alone
I'll bring you home
I will come through for you
Whatever it takes
Whatever you need
Whatever comes down between you and me
When the road gets rough
You've gotta trust
I will come through for you
Whatever it takes 

I've opened every door
I always wanted more
I didn't have much to believe in
I searched the world for you
I found what's really true
It's your love that gives me a reason 

Baby it's only you who can free my heart
I can't do it on my own
You carry the light of day baby
Through the dark 

Whatever it takes 
I will be there
By your side baby anywhere
When you're lost and alone
I'll bring you home
I will come through for you
Whatever it takes 

Baby I'm bound to you to release my heart
I can't do it on my own
We'll find the light of day baby

Belinda Carlisle,"If there was no sunshine
I could learn to live with the rain
Darling if I had to
I could trade pleasure of pain 

I could live without food or money
Wouldn't be so hart to do
And if the stars fell down from the sky
Baby I would make it through ! 

But in a world without you
Where would I be
Where would I be without you babe
In a world without you
Where would I be
Where would I be without you babe
I could breathe without you babe 

Wouldn't be no music
No reason to laugh, no reason to smile
Couldn't call it living
Without nothing to make the living worthwhile 

You know that it would all seem worthless
If you weren't here with me
I could have the world in my hands

Been running so fast right from the starting line
No more connections I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out and one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses just keep going strong

Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, outta control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

Been running so hard when what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason is one I left so far behind
I waited so long so long to play this part
And just remembered that I'd forgotten about my heart

Can't stop myself, outta control

Take away the borders inside your head
And you'll see other things instead
Realize the life we've led is all over now

So come on and love me

Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down, down
Why'd you want to go
And shoot love to the ground
Lay down your arms
Lay down, down, down down
Lay with me

Sometimes I can be so cold
I let you in but I don't let go
Pulling you, pushing you
Pushing you, pulling

Don't want to tear our love apart
Can we find each other in the dark?
Can we start living here?
Can we start giving?

So, we are in love
So, we are at war
But we can be on the same side
",Lay Down Your Arms,1993
Belinda Carlisle,"Dreams in the night
Dreams overflow
Building bridges to each other
Hearts make the waters flow

Sunlight and diamonds
Reflecting hope
Making journeys to each other
Going where lovers go

You were sleeping, I was walking
To the rhythm of hate falling rain
Too much water, to cross over
All the bridges falling down

You sing me songs
With overtures
From strange exotic places
Words I've never known

Wait 'til the morning
Don't send me back
Don't send me back across the rainbow
No return to where I've been

You were reaching, I was taken
To the river in the light of dawn
Too much water, to cross over
All the bridges falling down

Falling down
Come lie beside me
Lie beside me now
Beneath the waves
Beauty surrounds us",Too Much Water,1993
Belinda Carlisle,"You try to be a mystery
With all your eccentricities
Every move is so surreal
You can't touch what you really feel

I see a deeper side
More than you know
Don't even try to hide
I've been everywhere you go

All I want
Is to wrap my arms around your world
Break away the chains
Set you free
With everything that I can give to you
Wrap my arms around your world

You try to push the truth away
With all your witty repartee
A psychedelic romeo
Who thinks and does it all for show

I see myself in you
I know we're both afraid
There is an emptiness
Behind our masquerade

Is to wrap my arms around your world
All I want

Belinda Carlisle,"The mornin' sun touched lightly
On the eyes of Lucy Jordan
In her white suburban bedroom
In her white suburban town
As she lay there, neath the covers
Dreamin' of a thousand lovers'
'Til the world turned orange
And the room went spinnin' round

At the age of thirty-seven
She realized she'd never ride
Through Paris in a sports car
With the warm wind in her hair
And she let the phone keep ringing
As she sat there softly singin'
Pretty nursery rhymes she'd memorized
In her daddy's easy chair

Her husband he was off to work
And the kids were off to school
And there were on so many ways
For her to spend the day
She could clean the house for hours
Or rearrange the flowers
Or run naked down the shady street
Screamin' all the way

The evenin' sun touched gently on
The eyes of Lucy Jordan
On the rooftop where she climbed
When all the laughter grew too loud
And she bowed and curtsy to the man
Who reached and offered her his hand
And led her down to the long white car
That waited past the crowd",The Ballad of Lucy Jordan,1996

I want to walk away, LA

The swaying palm trees above our heads
Woke up to a primal rumbling sound
When the Northridge quake ripped open the ground

Belinda Carlisle,"Pretty soon you'll be able to remember him
Lying in the garden singing
Right where he'll always be
The door is always open

And this is the place that I loved him
And these are the friends that he had
Long may the mountain ring
To the sounds of his laughter
And he goes on and on

In his soft wind I will whisper
In his warm sun I will glisten
Will we see him once again
In a world without end

We owe it all to Frank Sinatra
The song was playing as he walked into the room
After the long weekend they were a lifetime together

Appearing in the eyes of children
In the clear blue mountain view
The coloring in the sky
And painting ladders to heaven
And he goes on and on

In his soft wind I will whisper
In his warm sun I will glisten
Till we see him once again
In a world without end

In his soft wind I will whisper
In his warm sun I will glisten
And I always will remember
In a world without end

He goes on
He goes on
He goes on

Just as I start to fall apart
You pull me back into your arms

I start to breathe
As I kneel at your feet (All I want to do)
I start to breathe
As I kneel at your feet
You can't see the other side of me

I keep it locked up safe, hide
There's so much deep inside
Like a wild wind screaming through the trees

I start to breathe
As I kneel at your feet (All I want to do)

Belinda Carlisle,"I see you walking with her
I see you all around
But you don't seem very happy now
You seem very down
I know you feel an obligation
To her emotional state of mind
But this is the time of your life baby
And you should be having a good time

And if you want me I'll be there
To run my fingers through your hair
If you need me it's alright
Come on over baby, and see me tonight (you've got to)
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your mind and you will see
You should be with me

You know that I'll be waiting
You know my heart is true
I will be your everything
And give everything to you
So is you want me baby, I'm yours
You don't have to knock, kick down my doors
Rules are made to be broken every day
You got one life to live, so hey (why don't you)
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your heart and you will see
You should be with me, baby
You should be with me

Live your life be free
Live your life be free
And when you free you mind
You will leave your past behind
Live your life be free
Live your life be free
Open up your eyes and you will see

Belinda Carlisle,"Last night
The April breeze was whispering
A hearts confession
That could
Mean so much
Starts to touch my wild suspicion
So close, not far away
A bluer world another way

[Chorus:]
Lavender, tangerine
Hmm baby anything
Life is not what it seems.
Make a wish on a star
Oh you'll go far
Life is only a dream

I find a solitude
In my imagination
Past is past, bring it back
Memories are made too fast
I'm giving in no hesitation

So close to mystery
I close my eyes so I can see

[Chorus:]

And if you think there is an answer
I tell you what I find
A million miles behind the vista.

[Chorus:]",Only a Dream,2004
Belinda Carlisle,"Every child deserves love 
A safe place to run and play 
Every man deserves a chance 
To bring home a decent pay 
Every race is equal
Beloved in God's eyes 
When I see discrimination my soul cries 
Say a prayer for the lonely 
A prayer for the confused 
Say a prayer if you'd only 
For the secretly abused 
Say a prayer for the newborn 
With all the battles to be won 
Say a prayer for the tired and worn 
Say a prayer for everyone 

Walk a mile with a stranger 
Put yourself in his shoes 
Lend a hand to an old one 
Good will come to you 
In our heads were happy 
We go our merry way 
In our hearts were all afraid of our dying day 

Every child deserves love 
A safe place to run and play 
Every woman deserves a chance 
To bring home a decent pay",A Prayer for Everyone,2004
Belinda Carlisle,"Whispering our goodbyes, waiting for a train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain
I can hear him saying ""nothing will change""
Come dance with me baby, in the summer rain

I remember the rain on our skin
And his kisses hotter than the Santa Ana winds
Whispering our goodbyes, waiting for a train
I was dancing with my baby in the summer rain

I remember laughing 'till we almost cried
There at station that night
I remember looking in his eyes

Oh my love, it's you and that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

I can hear the whistle military train
I was dancing with my baby, in the summer rain
I can here him singing ""Ooh, Love Is Strange""
Come dance with me baby, in the summer rain

I remember the rain pouring down
And we poured our hearts out as the train pulled out
I can see my baby waving from the train
It was last time that I saw him in the summer rain

Oh my love, it's you and that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Every time I see the lightning
Every time I hear the thunder
Every time I close the window
When this happens in the summer

Oh, the night is so inviting
I can feel that you are so close
I can feel you when the wind blows
Blows right through my heart

Oh my love, it's you and that I dream of
Oh my love, since that day
Somewhere in my heart I'm always
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Every night and every day now 
Though I know you've gone away 
Somewhere in my heart I'm always 
Dancing with you in the summer rain

Doesn't matter what I do now
Doesn't matter what I say
Somewhere in my heart I'm always",Summer Rain,2004

Tengo tatuado un corazon en el tobillo
Que me recuerda la locura del carino
Por mas que trato de olvidarte
Me enamoro mas de ti
Solo se que pienso en ti a cada instante
Y solo se que necesito encontrarte
Sentirte cerca y abrazarte
Como la primera vez

Te di mi amor sin condicion

Y que algun dia volveras

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Espero que no sea tarde
Y puedas volver a amarme
Verás en mí un cambio radical
Me siento con frío y pánico
Descalza en el suelo ártico
Ten compasión, no me castigues más

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás
En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Quiero saber de mi pecado
Eso que no me has contado
Y tal vez no sea verdad
El amor es arte y ensayo
Y hoy de tus errores yo callo
Cuando se ama hay que perdonar

Entre la sombra que ilumina el sol
Veo el reflejo de nuestro esplendor

Sé que no es el final
Por ti siempre voy a esperar
Sé que algún día tú volverás

En el amor hay que perdonar, sé que algún día tú volverás

Until you've flipped your heart and you have lost,

With a super dope body that I had to get
So I stepped to her
(What did you say, Ron)
I said, ?Yo?, baby, you think we could spend some time together?

?Whatever?s clever,? was what she said
Then the next thing you know she was in my bed
She was doin? me, baby, and I was doin? my duty
She was a helluva cutie
(Why)
Because she had a ghetto booty

Me, Rick and Ron was coolin? at the party
Pushed up on a sexy young hottie
I said to my man, ?Yo?, watch me work?
Looked myself over quick before I started to flirt

I said, ?Yo?, sweetheart, no need for introduction
But by the way, hmm, nice butt?
Let's go chill so I can get to know you better
Her first name was Loretta, she drove up a Baretta

We got to my room, she said, ?What are you gonna do?
?Well, let me slip into something more comfortable like you?
She jumped in the sack, I had my Jim hat strapped
And then I slapped her with a taste of the bowzack

Yo?, Mike, what's up with the super dope hooker named Melinda
Yeah, yo?, Sick what's up with the honey that named Melinda
She got a ghetto booty, I wanna hit it from the center

It?s a booty that's firm, luscious and juicy
Kinda tender like a Roni but sensitive enough to do me
The kinda booty that'll make your day
But you gotta, gotta rub it the right way

Crisp and clean wrapped in tight jeans
Makin? all the fellas up at the club scream
But yo?, it?s dope, so I?mma step to the cutie
And do what I gotta do to get that ghetto booty

This goes out to all the girls across the world
With the fat black do me baby booty backs
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah

We stack so you can spread love like I chose
The lyrical genius with the R&B messiah
And the roof, the roof we sets on fire

But as long as the party is jumpin, we ain't concerned
We don't need no water let the motherfucker burn
And everybody who was somebody was there
With they hands in the air bringing in the new year
Yeah, ah-yo, come on

Baguettes on the wrist, it's just for shine
'Cause ain't nobody checkin' out the time
Cash and clothes for days to blow your mind
Baby it's all good so dance tonight

Trapped for now in faith that death is still alive

In a tear her story moves to find the floor
And she speaks before she goes away

To wake beneath the rain

There once was warmth
Just one word, just one prayer is all I need
To save me from myself

Meet me down at the old cafe
I jumped into the shower
I was getting my marching orders

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime
Say, my place at nine?

She'd never stand for any lies
She's got an Out Tray full of guys
I could sense a breath, a whole new feeling
Now she says she wants to call a meeting

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I want to give you the job
A chance of overtime

I'm only living when I walk amongst the office staff
And catch up with the office wag
I'll be in bed by nine
My curtains drawn
My thoughts composed
I get to work on time

She gave me some dictation
But my strength is in administration
I took down all she said
I even took down her little red dress

We need to talk
Step into my office, baby
I'm want to give you the job
I'm pushing for a raise
I've been pushing now for days

My output is in decline
I was burned out after Thatcher
My banner I laid down with a sigh
Now I doubt if I'll ever catch her

I've got to change my ways
Dress for business every day
A sharp suit and a kipper tie
A big arrow pointing to my fly

Have you shaved for work yet baby
Don't go out the boss is waiting

Step into my office, baby

To think about the things that we have done this year
The dog lies down the pouring rain

It's the color of blood, chaos and corruption of a happy soul
A happy soul will ride in the field
Ride in the field
Ride in the field
Until the rain dies down

But it doesn't mean that we will show
There's a fork upon the line
We'll pay the guard to switch the signs
Off we go

Oh, you care, I know
You care, I know
You care, I know

On a sulky afternoon spent in dispute
You'll give yourself a headache, boy
So I spend the day in stories

It's not as if it's fun
At least not anymore
When your legs are black and blue
It's time to take a break
When your legs are black and blue

It only happens once a lifetime

Play me a song to set me free
Nobody writes them like they used to
So it may as well be me

Here on my own now on a bus

You could either be successful or be us
With our winning smiles, and us
With our catchy tunes, and us
Now we're photogenic
You know, we don't stand a chance
Oh, I'll settle down with some old story
About a boy who's just like me
Thought there was love in everything and everyone
You're so naive!
After a while they always get it
They always reach a sorry end
Still it was worth it as I turned the pages solemnly, and then
With a winning smile, the boy
With naivety succeeds
At the final moment, I cried
I always cry at endings

Oh, that wasn't what I meant to say at all
From where I'm sitting, rain
Washing against the lonely tenement
Has set my mind to wander
Into the windows of my lovers
They never know unless I write

Said the hero in the story
""It is mightier than swords
I could kill you sure
But I could only make you cry with these words""

Belle & Sebastian,"Anthony walked to his death because he thought he'd never feel this way again
If he goes back to the house then things would go from bad to worse, what could he do?
He wants to remember things exactly as he left them on that funny day
And if there is something else beyond, he isn't scared because
It's bound to be less boring than today
It's bound to be less boring than tomorrow

Hilary walked to her death because she couldn't think of anything to say
Everybody thought that she was boring, so they never listened anyway
Nobody was really saying anything of interest, she fell asleep
She was into S&M and bible studies
Not everyone's cup of tea she would admit to me
Her cup of tea, she would admit to no one
Her cup of tea, she would admit to me
Oh but her cup of tea, she would admit to no one

Hilary went to the Catholic Church because she wanted information
The vicar, or whatever, took her to one side and gave her confirmation
Saint Theresa's calling her, the church up on the hill is looking lovely
But it doesn't interest, the only things she wants to know is
How and why and when and where to go
How and why and when and where to follow
How and why and when and where to go
How and why and when and where to follow

But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
He'll try in vain to take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever

When she got back, her spirituality was thrown into confusion
So she got a special deal on renting
From the man at Rediffusion
""Look at me! I'm on TV
It makes up for the shortcomings of being poor
Now I'm in a million pieces"", picked up for deliberation
By the people listening at home
By the people watching on the telly
By the people listening at home
By the people watching on the telly

But if you are feeling sinister
Go off and see a minister
He'll try in vain to take away the pain of being a hopeless unbeliever

Hovering silence from you is a giveaway
Squalor and smoke's not your style
""i don't like this place""
We better go
Then i compare notes with your older sister
I am a lazy get, she is as pure as the cold driven snow
She accepts my confession

What did you learn from your time in the solitary
Cell of your mind?
There was noises, distractions from anything good
And the old prison food
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
Cause anything's better than posh isolation

With the boy from the Arab strap
With the boy from the Arab strap

It's something to speak of the way you are feeling
To crowds there assembled
Do you ever feel you have gone too far?
Everyone suffers in silence a burden
The man who drives minicabs down in old Compton
The Asian man
With his love hate affair
With his racist clientele

A central location for you is a must
As you stagger about making free with your lewd and lascivious boasts
We know you are soft cause we've all seen you dancing
We know you are hard cause we all saw you drinking from noon
Until noon again
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
You're the boy with the Arab strap

Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the cigarette catches
And sets off the smoke alarm
What do you make of the cool set in London?
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks

I'm not the same anymore
How will I hide these feelings inside
Call my girl on the phone
Neon lights shine bright
Taxi cabs glide by
Aeroplanes they fly, high up in the sky
Pretty girl says hi
What's the worst job you've had?
What do you read?
What's driving you mad?

Met the cigarette girl- took a note of her charms
But no cigar
Met the indie-cool queen
Took me out of the bar
And showed me the scene
My little girl I can't find
She's five hours behind
It's the singer not the song
Something's gone wrong
Said the spider to the fly
Do I like this girl?
It's such a big world
1 like the tone of her voice
I loved the sound of her voice

When I get back to London from outer space
Will it fall into place?
I'll hold onto my smile
Find my girl in a while
Look myself in the face
Don't know what you see
Am I playing in your movie?
You're in my magazine
Are you talking to me?

Unlucky, I've got nowhere to go and so I follow my feet

A choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for today
Tomorrow we'll be back in trouble again

Dream one, you had a whole lot of fun with a comedian
Stop short of going all the way, you'll have to make it someday

Why is this happening to you, you're not a child?
Why is this happening? You have too much on your mind

My darling it's the place to be
Take your shoes off curl your toes

The trouble that we've come to know
Will stay with us till we get old
Will stay with us till somebody decides to go
Decides to go

Soberly, without regret, 1 make another sandwich
And I fill my face, 1 know that things have got to you
But what can 1 do?
Suddenly, without a warning
On a pale blue morning
You decide your time is wearing thin
A conscious choice to let yourself go dangling

It's an emergency
There's no more wait and see

Maybe if I shut my eves
Your trouble will be split between us

Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there? 
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours 
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?
I know the truth awaits me
But still I hesitate because of fear

Skipping tickets making rhymes
Is that all that you believe in?
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
Rusting armor for effect
It's not fun to watch the rust grow
For it will all be over when you're dead

Counting acts and clutching thoughts 
By the river where the moss grows 
Over rocks the water running all the time

Even though you could be sick at any time?

I'm telling you I caught the sun
Creeping up behind my shoulder
Another day's begun
I was following a trail
I'd never been along before
Chasing darkened skies above me
Looking like the spring
Like the winter
And the morning

If there's a place I want to go
Then I'll be there with you
Cause in my dreams the things
I'm wishing for
Keep coming true
Now a new day comes
Clears the darkness out of sight
And the shadows that were sleeping
Come and dance beneath the light
And I'm trying hard to hide
Keep the sun out of my eyes
Close them tight
And now I'm waiting for the moon to rise

Don't try to say to me
That this was never meant to be
Cause the days are long where I come from
The next few days I'm free
There's a train I want to catch
But it won't leave here for a while
Till darkness fills the eastern sky
And streetlights stretch for miles
Through the spring
And the winter and the morning",Waiting for the Moon to Rise,2000

I don't care if I'm alone here singing songs to myself

Meet you up at the Indian part of the town

Their kids so there's not a sound a sound
But I must get from there to here
There's a small voice crying on the other side of the river from here

It's too late to phone her now
What went wrong, your grades were good
It would take a left wing Robin Hood to pay for school
Your dad's a boozer and you keep him alive

The river looks so good tonight
I don't know what's with your friend

She met a boy and at the summer's end
She said she'd had enough of playing games
I don't care cause I'm by myself
All the dancers left but I can't dance

So I will stay and clean the mess they left behind
But I dream as I set to scrub all the floors, the walls
I'm thinking of a song or two, a boy a girl a rendezvous
Are you coming or are you not?

There is nothing that would sort you out
There's nothing I could say or do

Belle & Sebastian,"We were sitting in the living room on the sofa
The wrong way round, looking out the window.
It was quiet, and then in the car park across the road we saw Elvis  
""Look, there, beside the postman's van""
And he was walking round the postman's van,

Looking in the open door.
He looked as if he was thinking about getting in,
But then the postman came back,
And he swaggered off, walked past the window
And down the stairs,
And then at the bottom of the stairs right by the caretaker's office,
He started licking the pavement.

Every night now since we moved into that new house
There's this noise outside the door
At just about half seven or eight o'clock every night.
And if we go and look outside the door,

Elvis'll be standing there waiting to be let in.
And then he wanders into the living room
Maybe sits down on one of the chairs or even lies down on the floor.
He doesn't say much, he just stays there for an hour or two,

Watching the TV.
We talk to him a bit, and then around ten o'clock he'll go away again,
And not come back until the next night.
There's a lot of lanes and stuff around here, around the house.

Although it's right in the middle of the city it seems quite like the country,
It's dead hidden, safe I suppose,
Made for night living.
There's a lot of squirrels and birds,

And Stuart says he's seen about nine foxes there
When he's jumping over the fence on his way to Prior's road.
Sometimes you can go out walking,
And when you've been out for a wee while

Even you don't know where you are anymore,
So it would be pretty hard for anyone else to find you.
I suppose that's why he spends so much here,
That's why he's come to live here,

Or maybe it's just the squirrels.
I read about somewhere that he likes squirrels quite a lot.

There's these two videos that we got for wedding presents
Called the E-files, the E-files one and E-files two,
About how Elvis is supposed to be still alive.
And one time when he came round we were watching one of those,

But he didn't say anything, he just sat on the armchair.
He was playing with his collar a bit,
And we watched it all through,
And then when it finished he just got up
And walked off into the mist and didn't say anything.

The first few times he came round I didn't speak to him at all.
I wasn't really sure what to say. 
And Karen spoke to him quite a lot -
She seemed to know what to do more than I do.

He had quite a strange manner,
He'd just go into your stuff and look through it,
Then he'd maybe pick something up and play with it for a wee while,
But he'd never make any comment about any of it.

Seemed pretty rude to me.
I just watched whatever Karen did,
And listened to how she talked to him,
And then after a while I started to copy that

And tell him a few things,
Not really bothered about whether he responded or said anything back or not.

I think the first time I spoke to him we were sitting up on the mezzanine
And I said that I would tell him about me and wee Karen,
And how it was that we'd come to be living here.
I thought he probably liked the fact that we were living here

Because he came round so much,
So I thought he might want to know how it was that it came about.

We did it all over backwards, I told him.
First of all we got to know each other,
And then a while after that we met,
And when we'd known each other for about seven years

We decided to have an anniversary, and that went quite well,
So after the anniversary we had a honeymoon, and that went well too.
So after that we decided that we would get married,
And that's why we're living here now.

I was happy for a day in 1975
I was puzzled by a dream
It stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day.

Got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches
From my crippled friend
She was not impressed
Cause I cured her on the Sabbath
I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whiskey and gin
To whiskey and gin.

The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel
Called The State That I'm In
So I gave myself to God
There was a pregnant pause before he said okay
Now I spend my days turning tables round in Marks & Spencer
They don't seem to mind.

Myself to providence and I've
Been there and back again

Why don't you lead me to a living end

Takes a second to think what to do
He's out of his seat and he's starting to speak

Honor forbids me, but honor be damned
You have whined till you got what you want
I did the working when things were going badly
You left us to rot

He locked the door of the boardroom
And turned like the scene from the old country song
Towering over the table he's lost
He is drunk with it all

When we'd rescued your arse from the fire
Your contribution to all that we did
Was to say it was dire

Just please leave me alone

And spare your tears for yourself

Warm in the woods that conceal him from light

Taking his time as he crosses the bridge
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
Walking in shadows to his senorita

Safe in the dawn he gets under the sheets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
That was put there to save and protect him

He knows that time can not endlessly go
Traps will be set by the people below
She will be caught too and he could not bear it

Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
He says his prayers and God listens to him

How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?

A trail for the devil to erase

San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?

We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may

I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you, my responsibility has found a place beside you
And strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
""You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job""
Maybe, but not what she deserves

Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway

Life outside the diamond is a wrench

I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day

Sends him hurtling back to the mirror of all his teenager thoughts and fears
He passes big houses and family cars they saddled the horses in cobblestone yards
He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years

Perpetual feeling in the grown up world that's all around him
That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy
And ""Oh to be dumb, Oh to be smart""

Belle & Sebastian,"It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you're far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don't know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind

Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
But I never want to leave you
We've never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths that I could follow
I'd write the ending without any sorrow

I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I will wrap my hands around you
I know it will be fine
We've got a fantasy affair
We didn't get wet, we didn't dare
Our aspirations, are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks

Summer's hastening on
I'm trying to get a feeling from the city

Belle & Sebastian,"""So how do we know each other?
And how do you have my number?
Well why don't you guide me
You be the driver""

Say what you want and leave your shyness home
And you should do what you want and write a little poem
Leave it for her and live another day
And you should leave it for her, the girl around the way

Write down a list of things you wanna do
And then you leave it in work because you wanna live a little
Pick up the girl in someone's borrowed Mini
Take her to dinner, use her boyfriend's money

Hey lady, put the phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I wanna see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown

Planning a freak is such a tricky thing
Because you move through the country, she comes back again
And then you move through the city, but she goes abroad
Is she telling you something, is she getting bored?

I make a rough plan to sleep around a minaret
I need a change, I'm a lazy rat if I am honest
But my bold change of tact will fade out with the summer
I've got no appetite and all the girls are bummers

My baby doesn't look at me the way I want her to look
She doesn't comprehend
My baby's got it going on
She's got a friend in every street in this town

I want to go out but there's nobody home-
I'll go on my own

Thus starts the lonely walking
There's always too much talking
I, I, I should have stayed home
She starts her cold caressing
The kid she starts undressing
I, I, I should have stayed home
The DJ's picking up speed
That's something I just don't need
I, I, I should have stayed home
The gossip's bearing down on me
The kids are pairing up in front of me
I should have stayed home
I should have stayed home
I think I'll go home

Listen lady, put your phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I need to see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it

Listen lady, leave your phone down
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it
Your cover's blown, I need to see you alone
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to cool it

Hey lady, meet my mom and dad
You're a strange operation in this land of potted plants
And funslide houses where the girls like mouses
Breathe a long sigh of resignation
You resign yourself to keep on growing
Like the seeds you're sowing
For a strange operation in this land of grammar schools
And galloped days, the lady's set in her way
Behind a long conversation from a kid named Stole
He's a little slow but in your favour it shows
Cancel all operations, tell your friends to move out to the sticks

Listen lady, leave the boy home
Cancel all operations, tell your friends there's more to you than this",Your Cover's Blown,2004

But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret

You could tell me all your secrets
All you ever do is run and hide
You can keep it inside
If you tell me all your secrets
All I have to do is let it ride
I can keep it inside
But if it's as it seems, and I keep having dreams
About the two of us, then it's obvious
You should stop treating me like I was just a child
You should start treating me like I was just the same as you

To step out of your cradle is like coming down
I just had somebody tell me I was introspective to a fault
I'll be a dozer if I can
But I will contented be right now if we could keep our secret

We could be a little closer
The mystery you're trying to preserve
You don't need in reserve
We should be a little closer
Intimacy has the greater charm
And it would do no harm
To give a little way, oh, please stop holding away
You could even read me your poetry
If you would stop treating me like I was just a child
You should start realising that I'm just as wild as you
Stop treating me like I was just a child",Your Secrets,2004

It's the color of blood, chaos and corruption of a happy soul
A happy soul will ride in the field
Ride in the field
Ride in the field
Until the rain dies down

But it doesn't mean that we will show
There's a fork upon the line

There was no flicker

So she hit me back

He catches the moon looking down from the stars
Just like it's done for years and years

That there's secrets that could be revealed with knowledge and philosophy

I'd stay in a melody
I would float along in my everlasting song

She is slowing everybody down

Belle & Sebastian,"I'm bored out my mind
Too sick to even care
I'll take a little walk
Nobody's going to know
I'm in senior year
It gives you a little free time
I'll just use it all at once!

Took the fence and the lane
The bus then the train
Bought an 'Independent' to make me look like I got brains
I made a story up in my head if anybody would ask
I'm going to a seminar!

I'm a genius
A prodigy
A demon at Maths and Science
I'm up for a prize
If you gotta grow up sometime
You've to do it on your own
I don't think I could stand to be stuck
That's the way that things were going

The bible's my tool
There's no mention of school!
My Damascan Road's my transistor radio
I tune in at night when my mum and my dad start to fight
I put on my headphones
And I tune out
I am devout
The girls are singing about my life
But they're not here, they've got the wild life

If you want to find out, find out
You got to look them in the eye
That's why my only choice
Is find the face behind the voice?.

She asked the man if the service was open
Not today, just the choir from the radio
Couldn't I sit in? I've come all this way
Will you bugger off, I've got work to do.

The city was losing its appeal
God was asleep
He was back in her village, in the fields

Belle & Sebastian,"Another sunny day, I met you up in the garden
You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon
I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous border
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees

Another rainy day, we're trapped inside with a train set
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
You've got the attic window looking out on the cathedral 
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk 

Another day in June, we'll pick eleven for football
We're playing for our lives the referee gives us fuck all
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds

Everybody's gone you picked me up for a long drive
We take the tourist route the nights are light until midnight
We took the evening ferry over to the peninsula
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
That crazy avenue of trees, I'm living there still

There's something in my eye a little midge so beguiling
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn't complain
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again

'The lovin is a mess what happened to all of the feeling'
I thought it was for real; babies, rings and fools kneeling
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart",Another Sunny Day,2006
Belle & Sebastian,"Look at the kid from school
He's teaching mamas and papas how to be a little cool
He's changing fashion, the way he dress
The tracksuits are old, and the hoody's way too moody
For a kid with the will to funk
He dances in secret; he's a part-time punk

She's getting off the plane
She wants to write a thesis on the population underprivileged
The kids fighting up the lane
Shop lifting, just drifting

If the malady don't go away we're in a little trouble
With the boss of the company
I'm a singer, a swinger I'm a layabout but laying on

Will never quite relegate me to a bum

I've been creeping round this town because?
Well, creeping's just my way
But with a little wink I'll be there
I'll be excited for a week, but then excitement starts to fade
I know your young, but you're out of touch
You're French, your vocabulary's not quite formed

I left my homework in the launderette
I got a letter from my mamma which my stupid dog has ate
I hid behind the fence
Here comes the deputy head with the bark of a bulldog
He's not making much sense

Belle & Sebastian,"Sukie was the kid, she liked to hangout in the graveyard
She did brass rubbings, she learned you never had to press hard
When she finished hanging out she was all alone
She decided that she better check in at home
There was an awful row between her mum and dad
They said she hadn't done this, she hadn't done that
If she wanted to remain inside the family home
She'd have to tow the line, she'd have to give it a go
It didn't suit Sukie
So she took her things and left

Sukie was the kid, she liked to hang out at the art school
She didn't enrol, but she wiped the floor with all the arseholes
She took a bijou flat with the fraternity cat
She hid inside the attic of the sculpture building
She had a slut slave and his name was Dave
She said 'Be my photo bitch and I'll make you rich'
He didn't believe her but the boy revered her
He got her meals and he got her a bed
He watched behind the screen and she started to undress
He never got far
Just lookin' and playing guitar

Autumn hanging down all the trees are draped like chandeliers
Sukie saw the beauty but she wasn't wet behind the ears
She had an A1 body and a face to match
She didn't have money, she didn't have cash
With the winter coming on, and the attic cold
She had to press her nose on the refectory wall
They served steamed puddings she went without
She had to pose for life for all the scholars of art
She didn't feel funny, she didn't feel bad
Peeling away everything she had
She had the grace of an eel, sleek and stark
As the shadows played tricks on the girl in the dark

People look at us and they think were doing fine
People look at us cause they see us all the time
All the time
But they never take to us

How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
A trail for the devil to erase

San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may
I love you

I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you, my responsibility has found a place beside you
And strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
""You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job""
Maybe, but not what she deserves

Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare

The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench

I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day

Maybe we'll get some bowling and drinking in
And looking at the sky

Pretend that you despise it
Why does your lazy eye rest on his skin
His arm, and his wallet too?

Take a look around you
The spring has sent the sound of rain upon your windowsill
So grab your coat and play a song for me

Don't think that I've forgotten
We've grown up, but I know the reason
I want to curl up in your room

That's why we're on the late shift
JP at Maida Vale
I've got my clothes dry-cleaned
To commemorate the day

Take a look around you

So grab your coat and play a song for me

And now my legs are weak,
But if I hear my baby speak then I'll start running

If I could be a song
I would be something that would snake into your room
And be with you the whole night long",(My Girl's Got) Miraculous Technique,2008

Because you made me think about the times
You turn the picture on to me and I'll turn over
The vision was a masterpiece of comic timing

But you wouldn't laugh at all
And I wonder what the boy was thinking
The picture was an old collage of something classical
The model with a tragic air

Because without a doubt he'd given up the fight
The ghost of somebody at his side
I will confess to you
Because I didn't think about the message

As I walked down the alleyway it was a Sunday
And all my friends deserted me because you painted me
As the fraud I really was
And if you think you see with just your eyes you're mad

When she knew she had been bad
She met another blind kid at a fancy dress
It was the best sex she ever had

But I was so embarressed when I missed your party
It was me that paid for it eventually

Because you know how much I wanted
To meet your friend the star of stage and local press
The dream of all the bowlie boys that hang around here
And I'm no different from the rest

I'm not too proud to say that I'm okay with
The girl next door who's famous for showing her breasts
You're not impressed by me
But it's a funny way for you to tell me

The man was talking about you simultaneously
Frankly, I let my heavy eyelids flutter
Because I have been sleeping badly lately

But I know I'd rather drag myself across the dance floor

Where no one knows me, and where I
Can cause offence just by the way I look
And when I come to blows
When I am numbering my foes

Just hope that you are on my side my dear

He knows his lover lies south in the city
Passing along and as sleepy as night
Warm in the woods that conceal him from light
He is accustomed to hiding from people

Taking his time as he crosse the bridge
Holding the flowers he picked from the ridge
Walking in shadows to his senorita

Safe in the dawn he gest under the sheets
His Senorita a heavenly sweet soul
That was put there to save and protect him

He knows that time can not endlessly go
Traps will be set by the people below
She will be caught too and he could not bear it

Hope in the freedom he can almost touch
Folk take for granted as they walk to church
He says his prayers and God listens to him

Travel south until your skin turns brown
Put a language in your head and get on a train
And then come back to the one you love

Yeah you're great, you're just part, of this lifetime of dreaming
That extends to the heart of this long summer feeling
Quiet night, you see the TV's glowing
Quiet night, you hear the walls are awake

Me and you are getting out of the party crowd
Can I see what's underneath your bed?
Can I stay until the milkman's working?
Can I stay until the cafe awakes?

Do you hate me in the light?
Did you get a fright?

Belle & Sebastian,"Born on a Sunday, everyday is Monday
That is what I've heard about the real world
Up on the morning,
Heading for the schoolyard
Big boys being bullies make it so hard

It's a lesson for the real world
Seems so far away the real world

Up to the bigger school
Trying not to be fool
Hear I am new shoes and cagoule
Look I'm getting closer to the real world
(""Tell me where the girls are?"")

Thinking about happiness
Thinking about Tara
Thinking about sorrow
Thinking about Sara
Sorrow and Sara are the very same word

In my young life I get so hurt
Will I make it in the real world?

Gluing up my Airfix kit
Cigarettes after gym
Had a pint of Special Brew
Won't do that again

Train for examination, got me traction.
Mickey mouse college course,
Looking for action
Play guitar, stacking shelves
Holding back in the real world

Now it's Monday morning,
I'm still yawning
Scuffing down the city street
Heading for the clock on
Bought a Daily Record like a real man

Well I made it to the real world
But I'm not living in the real world",I'm Not Living in the Real World,2010

How I knew it mattered
To a certain person
Heard the boy in London
Called out from the crowd

Said something that I could tell me 10 years later
Wishing that he still called like he called that night

Pulling songs from bridges
Smell the air in small town

She talks like talking from a book

But I need a friend and I choose you
I tell you the way I feel
The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will too

Tell me tales of punk rockin' girls

But I mostly blame my age
Please make allowances for me
I do not see

It's a drag that you're getting old
I love to think about the year
When we sobbed and then we cheered
The town deserted like a film
The sun was baking dust for fun
Trees were withering by the day
Your torso crushing me
Into the country and the tunnels and the fields

The truth is crushing like a heel
I will forget the kiss and feel if you will do

And on the balcony she quakes
And she is waiting for the sign
And when the brother does not come
And when the sister's much to you, she chooses you",Down and Dusky Blonde,2014

Now I am immune to his enchantment
He came in on a winter tide
He blew away, he took a warmer current

You can hold me back, you can give me a list of complaints
You suggest I find somebody for a remedy
But there's nothing so wrong with me

You leave the room
Suddenly the air is clear

Spirit, spirit speak to me
I'm looking for a voice to guide me
'Cause I can feel your energy
Reveal yourself if you're beside me

Reveal every sleight of hand
And show me what the fates decided
I made a world on shifting sand
We came apart, our worlds collided

If I can do it once, I can do it again
In orbit round the same star til we fly apart
Feeling blue, and I'll do it again
In orbit round the same star til we fall apart",The Same Star,2018

What do you
Want of me?
What do you
Want of me?
I am hiding in the city
Dressed in red
Walking in the dead of night looking for an answer
(Answer me)

I have said
I believe
Though my greatest friend, the gift of song is here
The gift is not enough tonight
I fear I breathe
Slowly slowly what do I believe?
Is it strong enough?

Let me love (let me love)
Show me the sun (show me the sun)
'Cause my mind is moving at the speed of light
I know you place the jewel of love, your heart
In the middle of us all to fight it out
And we do it
We're waking up to that belief
And you will be saved

Wicked you (wicked you)
Wicked me (wicked me)
We are lost amongst the dreaming fields of pain
Praying on our ever-bended knees
That you'd dip your cooling finger in the well, and you touch us
I wanna be with Lazarus, I'm on the side of the weak
(Side of the weak)
(Side of the weak)

What I choose to do with my time
Is a gift
I threw in your face
A hangover of youth, but the plain bloody truth
You suffer a while before ladders of gold set you free

Na na na na na na, na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na 

So I come (so I come)
Broke the seal (broke the seal)
Broke the faith of every deal I ever made
Did the obvious, the weakest thing I could
And your mother and your beauty run to you
Let me foster my intentions to be wise
And to love you

Belle & Sebastian,"Here we are just trying to be flatmates
Here we are just trying to sophisticate
Be an adult, trying not to fall in love
Be a human, trying not to stand up

Here we are just trying to be neighbors
You in bed, me still with the painters
Smoking at the window, at the magpies
Trying to work out what's the truth and what's the lie

I'm not saying that we will be best friends
But I took you dancing at the weekend
Tell your folks in bed you had to play
I'll try to make you feel like the kids are playing pretend

I'm not saying that we can't be running mates
You run too fast for me, I try to keep the pace
What I lack in speed I make up for in the way I move my hips
And the way the sun comes out when I move my lips

So you won't want to miss
All the shapes that can make
It's a choice you want to take

Here we are just trying to be
Oh, here we are just trying not to
Fall in love
It's only human not to want to be alone

Here we are just trying to be
Oh, here we are just trying not to
Get too close

Come on rant to me
I'll be your lock and fold
Tell me all your dirt
I'll never tell a soul
Tell me over steam and mac 'n cheese
Hold the tray above your knees
We can listen to the radio

I'm not saying I will kick you downright
Stick with me and oh we end up bein' like
There are other ways to feel you out
I can look into your soul
I can feed you all the love

I've been savin' up
Oh, and don't let me run
I'm a-digging my way in
I just like the game you're playing

Here we are just trying to be
Oh, here we are just trying not to
Fall in love
It's only human not to want to be alone

Here we are just trying to be
Oh, here we are just trying not to
Get too close

I'm not saying that we can't be dreamers
Here we are just trying to be neighbors

Belle & Sebastian,"Please don't be afraid
There's someone watching over you
Watching in the realm of sleep
The play is acted out when no one wins

All our intuition calls for you
We're looking through her glass
But the date will come

When I see you face to face
Lonely as a picture
Hung in an abandoned room
You fall back on the love inside
Please let your love be known
Or it will die

Aching with the pain of I wish I had
There's no such thing as fate
There is no such thing as doom
Or suicide

All I ever wanted, to sit and talk to you
Drive around in your car, I'll be the passenger
Take me from this suffocating day
Take me from this world of fading grey

Leaving on the sunshine
On the only distant day

Mail it to my greatest friend
Be comforting to know
I need you Lord

Now the days have left me feeling pain
Hurt me and I feel it might kill
Discard disco
And it don't get old

All I ever wanted has come too late for me
I am not an idea, I'm not a melody (Uh)
You had a chance to have it all
Oh, what never happens hurts us always

Caution always makes the fall
It only makes the war
Wisdom is a mind at ease
And if I am clever 'nough
I do, I cry
Tears for days of our infirmity
Tears for beauty gives you a reason not to jump
From the highest bridge

Belle & Sebastian,"Poor boy, I could never live up to your imagination
Poor boy, I was a crush that killed
Poor boy, I could never live up to your hallucination
Poor boy, I was a crush that killed

I had a dream
That trouble always starts in someone's head
And dreams are real
When you're asleep you may as well be dead
I predicate
The last ten years on figuring with me
After the war
In some strange city on a strangers

So you think I'd waste my life on this
To be your comfort when you needed me
Lay the everlasting friendship

Poor boy, I could never live up to your imagination
Poor boy, I was a crush that killed
Poor boy, I could never live up to your hallucination
Poor boy, I was a crush that killed

We had a time
If we could have it back over again
I'd be a force
Not so polite and not so delicate
I'd trot around
On velvet socks so I could not be felt
I was your fan
Waiting for the day when this God will start to

Talk to me, don't venerate me now
I'm not a garland head have to be adored
See my heart beat, smell my sweet skin

Poor boy, I could never live up to your imagination
Poor boy, I was a crush that killed
Poor boy, I could never live up to your hallucination
Poor boy, I was a crush that killed

If I carry you in my heart
Will you ease the pain or make it harder
I know you like to let me know you're there
And if you're blind, God's calling, we disappear

Is there space in my life for you
Will I see you tomorrow
Or will I ride on

Poor boy, I could never live up to your imagination

Belle & Sebastian,"There is an everlasting song on my lips
I got up early so I don't let that song slip
And mighty is the voice I'm singing with
It beats out all the dread
Defeats the hours of darkness

There is an everlasting promise to be made
My ink is wet, there is no paper could contain
The depth of feeling that I pledge to you
Solemn as the sea, solemn as the sea

There is an everlasting morning near the sun
It burns a hole in my heart, makes me want to run
And I would run all day if they give me the choice
I hear your voice, I hear your voice
I hear your voice

There is an everlasting gladness of the heart
The stranger looks at me and loves me as I am
One day I stand upon the river's scared shore
And feel the sun, I'll feel the sun

There is an everlasting sadness all around
It's bigger than the news, from this you cannot run
A woman's magazine, a column in the mail
Can't help you now, can't help you now

I love the summer birds, they sing no word of lie (I love the summer birds they sing)
The air is cruel the frost will catch them as they fly (the air is cruel the frost will catch them as they fly)
But glorious the sun returns to wake the year
They show no fear, they show no fear
They show no fear",There Is an Everlasting Song,2018
Belle & Sebastian,"I picked the right one
You picked the wrong one
Days of confessing
Nights spent obsessing

Recently I've been walking home
And take the long way through the rain
Sit in the cafe, the cinema
I watch the people making out

I'm lost, I know it, I'm waiting for
Some kind of message, some kind of break
They say good things happen if you wait
I get the river of tears to cross

I once was a butterfly
Me and him were the golden guy
You wanna be with a lot of fun
Can you believe it all went wrong?

I picked the right one
You picked the wrong one
Days of confessing
Nights spent obsessing

Woo!

Where did all the people go? (Where did they go?)
'Cause when you break that's when you know 
Who's on your side and who's with him
And all the rubbish that's in between

I didn't mean to make me cry
You took the love and let it die
There's a place where love remains
I'm gonna find it and there I'll stay
There I'm gonna stay

The little dried up streams on my face are painting a horror show
Just between myself and the mirror I am a lonely soul

Oh but I try to overcome
Oh and I'm feeling numb
I listen to my friends' advice
But it all falls flat

When I finally see her with him
That's when I know
Oh, I should let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

I need something to make this right (makin' it right)
I'm out of faith, I'm out of life
I join a lonely heart's girl band (banging the drum)
Banging the drum for a different guy

We'll listen to me wanna die
This kinda thing's just not my bag
They wanted me to be a king
They brought me up to fight and win",Too Many Tears,2018

And it's a hard winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
It must have been love but it's over now
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows

It must have been love but it's over now
It must have been good but I lost it somehow
It must have been love but it's over now
From the moment we touched â??til the time had run out

Belle Perez,"On the beach with all my friends
Just singin' dancin'
Watchin' all the chicos
walkin' by someone yelled
Party here tonight
When I turned
Someone was standing 
There before me
He had brown skin and jet black hair
And he asked would I be here tonight

With a smile I looked straight at him
And I could feel his latin melody
When he spoke I heard the rhythm 
Of a spanish guitar
He touched my had I felt so free
And then he said these words to me

Refrain:
Venga mamacita
I don't know why girl you 
Make me high I can't lie
Latina girl lookin' shy 
Venga mamacita
I can't deny 
In your big brown eyes
I want to die 
Latina girl with me tonight
Venga mamacita

Party people dancin' inÂ  the heat
Merenge Salsa
He said Mamacita won't you groove
With me c'mon and feel this 
Latin breeze
And we're dancin' barefoot
In the sand sexy Rumba
The waves that roll into the shore
Makes him want me more and more

And all the passion that' inside him
Gives our hearts just one beat
The scent of my perfume
Is makin' him high
He said there's no place else he'd be
And then he said these words to me

""Take me in oh tender woman

And then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk

She found that pretty snake she'd taking in had been revived
""Take me in, oh tender woman 
Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in oh tender woman,"" sighed the snake

Now she clutched him to her bosom, ""You're so beautiful,"" she cried
""But if I hadn't brought you in by now you might have died""
Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight 
But instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite

Take me in, for heaven's sake
Take me in oh tender woman,"" sighed the snake

""I saved you,"" cried that woman
""And you've bit me even, why?

Cupid by the hour sends Valentines to my sweet lover and me.

a wishing well of butterfly tears.
Wish me love a wishing well to kiss and tell.
A wishing well of crocodile tears sing.

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do right beside a riverboat gambler.
Erotic images float through my head; I wanna be your midnight rambler.
Quickly, but quickly the blood races through me veins.
Quickly, loudly I wanna hear those sugar bells ring.

(I can make you want me back again)

Let me break it down
It's not that complicated
I know I've done you wrong
But I can make it right

I was lost and insecure
You might say careless with your heart
I made you cry, now let me try
Dry your tears
Oh let me stay a little longer

I,... I can make you fall in love again
I can make you want me back again and then
Maybe you'll forgive me baby I,...
I can make you give your heart again
Take another chance to trust me and then
I can make you fall in love again

Now don't be so defensive
To get this thing to work
I need to reach your heart

Cause I gotta make you see
That you mean the world to me
That we're still okay, that we're far away
From falling down
So let me stay a little longer

I,... I can make you fall in love again
I can make you want me back again and then
Maybe you'll forgive me baby I,...
I can make you give your heart again
Take another chance to trust me and then
I can make you fall in love again

You're lost and undecided
Only love can pull you through
Have a change of heart
Don't fight it any longer
Let it be a brand new start

I can make you fall in love again
I can make you want me back again

Baby, I,... 

I can make you fall in love again
Want me back again
(Maybe you'll forgive me)
I can make you give your heart again
Trusting me again

Baby, I,... 

I can make you fall in love again
I can make you want me back again and then
Maybe you'll forgive me baby I,...

I could feel inside
Desire
You came up and you smiled
You said you'd stay awhile
I'm on fire
Have I been on your mind?
Will you love me all the time?
While we're together
If you want to be with me
That's the way it's gotta be
Baby, surrender

I heard when a guy really loves a girl
He'd run around the world chasing her
But what you guys don't realise
Is that we're chasing you in reverse
So if you're wanting me
Baby try a bended knee
Cause...

[Chorus]
You look just like a dream come true
I'm so glad that I'm with you
Don't act like you know what we should do
Bet i could show you a thing or two
So if your wanting me
Baby nothing comes for free

Why I'm sitting here waiting for you to call?

Going round and around in my head

Things got out of hand
I thought you'd understand
When words don't say enough

I meant to do

Grow silent
In a world where no one cares
Love keep slipping away
Some say time
Is the healer
But in a house where no one speaks
Love keep slipping away

Why do we fight when we know it's all wrong
Why do we play that same old song
Is it just because
We're lonely

Day's with out you by my side
They run together
Like stormy weather
In the Summertime
And I don't have to tell you how it feels
To wake up in the night without you here
So wrap your arms around me
Show you how you miss me
Say you know how I feel
Stay a little longer
Move a little closer
Stay until you forget to leave
Don't think my heart could take it
Every time you go and break it

When goodbye is too hard to say...
Stay
You don't have to look into my eyes
To know how I feel tonight
Smiling on the outside
Dying on the inside
To keep you here
You don't have to say another word
You should know your thoughts can be heard
Yeah, every time you kiss me
I know you really want me

That don't bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out

I'm not afraid to cry
Every once in a while
Even though going on with you gone still upsets me
There are days
Every now and again
I pretend I'm ok but that's not what gets me

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
Not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do

It's hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I'm doing it
It's hard to force that smile when I see your old friends and I'm alone

Still harder
Getting up, getting dressed
Dealing with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade
Give away
All the words that I say
Through my heart that I left unspoken

What hurts the most
Was being so close
And having so much to say
And watching you walk away
And never knowing
What could have been
Not seeing that love in you
Is what I was trying to do

Is what I was trying to do
Oh wow oh wow

I got my maple syrup, everything but you

I break the yolks, make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off the mirror

If I had you on the line
Same old stort, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on

I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick up a book, turn the sheets down
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my p.j's and hop into bed

I just shouldn't think anymore tonight

Bellowhead,"In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sings
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
While the river-bank weeps to the old willow tree

In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
Full of beer, full of cries, in a drunken down fight
But in the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who's born
On a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light

In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and -tails
And he'll show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
That can drink down the moon, that can haul up the sails

And he turns to the cook, with his arms open wide
""Bring me more fish, put it down by my side""
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
So he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly

In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance
Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey-voice croaks
Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes

And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust
Til the rancid sound of the accordion bursts
And it's into the night with their pride in their pants
And the slut that they tow underneath the streetlamps

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks
And he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men

They have bargained their bodies, their virtues all gone
For a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on
He puts his nose in the air, and he wipes it up above
And he pisses like I cry for an unfaithful love

Bellowhead,"The Earl of Rosslyn's daughter walked through the woods alone
When by came Captain Wedderburn, a servant of the king
He said unto his servant-man, ""Were it not against the law
""I'd take her into my own bed, and lie her next to the wall""

So he jumped off his milk-white steed, and he set the lady on
And all the way he walked on foot, and he held her by the hand
He held her by the middle of the waist, for fear that she could fall
Before they'd lie in one bed, and she'd lie next to the wall

""But,"" said the pretty lady, ""before you me perplex
""It's you must answer questions yet, and that is questions six
""It's questions six you must tell me, and that is three times twa
""Before I'll lie in your bed at either stock or wall""

""Oh what is greener than the grass? What is higher than the trees?
""Oh what is worse than woman's voice? What is deeper than the seas?
""What was the first bird that did crow? And what did first down fall?
""Before I'll lie in your bed at either stock or wall""

""Oh envy's greener than the grass, and is higher than the trees
""The devil is worse than woman's voice, hell is deeper than the seas.
""The cock is the first bird that did crow, and the dew did first down fall
""So we'll both lie in one bed, and you'll lie next to the wall""

Oh little did that lady think that morning when she rose
That this would be the very last of all her maiden days
And in the cottage where they lived, they're the happiest pair of all
And they both lie in one bed, and she lies next to the wall",Captain Wedderburn,2010

Cold blow the drops of rain

And in Greenwood he lies slain

As any young girl may
I'll sit and weep down by his grave
For twelve months and a day

But when twelve months they were up and gone
This young man, he arose
What makes you sit by my grave and weep?
I can't take my repose

One kiss, one kiss from your lily-white lips
One kiss is all I crave
One kiss, one kiss from your lily-white lips
Then return back to your grave

These lips, they are as cold as clay
My breath is heavy and strong
If you were to kiss these lily-white lips
Your life would not be long

Oh don't you remember the garden grove
Where once we used to walk
Go pick the finest flower of the morn
It will wither to a stalk

Go fetch me a flower from the dungeon deep
Bring water from a stone
Bring white milk from a virgin's breast
That baby never bore none

Go dig me a grave both wide and deep

That I may lay down and take a long sleep

She asked me back to see her place; she lived on Barrack Street

And when we got to Barrack Street, we stopped at forty-four
Her mother and her sister were waiting at the door

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

And when I got inside the house, the drinks were passed around
The liquor was so awful strong, my head went round and round
And then we had another drink before we sat to eat
The liquor was so awful strong, I quickly fell asleep

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

When I awoke next morning, I had an aching head
And there was I Jack all alone, stark naked in me bed
My gold watch and my money and my lady friend were gone
And there was I Jack all alone, stark naked in the room

And away, Santy, my dear Annie
Oh you New York girls, can't you dance the polka?

Oh looking round that little room, there's nothing I could see
But a woman's shift and apron that were no use to me
With a barrel for a suit of clothes, down Cherry Street forlorn
Where Martin Churchill took me in and he sent me round Cape Horn

You'll have to get up early to be smarter than a whore

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone.
It's not unusual to have fun with anyone,
But when I see you hanging around with anyone,
It's not unusual to see me cry.
Oh, I wanna die.
It's not unusual to go out at anytime,
But when I see you out and about,
It's such a crime.
If you should ever wanna be loved by anyone,
It's not unusual.
It happens everyday,
No matter what you say,
You find it happens all the time.
Love will never do what you want it to.
Why can't this crazy love be mine?
It's not unusual to be mad with anyone.
It's not unusual to be sad with anyone,
But if I ever found that you'd change at anytime,
It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you.

Belly,"She wears her dress high
As high as she pulls her hat down low
She's seeking out the places those other people can't go
And hold her
And touched by the sea
She's walking on water when she walks in her sleep
She's dragging me through places I didn't want to be seen

She's a liar
As I am a thief
Because of you I came
Because of you I leave

I want to know
I want to know why the monsters that hurt you so
Don't look like those things that we battled so long ago
And I thought I did my part when I pulled you out of there
That night you left bruise marks on my wall

You are my liar
So I will be your thief
Because of you I came
Because of you I leave

Belly,"Sit beside the breakfast table.
Think about your troubles.
Pour yourself a cup of tea,
And think about the bubbles.

You can take your teardrops and drop 'em in a teacup.
Take em down to the riverside,
And throw em over the east side
To be swept up by a current

And taken to the ocean
To be eaten by some fishes,
Who were eaten by some fishes
And swallowed by a whale,

Who grew so old,
He decomposed.
He died and left his body
To the bottom of the ocean.

Now everybody knows that when a body decomposes
The basic elements are given back to the ocean,
Then sea does what it oughta
Consume the salty water (not too good for drinkin'),

'Cause it tastes just like a teardrop (so you run it through a filter),
And it comes out of the faucet (when it pours into the teapot),
Which is just about to bubble.
Now think about your troubles.

Now,are you sleeping?
Can you hear me now?",Think About Your Troubles,1996

We were golden
Then you walked away
In my garden
You were something, there

You walked to me

Buried in my garden
I will catch you there

Broken my shell
That once in my garden
Be there in my garden

I think they feel the pressure {4X}
I know they feel the pressure {4X}
Nowww! 

[Verse 1: Belly]
Swear to gud I?m about to blow
I?m coming in y?all going out the door
You can hate you can doubt the flow
But tell the whole globe it?s about to snow
Broads, cars, record deals and cheddar
I ain?t involved if it ain?t a mil or better
You feel the pressure? I know you do
Roadsters, Rovers, I overdue
I do it how you suppose to do
Get rich before rap no loans recouped,
I?m what a cold a flow little promo do
Stones looking like a million little photo shoots
Maybe that?s why all the models stop
Same time the jaws and the pradas drop, 
They feel the pressure like bottle tops
Right before the bottle pop
Owww!

[Verse 2: Belly]
It?s Belly boy get the name right
I paint life you can ask what my game like
Get introduced in the daylight
Seduce and knock boots in the same night
Girls kill for a him, 
That?s me the new day filmore slim, 
I have you sweating till you feel more slim
You wanna feel less them and feel more him (I knowww)
I have to win that?s right whole life full of acronyms
DD on her chest, CP on my chest
AC on the seats, TV in the deck
SLR couple GTs and a S
DBD(death before dishonor) when I speak, 200 Gs on my neck
It?s be do you feel the pressure yet?
I?m MJ with three seconds left
Yesss!

OMG it's Tunechi Lee, I sip, I drink
Pop two, pop three
And just be free and just be me
They will critique I just keep keep
I'm pouring up and slowing down
We going up, it's going down
We throwing up because you know that more than enough is never enough
We pour a little more in her cup and measure it for what
And these bitches already know we setting them up
Gotta bump it like some motherfuckin' exzema bumps
They naked in pumps

And when it comes to drugs never give up

Staying up nights 'til my day comes
Old memories had me wishin' that we stayed young

I could probably fuck Pocahontas right out her moccassins
Killing everything that I'm authoring like a offering

O que eu nunca vi
E com carinho explicou
O que eu nunca entendi
Que eu tinha tudo
E não tinha nada

Amar é o que eu mais precisava
A tristeza acabou
Agradeço a você
Tudo aquilo que sou

Antes de te encontrar
O mundo não tinha cor
Quero te dizer teu amor mudou a minha vida
Amo você de mais
Te peço por favor
Pra me prometer que nunca vai ter despedida
Vou contar (vou contar)
Tenho medo (tenho medo)
De ficar um segundo sem ti

Tudo mudou
Depois que eu te vi",Tudo Mudou [Todo Cambió],
Belo,"Enxuga meu suor no teu cabelo
Me prende com um jeito tão faceiro
Que eu fico louco ao te ver no espelho
Me beija com sabor gostoso de hortelã
Que assim eu vou à lua

Te peço pra ficar na minha vida
De qualquer jeito amante, amor, amiga
Quem sabe então você não me convida
Pra outra noite cheia de paixão
Te quero toda nua
Adoro o seu jeito de me olhar
Briga, me xinga, depois quer voltar

Que explode o coração
E o desejo inflama
E assim em cada relação
Me prendo em tuas mãos

Só me fez sofrer

Era como um sonho te querer
Pra te ver feliz, desenhei o mundo que você mais quis

Eu sofri demais, mas aprendi que o meu erro foi me dar demais assim

And I'm falling into your arms again
I'm thinking that I should put my trust in him

I could see your breath but your heart was vaguing
Maybe this is what I need, some uncertainty
But if I let it go, I could be risking everything

And it's tearing me..and it's tearing me..

Belton Richard,"Deep within my heart lies a melody
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone
Deep within my heart lies a melody,
A song of old San Antone
Where in dreams I live with a memory
Beneath the stars all alone
It was there I found beside the Alamo
Enchantment strange as the blue up above
A moonlit pass that only she would know
Still hears my broken song of love
Moon in all your splendor know only my heart
Call back my rose, rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
Speak once again of my love, my own.
Broken song, empty words I know
Still live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone",San Antonio Rose,1990
Belton Richard,"Well, you wouldn't read my letters if I wrote you
You asked me not to call you on the phone
There's something I've been waiting for to tell you
So I wrote it in the words of this song

You never knew there were honky tonk angels
Or you might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
So I went back to the wild side of life

Now the glamor of the good life always lead me
To the places where the wild liquor flows
I tried to be your one and only angel
But I'm not that kind of angel, heaven knows

I cried so hard the day you went and left me
'Cause some things you said, they cut me like a knife
What you wanted was another kind of angel
And you should be back to the wild side of life

No, well, I guess I'm just a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
Well, you left the only one who ever loved you
And I'm back here on the wild side of life

I'm only a honky tonk angel
I might have known I'd never make a wife
You walked out on the only one who ever loved you
And you left me here on the wild side of life",Wild Side of Life,2005
Beltones,"Remember when we used to say we ruled
We thought that everybody else were fools
Well I guess it seems that we were too
When I wake up in the morning I don't see you

I think about it like it's yesterday
That girl she left my heart in disarray
Well you came along and kissed the tears away
An empty can by your door and I was on my way

I'm not the type to dwell in the past
And I know I'm the one that threw us in the trash
But sometimes some things are so hard to say
Bye bye baby, baby goodnight

You're never out of my mind just cause you're out of my sight
And I hope a better man is holding you tonight
Goodbye baby, sweet dreams, baby goodnight

Belvedere,"

searched all this time for unparalleled beings
And I'm not believing what I'm seeing
It's imperfection without knowing
The deficiency is showing
Everybody's wondering what I'm looking for I know
What else can you ask for a perfect place
What more can you ask of a perfect face
I know I know there's something wrong
Searched everywhere for unmuddled reasons
But this place relies on a constant season
That's all I thought of while I was leaving
It's deficiency was showing
Everybody's wondering what I'm looking for I know
What else can you ask for a perfect place
Wat more can you ask of a perfect face
I know I know there's something wrong
This feeling inside won't hurt no more
Utopian land won't be beside me
Things that were said won't hurt anymore
It's part of a plan I'm not feeling so bad
While I'm turned the other way
This feeling inside won't hurt no more
Utopian land won't be beside me
Things that were said won't hurt no more
It's part of a plan I'm not feeling so bad
While I'm turned the other way

Belvedere,"What difference does it make, is it so important,
Worth the friendships it will break
All this strife for prevailing moments,
Now it's yours so fucking own it
And wear that crown of pain

For the record (for the record)
No animosity, only rudders (only rudders)
Directions never real
For your records, (for your records)
Never follow the lead, motivations
The path too dark to see

Can't turn it back, can't turn away
Rearrange those words you said
Those days are burned in memories
And I doubt you'll ever come

To satisfy the green, 
To justify your need
Instantaneous retreat, 
Should have been expected
I hope you're choking on those feet, 
Rationale neglected

(This brick wall) a sand castle
(Apologies) not worth the hassle
Of a moment of humility

For the moment (for the moment)
No animosity, only pity (only pity)
Of the life you lead
For a moment (for a moment)
See yourself clearly these motivations
Are never what they seem

Can't turn it back, can't turn away
Rearrange those words you said
Those days are burned in memories
And I doubt you'll ever come

To satisfy your greed
You are you satisfied

Belvederes,"Thanks for the memory
Of sentimental verse,
Nothing in my purse,
And chuckles
When the preacher said
For better or for worse,
How lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of Schubert's Serenade,
Little things of jade
And traffic jams
And anagrams
And bills we never paid,
How lovely it was.

We who could laugh over big things
Were parted by only a slight thing.
I wonder if we did the right thing,
Oh, well, that's life, I guess,
I love your dress.

Thanks for the memory
Of faults that you forgave,
Of rainbows on a wave,
And stockings in the basin
When a fellow needs a shave,
Thank you so much.

Thanks for the memory
Of tinkling temple bells,
Alma mater yells
And Cuban rum
And towels from
The very best hotels,
Oh how lovely it was.

Thanks for the memory
Of cushions on the floor,
Hash with Dinty Moore,
That pair of gay pajamas
That you bought
And never wore.

We said goodbye with a highball,
Then I got as high as a steeple,
But we were intelligent people,
No tears, no fuss,
Hooray for us.

Strictly entire nous,
Darling, how are you?
And how are all
Those little dreams
That never did come true?

Awfully glad I met you,
Cheerio and toodle-oo
Thank you,
Thank you so much.",Thanks for the Memory,1992

Se me ha vuelto a hacer mañana mientras tú dormías

Que quiero todo más si es contigo
No hacer como si nada
Hacerte aquello que no tiene nombre
Y que a partir de ahí le pongan tu apellido
Que si de algo hay que morir sea por fuego amigo
Como se diga
Porque tú eres vida
Eres de todo menos de mentira, que ironía
Qué diga todo lo que siento hasta formar aludes
Y que ni aún así te des por aludida

Y todo se detiene alrededor si tú y yo nos miramos así
Son tus besos encendiéndome a fuego lento
Y cada esquina de mí habitación presta atención para vernos aquí
 
Dando vueltas por el suelo
Burlando al colchón

Que nos sobren los vaqueros
Y nos vista el sudor

Something's coming over me 
Haven't been the same since that evening
That I put eyes on you 
Filled me with life changing feelings 
Now its all a memory 
Where you are is a mystery 
I'll do almost anything
To get back to that night 

I miss you 
I wish that you were here with me 
It felt so true 
But it only happened that night
(It only lasted that night) 
Only that night

Something like a spiritual connection 
You felt it too 
That's why your body came in my direction 
Was it all a dream?

Ben,"Moi je n'aime pas, je concrétise.
A force de parler, on se contredis.
Quand on aide avec maladresse,
on peut faire du mal à ceux qu'on aime.
Remplacer un souci par un problème,
tu voulais bien faire mais ce fût le contraire.
L'art et la manière, trop peu d'artistes,
le manque de tact nous traumatise.
Ceux qui doutent se font du tourment,
On ne croise pas la fortune en la contournant.
Rien ne me surprend,
ni ta mauvaise foi,
ni ta joie ne font mon désespoir.
Les filles sont moins rêveuses,
crient au loup devant des agneaux.
Pensais-tu qu'la vie s'rait joyeuse ?
Sans la creuser jusqu'au noyau...

Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...

Une petite remise en question,
tu l'as pris comme une agression.
Quelle idée ? Envers et contre nous,
notre vie passera malgré tout,
à se rappelle de ce qu'on avait,
insatisfaits de c'qu'on est.
Peu le reconnaissent,
les plaisirs mesquins, les calculs bas,
conduisent à la surprise du résultat.

J'ai tailler mon cOEur de cristal,
car l'amour ne suffit pas.
Des familles éparpillées,
seules mais tristes par milliers.

J'ai surmonter mes erreurs,
me tromper m'a rendu meilleur.
Si on ne veut plus se décevoir,
cessons les sens uniques dés ce soir.

Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...
Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...

La vie n'a pas de sens, j'ai fait le deuil,
l'impression de n'avancer que sur feuille.
Devant cette distance que l'on a creuser,
on essuie les yeux comme si il pleuvait.
Je n'écris pas pour qu'on m'adore,
ni pour que l'on soit tous d'accord.
A courir tous dans le même sens,
il n'y aura qu'une conséquence.
Aussi tragique soit la destinée,
j'veux croire qu'on peut la dessiner.
Certain que les bons chemins se croisent,
les amitiés forment les branches d'une étoile.

Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...
Sens inverse, on s'aime à sens inverse.
La terre tourne trop vite, ralentis pour moi...

How you even thought it could be right
Cause everything we cherished is gone
And in the end can you tell me if
It was worth the try, so I can decide

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Oh you never really love someone until, you learn to forgive

To flee the shadows of the night
It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
But how can I try to hide
When every breath and every hour
I still end up thinking of you
And in the end everything we have makes it worth the fight
So I will hold on for as long

As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Ohh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive

I never thought that I would see the day
That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
But in the end what makes it worth the fight's
That no matter what happens we try to make it right

Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
And all will be alright in time
From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
And all will be alright in time
Wounds of the past will eventually heal
And all will be alright in time
'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real

I said all will be alright in time
I said all will be alright in time
All will be alright in time

I hate everything about me I think I need some air

Qualifies as a cracker

And when you put a cheese on something
It's sorta the finer characteristic
Of what makes a cracker

Why I thought of that, I just

Ya got like a little animal cracker, Discovery channel thing
Watch the gazelle as he grazes through the open plains

Now look, as the cheetah approaches
Watch as he stalks his prey
Now the gazelle is a little spooked
He could head north to the manless peaks above or south

The gazelle now faces mans most parlous question
North or south way down tune in next week

That anyone else in this world
Is doing this very same thing at this very same moment?

Ben Berne,"Once she dressed in silks and lace, Owned a Rolls Royce car
Now she seems quite out of place, like a fallen star
Draped around my kitchen sink , Happy as can be

I'm not much to look at, nothing to see
Just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent
She doesn't holler she'd live in a tent
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day
She'd be so much better off if I went away.

But why should I leave her, why should I go
She'd be unhappy without me I know
I got a woman crazy for me
She's funny that way.

She should have the very best, Anyone can see
Still she's diff'rent from the rest, satisfied with me.
While I worry plan and scheme, Over what to do
Can't help feeling it's a dream, Too good to be true. 

Never had nothin'; no one to care
That's why I seem to have more than my share,
I got a woman, crazy for me,
She's funny that way.

When I hurt her feelings, once in a while,
Her only answer is one little smile,
I got a woman crazy for me.
She's funny that way.

I can see no other way and no better plan,
End it all and let her go to some better man;
But I'm only human, coward at best
I'm more than certain she'd follow me west,
I got a woman crazy for me,
She's funny that way.","(I Got a Woman, Crazy for Me) She's Funny That Way",1996

Gave me Dinah; 
I'm the proudest one 
Beneath the Dixie sun. 

News is spreadin' 
'Bout our weddin'; 
I hear church bells ringin', 
Here's the song my heart keeps singin': 

Dinah, 
Is there anyone finer 
In the state of Carolina? 
If there is and you know her, 
Show her! 

Dinah, 
With her Dixie eyes blazin', 
How I love to sit and gaze in 
To the eyes of Dinah Lee! 

Yet, every night, 
My, how I shake with fright, 
Because my Dinah might, 
Change her mind about me! 

But if Dinah, 
Ever wandered to China, 
I would hop an ocean liner, 
Just to be with Dinah Lee!

Ben Bernie,"There's a boy that's in our band
And how he blows that horn
Finest since you're born
When he starts you're gone
They all call him ""Hot Lips"" for
He blows real red-hot notes
And ev'rybody on the floor just floats
(That's what they say)
 
He's got hot lips when he plays Jazz
He draws out steps like no one has
You're on your toes and shake your shoes
Boy, how he goes when he plays Blues
I watch the crowd until he's through
He can be proud they're ""cuckoo,"" too
His music's rare you must declare

Heard him play the other night
And old man Oscar Clive who is eighty five
Sure as you're alive
Got so frisky when he started out to do his stuff
Was told to sit right down for being rough

But now I hear love call,
I'm getting sentimental over you

Things you say and do,
Just thrill me through and through,
I'm getting sentimental over you.

I thought I was happy,
I could live without love
Now I must admit,
Love is all I'm thinking of

Ben Bernie,"Someone that I belong to
Doesn't belong to me
Someone who can't be faithful
Knows that I have to be
Wonder if I am wrong to give her my loyalty

Why should I be a lone soul
Why can't I be my own soul
Alone from night to night you'll find me
Too weak to break the chains that bind me
I need no shackles to remind me
I'm just a prisner of love
For one comand I stand and wait now

From one who's master of my Fate now
I can't escape for it's too late now
I'm just a prisoner of love
What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing
Those arms with me
Although she has another
I can't have another
For I'm not free
She's in my dreams awake or sleeping
Up on my knees to her I'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping
I'm just a prisoner of love.

Ben Bridwell,"One, two, now
Those 3 plus years, I was so proud of
And I threw ‘'em all away for 2 Styrofoam cups
The irony, everyone will think that he lied to me
Made my sobriety so public, there's no fuckin' privacy
If I don't talk about it then I carry a date
08-10-08, but now it's been changed in every
When they put me in some boxes that say
That I never was, it's the false prophet that never came
And will they think that everything that I written has all been fake
Oh well I'll just take my slip to the grave
Uh, what the fuck are my parents gonna say?
The success story that got his life together and changed
And you know what pain looks like
When you tell your dad you relapsed and look him directly into his face
The seep on your shoulder's the seemingly heavy weight
I haven't seen tears like this on my girl
In a while the trust that I once built's been betrayed
But I'd rather live telling the truth than be judged for my mistakes
Them falsely held up, give em props, loved and praised
I guess I gotta get this on the page

Feeling sick and helpless, lost the compass where self is
I know what I gotta do and I can't help it
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them
God help 'em
One day at a time is what they tell us
Now I gotta find a way to tell them

We fell so hard
Now we gotta get back what we lost, lost
I felt you'd go
But you were with me all along along

And every kid that came up to me
And said I was the music they listened to when they first got clean
Now look at me, a couple days sober
I'm fighting demons
Back of that meeting on the east side
Shaking tweakin', hope that they don't see it
Hope that no one is looking
That no one recognizes that failure under that hoodie
Was posted in the back with my hands crossed shooken
If they call on me I'm passing, if they talk to me I'm booking out that door
But before I can make it somebody stops me and says are you Macklemore?
Maybe this isn't the place or time
I just wanted to say that if it wasn't for other side I wouldn't have made it
I just look down at the ground and say thank you
She tells me she has 9 months and that she's so grateful
Tears in her eyes, looking like she's gonna cry fuck!
I barely got 48 hours, treated like I'm some wise monk
I wanna tell her I relapsed but I can't
I just shake her hand and tell her congrats
Get back to my car and I think I'm tripping yea
'Cause God wrote Otherside, that pen was in my hand
I'm just a flawed man, man I fucked up up
Like so many others I just never thought I would
I never thought I would, didn't pick up the book
Doin' it by myself, didn't turn out that good

If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
If I can be an example of getting sober
Then I can be an example of starting over
